												Finished my first run through the game and I've got to say it's quite unlike everything I've played recently. Took me about 17 hours and it turned out to be one of those games that keep me awake until 10 in the morning.It feels and plays like your own personal interactive Star Trek episode. It is your classic ""Thriller on the Express"" with a strange murder, a killer hiding amongst your crew, an ancient conspiracy, aliens, mercenaries, and a whole load of mystery. In my first playthrough I have failed to reveal a culprit, but thanks to the fact that the game has a lot of replay value, I will delve into it again in the hopes of solving the case and do things differently.It's got tons of character interactions (Which you are free to befriend, antagonize or completely ignore), pages upon pages of lore and exposition in the Zenlil's onboard library (Which you can totally avoid if you don't like reading), choices that actually matter and a few twists and turns that I honestly did not see coming (And a couple that I totally did).The player is encouraged by the game to explore alternative routes as much as possible. One can reload an auto-save made before a conversation (The game saves into a separate slot every few minutes automatically) and choose a different option if you are dissatisfied with a result. You don't have to, but you can if you so desire.Aside from rather long loading times, a couple graphical glitches and small progression issues such as characters sometimes responding as if I walked away from a conversation when I didn't (Both fixed by loading a previous save), it was a pretty smooth ride.This is probably not the game for you if you enjoy fast paced shooters (Although it does have some FPS elements), but if you think you might enjoy an adventure/RPG/quest mix then give it a go.

												This game looks pretty poor and has remarkably long loading times. It's also a pretty short game; I finished it twice in about 11 hours.With that said, this game is worth playing twice if you enjoy this type of game. What type is that? An RPG with lots of decisions and consequences. Note that, the decisions you make are actually quite impactful, and the game entirely allows you to make ""bad"" decisions (the game itself describes this as there being no bad decisions). Beyond that, the game explores some fairly cool science fiction themes and does a fairly good job in making those themes interesting and plausible.Just a small addendum: I said this game is largely based around decisions and consequences. Let me elaborate on this a little. During the game you'll be trying to solve a sort of mystery. You will not be spoon-fed the answers to your questions and your suspicions will not easily be confirmed. Even if you do a pretty thorough job of the 'investigation', there's a good chance you won't figure it out. However: That is okay. If you don't figure it out the game doesn't become less fun after that point.I would absolutely recommend this game, with one sidenote: This is a short game. If you think a game costing 15 euro or dollar or whatever, should net you ~15+ hours of gameplay, then you should buy this game when it's on sale. I myself bought it at 65% off, but feel like I wouldn't have been upset if I'd bought it at full price.			"

												This is a fantastic game. It isn't ruined by poor interaction, bugs or bad gameplay and the likes. It's ruined by the fact that this whole thing is gaming blue balls; a shareware demo; a teaser. There is a plethora of fantastic game content that you ultimately don't get to play with. The combat/inventory system is barely utilized outwith the VR trainer sim. The story is a gigantic cliff-hanger. You're encouraged to use quicksaves to explore alternate dialogue options, but they will only leave you with more questions. Very few will provide the answers you crave more and more as you explore further. The game literally ends when you jump out the back of the futuristic jumbo-jet you start the game in - imagine if the whole of Mass Effect was set on the Normandy and that's about what this title is. If you explore the dialogue and lore (of which there is a near-overwhelming amount of), you'll get some good hours from this game. However, this release is basically a glorified ""Murder on the Orient Express"" game - or the first half of one anyway. You're going to have to wait a whole lot longer for any closure, and, of course, put down some more cash. A wholly unfulfilling and, in the end, frustrating experience.			"

												Seeker...High quality job. The interaction between player and A.I. seems so natural and realistic, and the voice acting is seriously one of the best I've seen, better than most big budget games. There's a lot of variety in dialogue choices, which actually make a big difference in the outcome(s). I encourage all to play multiple times, you will discover a lot of different things. You will encounter events and situations if you're at the right spot at the right time (some quite humorous), making it seem like a real living world. The story is definitely its other strong point, with plenty of background lore to discover if that is your thing - or otherwise you can be just as engrossed without the deeper knowledge. Graphics are unique, good textures, nicely detailed areas, minor graphical glitches, nothing game breaking. I haven't done much combat, as I prefer the diplomatic options, but from what I have experienced there's nothing wrong with it.All in all, it's fantastic on so many levels, and I wait in anticipation for the next installment.IT'S A ROLEPLAYERS DREAM COME TRUE!

												So here I am... Trying to get KOTOR to work on my computer and failing miserably. I go to the store with $20 in my Steam wallet. Fed up and tired to pick an indie game that looked interesting.I run into CONSORTIUM.I decide ah, what the hell and buy it. To my surprise, it actually turned out to be a great game.The story goes as follows: You are you. The game itself is actually a portal to an alternate reality's future where you inhabit the body of a man codenamed ""Bishop - 6"" a high ranking officer in the CONSORTIUM. That's all the game tells you about the character (at least in the time I played it) The game physically cannot let you know about Bishop's past, as it glitches out when people talk about it. The characters and the writing are better than a lot of triple-a titles out there and can be very humorous at times.The music is beautiful, it sounds like it could go in KOTOR itself, and there is a reason for that: Jeremy Soule composed this game's soundtrack. As an admirer of his work I was pleasantly surprised.Other than a few minor bugs, the CONSORTIUM is a fantastic experience in my honest opinion.Check this game out! You'll be glad you did!			"

												 It's been a long time since I felt fully trolled by a game. Lets ignore the game breaking bugs and the fact that most people seem incapable of finishing the game. Lets ignore the peculiar graphics choices since they're functional and graphics arent important as long as they perform all the tasks you need them to in the game.Here be spoilers.This entire 'game' is the intro sequence to a game they havent made yet! You're told bishops are essentially a warrior class, you're given a powerful suit of armour, several weapons and several pieces of equipment that you plug into your armour for various effects...and there is no combat in the game. The combat takes place in a virtual reality suite, there is one opportunity for actual physical combat in the game and it only happens if you screw everything up. Also, the special equipment you get for plugging into your suit that gives you different abilities? that is only given to you AS THE GAME ENDS! Meaning they put work into coding items you are physically incapable of using in the game at any point. They constantly talk about the combat system, the equipment system, your role as a warrior in this alternate society...and before you actually engage in any combat the game ends. This game would have been perfectly fine as an interactive story game. If they had included none of the taunting allusions to combat, none of the equipment and several guns you will never use in any situation (they're even locked down during the game with the safety on, I never even fired them) and focused on the one thing the game delivers, a good narrative and great voice acting, it would have been a good game. But constantly promising that this is a first person shooter with role playing aspects when it is in fact a socialization simulator is misleading and a direct attempt to lull in a different audience.In short it's 2014 and having a dialogue tree in a game is not a selling point, we've had those functioning at this level since the 90s. You cant sell a game entirely on the point it has a dialogue tree in it, so they clumsily tacked on some pretend first person shooter aspects to use guns to sell it. The entire 'game' is a sham. It's an interactive movie, which would be fine if they marketed it that way. Including features it isnt possible to use anywhere in the 'game' whilst constantly leading you to believe the game is a first person shooter in the advertising and in the game itself is dishonest and frankly insulting.

												Space RPG game with FPS elements. No its not like Mass Effect.I bought this the minute I saw it on Steam. Why? It looked cool and the story/setting got me intrigued.  The first hour was a bumpy ride because of a wide variety of bugs. The devs were very honest about it, admitted they should have released it as an early access game. I waited, patiently, a few weeks for the devs to fix their game. I started over because the patch also deleted the savegames (which was announced by the devs as well).This whole game takes place on a rather small spaceship and you're a Bishop, lead operations if I'm correct. The ships hierarchy is based on chess. You have your pawns, rook, queen, king, etc.  So you always know the status of a crewmember. You're transfered from 2014 into this bishop person. At the start you have no idea who you are and what you're supposed to do. You'll learn by interacting with the people on board, who do not know you're from 2014 (and you might want to keep it that way). The way you respond to these people and actions you take playing this game will get different outcomes. In my 5 hours playthrough I somehow managed to♥♥♥♥♥♥of most of my crewmembers ;) I checked the achievements and there are a lot of ways to finish this game. I'm thinking about playing it again, with some different approaches to some situations.  The story begins with a hostile attack and a murder and unfolds after that. I liked the story, a lot! More games/episodes are coming as this story ends with a cliffhanger. I'm looking forward to it!(I cant tell more about the story without giving away too much.)Some points you might find interesting:* FPSJust a small part though this might be more important in the coming games. You have a wide arsenal of weapons, all with different specs. You have guns to kill and guns to capture. Whatever you choose will ofcourse change the outcome.I had 2 battles in this game and 1 tutorial. It aint CSGO or COD but its ok.* Graphicslooking good but nothing fancy, kinda like an interactive comic. Not childish in any way though.* SoundVoiceacting is great. Lot of different accents, all very convincing.Soundtrack and effects are ok. * Replayability Definately! I checked the achievements after completing this and I saw their are many different outcomes to specific situations.OverallExcellent game and I have no regrets buying this. The 6-man dev team did a great job and reacted honest and adequate when they found out people were experiencing bugs.  The story, for me the most important part, is great and well told. More of this please!			"

												An awsome game that reminds me of a good Star trek episode, and like star trek, this game's story feels like a first episode in a series with it's to be continued ending four hours in.  In truth, this game alone is not worth the $20 asking price and should be bought on sale for around the basic price tag for a dlc. Around $10. Gameplay wise, with everything patched all I had to complain about is some subpar graphics, but this can be forgiven from a indie developer when everything else is this well done. In short Good Story though short, Poor graphics, great soundtrack, great controls, but over priced.7.5/10			"

Click here for my full video reviewConsortium is a science fiction RPG where the player takes control of an Avatar aboard the Consortium ship through a video game.  This isn’t a typical RPG though.  There are no levels or experience points.  The game isn’t designed around the combat, skills, or even the relationships.  It’s designed around the personalities of the characters.  The joy of this game comes from the fun visuals and most importantly the diverse and talented voice actors.  The dialog is something to be savored rather than skipped though.  The voice talent and fun visuals made me really fall for this game but I can’t fully recommend it yet.  If you buy Consortium you will love it eventually but the game had several very frustrating bugs and I spent more than 2 hours finding a work around for one.  Once the developers work this out the game will be great.  Buy this game now if you love deep backstory, plot, and character development.  Buy this game next month if you just like RPGs. "

												I originally had massive problems with running this game, and plenty of others did as well. In my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable state.Interdimensional Studios themselves admited ( and apologized ) that ""Consortium's"" launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case. With all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs (game-breaking or just weird) are now gone. I intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they have.I can best describe 'Consortium' as a mix of the original Star Trek and Mass Effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half Life 2 and if that mix doesn't sound good to you ( or you didn't like any of these examples ) then it's hard to recommend. However if you're looking for epic 1st person sci-fi romp with an emphasis on story, dialogue, player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no further.'Consortium' is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most, however it never feels ""too short"" and i'm very excited for what's to come. The story is brilliantly written, the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done. Combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with Half-Life 2 (which i find works well enough) but it's hardly the focus of the game.No, the focus of 'Consortium' is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them, and Interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly. Even with my previous frustration at launch it's obvious how far 'Consortium' has come and the Master Edition truly is worth anyone's time especially for only $20. This is the type of game i've been wanting ever since Mass Effect came out, and it certainly doesn't disappoint.			"

												This game is a truly unique experience. It seems like an RPG and an FPS but in reality its neither and both at the same time! Its atmospheric, well conceived, extremely charismatic and has an immense replay value. Also you get to witness the consequences for your branching actions fairly soon. Now the game is not perfect, particularly its extremely short that would be my biggest complain, its just criminal to show me this amazing product and not be able to enjoy more of it! Inventory system seems vastly redundant, same goes for some other things, like energy conversion. The NPCs in this game are extremely believable and charismatic. Each with their own 'thing' going for them. Particularly the slavic hobo! The man is oozing confident demeanour while being interesting all around. The action elements in the game are interestingly done, - the plane shootout was incredible fun, but was cut short quick, while ground combat seemed to need more polish.Overall its an incredibly solid 8.5 it would easily be 10 had it a bit more content to explore and if the ground combat was ...better. VERY RECOMMENDED. Eagerly awaiting part 2 of this masterpiece.			"

												A short, but great adventure game. A game that explores some quite complex and intelligent science fiction themes, while simultaneously baffling you with a mystery that you probably won't solve after a single playthrough.A brilliant concept. Overwhelming amounts of ""game lore"" (which you can safely ignore if you dislike reading). Characters with diverse and well-developed personalities. An intriguing sci-fi setting. Fun and creative. Being the first part a trilogy, it is nevertheless self-contained and worth playing right now.If you get it on sale, your satisfaction is even more guaranteed, because most of the negative reviews seem to focus on the game being too short for its price. Do yourself a favor and wait for a sale so that your experience is not tainted by mundane financial concerns.			"

												You could be interested in this game if you like short, dense, dialogue driven games in a near future setting - with a focus on replaying different permutations of choices.You are dumped on a high tech airplane that functions as mobile base as the enforcer of a multinational all-powerful corporation. You are the ""new guy that everyone is a bit frightened of"" since you  are the guy with the Robocop-armor and guns.  You get know your 16 fellow corpers then someone dies and suddenly there are fighter airplanes on the horizon and someone in the plane seems to feed them information and sabotage as much as possible. The meat of the game is to talk to your fellow specialists, watch their actions, threaten them (or not), deduct information, cross reference alibis, and find the traitor (if there is one). Dialogue (and background dossiers on the info-terminals) are extensive, well written and well performed.Solving the mystery around the traitor(?) is the big draw of the game but since it is quite short (about 5-6 hours) and events are dense and develop quite differently depending on how you talk to people replaying the game just for kicks can be very motivating if you are the kind of player this appeals to.There are first person shooter elements in this game but they are mostly optional. The gameplay in these is competent but nothing special.			"

												The first time I played through the game I found a fun, interesting, tightly woven adventure story with humor, action, drama and rising stakes... very enjoyable.But interestingly, I didn't have to resolve every single thing to get through the game's narrative. Still, I felt a stong desire to resolve a particular situation and uncover this part of the story. So I played through again. And then a third time.On the third playthrough I resolved the situation and uncovered something that not only fit with things that the game had been hinting at, but also blew my mind because the ""narrative device"" of exploring this complex alternate universe turned out to be more complex than it appeared on the surface. I finally got a small part of what the game had been trying to tell me all along.Once you realize what might really be going on -- it is HUGE.Not not only did I WANT to play the game again and learn as much as I could for my own enjoyment -- and I'll mention here that I've played the game all the way through about a dozen times, finding new and interesting things each time -- but I also felt that from a narrative perspective that I NEEDED to play through and learn as much as I could because of what I realized was going on.

												A fun, sci-fi rabbit hole, which I recommend jumping into, headfirst. If you like murder mysteries, time travel, parallel worlds...if you like Star Trek, there is a high probability that you will love Consortium. Jeremy Soule composed the score, so you know you'll want to get the DLC, too, which includes the soundtrack, as well as collected information from the developers A.R.G. from 2010. The A.R.G. website is still active (http://interdimensionalgames.com/), so you could take the time to spelunk that cave of wonders if you like, or save time and just absorb all that you can from what's included in the DLC.You'll encounter a few bugs here and there. The ones that bothered me the most were when characters would talk over each other, making it hard to follow what either one is saying. Thankfully, this only happened a couple of times, and the game encourages (almost requres?) you to play through multiple times to experience the whole story. My first play was about 5 hours, at a comfortable pace. Very good storytelling here, and the second game (of a planned trilogy) is on the way. A good world to sink your mind into!			"

												I haven't gotten too far into the game yet, so these are just first impressions...   A very promising game, but there are issues.  The game runs terribly, I've got every setting turned down to ""low"" or ""off"" and I've still got framerate issues.  I'm no graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but it would be nice if the game at least ran smoothly.  It's keeping me from getting immersed into the story.  However the devs claim to be working on a patch, and I'll take their word on that for the time beingThe combat seems lacking, but I didn't buy this game for combat and I'm more interested in taking the non-lethal route anyway.  Dialogue/writing.  I'm VERY early in the game yet, but this ain't no Mass Effect 1 & 2 (we shall never speak of 3) but it is passable, and the characters seem likable enough so far (though the doc is either poorly acted or intentionally creepy, I won't be shocked if that's a plot point)STILL, this game seems interesting, and I'd rather be playing this than a Call of Duty, or a Bioshock clone, or whatever else is ""new"" that I've already played 4,000 times before, so I'm going to give it a tenative recommend.

												6.5/10Overview: First Person RPG/AdventureThe Good+The main selling point of this game is that the choices you make affect the story in multiple ways. These choices have a significant impact in how things play out and what scenarios you are put in. Something that is very lacking in today's modern games. Too many games claim to give you freedom of choice however many of these games lead you to the exact same place/story segment and it feels cheap. Consortium however is different, decisions you make in the beginning of the game can adversely affect you later on without you knowing it. I have played through this game a few times now and I am very impressed with the degree of how the decisions you make have a major impact on what goes on.     + Its one thing to have choices, but if the scenarios are boring the game wouldn't be interesting. Consortium does a great job of putting you in some really great situations. These situations will really make you think and the outcomes are not always so obvious. + The developers really wanted to explain everything in the game. The game features an in-game console that explains a lot of the history /characters/story to really immerse you in the game. In addition all the characters seem to act realistically given their surroundings. It wasn't until I went online and read what other people were seeing that it made me go back into the game to see how much attention to detail the developers put into such a small game. +Good replay value, play the game again and choose different options, speak to people differently and see what happens!+ Good voice acting+ I was very surprised by how good the music is. + Included is a virtual reality mini game, it is completely optional and provides a nice change of pace to a game that is mostly about talking to people. The Average:The developers included partial controller support, sadly the controller doesn't seem to work in menus/inventory making controller support rather useless. You are given two choices of button layouts, you cannot remap any buttons for the controller. Just stick with keyboard/mouse. The art style is rather ugly. It just doesn't look right, the game isn't very impressive technically either. I understand this is an independent developer and they don't have a big budget but that doesn't really excuse them for choosing such a poor art style. User interface looks cheap.  Most of the back story is hidden behind information console. Somewhat short if you don't bother to read anything in the information console. The BadIn a game that is all about making choices and replaying the game to see how things play out differently, it would be nice to skip dialogue. Having to listen to the same things over and over again is awful.ConclusionI really want the is game to do well because the game has some really good design decision wrapped up in a poor looking presentation.

												This game was just...wow.I put about 16 hours into my first playthrough of this game, but you could get through the campaign in probably just one or two. An hour or two of my playtime I was AFK, but the rest of it? How did I get so much more time out of it?Reading.Yup, you read that right. I spent a dozen hours just reading in this game, and I don't think I even found everything there was to read. You see, this entire game takes place on a single ship, asking questions about a single murder, and yet, somehow, this team has put together the foundation for an entire universe inside of this tiny little game. Instead of exploring a massive world, doing quests and collecting bits and pieces of lore along the way, it's all laid out for you in a computer database filled with journals, clips from newspapers, transcripts of audio files, blogs, and pretty much any form of medium you can think of. Each story is broken up into pieces, some having all of the pieces lined up nicely for you, others you have to go digging for. When I first got into the database, the sheer amount of information seemed daunting, but the more I read, the more I got sucked into this world. It shows you how this universe came to be the way it did, noting several historical events that changed the course of their history from ours (such as Italy siding with the Central Powers during WWI and Hitler's assassination in the beginning of WWII).Without getting into spoilers, it also hints at some potentially darker aspects of everything that's going on. There seem to be mysteries within mysteries, and every answer you find just gives you more questions to wonder about.Before I end this, just a couple of things I noticed that could be improved upon:1) There were a number of spelling mistakes within the database as well as some of the subtitles not quite matching with the dialogue. Some of the spelling mistakes seem to be intentional (like putting those mysterious ""21""s around everywhere) while others seem to be actual mistakes (using bear instead of bare, simple misspellings, etc). While they *do* slightly take away from the immersion of the game, they definitely don't break it. And the misprints with the dialogue still tell the same idea, it just isn't always the exact same phrasing.2) This is really just a minor annoyance, but it's kind of annoying that you can see the ""+/-"" symbol for the dropdown menu of crew relations on your main HUD but you can only access it when you're on the inventory or main menu screen. Either don't make it visible on the HUD or let us access it directly through a shortkut key (like, say, the ""+"" or ""-"" key).3) Speaking of crew relations, I would absolutely love more opportunities to interact with the crew. The depth they've created for their world is amazing, but apart from a couple of main characters, the rest of the crew seems kind of bland, just given a quirk to run with. The Induction Summary Interviews are nice, but it'd be nice to actually see their backgrounds play out through our interaction with them. Looking at the sequel, it seems like there won't be much interaction with the crew apart from over the CMC, so I guess they were more concerned with world-building than relationships, which I get. Although if I'm being really honest with myself, I just wanted more of a chance to flirt with Carla. She was the first person I met outside of my cabin and I guess I couldn't help but want to get to know more about her.4) Last (and definitely the least) of my issues with this game is the graphics. You can tell they're a bit dates. But you know what? It doesn't take away from the story, it doesn't make combat any more difficult, and so ultimately, it doesn't take away from the game. I'm really just putting this hear to let you know that it's there. This isn't the prettiest game out there, but it's what's on the inside that counts, right?Now if you'll excuse me, I'm ready to jump back into this thing so that I can try to figure out...well, everything.

												At it's core, Consortium is a playable movie. But your decisions drastically change the course of it. So, really, it's YOUR movie. I'm not usually one for story-heavy games, but it's been a long time since I was so captivated by a first person story. I've seldom played a game that made me care so much. A lot of love went into this project, and I can't wait to see where it's going.			"

												Consortium isn't a terrible game anymore, but it's still a terrible rip-off. When originally released, it was filled with game-breaking bugs. Now, after many patches, it has some minor bugs, occasional graphical glitches, and rare crashes remaining, but for the most part it works. However the game is only 3 hours long and the replayability isn't all that great. You may profitably replay it once, or maybe twice. And it isn't a complete game; very few of the story elements are really resolved by the time you get to the end. It just tells you to buy the next game. The game is so short in fact that you get to the mission briefing for your first mission about 15 minutes before the end of the game, and you never get to play that mission. Apparently your first mission as a Bishop is in a sequel that may or may not ever be released.Some people say the game is ugly, but I find the graphics to be stylish. The voice acting is mostly good.In short, it's kind of fun to talk to people, but it's a complete rip-off at $20 for 3 hours of gameplay that result in nothing really being resolved. If you can get it for $5 or less, go for it. Otherwise, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Consortium is a very story and dialog driven game.  To sum up briefly...Dialogs: lots and branchingDuration: relatively short (a few hours depending on what you do) but replaying highly recommendedStory: excellentCombat: completely avoidable but if you do it is passable (great if coupled with an AutoHotKey script to overcome some binding quirks)Characters: lots of variety and about 20 of them.  They're memorable enough you'll remember most of their names.Environment: small (stuck on a large aircraft) but detailed.Graphics: the style is minimalist.  Judge for yourself from the screenshots.I love this game so much, I invested big bucks into the Fig campaign for the sequel.  It's not for everyone but it is at least worth playing once to decide if it is for you.Saves will carry over to The Tower!			"

												What impressed me most about this game is that you are able to talk your way through almost every conflict. I have to admire the devs for letting you all but completely ignore the shooting element of their FPS in favor of being a silver tongued devil. You are perfectly capable of shooting your way through the game as well, and both are viable ways to solve problems. To complement all of this is a large cast of complex characters. I found myself reloading saves just because I was interested in exploring more dialogue options. The world of Consortium feels very alive and complex, hell, there's an in-game database that has an absolutely vast amount of backstory and supplementary material that you could spend a day reading.If you've played the Mass Effect games, there's a strong chance you'll enjoy this game. Buy Consortium not because you want another FPS, but because you want to explore a story and the whole universe it takes place in.			"

												1. It's about 1/3 of the story, ending with a cliffhanger. 2. It's _extremely_ short.3. You make a lot of choices, but suffer almost no consequences. Carefully built reputation do not affect anything. 4. Your game world is an airliner, something the size of A380. 5. Equipment, combat modes, combat mechanics are used only twice, of which only once in real combat. Also, it's quite poor. All in all, you could be playing any text-based RPG instead of this, getting the same or more of NPC dialogues and probably a lot more of combat and other action in the process, having full story, etc. Dialogues here are voiced and everything is in 3D, but with current level of detail it is irrelevant.

												What an awesome game!I read about this game before it launched and the idea was intriguing so I added it to my wishlist. A few months later I noticed it was part of Groupies Be Mine 14 Bundle so I paid $5 and picked it up.For the next few months CONSORTIUM languished in my game queue until last week when I finally decided to dive in--and dive into another reality I did!CONSORTIUM's story kept me guessing until the end. In fact, I need to replay the game or parts of it to unlock sections of the story I didn't find during my first play-through.And the ending... Holy crap! When is CONSORTIUM 2 coming out? I want to play it right now!Before I started my play-through I read about CONSORTIUM's rough launch and all the bugs people encountered but, after 12+ hours of playtime I have yet to encounter a single problem; it looks like just about everything was fixed.Even though CONSORTIUM doesn't have state-of-the-art graphics I can't help but think the game is beautiful. The character models' cartoony style is perfect and they don't detract from the story, voice acting or gameplay.I appreciate that Interdimensional Games Inc. focused on the more meaningful parts of the game, e.g: story, mechanics, and UI, rather than trying to (as an indie studio with a small budget) create a game with out-of-this-world graphics.CONSORTIUM is one of the best games I've played in the last year.Thank you Interdimensional Games Inc. for providing the experience. I'm looking forward to CONSORTIUM 2--don't disappoint me!			"

												I'll assume you read the description blurb for the game.  And now onto the review.Was it worth it?  Yes.When you think about a game occasionally over the course of *years*, you know they did something right.  (Forgetting about the fact I've been waiting for a sequel for AGES)  Too many games are forgettable in my opinion.  Especially when Steam has SO MANY.  This one however, was totally worth it ;)Let's skip to the breakdown:+ Great background music by Jeremy Soule and free soundtrack download+ Stanley's Parable level of unique choices with different outcomes+ Unique setting (it's on a plane?)+ Great voiced characters+ Detailed story with lively characters+ Did I mention the story?- The graphical style is unusual.  It's not BAD, it just doesn't look real- Fights while few, are fast, frantic and unwieldy- I ran into some weird graphical issues when I first played, restarting worked for me- A single playthrough is SHORT!  And the sequel, well I've been waiting forever!!+ The sequel is about to make its kickstart debut... FINALLY!The real fun of this game is in blindly throwing yourself into a detailed new universe, the game admitting that, and enjoying how the world reacts to your choices.  Spoiler example: What would happen if you started a new game, and didn't know much about your environment, who the NPCs were, ... even what your name was?  lol Actually that's typical, but expect this game to call you out on it if you're obvious.I recently played Undertale and it reminded of this game, choice-wise.  That's praise.Anyway, I say it's definitely worth a shot if it sounds at all interesting to you.  With TallTale taking the lead on games like this, it's nice to have new blood.  Especially since you have SO much more control over your choices compared to traditional adventure games.			"

												I'm about an hour into my first playthrough of the game - I hear a single playthrough is about two hours long. As soon as I'm done, I want to start the game again and try different things. This game is incredibly successful at engaging a lot more of my brain and 'gut feelings' than most. I'm not sure that I've ever played a game that gave the player such respect while also commanding so much responsibility.Without revealing too much; you're thrown (somewhat 'naked') into a key role during a specific series of events. Your decisions and actions can sway how events unfold and also how the game is to be played. In most games, if you stray too far from what they want to show you, the game tugs harshly at your leash or essentially shuts down and waits for you to come back. Not so, here! As far as I can tell, the only time you're really yanked out of the proceedings is if your character dies. Then, you can load up an auto-save from earlier and try something else. That's only happened to me once so far. Basically, if you bumble, the game unfolds in a logical way as it would if someone in your position bumbled in an actual situation like this, if that makes sense.What kind of a game is it? Well, it's a shooter if you want it to be...I guess. It's a missile defense game sometimes. It's a 'cool special agent on a plane' social simulator. It's an alternate future reality quantum leap homage thingiemadoop.			"

												I normally don't write reviews for games for one reason or another, but I liked this game enough and commend the devs for the work they have done on it. The game is somewhat unique in the fact that the world itself from what I've played continues through time like it's an actual world, now I have only played through it once so I don't know if it actually does that but it does it enough to feel alive. It's inspired by various sources but I'd say what has it inspired the most is probably choose your own adventure books, moreso then a particular game. Yes you can say Mass Effect, Yes you can say Deus Ex but a lot of these games while much longer don't quite encapture the amount of stuff you can actually do to affect the game's world the way Consortium does.  As much as I personally love this game, if you're looking for your typical action RPG this, unfortunately for you is not it, and by the end you may end up feeling like you bought a preview for what's to come as it's a trilogy that will yes, have a continual storyline. So for folks that are looking for a bit more meat I'd pass for now, check on the sequel when it comes out and buy both. Personally even without it, It's worth the price of admission just for the taste of what the developers hold in store.Pros: great story interraction and loregood mechanicscons (only if you consider it)not typical action RPG/potential content			"

												For being Chapter 1 in an incomplete series this piece of software shocked me. I've played through the entire game more than twice now. Each time I'm compelled to try things different or to just explore the ship or ""world"" that you're presented with. The whole idea of this game is refreshing and I really can't place why it makes me want to explore and read everything.  What hooked me is the idea that you're stationed on this giant plane that is your flying home base. That you're given the sense you'll be deployed onto missions and then report back to the plane for debrief. That sense of procedure is amazing. You actually take part in the conversations and influence everything. A+ from meEDIT: Updated because I wrote this while tired. Thanks for the heads up IDG.			"

												The story is interesting, the writing is good. The gameplay is disappointing, and just plainly bad. I spent quite a while fighting an incredibly boring bullet sponge of an enemy, more or less playing a game of tag, running between recharge stations. It was very very tedious and just frustrating. After many slow reloads after many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deaths, I eventually defeated the aggressor. I recovered a chip that i had to put into a wall panel. I attempted to put the chip in, but it wouldn't work. I tried a few things before the chip completely disappeared. Poof. Gone. I had to reload back into the excrutiating fight. There's no way I'm going to play through that again. I have better things to do, such as write long-winded steam reviews. I want to mention that before this I was having a good time, the gameplay was still not very good but it was interesting enough with the story and dialogue. If the combat and actual gameplay was better I would change my recommendation.			"

												i was unsure whether to click the thumbs up or down button. in the end i don't think it's worth paying money. tl;dr version:great game mechanics, setting and the story don't make up for the 15 minutes gamelay. it was a big disappointement for methe actual review:don't get me wrong, it's not all that terrible. it's kind of a fun game with interesting dialogues and some minor combat but after finishing the game it feels like i've been playing tutorial all along and the game should come now. instead, the ending creding credits roll in.there has been so much effort put into character development and combat/inventory mechanics that there is actually no game at all. where is the actual level design? there is a small plot twist in this futuristic plane with a great story setting but you end up walking down a few halls a couple of minutes while investigating this twist and that's it. the game ends.it's like watching one of those short 15 minutes hitchcock stories. great indeed but is this really it? so much of effort of hud and game develpment for just this? sure there is some fighting simulation game (to which you don't even necessarily have to get the chance to play by the way) but that doesn't give you any satisafaction of using the action mechanics.all in all, it was a disappointedment for me. with such a great potential i expected more just a big tutorial. and no, encouraging the players to ""TRY TO FINISH GAME IN DIFFERENT WAYS, LIKE TALK TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND SUCH"" is definitely not a satisfying fulfillment of what expectancies have these great mechanics built-in inside us.definitely would not recommend buying. maybe get it for free/humble bundle from somewhere or something			"

												TLDR: Think of this as a single really long level from Deus Ex. There are a bunch of characters, a single unifying mystery, some systems and mini-games, and ties to a (frustratingly obtuse) larger conflict.The setting is jaw-droppingly complex. Sure, you can understand the core mystery (who is the traitor onboard?) without knowing the setting, but if you want to immerse yourself, you need some ritalin and a lot of patience. Be prepared to play an entire ARG, read thousands of words of backstory, and dive deep into the 'discoveries' folder (free DLC.) And even then, nothing is resolved; you've got a Byzantine world of intrigue and near-future politics. The story you play (a murder mystery) is a tiny fraction of a greater conflict that Adam Jensen could never hope to understand. We're talking ancient aliens, future churches, megacorporations, rogue AIs, machine revolutions, and multiverse theory.I'll let you down easy; once you go into the briefing (towards the end of the game) about the next mission, that's it. You've got one more scene and then you're done. This game ends right when you're expecting to continue playing, and in a bad way. It's not just a cliffhanger, it's a frustrating and abrupt ending that leaves all the major questions unresolved.I think there are only two ways to dive into Consortium:1. Play through the game. Interact with the crew. Try to ignore the setting. Enjoy the mystery.2. Dive deep. Read the documents. Play the ARG. Go on the forum. Read every kickstarter update. Spend hours on the in-game infodump terminals. Lose sleep over abstract concepts and the constant repetition of the number 21. Wait for the sequel in 2018. With all that said, I only write the review because I like the game. It's got lots of interesting character moments, some decent voice acting, and a fantastic soundtrack. I think you should pick it up if you like investigation or mystery games, because it's a neat little experiment within the genre.			"

												So the game tutorial starts by snowing you how your special abilities/weapons functions. However, I managed to play through the game and fighting only once.  That is a rare thing, a RPG which actually let you forge a path, so far i beleive there are not that many opportunities to fight (this is episode 1, the others promise more action i think but thats speculation, there's also computer simulations for more action if needed). Although there was not much action, the storytelling was exelent. You actually get invested with the people you meet and the action you take. The characters you interact with also have a 'beyond highschool' mindset, and will speak about various things/subject (aka they do more than flirt with each others and reference the same poppular things). For instance a character is an addict to an online MMO and spen most of her time playing it. If confronted about that, other character may tell their opinion but not get invested too much as they are busy at that time. I had fun and will definitely at least replay once. I would say that the game is possibly closer to a visual novel than a full fledged action game, for part 1 at least. This does not take away from the experience, luckily. If you like this kind of game, it's worth a buy, this is not what i was originally expecting, but i enjoyed it all the way through!have a nice day and game on!-Lost			"

												The current build is a bit on the buggy side, overall this game is quite impressive if you ignore some of the technical difficulties this title is expieriencing at the moment. Consortium breaks the 4th wall for the first time in a refreshing way, that makes you (the player) feel like you are actually integtrated into this universe. The decision making paradigm is similar to Mass Effect, the game play is much more free than that, you can truly make your own decisions, if you want to punch one of your female comrades in the face, go ahead, if you want to talk it out with everyone you encounter, you can. It is because of this simple fact of freedom of choice that I feel like Consortium is a stand out title. I highly recommend Consortium to fans of shows like Firefly or Star Trek to even fans of Adventure games like Monkey Island or Sherlock Holmes.			"

This game is tightly knitted with a story that has the capacity to grow into a very large and perverse world of backstabbery, blaming, love and discord.

												Holy wow, I had only just heard of this game a few weeks before the December 2014 Steam Holiday Sale, so I didn't have a lot of expectations going in. However, even if I'd set my expectations sky high, I don't think this game would have disappointed me.First off, the game is rather pretty; the cel shaded graphics will likely help the game retain playability for a long time, so if you don't have the money to spend now, you can always wait for the next sale. Bonus: The developers have said there will be future episodes of Consortium that build upon the events of this game, so waiting for that may be in your best interest if you're a binge gamer.As for the story, it feels pretty natural. If you're unfamiliar, the game puts you in the body of a person in the future. The game itself pretends that this is actually happening, so when you have to pretend you know what is going on, it feels legitimate. However, that also means that on future playthroughs, you can react to situations differently as you are more familiar with the game's lore. The game is built with this concept in mind, which makes it extremely replayable. On that note, I recommend playing the game through, living with each decision you make, rather than reloading to see how consequences change. In the amount of time I spent watching the loading screen, I probably could have played the game through at least one or possibly two more times.The situtations the game puts you in have the feel of action-packed, suspensful movie scenes, and the game does a darned good job making you feel as if you were really in the thick of things. Also, since you're not the captain, you're not always the center of attention. In my opinion, this feeling adds another layer of deptht to the game as it made me feel more like a part of the crew, as opposed to having me order people around, Kirk-style.I can't speak much for the combat because the game gives you the options to not have to fight, except for one ""air combat"" mission. The controls in general felt solid. There's nothing that felt innovative here, but nothing that felt broken. The only time the game didn't feel smooth were when I accidentally triggered an event that moved the story forward before I meant to. This is a chronic issue I have in games and may speak more about me than it does about the game.Bottom Line/TL;DR: If you want to feel like you're actually in a futuristic crew on a ship flying around on missions, then this game is likely to be right up your alley. The conversation choices and reactions to actions you take feel natural and make you feel like you really are hijacking the body of someone in the future.			"

												When the Mass Effect trilogy controversially ended with a seemingly arbitrary final choice, it also felt like it invalidated all the choices leading up to it. Players were outraged because the game offered them a glimpse of something truly awesome and then snatched it away, right as the game came to an end. To be fair to the trilogy, what players felt they deserved was something most a games don't even try to provide: a true sense of player agency.There's an obvious reason why giving players non-trivial choices is so rare. It's super hard. Every time a player makes a meaningful choice, the developer has to create all of the content for the path they chose and all of the content for the path they might not ever experience. The amount of content that needs to be written is literally exponential to the amount of content that the player experiences.CONSORTIUM ambitiously tries to meet this goal and it actually mostly succeeds. The most common complaint is that it's short. Of course it's short. It has to be. For every chunk of the game that you see, the devs had to make many that you don't. This branched story structure is essential for creating the kind of fun anxiety that comes from making real choices with incomplete information. The tradeoff is that you're paying for a lot of content that you'll never see.The developers have tried to address this issue by making the game highly re-playable. Not only can you return to saved games to check out different paths, some elements of the game are actually different on different playthroughs. This solution sort of works, but the bulk of the dialogue never changes so replays can feel pretty tedious. The repetitiveness feels especially punishing when you have to re-load a game due to finicky dialogue and quest triggers. The game shipped with a ton of bugs, many of which are now fixed, but the triggers still require some babysitting.Overall, it's an ambitious game and a worthwhile experience. I'll definitely check out the sequel.One final thought: CONSORTIUM advertized a large library of in-game text to read. It's theoretically optional, but there is information in there that can affect your game. Another important thing to know about it is that it's extremely boring. As much fun as I had playing the game, the world outside the aircraft is not particularly compelling.			"

												An amazing interactive experience with the most detailed and extensive backstory I have ever encountered. This is going toset the trend for a new genre of game; it's somewhere between a book, social experimentation and a FPS video game. If you've ever played Deus Ex or Mass Effect and loved the dialogue options but been disappointed that it wasn't more in depth, this is the game for you. I have already played this game through three times and I'm still discovering things I missed in previous playthroughs. In summary, a brilliant experience for the kind of person who really likes to delve into the backstory of different universes as well as experiment with dialogue and decision trees.			"

												The execution doesn't live up to the ambition. It has some promising aspects - a distinct world and characters, extensive dialogue, impactful choices and varied gameplay. The writing is generally decent, and at least puts a bit of a twist on the tired old amnesiac protagonist device. Unfortunately, these are let down by technical issues (painfully slow and frequent loading, excessive GPU use and various glitches), voice acting which ranges from passable to cringeworthy, poorly explained concepts and a baffling layout which is desperately crying out for a map and/or objective marker. Hopefully the experience will see the devs come up with a less clunky game which properly showcases their talent.			"

												CONSORTIUM is one of those tricky games that will make you ponder over what could have been possible if the team had an unlimited budget and unlimited time to work. It gives you a taste and leaves you wanting much, much more. In particular the first time through is quite exciting. Although you're on rails, of course, it's not always obvious where the rails are. Replaying the game to find the ways in which scenes can be altered is fun, but also bittersweet because you'll see the limits of what was possible. The voice acting and direction are both excellent, and are critical to the experience (this game would not be nearly as interesting without the voice acting). I feel it deserves a 10 not because it's perfect (it isn't, not even close), but because it really is a ""must-play"" for fans of the genre. Play CONSORTIUM, and wonder about what's possible for this medium.			"

												I am mixed on this game. Other than one or two crashes, I didn't have any issues with stability as many of the early players did. So no real complaints there. What this game does well, it excels at, but there are a number of things this game does not do well. If you like action games, avoid this one. If you like story-based games this is a good start to what could be an excellent story game, but I would not pay more than $5 for this game as it's essentially the first chapter or two of the story and it ends very abruptly with a pitch to fund/support the next installment of the story.Overall I enjoyed playing what amounts to 3-8 hours of content (depending on how much of the side stuff you do and how quickly you play) enough to give it a qualified thumbs up. Your mileage may vary....What to likeExcellent start to a promising story that includes time travel, political intrigue, and murderVoice acting is excellent and it really helps with immersion in the story and personality developmentWhat there was of this game was fun overall, but only if you like story-based games - there's little action in this game and what there is not very compellingWhat not to likeThis is the big one... the story just ends after a few hours and you are pitched to buy/support the next installment. This game feels like a teaser or a ""demo"". Don't pay more than $5.Graphics are passable at best (would have been impressive 15-20 years ago)The inventory system is terrible and needs work, including the whole utility/power systemThe infrequently used combat system is ok for regular guns, but don't buy this game for its combatThe stun/incapacitate mechanic is tedious and needs work - It was not fun			"

												>10 USD now, That's still too much for the length of this game however.  The game is so short it will make you feel like you just played a demo for a real game.  I have 7.4 hours on record which alot of that was me leaving the game running while I was doing other things, yet I still finished the game.  I think the devs wanted to make the game into a series, but I can't really see that happening.  As fun as this game can be at times I can't recommend paying more than $2.00 for it.  Without a doubt it's not worth the $20.00 they are still charging for this game.			"

												Not a bad 'game'. At least until they decided to break it and corrupt save files without making the patch 'opt in' for those users who play more then one thing at once and don't live on forums 24/7. Performance was just fine on systems above min spec, they broke it trying to fix on systems below min spec.Doubt i'll bother restarting or returning but enjoyed what I had played up until that point.Probably look elsewhere if you don't enjoy reading/listening to people as this 'game' would be over in a couple of hrs or less playing as a shooter.B+edit: When I say 'game'. This isn't another ""Dear Esther"" by any means. It's just a different kind of experience. 'Get out of it what you put back in"" to some extent.The quote on the storepage about it being like a good book you want to curl up on the couch with is fairly accurate. Does have branching dialog trees that certainly alter the story, most of which are rather interesting. :)			"

												This game is a lot like Knights of the Old Republic. It has an inovative gameplay, and lots of different stories.Saying that I would like to add that it is really short. You could get through the whole game in about 1-2 hours. However, this game is made to be replayed. I would be very surprised if you told me that you found the traitor on the first try.Overall a great game, although I would suggest buying on sale if you can.			"

												Surprisingly good game with so many plotlines that diverge the whole story like crazy. Some have compared this to a chose your own adventure Star Trek episode and I agree. The game sets you on a super advanced aeroplane in the 2050's, with you taking over the body of a spec ops soldier. You will disrupt or encourage sabotage, fend of enemy craft, talk to or kill the main antagonist, and after all this you can even insult the leader of your entire orginisation. You will reveal your identity, or absorb into someone else's. You can be a sloppy am jam psycho, or a true non lethal spec ops soldier. Your crew reations change depending on how you handle things. It really is a fresh and innovative RPG videogame.Really makes me sad then, that their kickstarter (and now seemingly all alternatives) had failed. I gave 'em £50, that is how much I would've paid for the base game either way. But now I get messages every so often via kickstarter from them practically begging their backers to pay more because they don't have enough. Seeing as I only heard of this because PC gamer said they're giving it away for free, I wouldn't expect it to work. I hope it does though.9/10, pure innovation doesn't make money I guess.			"

												Very interesting game. Not perfect, but impressive, as in it leaves an impression. The concept puts the recently popularized idea of ludonarrative dissonance in a scewed perspective. In this game, you are placed in a world obeying the rules of a game. Is the protagonist always in the right place at the right time? Does he always know what to say? Does he never miss a shot or make a wrong move? He is ""save-scumming"", for lack of a better term. Combing through the countless alternate realities for options that lead to his desired outcome.I would happily recommend this game, were it a complete package. Currently, you only get a third of the complete game. And, as this third is embarrasingly short, I would hope the next two installations are both longer and included in this initial purchase.If not, then I can't make an honest recommendation. It's a good game. It was easily worth the time I put into it. But paying the same price three times for three experiences separated by a significant amount of time is simply not fiscally responsible.			"

												Consortium is the kind of game with huge replay value, and the layers of sub-plots and mystery kept me hooked throughout the playthrough, so much so that as soon as I finished my first time round, I immediately created a new save to uncover everything I missed. There's enough exposition to allow you to understand the ship and the world's current situation, but there remains the uneasy feeling that, being a traveller from another dimension, you really are out of your depth, and learning more is key to getting a grip on what's going on.The voice acting is very good, and the usual tropes are avoided in the cast of well-rounded, interesting characters. A special mention must also be given to the soundtrack, which heightens tension in all the right places. ""Almost as good as Morrowind's OST,"" I mused, before I closed the game and discovered it was Jeremy Soule himself who composed Consortium's score. Excellent selection, developers; I'll be buying the soundtrack shortly!The gunplay, admittedly, feels a little janky, and the inventory menu was confusing in my opinion. This gave me the incentive to avoid fights and settle problems using diplomacy and cunning - I think this ended up being the better choice, but if combat is mandatory in the second game as I reckon it will be, I hope the HUD improves. However, it wasn't a major concern for me.All in all, I'm really looking forward to the next installment of this. The developers of this game have created something brilliant - I hate to make comparisons, but I can't help but draw a parallel between this and the story-driven TellTalle games of recent years. If you like those, you will LOVE Consortium.Now, I have some mysteries to solve...			"

												How to review a game like Consortium that is packd with so many great ideas? Well first off I will say that I really enjoyed the play throughs I have made so far.Consortium puts you - Quantum Leap style - in the body of an operative called Bishop-6 onboard a high tech aircraft flying to Dublin. The entire game takes place during the flight and can play out differently every time depending on your actions. There are no right or wrong actions, just different versions of reality. You are confronted with a number of plots to solve - or ignore - which I won't spoiler. What I will say is that they are excellent, and enjoyable.Consortium is an excellent example of the ""One Block RPG"" where everything takes place in a small area with well developed characters but within that scope the player has great freedom. Consortium benefits from many play throughs as you explore diferent possibilities and in fact the game makes a virtue of this and saves them as detailed versions for you to look back on.Oh did I mention it has a soundtrack by Jeremy Soule?The game had a rough launch - the team who developed it are very small - but they stuck with ut  and turned it into a gem that should not be missed. If you like good, thoughtful RPGs: buy it. If you love interesting sci-fi setups: buy it. If you like good writing: buy it, If you like soundtracks by Jeremy Soule: buy it.I'm going to go and have another playthrough now.			"

												Tad bit of a ramble here. So first things first. The Pros and the Cons, followed by my own interpretation of this game and how the Devs did.ProsBranching Story Archs.Character Interaction.Mutiple ways to deal with major issues.Your choices actually matter.Non-Playable Characters have individual personality.Some epic puns and hints (Especially the Riker, and Picard ones.).Runs smoothly.Combat can be very interesting in the VT/Boarding Mission.Cons Crashes at least once per playthrough, but nore more than two crashes recorded.Looooong load times for me.----------------------------------------------------Now then I've had this game since it first came out for Early Access. And have seen it grow from ""Okay"" to ""Brilliant"". The developers have done an amazing job with this game, and I regret I never got to back The Tower while I was away on business. This game fills a very small but important need in video game storytelling/art that I can't seem to find anyplace else.If you require NPCs to interact with, a story that pushes you, a set of missions that will make you think, like for your choices to matter, like for your actions to matter, and want a Star Trek Bridge style feel of how interactions take place then I highly recommend this game. You will need patience, timley interaction, tact, wits, and multiple playthroughs to fully appreciate this game. This is NOT a heavily combat oriented game where you're a Pew-Pew super soldier. Instead this is more about negotiation, diplomacy, wits, and thinking. Sure you can be combative (Both lethal, or non-lethal.), but that is only a very small part of the game. This is an interactive story. A Novel that can be inerpreted differently with each playthrough.I look forward to The Tower and seeing how the devs continue on the story of Bishop Six.			"

A text review is provided below-Consortium is a first person RPG. It’s a very unique game that’s for sure. It has RPG elements, shooting mechanics, and quite easily the most impressive conversation simulations I have seen in my entire life. The buttons for conversations however are in the F keys like F1 and F2, so that’s a little odd and has led to the occasional mis-click on my part that had...undesirable results. But honestly, I have never seen a game more capable of having the most realistic and intelligent conversations as Consortium. The shooting mechanics are solid, AND entirely optional. You never once have to shoot a gun in this game if you don’t want to.Consortium is a very choice-driven game. Every action you make, everything you say and do has a reaction. You can play this game as a pacifist, as a rambo, or as someone just trying to survive or what have you if you wish. The gameplay is very solid and a definite pro in my book. You can even explore the plane through all the maintenance corridors above and below where you’re supposed to be just like in Star Trek or that one scene in Mass Effect 2, it’s really cool the first time you discover it.The story of Consortium is an interesting one. It’s essentially one big murder mystery with some extra things happening. You have to use the in-depth conversation mechanics and your own ingenuity to discover why the casualty was murdered and who was behind it. It’s actually pretty awesome, and I HATE murder mysteries. The reason I think it is so awesome is probably because I’m a huge fan of Star Trek and seeing as all of this takes place on a futuristic plane that is essentially a flying fortress that can laser zap missiles and planes out of the air by the hundreds... It’s sort of like you’re playing through your own episode (Which is a very good point I saw another review make)...except you’re not in command. But that’s good, I mean, I wouldn’t be able to have half of the humorous reactions I had in this game if I were supposed to be the always-busy all-feared “captain” of the plane.The graphics are decent. The voice acting is actually pretty great. There’s some voice acting that might be considered mediocre but I loved it either way. The sounds themselves were alright I suppose. Nothing memorable there but nothing particularly bad either.But this game must have a con right? As all games do. Yes. This game has one gigantic glaring con that is so bad that it actually caused me to walk away from my computer mid-playthrough. This game has the big glaring RPG-cancer of an issue where continuing the primary questline makes you fail all of the side quests. But that on its own isn’t bad. The fact that they don’t TELL you about this game-ruining feature if you don’t save enough that most RPGs were done with ten years ago is bad. ANd unless you intentionally stop playing for a minute to look for what’s what you have NO idea what’s a primary objective and what isn’t unless you paid attention to the two second pop up when you receive an objective (which usually comes mid-dialogue). There is no quest tracking of any kind so if you’re just playing to play immersively as the game so encourages, you might accidentally trigger THAT phase in the main quest where all of your side quests are canceled. This usually happens after 10 minutes of dialogue meaning that if you reload a save to make sure you don’t ♥♥♥♥ that up, you have to sit through 10 minutes of the same dialogue AGAIN. Looks like realistic conversations has a con. Maybe if paired with realistic time progression though, it wouldn’t be as bad. This is all very critical in my opinion though because these side quests are, with the exception of one, all VERY closely linked to the main story which is essentially the investigation on the murder. Then there’s some minor issues as well like strange delays in loading screens and the issue of being a floating head with no body that so many first person games mess up, but nothing quite as glaring as the ability to ♥♥♥♥ up your progression without so much as a notice that THAT is what doing THAT particular quest will do.So my final rating for Consortium is a 6/10. I think in itself it is definitely a good game, but this design choice alone ruins my entire view on the game. If you know about it in advance, it’s not that bad. But if you’re unfortunate enough to start this game without knowing that this is a FEATURE? Then it could be enough to convince you to put the game down. It’s a short game. You already experienced half of it by the first point you can get ♥♥♥♥ed over. What’s the point in continuing? It’ll just be more of the same.So do i recommend Consortium? Well, yes and no. I’m going to state officially no because I don’t believe in supporting a game that makes design choices that were bad enough when they were invented but then makes them years after seemingly every other RPG developer caught on and stopped making that flaw of a design choice. BUT, the thing is so long as you are willing to break the immersion to look up every story situation you come upon to see if this is a “no-return” type of thing and avoid primary objectives at all costs should you not find a clear answer? Then it’s actually a really a good game. Very unique and something we need to see more of. So while I don’t recommend this for anyone who just wants a stress-free good game to play. I do recommend it for those that want an interesting game and are willing to go out of their way to stop the game from screwing them over.			"

												Consortium is a very interesting experience, one that is very rare to come by when it comes to Indie Games. I'm going to say this flat out, I cannot recommend this game to everyone, and a part of me still regrets spending the $20 I had on it. That being said, this isn't a bad game, but it also is not a very good one. Consortium suffers from a wide array of issues, but even with all of them, I cannot say I did not enjoy my time spent with it, it just honestly feels incomplete. It is a very different RPG experience you will not get from a lot of other games, but it has so many issues its hard to say whether or not they justify it's good points.  Consortium is a FPS and also a Sci-Fi RPG. You play as a person living in the 20th century who uses a device to travel to the future of a parallel universe. You awake onboard a space ship with the task of simply living in this world. The ship is fairly small and leaves little to be explored, but all the characters on this ship are interesting for various reasons. Some people are average workers with a good personality, while some are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and even one is a religious extremist. If you are into games with a heavy focus on dialogue, you might be interested in this title, the problem is that most of the said dialogue includes details of the people onboard, and not on the world you are living in. This can be a huge let down for people, as you spend most of your play time learning about people, with no depth for anything else. However, even with the lacking explanation of the world, the dialogue is pretty damn good, and almost every voice actor plays their character perfectly, it honestly is some of the best voice acting I've seen in a game, which is really impressive for such a low budget title. When you aren't walking around, talking, and making decisions ( which actually do have a large impact on the gameplay, and really encourages multiple playthroughs ) you are fighting... MAYBE. This I feel is one of the strongest aspects of the game, you are given the decision of lethal or non-lethal combat, or skipping combat entirely. You will be placed in a situation where combat is about to happen, but if you make the correct decisions in the dialogue trees, you can talk your way out of it. This is something rarely even seen in a game, and it really is refreshing to see it here. That being said, violence is definitely an option, and if you don't want to talk your way out of something, opening fire on anything that lies in your way is an option, which really is the best part about this game, options. You are constantly deciding things, how to interact with other people, how you are going to deal with enemies, its all dependent on what YOU want to do, which is something that should be present in other RPGs.  But even with all of these good things the game offers, it has a lot of problems that are persistent throughout your whole play through. The game, while having an interesting and colorful art style, is ugly and outdated. Its not really a problem for me, and may not be for others, but it really is an absolute fact. The game is buggy, you can get stuck in walls, characters will fade through door ways, dialogue choices may disappear which will cause a reload, it really is a mess. Apparently it is not as bad as before, but it still is a huge issue. The inventory management is annoying, it uses an ""energy"" system. You hold energy to heal and repair armor, and also use the non-lethal weapon. Energy takes up inventory space, which means carrying even 50% energy will really limit your choices of weaponry and items. Everything is just too heavy, and I can see this being an issue in the sequels if more combat takes place. Yes combat doesn't take up that much of the game, but I still feel it is an issue. I think worst of all is how short the game is, I finished it in about 4 hours. Granted, I skipped the like 3 side quests, mainly because I couldn't figure out what to do for some of them. Yes, it has high replayability, and it is a great experience, but the price of $20 honestly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  If you want to play a game that has a huge focus on dialogue and choices, and don't mind how short it is, this game is something you should look at, even people who are looking this style of gameplay may or may not enjoy this experience, so just be cautious. If you are willing to spend $20 on a risk, or it goes on sale, go for it. Otherwise, you're probably better of skipping it.  "

												I wasn't 100% sure what to expect playing this game. I knew it looked like the sort of thing I'd enjoy playing, as usually I like games with player driven narrative, but the details on what happens during the game are kept to bare minimum (understandably). I ended up playing through to the end it about 9 or 10 times in total, and had a whole bunch of reloads in between as well just see what other interactions I could have. After all that time I was still encountering new dialog as I did my final mission to be a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone for the final achievement. I won't spoil the story as I think it's something that is worth playing through at least once without really knowing what to expect, but it was an interesting sci-fi story and very meta in terms of who you are in the game. I look forward to one day playing the next chapter.The game does have combat if you want, and even this has an impact on the story and what others think of you. Kill everyone outright and some people will not be too happy. It did feel a little bit underutilized in this game though. Like they went to all the trouble of giving you these weapons and cool inventory system, but I guess the way the plot for the next chapter is being set up this will be used more.  There is a virtual training scenario which was obviously created to allow you to use these aspects more but I would look forward to seeing what actual impact the equipment side of things can have in the game.If I had any complaints it would be that the game world is very small, literally confined to the 12 or so areas on the ship, it's not too serious though as the focus is on the dialog and story, and the game does a good job on that, but a bit more change in scenery wouldn't go amiss.All in all, a well executed game that is a lot wider than it is long, and I look forward to continuuing the story in the future.

												Consortium is a short, dialogue-driven indie drama defined by the choices you make. Short, because its length feels like an episode rather than a full game (took me four hours to complete a run-through). You have the ability via some satellite thingy to travel into the future and inhabit the body of someone else in that future. You wake up in a cabin aboard a plane / airship and have to immediately come to grips with your new surroundings. The entire game is spent aboard this plane; you'll look for a traitor among the crew, negotiate with a mercenary, and try to keep the plane repaired and running. The moment gameplay starts, the conversations and choices begin.You can view the opening of the game here.Which are two of the primary strengths of Consortium. Choices abound, and result in genuinely different outcomes – NOT the same out come with minor variations. This means that, though short, replayability is high. There are a lot of dialogue options, with staying silent being a valid choice as well. With so much talking, the voice acting needs to be top-notch, and it is. A few characters seem a little flat, but the primary characters are unique and reactive. There are some very funny sci-fi references as well; like when you find someone dead, one of the conversation choices is, “He's wearing a red shirt; why should I care?” (Star Trek fans will know.)A supporting strength of Consortium is the lore. This is never forced on you – you have to go find it – but there are questions that can be asked, and bulletins to read that explain a lot of the world you find yourself in. Ranks are modeled on chess pieces (you play as a “bishop,” while answering to a “rook,” and primary crew are “pawns”). And gun play is good, though shooting doesn't need to happen much if you don't make certain choices. I did choose the more violent route, and the shoot-out on three decks of a plane / airship, blacked out, with only red emergency lights pulsing on and off, was a creepy yet exhilarating setting for a deadly game of cat and mouse.The three decks of the plane / airship are fully explorable (including the crawl spaces). Characters are generally well-modeled, though assets are re-used frequently (while every character's face is different, all men have the same body type, as do women). The graphics and environment are fully 3-D, which is an interesting choice since the game could have gotten away with being a 2-D point-and-click (would have lost that feeling of freedom to explore if the devs had done that, though). The graphics quality is plain but utilitarian; it fits the setting.Usually a game's shortness would count heavily against it, but the high level of replayability counters that. Go into Consortium expecting dialogue-driven drama, and you'll easily get your money's worth. The game ends on a cliffhanger, but with the sequel recently Kickstarted, I hope the next episode comes soon! Value-wise, worth getting on sale for around $5, but if you want to support the developers, consider purchasing at full cost. Highly recommended.Note about crashes:I had a few where the game would just lock up and CTD. I set the game to run in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode, and the crashes disappeared. The load times are long, though, and if you open the Task Manager it will say Consortium is “No Longer Responding”; ignore that and be patient, the game should eventually load.			"

												Do you like the sci-fitastic atmosphere from games like System Shock, Deus Ex, and Mass Effect? Do you like games with a deep enriching story and narrative combined with very clever roleplaying elements? Choises and decisions that ""actually"" matters? Then this is the game you have been waiting for since the last decade (or the one before that)Consortium lets you travel to an alternate dimension set in the future. There you will inhabit the body of Bishop 6, a newly recruited officer onboard the extremely high-tech warship Zenlil. It's literally Bishop 6s first day on the job, and as you awake in your cabin you quickly realize that something is wrong. So jump into your Battle Utility Suit and discover what dangers and mysteries lie within the world of the future. Discover why you, on this day in particular, are in control of the fate of everyone onboard Zenlil (and perhaps the entire world!)			"

												So did I pay $20 for a 3 hour game? I know that it says I have 10 hours on it but that is only because of the numerous glitches that accompanied the game at launch. Now It has excelent gameplay now that it works and it was a good bit of fun but seriously, 3 hours for $20? This game doesn't make me want to replay it over and over. I really hope that I won't have to buy the next 2 chapters seperatley. I will change this review from not reccomend to reccomend if the next 2 chapters are free. I don't feel that the content provided was worth $20. Now having said this I will replay the game as it is fun but not until I can complete it from start to finish. Also why is everyone always waving their hands around like they are using a console? Not a huge deal just a bit distracting.			"

												I like it.The bad things:- It is very short. 1 Game is done in about 4 hours.- It was released with a lot plot stopping bugs. - For the short play time the prices is too high- Although the freedom how you do things is very high the plot itself is still rather a linear one.The good things:- They are serious on fixing the bugs and in the right priority fast and are present in the steam forum. I recomment to wait till the first patch is out which should happen this or the next week.- Unique interactive world and Game concept. Dialogs that give you high degree freedom and great voice acting.- NPC Characters that have a character and behave and speak according to their character.- Game can be replayed and you still discover a lot new things you missed the first time. Especialyl if you do things different every time.- They created a whole world with a lot information you unfortunatly mostly miss in your gameplay but can be read up as metagame (stickys in this forums..the game forum and even in the game files.) One importand thing to know is that this game is only Part1 of a triology. Unfortunatly Part2 and 3 first have to be developed which means you will have to wait 1 to 3 years till you can play those other parts...and they cost extra. :( "

												Was an interesting game. Many replays if you just wanna get all teh achievos or just wanna play for fun. You control this character codenamed Bishop 6 who is on Consortium which seems to be the plane/space plane(as apparently it can travel outa space too). So you run around the plane doing  missions and meeting these new crewmembers of yours, bla bla bla, then you get attacked, and then sent on a *real* mission which promptly ends the game with that cliffhanger.....Game appears to be run on Source engine and it looks alright. Audio seems to be stereo only, sound and music are fine, IMO of course. This game can be described in one word: Simulator.Overal I enjoyed the game, so thumbs up from me.================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display; resolution 1920x1080.

												Incredibly surprising, in a good way. While not pretty to look at, and an IMMENSE amount of unvoiced background content in the way of written logs accessed from a terminal (a vital component to the whole of the game), it is both competently written and voice acted, and the existence of ACTUAL CONSEQUENCES to your actions is refreshing.A tiny game with a lot of love put into it, and worth it for fans of ""Who Dun It?""'s and other investigative adventures.

												The game is kind of in the same vein as TellTale's Walking Dead games.  Unlike other interactive games, this one never took control away from the player.  The game can be completed rather quickly but it is intended to be played more than once.  Each parallel ""Universe"" can provide different results based on your actions.			"

												Despite the FPS/RPG trappings its more like an adventure game than anything else; aside from some virtual reality training levels there are only two real firefights in the entire game. Thankfully the adventure game stuff is pretty interesting, with the entire game playing out on a single sci-fi aircraft that's like a cross between Star Trek and Thunderbirds where everyone has goofy uniforms and chess-based rankings and you do everything from solve a murder mystery to negotiate with terrorists to man the ship's defenses and do repairs after a battle. It's only towards the end when it tries to introduce a metanarrative involving terrorists and AIs and characters speaking to the player directly that the story starts to fall apart.			"

												Magnificent game. Great non-linear story-telling in a small but dynamic world.Engaging characters, clever interactions, optional combat (depending on your decisions). Meant to be played multiple times as there's many different threads to follow.The graphics are very basic but they are enough for the purpose they need to fullfill. The quality of the writing and the thought that went into building such a world beats most recent major AA releases by miles.It's also a game where you're truly ""role playing"", you're not just moving some predefined character. You have no voice, no name, no history. And it works perfectly (as opposed to the amnesia every second video game hero seems to have) the way it's setup.The core of this game are the dialogues and characters, so if you're looking for that it's more than 100% worth the price.

												This game does something no other game has ever done, and does it well - presents a real time story that is highly scripted but nonetheless different every time you play.  It's like a choose your own adventure in some ways, but the story proceeds without you no matter what you do - it's up to you how involved you get, and in what way.  It's also got this great meta-narrative, where making decisions based on knowledge from previous playthroughs is a valid and fully supported path.  The settings is unique, rich, and thought-provoking, and everything that could be odd or jarring about the meta-stuff is handled really well.  As far as the gamey stuff goes, the voice acting is good, and the interface is decent, but for the combat you pretty much just get through it.  That's not really a problem, though since there's not much of it.The game ""ends"" abruptly, although this is a game meant to be replayed.  However, it also demands a sequel, due to the unresolved cliffhanger.  Let's hope that happens.Also, the in-game fiction is quite good and very extensive.			"

												I'm filing CONSORTIUM under ""Games that are not for me""Do you read all the books in Elder Scrolls games? Was your favourite part of Mass Effect when you wandered around the Normandy talking to the crew? CONSORTIUM might be for you, then.Finally got around to trying CONSORTIUM because I'm in the middle of binging on The Expanse, and I was in the mood for some sci-fi gaming. That was a mistake. Story/dialog in video games always suffer in comparison to other media, and CONSORTIUM is mostly dialog and backstory. Apparently multiple playthroughs are required to get the full story. The dialog, while reasonably well acted, is not written well enough to get me to sit through it once, let alone multiple times. Oh, and everyone has a callsign(?) consisting of a chess piece and number. Some people might have no problem with that, but I very quickly lost track of who was Pawn 17 or Pawn 44 or Pawn 32 or whoever. Made it hard to get invested in the story when I generally had no idea who was being discussed.Story aside, the game is also generally klunky. For example, I kept getting hung up on doorways; it honestly felt as though my avatar was bonking his head on the lintel each time, and having to stoop a bit to get through on the second attempt.So, yeah. Not a bad game, necessarily, just not one for me.			"

												A strong narrative and deeply branching story where your choices matter. You step into the role of a global peacekeeper in the near future, aboard a large future craft, inside which this story takes place.An on board murder has you looking for a killer on a ship with a NPC crew who work, socialize, go about their lives, react differently to your conversations and actions, as well as your response to unfolding events. It's some of the deepest conversation mechanics I've experienced, like a really fleshed out Mass Effect game taking place entirely on board one ship. It's probably the closest we will get to a block style RPG.There are some FP Shooter elements, namely hostiles and VR training, but the passive route can be taken with aggressors.A sequel has been funded on fig.co and I believe this entry will be ported over to UE4 in the future.

												An equivocal review of an intriguing game with one critical flaw.The characters of CONSORTIUM are each unique, supported by adequate-to-good voice acting, and they combine nicely with an interesting story to create a plausible and exciting environment. There is also an impressive amount of player agency within the small bounds of the scenario. The game's simple aesthetic mostly works well, though the bare animations do detract from immersion.Unfortunately the core experience of this game explicitly relies on save scumming (saving and loading to explore different gameplay options) and while saving is quick, the slow loading times are immersion-breaking when you try to follow the game's instruction to explore conversation trees. This is the main issue with the game as it stands: exploring the many complex branching conversations central to the game is changed from an exciting and fun experience into a slog.A few other, mostly minor, issues also detract from the game. Many conversations seem to just involve finding what to say to each character to increase their alignment- though many obvious exceptions make this a minor gripe and the game is still miles better than most other games in this regard. Combat is also limited, but functional, and given the scope and tone of the game the slight awkwardness may be appropriate. Finally, game-breaking bugs do exist but fortunately the developer seems to be active in supporting and fixing those as they are encountered.CONSORTIUM is pushing forward the boundaries of the art, and is certainly worthwhile. The game brings some intriguing ideas and a good story to the table, but sadly the load issue combined with other mechanical shortcomings were enough to push it slightly over the boundary to 'not-fun' for me. In my opinion it is worth supporting this game solely for the direction it is headed, but I would not recommend it to friends as a fun way to spend some time.			"

												Definitely a reccomendation from me. The whole game world consists of maybe 100-200 square meters (except for the ending, but that doesn't really count) but the game would absolutely require several playthroughs to see everything the game has to offer. The game's story has a lot more to offer than it might appear, in fact, there's more to discover even if you beat the game. There's several secrets, and they're well done. I'd absolutely say you should get this game. It's only ten dollars, and usually the rule for me is one dollar per hour, and i've got 22.7 hours as of now in this game.			"

												If you are looking for something similar to System Shock... then don't look for it here ;). Which is not bad because this game is something new and something good.It's not a shooter game, it is not RPG-by-stats game. But it is truly roleplaying adventure game where you talk to others, solve criminal case by looking for clues and asking questions. There are shooting sections, there is inventory management but te core of the game is playing your role and expressing it by actions, inactions, words spoken and unspoken. Great experience that changes rules how NPC interactions can be implemented in the game.I played this game twice, and even though i tought i do everything the same i got different choices to pick just because i rushed some conversation straight to the point or didnt click one thing. You can play your style, you can break 4th wall, you can try playing role of character you play - short game with replay value and some achievements on the list makes me wonder 'how is that even possible? ive checked everything' :P.Dont be fooled by, maybe bad, screenshots - game looks really good when you play it and simplistic graphics serves it's purpose - you can clearly distinguish one NPC from another by simple features of face and haircut so when you are given task or clue to talk to somebody you can recognize them from afar.And even though game offers really limited space for your actions this space is used to its full extend. Scenery will change, rules will change, game will ofer new things within the same corridors.Story is solid and characters are well fleshed out. Some pieces of world lore or propaganda could be annoying as game obviously uses cliches, national stereotypes and puts real world politics or religious issues inside the game. Setting is parallel universes in future so why the game is full of nowadays topics? Feeling of being indoctrinated is so strong that everytime i see piece of this makes me roll my eyes and think 'omg, rly?'.As i wrote earlier - it is not a shooter game so shooting is really basic and quite simple. Enemies are just dolls to be shoot at and only difficulty is their endurance. You can't use covers and all focuses on taking enemy down without much tactics on how to do it - just keep their silhouettes within your crosshair and keep button pressed down.You can collect new gear, manage ammo and use energy to heal during battle but these features are not much used within this game.And why battle is in the game when there is not much action? Because it is just a first episode of upcoming action game where you enter the brawl in The Tower. It is like introductory sequence, shareware-alike kind of old games used to have where you had first episode to have fun and then you could buy full version. But for this one you have to pay full price in advance and episode will end up with a cliffhanger.Of course it is just information for the reader, not a flaw, i don't see a reason not to pay the devs for such a good piece of work. Game looks great, sounds great [full voiceover], is replayable and costs 10e. It is like going to the cinema but here you can change the outcome of the story if you like so :)			"

												This game does many incredible things with its dynamic narrative and interactivity. There is nothing quite like it, and I recommend being as little prepared as possible for what you're getting into. It wields a brand of tension, intrigue, and even horror like no other game out there.However, I will say that I found the Shooter elements to be exceptionally lacking. The bright side is that all violence is completely avoidable. Someday I'll brave the combat mechanics in order to experience some of the other story branches, but you can easily get your money's worth without doing so.Er, I'm sorry. Did I say this was a game? Don't let the simulation's low fidelity fool you: these are real people. You may be immune to the consequences of your choices, but the people you meet will not be so fortunate. Act accordingly.

												Consortium is a RPG unlike any others. The best way I can put this game into perspective is to think of the Mass effect series games, reduces its scope to just one setting but focus entirely on dialogues choices and characters interaction.  The setting you are playing on, a huge command plane similar to the BUS in Agents of SHIELD, is full of interesting characters, of which all of them are voiced over. The people you encountered are all believable; each has interesting thing to say either about themselves, their colleagues and the world around them. Conservations seem life-like as the choices are timed so you can’t be holding on to decide what to say next, and “say nothing” is always present for all dialogue options. You can even walk away during a conversation and the characters would react to it. Talking to them is a lot of fun; the dialogues are entertaining as well as giving background story about the world. There’s even a part which your answer is breaking the fourth wall, and at first it seem like a joke response to one of the character inquiry but to my surprise, later on the game the character actually referred back to your response and if you persist  enough will become one of the subplot. Now the story, essentially you are trying to solve a murder happened shortly while you are on board but as the story unfold it hinted on a larger mystery / conspiracy hangs in the shadow.  The story is engaging but slow at the beginning, it picked up pace around the middle but ended in a cliff hanger. I would say that’s the only negative thing about the game. Combat is simple and basic but it is not irrelevant. It does feel dated as it is still using the source engine.  With that said combat has a choice of lethal and non-lethal and a fairly basic inventory system. But seeing that you can actually complete the game without firing a single shot, there is definitely less emphasis on combat.All in all I would definitely recommend this game as it mixed rpg, adventure game, and FPS into something that is quite unique.

												This is a very strange game. Your first clue is that it claims to be real. The deal is, you used a system by iDGi to take control of Bishop-6, a general-operations crewmember aboard the Zenlilth in the year 2043. The Zenlilth is a highly advanced plane containing a chess-based heirarchy, all working for the leaders of Consortium, King and Queen. Your purpose is to do stuff, and try not to screw up the plane too badly through traitors, mercenary attacks, and intrigue. There's even a section where the high leader of Consortium calls you specifically to tell you not to kill the guy you're controlling. It is, in my opinion, well-written and creative, and if Bioware RPG's are too busy for you, this is much more story-focused and less shooting and picking flowers.The combat is unique, and takes backstage. As a ""Bishop"", you are supposed to know how to fight, but in the only big combat scene of the game people get a bit annoyed if you kill too many people (especially the leader). Story is unique and immersive, the ending is incredibly strange and yet not out of place. So much detail is put into a facade of reality that the same section of a game might be experienced with bad space/time continuum connection the first time, and some static the next. There's a lot more to learn and I've played through the game twice. Is it worth 20$? Maybe. Is it worth the money you pay when on sale for 33% off or more? Definitely.			"

												Today, I’m talking about a little first-person action-adventure game called CONSORTIUM. Developed and self-published by Interdimensional Games, Inc. The games development had its start in a successful Kickstarter campaign, which leads us to what we have today. CONSORTIUM’s story starts off with you, the player, travelling forward through time, and to a parallel universe, thanks to a satellite that allows us to connect to a sentient A.I. that exists in the other universe. In this future universe, it seems that everything is just about perfect. Global hunger, energy, and poverty problems has been resolved for the most part, and all forms of war have almost completely ceased. We have people living in space, on the moon, on Mars, you name it. But can things ever really be perfect?Consortium1You take the role of someone named Bishop Six, a field agent and peacekeeper of sorts in the Consortium, a society dedicated to protecting the galaxy or something. But all is not well, as soon after you arrive on your ship, the Zenlil, one of your shipmates is found dead in their bunkroom. Believing them to have been murdered by another shipmate, you are commanded to begin interrogating your shipmates to find out who the traitor is. If that weren’t enough, you also have the problem of a band of outlaws currently looking to take down your ship. It’s up to you to solve the mystery behind the murder, and take down the outlaws, among other things. But you better watch out, nobody can know where you’re really from, otherwise you might end up causing a temporal breakdown and destroy the universe!So, let me tell you right now: Gameplay is where this game really shines. CONSORTIUM really isn’t an action game, so much as it is an immersive story told through its great character dialogue, its mysteries, and the in-game lore that comes with it. You communicate to the other characters on the ship through simple button presses, similar to a Telltale game. Alternatively, you can choose to say nothing and make everything awkward with your constant silence. Like I said before, one of the major goals is trying to find out who the murderer on your ship is, but naturally, things can never just be that simple. News gets spread fast on Zenlil, and before you know it, everybody on the ship knows what has happened, which naturally freaks them out. As you question and get to know your shipmates, you find that quite a few of them are less trustworthy than they appear, and others seem way too nervous or in some cases, optimistic about the whole situation. But, for those of you out there who decide that there isn’t enough shooting involved, there ARE action segments included with the game. Depending on how you choose to interact with other characters, you will be forced to engage in combat with bloodthirsty mercenaries who invade your ship, or shoot down enemy spaceships. You are also given the choice of capturing, or outright killing their leader. Just remember: Gameplay, as well as the story itself, might turn out differently depending on what you’ve chosen to do or not do.Consortium3Everything looks decent in terms of graphics, but the game was built on the constantly aging Source Engine, so you probably shouldn’t expect anything too fancy. Because it IS Source though, you can be almost certain that CONSORTIUM will run on even the lowest-end of gaming PCs. The sound effects are pretty good too, really helping encapsulate that claustrophobic feeling of being on a small little spaceship. The music is absolutely fantastic, but what do you expect when it’s composed by none other than Jeremy Soule, the same guy who did the music for such great games as Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Knights of the Old Republic? The developers really use the music to their advantage here when it comes to telling the story, and really puts an emphasis on the importance of what’s going on around you.If there was one major flaw I could point out about this game, it’s that it was too short for my tastes. If you want a short, but good little immersive plot-central game, I recommend you try out CONSORTIUM. It’s currently on sale on Steam for $19.99.http://wtbfun.com/consortium-review/ "

												A video game that's not really comparable to other video games, because there really isn't anything like it. I've played through it once already and just started a second playthrough, and I think I'll continue playing it beyond that. No point in explaining what the game is (just read the store page), but I will say that they ♥♥♥♥ing nailed it. Starting off with the writing, I was blown away. The lore is insanely extensive, which you can find by just playing the game or accessing the terminal on the ship or reading the ""iDGi-1 Discoveries"" compedium (included with the game for free). It's rare to see a game take its lore as seriously as this one does. The actual writing in the game's story is great as well, with characters having their own distinct personalities (as they should) - and the way you interact with (or don't) with these characters actually has an impact on the way they treat you and even the outcome of the story. The branching paths of the story not only make replayability possible, but they seem designed around taking advantage of replayability (and replaying actually fits the lore!) - a good comparison (apparently) is Undertale.Gameplay-wise, the game is mostly talking to people. There are a few combat scenarios, one being in a virtual world, but for the most part you won't do much shooting. The combat itself can be approached in multiple ways, offering lethal, non-lethal, or a little of both. This also has a noticeable impact on the game and its world. The actual combat mechanics aren't anything amazing and are rarely used, so you probably shouldn't waste what little inventory space you have trying to carry an entire armory.Now the complaints! At times, the voice acting was particularly hammy - sometimes even outright bad. Most of the time it was just decent. Visually, the game was a headache - at least at first. I can appreciate an art style but the shadows and lighting just seemed to detract from everything, and it just felt like they were progressing backwards in their art direction. The UI is especially messy, and the main menu is an eyesore. I feel like this could be attributed to the engine, as Source is and was pretty severely dated at the time of this game's release. At least the sequel seems to be rectifying that.To quickly address the length, it is short. I can see how some might think 3-5 hours is petty for a $15 game, but with the amount of replayability and the fact that replaying actually changes things, I'm alright with that price. Is it worth the money? Absolutely. I'm actually ashamed I got this for free, and would have gladly paid for it had I known it was this good (though I did back the sequel on Kickstarter, as should you if you're reading this within 24 days of posting).

												One of the best and most unique games I've played in a while. A genius scifi-rpg from FPS perspective, taking place entirely on a plane. Murder mystery and much more.Pros:- Strong, captivating story, some great characters and plot twists- Short to play through once, but excellent replay value. The main mystery can only be pieced together after multiple walkthroughs, and it's really worth exploring different paths (some by reloads, some by new universes).- Great dialogs and voice acting, with the option to say nothing or just walk away from any conversation- Unique and sometimes disturbing meta-game aspect. You don't play the character in the game, you play yourself controlling the character, which allows for weird effects, smart use of glitches and limitations, and can even be discovered by characters you encounter...- Deep and interesting game lore + an info database you can search for any keyword and discover new stuff- Excellent soundtrack by Jeremy SouleCons:- Not beautiful (though going well with the art style), Source engine is not well suited for the confined space- Slow (re)loading times (I read this is because of Source)- UI could use some improvement (I love the design but some functionality could be better)- Combat and inventory management are overly complicated and unrewarding. Luckily they have little role in the game- (for me at least) a bit hard to keep track of all the NPCs relations- somewhat anticlimatic cliffhanger ending leading to the planned sequel			"

												First playthrough, 10 hours. I am not sure how many playthroughs I will need, until I know enough of the story.I think I was 5 hours only reading the news and reports.There is always happening something, it is even worse, you always think somewhere else is something happening and you should be there. I think, in most cases, that is even true.You play as a Bishop, a fighter in high tech armor. But the game is not about fighting. It is about talking to different people. It is about finding out what happened, who is hiding what.If you like to read a lot, if you like good characters, if you do not need to shoot all the time to be happy, then this game is a must for you. This is the world of tomorrow and now you have the chance to help change it for the better.You will really like or dislike some guys/girls, you will curse because some dialogs went wrong, you will not understand all that happens. You will have a great time in this game.Get it!(No, it is NOT open world, it is NOT a shooter, it is NOT a point and click adventure and NO, there is NO multiplayer, go away)			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Seriously, some of the best narrative work I have experienced in a really long time. Each of the characters have their own definate personality, and thankfully don't follow the common cliches. the soundwork is pretty great too - I was really suprised to see someone who worked on KOTOR accredited to the music.I'm genuinely facinated by the world of consortium; I really want to experience it more! Unfortunately the 2nd game won't be along for a while, and the wait is gpoing to be painful - there is so much stuff that is referenced in passing, which I hope is expanded on in the planned next 2 games. There are bugs, yes, but at time of writing, the game had only been out for less than a day for general release - I personally did not experience any crashes, but a word to the wise. Enable dev console, and get used to load autosave01. also  manually save. a lot. overall, CONSORTIUM is well worth your money and time.			"

												I really tried to like this game. I really did. It just never clicked. Pros voice acting on all characters fairly intuitive controls diverse personality rostercons mission objectives sometimes hard to understand personality roster is odd bad timings in conversationsThings can happen at the same time. You can have a long discussion with a character and someone else will talk to you at the same time, making everything confusing.Characters talk to you like they know you and don't know you at the same time. You're a new guy there which...makes sense I guess?Locations are odd. Sometimes you're told to do something, but you have no clear as to what the person is talking about or what the thing you're supposed to look for looks like.Then there's the whole mind transfer thing. You're thrown into another person's body after a creepy cutscene with nearly no explanation as to why. The only thing this does is to impose annoying static. I'm sure there's a point, but I never got to that. The game tries to do a lot of things at the same time.There are a lot of options/storylines going on at the same time, which, if you're a perfectionist and you don't mind going through every detail more than once will make this a gift to you. I don't mind sleuthing, but the level this game takes it to is just a notch over what I find to be pleasant.The traitor quest was damn near impossible too.Needless to say I never made it farther than to the discussion with the Queen. Took a few wrong turns and disconnected.I feel that this could've been a really good game, but something went wrong in the process.PS: the game is 6 Gigs and I have no idea why.			"

												This is like the first 15 minutes of a movie. If you like real time unskippable cut scenes, you'll love this. There's a lot of gushing over this being dynamic or choices with consquences, but that's significantly overstated.The game developers packed a crap ton of text into the onboard computers, so... if you want you can read over twenty five six page articles about something about the setting this is suppose to take place in. The story takes place on a fairly claustrophobic cartoon ship and the combat mechanic is weak. The story is kinda meta and references you playing a game, but as like a serious acknowledgement woven into the story rather than tonge in cheek. There's a lame murder mystery thing, confused only by the fact all the characters have identical titles with a number and look pretty much the same too. The definitive ""clue"" makes no sense in the context of a saboteur committing murder. Contrived mystery is really central to what little there is here, so it shouldn't be a spoiler to say that aspect falls flat. Rest of the game is go from one cut scene to another cut scene. Sometimes you can walk away in the middle of a conversation, sometimes the door inexplicably locks behind you.  After sitting through an eye rolling mission briefing about Osama Bin Laden's son taking a building hostage, you paratrooper from the plane and the game ends before it starts.It probably would be an alright tutorial or intro to a game, but this probably shouldn't have been released as if it was a real game. I can't in good conscious recommend this to a general audience. Go play the Stanley Parable if you want an unconventional narrative and an exploration into player choice.			"

												It took me a bit to determine if I would recommend this game and the answer has to be no. In the end, the actual ""game"" is extremely lacking and the best bits really leave you wanting more. It might have a great sequel, but as it is, I can't recommend it.The bad stuff. So there isn't really a game here. There are the concepts of a FPS intermixed and there are even a couple VR training sessions that show off a functional shooter. It's not great, but it's functional. Oh and there's a bug where apparently the AI cannot figure out where you are if you go up two ramps from the starting level.In the game itself, there are at most two parts that can involve combat. If you play ""correctly,"" there will be no combat though. If you don't, it's again not very good combat.So the experience rests firmly on the story and the interactions. The actual writing of all of the lines is pretty good overall with respectable voice acting. There just isn't any real motivating force past either advancing the game or I don't have anything better to do to actually play along. There is a ton of information you clearly are left out of, but the game never really lets you into that. Maybe with some more context or something, I would care, but as presented, I just don't.So that sounds like all of the game. Why would this be hard for me to say yes or no to the recommend to it? It sounds boring to bad overall.There are glimmers of something great in here. The meta story could be actually pretty interesting. I would love for there to be more to it. At the end, it even seemed to be coming through a bit.There actually seem to be characters in this game. People have glimmers of personalities and conflicts. That all seems great. No one happens to develop anywhere near enough for me to care about them, but I can see things there.The entire game takes place on one (large) plane. I love that in such a condensed space, you can have quite a few interactions and it felt decently real (as in a reasonable series of events). Hell, even the plane felt appropriate where there were places for people to sleep and relax and eat and such while remaining very tight and small. Unfortunately those interactions all end up being boring.So I really want to see what comes of the sequel which I believe starts kickstarting soon. This isn't the game I wanted to play, but it is a world I'm interesting in revisiting.			"

												Interesting take on non-linear adventure game combined with murder-room mystery elements. I didn't expect it but it was really fun talking with all the crew and finding out whodunit. I really liked the freedom of choice in dialogues and compelling branching strory set in interesting future world.Sometimes it was very hard to differentiate between all those numbered chess-like nicknames as whole hiearachy definitely needs some time to get used to (I would appreciate showing normal names anytime). Browsing through main terminal was mainly boring because most of the texts were written as interviews with too much beating around the bush (I would prefer shorter news-like summaries). But overall it is surprising hidden gem. and I'm glad I found it.I recommend this game to anyone who prefers talking their way out instead of fighting in other RPGs.			"

												Though the game is mercifully short if you choose to not read the dozens of in-game messages, I can't recommend the game for a couple reasons:- On second playthrough, trying to get more achievements and unravel more of the mystery, I encountered a game ending bug. I couldn't enter the Knight's office when she demanded a meeting. Restoring from older saves was both ineffective and a tremendous waste of time since you can't skip dialogue. Achievements aren't worth starting all over again HOPING that things might work on the third try.- Inventory system is flat out bonkers.- The game ends right when things finally get interesting. All the wandering around the ship pays off with a thud. Roll credits.			"

												More a proof of concept than a real game: the talky bits from your favourite sci-fi RPG as retold by Neo while peeing all over the fourth wall.   A better idea in theory than in practice.  Starting in media res, optional combat, multiple ways of dealing with situations, with no right or wrong decisions, your choices do have impact... a good start, but ultimately the whole thing just doesn't go anywhere and there's very little content making it hard to recommend.  Maybe the sequel will give us the real game.			"

												CONSORTIUM is absolutely fantastic.It's very like one of those well loved but sort of clunky RPGs, like Deus Ex, Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines or EYE: Divine Cybermancy. If you can look beyond the flaws, which I personally haven't really suffered, it's a fantastic game. I've only played around 3 hours (so Steam tells me) but I could swear it's been more. It's absolutely astounding, the visuals are interesting, and the world is so rich! There's a computer bank with literally thousands of ebooks in detailing the world. There's so much there I really can't even begin to absorb it. It's got a real diversity in playstyle, too. For example, the big bad of the first act, I looked him up, worked out a bit about his personality, and when speaking to him, played his ego and curiosity. This meant I could defeat him and his army, then his fleet without firing a single bullet or hurting anyone.Alternatively, I attempted a more violent approach, but I personally never found that to be the best way. The richness with the way you interact and chat with the characters makes you genuinely develop emotion towards them, not forced emotion, such as in The Walking Dead. They each have their own metric ton of things to say, and your behaviour changes their thoughts towards you, and the same will go for you.The setting is very rich, like a Gerry Anderson serial, or something. I was strongly reminded of Spectrum, with the whole codename system and flying base. The only sort of problem with this is that nearly every character is designated as Pawn and then a number. This means I got very confused when investigating an incident that comes out through the game. I actually ended up screwing my alignment utterly with two characters and failing to find the bad guy. This did sort of annoy me, but the game does tell you that regular saves are a good idea, and I decided to not do that to add a more permanent level to my choices.I can imagine that there's so many ways to approach this game, so I can't comment on the scope of it. It can also be very tense in some parts, like when you're being interrogated about your name and stuff.All in all, this is one of those games you will love if you can focus past things like attempting the usual tutorial and introduction dialouges with NPCs being met with ""Are you feeling okay? You've forgotten everything"" and other things. The developers have also promised to fix the bugs that have damaged some people's experience, too.			"

												Someone called Consortium an interactive StarTrek episode, and boy was he/she right!This title is a mix of roleplay, shooter (not much, but still) and advemture game, strongly depending on bulding relationship with crew members (or making them hate your character, if you like) which will be the key to solve the mystery taking place on Zenlil. Every one choice you make, every word you say can be VERY important and change the whole outcome of the story. The best word to describe this game is a simulator. Simulator of your alter ego who will have a big impact on the other world. Literally and figuratively.The first playtrough took me 15 hours, but I'm an explorer who wants to find as much as he can for the first time. I took my time for doing the detective work (reading logs, speaking with npc etc) so surely my timeplay will stand aside from the typical 5-6h people have. Still, hours very good spended.I hope the game will have more attention from the press and that people will help fund the second episode. This title has a great potential to become next years Deus Ex.			"

												It's a very strange game. And I'm talking about the plot as much as the game itself. First off, it looks absolutely terrible, but if you can get over that it looks like it was made by a bunch of amateurs, it's actually kind of interesting.It's more or less a walking and talking simulator on a space ship. You interact with the crew in first-person navigating through dialogue trees to solve various mysteries that your crew runs in to. Things happen in real-time as well, so you can actually miss some clues if you weren't at a certain place at a certain time. Voice acting isn't bad and the music was created by Jeremy Soule, so it's actually quite an enjoyable experience the first time around.Ends in an awful cliffhanger, but you can at least solve the one big mystery. I got it for free, but I don't know if it's something I'd pay $15 for.			"

												A pretty standard shooter hides a system of branching choices. Unfortunately, you'll get little opportunity to see the results of either as the game is little more than part 1 of an episodic story whose part 2 has just entered kickstarter and may never exist. Mildly entertaining for a few hours within its confined space, and its cast is populated with interesting characters whose lives you may occasionally be responsible for. If the game had a demo, I'd suggest it, but the game itself is barely a demo. If you can get it for under five dollars it may be worth it.			"

												Decision Making at one of it's best. Many games try to pull off the whole convseration simlulator route and while this one far from perfect it comes pretty close. The problem with most decision making games is that the choices tend to fall with the whole black/white or good/evil route. Few truly understand how to manuiplate the whole mass of grey area that comes with conversation.			"

												Play this game. It's not a massive game, but it is well made and if your graphics card can handle the slightly curious render then it will be a satisfying way to pass a few hours. You can actually have conversations with the AI in this game, the talking flows naturally and the interactions are mostly really connective -as in- I care about the crew (well, Rook 9, who still owes me a drink!) far more than their colleagues in Skyrim (who insist on telling me their lifestories without request before I firestorm their arses). But yes, A fun smallish but well crafted detective game right here.....			"

												CONSORTIUM is a heavily story based and very conceptual game. It has this slight feeling of leaning towards AAA games, but instead of being a few hour long rollercoaster ride with splosions and lols, it focuses more on ideas while providing more gamplay than usual indie titles.Story is the main point in the game, but it has so many branches that it would require a dozen playthroughs to get them all.  In one conversation you can change the whole outcome of the game, then in the next one, you might change it all again, everything depends on your choice. You can be a modest doing-my-job guy or a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a complete weirdo. And again, this may or may not impact the outcome. Honestly before this game I did not think you can make so many changes in story with  2-5 dialogue choices.While the game has combat which is moderate (and that's what makes the game lean towards AAA FPS rather than being full chit-chat indie title), it can completely avoided through dialogue OR you can turn the game into a bloodbath. Graphics aren't impresive but bearable (though somewhat unusual, thus giving some originality to the game), same about sounds.CONSORTIUM combines FPS, RPG and mystery solving while being heavily story driven, and makes me wish more AAA titles would adopt such ways of story telling. Not just 2-3 outcomes and call it best game ever with multiple endings, but story that changes with every choice you make.			"

												I budgeted a whole two hours for games when I picked this up and I spent like... four on it before I knew what had happened.It's a little rough around the 'indie' edges, but the conversation tree/affection-rating systems clashing with your goals of playing detective, diplomat, and warrior? All good fun. All while trying to figure out what's going on with the metagame without letting slip that you're actually a remote-control operator from the past in 2013.The 4th-wall-breaking conceit behind the game is that the entire game is apparently a VR simulator delivered to you at your PC via uplink to a satellite which is making use of tachyon bursts or some♥♥♥♥♥♥to transmit temporally-adjusted data with an advanced, benevolent AI in the future, allowing you to remote-control an specific, nominated avatar at a fixed point in the future, generating a number of 'branched' alternate realities - based on your decisions - which the AI can track via other satellites in other parallel universes, spreading itself as a single entity functioning on nodes across all of them.The rest of the story is best kept a mystery because it's kind of fun getting clues from the crew about the world lore and politics etc, without asking the standard, ""Duh, so what is the deal with [Major Faction even a child should know about]?"" RPG questions. Those options are still there but the crew will think you're a bit dozy or incompetent because of it, and start to regard you suspiciously or with hostility.There's an in-game encyclopedia, but it seems like it only decelerates time to a certain degree to allow you to catch up, meaning that significant events and conversation opportunities can pass by or run their course without you. A veteran can probably see where most of the threads are underlying all this, and manipulate things appropriately, but if you let the smoke and mirrors do their job, I'd say this one's a fun one to get into.The mechanics of combat and the rest are not the smoothest, occasionally fiddly and unintuitive, but you can avoid most twitch-dependency if you're so inclined, through game-choices. It's definitely more substance than style, with some kind of dated graphics.  Either way, none of this got in the way for me, so I can pretty confidently give this an overall thumbs up.			"

												I've never written a review on a game before but this game deserves to be showered in praise. It's exciting at every turn. The story is fantastically well developed with a small yet surprisingly diverse array of characters. The end really messes with your head. Good god. ""Out the plane you go...welcome back to the start of the game!"" ""Wait what?!"" I only wish I had picked up this game several years later so I didn't have to wait for the sequel because I can't wait to see how this story ends. The best part is, is that the story could branch in any number of ways with all kinds of outcomes. Murder everthing, Be the nice guy, tell everyone you've hijacked this guys body and you're actually from another dimension. Do whatever you want!			"

												...uhhhhh, weird feelings.CONSORTIUM, the game where developers make you think that everything you do is REAL and has impact on everything in the future world. But speaking normally, it is about a game where you enter the mind of some person through a satellite and do some stuff. Boatloads of story awaits.Pros- Boatload of story and lore- More boatloads of story and lore- One big mothership of story and lore- One BIG UNIVERSE of story and loreCons- Sometimes TOO MUCH story and lore- Almost no combat- You may feel guilt sa you make decisions, but it's just a feeling.Conclusion is that there's STORY AND LORE OVERLOAD!!!!!!!111!11!1!one!!1!!!1oneone- *static*			"

												It's an interesting idea for a game... mixing genres like adventure games, cRPGs and shooters together. It's fun and fairly engaging for a while. The problem however with it (aside from not that great usage of Source Engine and terrible optimization), is that the story develops waaay to slow and there is not enough depth in dialogue choices, to make it worthwhile. It's still a decent game to grab on a sale. For a full price however - I'd say no.			"

												The game is quite interesting and shows promise, but ultimately is far too short and convoluted. In my first playthrough, i ended up in a ""you die"" scenario more or less telling me to buy the sequel when it comes out. Along the way, i was told by an in-game character that i needed to have an ARG (alternate reality game) completed to be ""prepared"" to play. After a four hour experience, there have been dozens of questions created and none really answered. While it is an interesting take on interactive storytelling, it feels very much like the story just wasn't finished - and that is the entire centrepiece of the game, as combat is only a small feature used in one or two situations.

												I'll just bullet point summarize this one:- So-so story line.- Combat mechanics are bland and frustrating.  The game would have been better without them at all.- Some random glitches with the AI where one or more characters will stand stuck in place and you can't interact with them.- The dialog choices feel like they won't really change anything by the end of the game (with one exception that lets you skip an incredibly annoying battle).- The game assumes you'll memorize the layout of the plane, so finding things can be frustrating at times.- The reveal of who the big evil bad guy is near the end of the game made me roll my eyes.  Then when they showed a picture of him, I laughed because it looks like a guy in a purple bicycle helmet with yellow sunglasses and a pink ascot.  Fabulous.- Even though there's only 3-4 hours of actual gameplay time in this, even counting reloading saves because of combat, I found myself wanting to skip through the dialog for the last 30 minutes of the game because I was ready for it to end.

												Feels more like a poorly written sci-fi novel than a well-executed gaming experience.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I sigh looking at that previously written single-line review I had left for this game, because this game is pretty good as far as allowing you to craft your own line in this narrative. It just feels pretty poorly put together. I absolutely LOVE games with a good story, but this one just didn't enthrall me as others have. I very often will play a game, not enjoy the ending, sit thinking about it for hours or days, and realize the game I'd just played was deeper than I thought at first. This game just does not fall in that category though.			"

												It looked so promising, but I was disappointed. CONSORTIUM is a game that holds itself together with its plot, but that's where it suffered.To truly appreciate everything the developers are trying to do, you need to read reems and reems of backstory prose, delve into blogs, read ""musings"", and even play another game by the same developers. The combat is pretty terrible - it could have been removed or simplified without any real impact to the game. You're constantly thrust into weird scenarios in which everyone else seems to know something you don't. There is a *lot* of talking. Yes, the plot is very important, but sometimes you're going to feel more like a passenger than a driver.The concept of the game itself being a gateway into an alternate reality broke my immersion more than anything else. The fourth wall was broken and never ended up being repaired. I soon stopped caring about the characters, the ship, or the mission. The setting just didn't have a good draw. The technology is advanced, and there are some interesting concepts in there, but the game might have been more interesting with more simplification.Set it on an orbiting spaceship instead of an aeroplane; provide a concise glossary or encylclopaedia; cut down the number of weapons to just one (you don't need a lethal assault rifle with a stun-grenade launcher attachment *and* a stun gun with a lethal laser mode); and most of all - utilise SHOW instead of TELL as a storytelling/exposition tool.I read all of the database entries in Mass Effect because they enhanced my experience, but in CONSORTIUM the extra information is pretty much mandatory reading if you want to understand what's going on - and the entries are *really* long. Let me put it this way: I can tell you all about the First Contact War and how the Mass Relays work in Mass Effect, but I'm still not sure I know what the Consortium itself actually is, what its ideals are, or how it does what it's supposed to be doing.Conversing with the crew and interacting with them is really important, but if you miss one or two key lines, you can miss a heck of a lot of content (and it really hurts your chances of solving the main mystery).If you get excited over the idea of a computer game pretending to be a door into another dimension where you can tell people ""I'm from another world, playing a computer game, and you're all characters in that computer game. If I load a saved game, I'm breaking the timeline and creating another alternate reality..."" then maybe you'll enjoy CONSORTIUM, but for me it was laid on a bit too thick.			"

												A sci fi RPG. Thought the game sounded interesting, but it's not, this game is boring as it's just wandering around a ship talking to everyone and hardly knowing what you're doing. A game with a tiny bit of  action and a lot of endless talking. It would be wrong to class it as a fps as there is hardly any shooting.The graphics are basic looking and sometimes a bit buggy and weird as NPC eyes seem to look in weird direction or clip and there doesn't seem to be much gameplay unless you are prepared to continually reload saves to see the different paths you can take. And relaoding is very slow.The game is also buggy, I went back in the cabin and am now stuck in there, can't get out. The door was open but acted like an invisible barrier, no matter how many times I opened and closed the door. Had to reload a previous save.Also characters speech timing is terrible making it hard hard to hear what anyone is saying as you'll be talking to one character and then some other character will come speak at the same time and over each other, I had the knight, Wade and rook 25 all speaking at the same time, making it a garbled mess.The game is confusing at times. I don't know where Iam going or where something is. And not sure what to do sometimes with mission objectives.I ended up confronted with a traitor and not being able to harm the person in anyway and just die.The game is also very short, only taking 3 to 4 hours.(thank god) The game is medicore and boring as well as buggy. I'd consider getting a refund if I wasn't collecting games.4/10 can't reccomend.			"

												Consortium is able to be a game world that is realized on a scale that is able to immerse the player wholly. Now, getting off the Webster-Merriam high horse, Consortium is able to deliver a world that feels real and right. This is a believable world with as much character as any world should have if it is to be as much a character as any other. It does not wait for you to give it the green light to move forward. The universe will continue on whether you're ready or not. The cast of this game, as well, truly feels alive and they interact realistically. When you're not watching, they still have full agendas, talking with people and moving around, doing their jobs. When you talk to them, they are able to feel fleshed out and they react realistically as if you have existed in this world. In a nutshell, this game is a must-play for those who love story and conversation as well as being able to immerse themselves for a few hours in a soon to be continued game world.			"

												This game is NOT designed to be played only once. There are many things that you can only unlock or discover if you play several times, knowing what will happen and when. The game is designed like that. Play it at least twice, changing your behavior, visiting different parts of the ship at different times, doing differently every time. You'll then find that this game is NOT short, but it's engaging nonetheless (you won't get bored after the first pass, far from it).The biggest ""miss"" IMO are the huge information documents that describe the lore, the setting, and several key points of the plot. Overly descriptive, boring, and excessively ""not-to-the-point"".			"

												Haven't finished the game yet, but I want to write this review to say this game deserves more attention, I have been waiting for a game like this to come out. True there are glithches but with so many options the game give you to solves a problem it is not a surprise. But if you can live with a few bugs it is still a good game. The story is great;You play as you in the body of an officer named Bishop-6 a new and important crew member on ZENLIL a Consortium Command vessel. Your job is to get the crew out of trouble and they get into a lot.You can talk to the crew members wou all have there own unique personalities, and I even uncovered a Hilarious star trek references in a few conversations I had. Love it.I love this game, it isn't perfect but for what it is I can't seem to put it down it is just briliant.Update!/EditHave played the lastest version of Consortium and all the bugs reported when the game first came out have a vanished, and say again this game deserves more attention then it has gotten it is a really brilliant game and the hard work the Devs have put in to fix it up and keep us updated is wonderful. I wish there were more games like this and I can't wait for the next installment of the game.			"

												Awesome game I almost missed out on because the first load took ages and was ready to quit when it finished.The plot, setting, and characters are excellent. You're a traveller to a parallel universe's Earth where you play as a Bishop (lorewise, something between secret agent and one man army) on his first day on duty, aboard a plane called the Zenlil. From the start, you will be exploring highly branching conversation options with many of the crew's members. The only thing I had heard about the gameplay before going in was that ""everything you do has a consequence"", and I found that to be largely true.The somewhat limited duration of the narration means you don't get to know all of the characters in depth; the lower-ranking servicemen in particular can be one-dimensional. For those you do get to know, you learn enough of to really want to see how they'd react to future situations as well. The voice acting is solid throughout.Everything in the graphics department feels source engine-ish. On the bright side, even as a player who will sometimes not play certain games solely because of the graphics, they didn't bother me too much. They got the job done well enough, and there was enough detail put in that they weren't bland.The combat is clunky at best, and is by far the game's weakest point, but its presence does help with the setting, which was lovingly crafted (in that it'd be harder to believe your tough enforcer background without the combat scenes to prove you're as good as they say you are/should be). Also, there's a news article database where you can read articles on the world's lore, many of them simply there for the curious.Overall, this was a very pleasant experience for me. I'd say it's a must-play for anyone looking for a great narrative delivered in a fresh way.			"

												If I had to describe this game in a phrase, I'd say ""kinda like Star Trek on a high-tech jet with Mass Effect dialog options minus persuasion stats."" I could blab about what everyone else has already said, but I'll just say ""ditto"" to what the positive reviews are in agreement about. It's a fun experience. If you are wanting a first person shooter, I can promise you this game will not deliver on that front. You play in first person and there are a couple of parts where you may shoot, but they're pretty weak and not very good. I kinda feel like the game doesn't actually need any first person (or third) shooting at all, but I suppose that might be for the sake of empowerment and a bit of realism. Long story short, the shooting sucks, but that's almost non-existent in the game. I feel like I'm making the game sound bad, but I really liked it and will buy the sequel at launch, if/whenever that might be. The story is great and there seem to be a lot of different options and ways some events can play out. Good stuff!Take note that almost every negative review is about game-stopping bugs that supposedly no longer exist. I didn't encounter any myself now that version 1.2 is out. So think about that when considering those reviews! =)			"

												This game may not look like much to start... but it captures ""role playing"" in a way that I seldom see done well enough. Your conversations feel a little more real and emersive, and the choices you can make can quickly turn a shakey relationship sour, causing not just that character, but others to react differently in entirety, not just a small quip or comment made at somepoint, highlighting your choice for 5 seconds of ""ah ha!"" and then fading into obsurity like nothing really mattered in the end. The characters you interact with all have unique personalities and react like people, not exposition-spouting info logs at your disposal. In the end, I was satisfied with it. It held my interest, made me think, and didn't make me feel like I was being held by the hand and led through a tour. It was an experiece I really enjoyed.			"

												Consortium reminds me of the old school story telling games that you'd spend months or even years replaying. This titles depth caught me by surprise as I missed the hype and only caught the game once it hit steam but even ignoring the then omnious warning from the developers about the games bugs and to avoid purchase, I decided to leap in and take a look, I mean, the devs seemed dedicated so why not, right? And now that most of those are sorted, the game is a real gem.I was delighted with a well scripted, although with some sometimes flat voice acting (perhaps intended?) well laid out plot options and some pretty amazing gameplay during the FPS style scenes. But it does not stop there either, there are so many differing gameplay elements built into the game and melded together so gracefully it's hard to not lace this review with spoilers but I will behave myself and let you enjoy the game for yourself.

												To start:  I love this game.  But, it can be little rough at the moment.I was a backer on this game during Kickstarter, I was very intrigued at the setting, art style, and gameplay premise.  It seemed to be a unique take and full of great new ideas.  In this respect the game did not dissapoint me.  The weighted crew interactions are very well done and I found the voice work to be pretty good.  The first core gameplay centers around conversations with crew members of the Zenlil, navigating dialog trees to increase or decrease approval with different crew members and opening up new lines of inquiry and knowledge.  The second is exploring the Zenlil craft and interacting with it, though in this game it is a bit limited by what the scripting allows.  Third is the FPS combat, and in my particular playthrough it took a backseat, though depending in your actions you could get a lot more.The story and plot started off well and became more and more intrigueing as the game progressed.  It takes place in the future, where your psyche has taken possession of a soldier on the combat aircraft Zenlil of the international Consortium.  Your mind has been sent forward to this realm through a special satellite system presented as a game.  But is it really a game?  What are the true motives of those who control the system?  And what might happen if you try to test the limits of that control?  Play to find out.The world of Consortium is surprisingly deep, and there is an in-game knowledge center for those who really like to dig into the lore.  Multiple in-game hints also indicated that there is an ARG that links to the world that provides more background.  By the end I found myself with a few ""Oh Wow"" moments that really have me looking forward to the second Consortium game. Now for a few negatives.  Despite the tremendous quality of the game from a small indie developer, the many branching pathways and moving parts are pretty complex, and I ran into quite a few bugs right off the bat.  I began playing with the Humble Bundle download version, and it seemed to have several issues with NPC pathing, especially getting stuck in doorways, blocking access and forcing me to start over.  I also ran into situations where the scripting would get out of sync and I would, for example, get caught in a loop where I ended a conversation and then the airplane exploded, only the reload at the last save and explode again.  The solution?  Save, save, save.  Once I got into the old school habit of making an incremental save between different encounters, I was able to work around various issues and continue playing.When I got my key and changed to the Steam version, I noted it seemed to work better and several bugs present in the Humble version were not present.Overall I am extremely pleased with my decision to back these fine folks on Kickstarter and have greatly enjoyed the game.  Those who are not patient enough to deal with progress halting bugs should avoid for now, and await patches which are swiftly being worked on.  The setting is incredibly rich and begs to be expanded in future titles, which I eagerly await.			"

												Consortium is the big boy alternative to the walking simulator.The first thing that is apparent once you start this game is the degree of bone-crushing depth to the world the developers have created. There are dozens of pages of lore contextualizing every character in the plot, every event in the meta-narrative, and the vision of the future created for this game. This is exactly what people of a certain old school demographic in gaming claim to want in an RPG, but it is instead built upon a mediocre Half Life-esque shooter's skeleton.I say that, but there is more than one path to progress through the game in which the player doesn't need to engage in combat at all. In fact, Consortium places gunplay in the back seat, leaving the plot to be the driving force. The more active gameplay is, however, still in the car, unlike other ""games"" lauded for their plot but devoid of anything but the simplest interactivity. There is challenge to the combat, sometimes born of the situations, sometimes born of the tight spaces of the ship or the sheer number of enemies players are expected to deal with in one fight. There are also minigames, most notably a Missle Command-esque game that, while not difficult, is engaging enough. The point is, Consortium, while focused on story, does not shun gameplay, or even the fact that it is a game. There are even dialogue options for players who wish there to be no 4th Wall at all.And the subject of dialogue options brings me to the final point in this game's favour: The degree to which the player shapes the story. Consortium is near the level of Obsidian's Alpha Protocol in terms of the permutations each event can have, and each conversation, no matter how trivial, has at least two different potential statements a player can make. This helps immensely in helping the player engage with the rest of the cast, who are all distinct in personality, and for the most part well acted, even if some performances are clearly better than others.As I said, Consortium is a big boy alternative to the walking simulator; games that use a focus on story as an excuse to be little more than a film with a few QTEs or childishly easy puzzles. It has RPG-level depth at FPS prices and is not ashamed to go into the absolute minutia about the world it seeks to build for future sequels. If those sequels stay true to this game while improving the more combat-oriented approaches, they would deserve consideration alongside the greats in the Science Fiction genre of video games.			"

												A wonky story driven game where you spend all your time on a plane talking to people and occasionally shooting them. The combat is sort of crap but if you want a game with a weird plot that gets weirder the deeper you look into it then give Consortium a try.			"

												This kind of felt like a High Concept game. Other than a few bugs, I found my first playthrough to be very enjoyable. The story and choices were fun aspects. The universe and technology was really interesting. The theme, while initially was a little challenging to follow, turned out to be very facinating. By the time the game was done, I was begging for more. And that's actually where the problem comes in.The game invites you to play it over-and-over, but I couldn't. But the game length wasn't long enough to justify it another play through. Even despite the different narrative choices and the mechancal aspects that intertwine the changing story and gameplay, the overarching story will be the same. And it just feels too samey with the other playthroughs.When the game ended, I was disappointed. It felt like I just finished the very entertaining and scene setting prolog, and it was game over.Other criticisms include the fourth wall being broken; that just never seems to quite work. I want to get immersed in an RPG-like game, I don't want it to point out ""Hey. You're playing a video game!"" - Let me be a part of this beautiful world. I fullly grasp the attempt at the metaplot. But it just didn't work for me.There's so much potential in this game.Ultimately, Consortium creates a beautiful setting, with smart game mechinisms. I would absolutely recommend people play it. But due to short narrative, unsatisifying cliff-hanger, and a few other minor things, I would only suggest picking it up when it is on sale.			"

												A turely immersive wortld backed by a ARG for those who wish to delv deeper into the story (though it isn't required). While the game will will forever have issues due to running on the Source engine that dosen't take away from the amazing creative direction the game offers. The remaining two games in the series will be made with Unreal 4 which should help to aliveate a lot of the issues.For a game that in my opinion should be more popular for what it is, if you love to immersve yourself in a world and play by killing, never firing a shot or never saying a single world this mixes it all. The sequals can only get better.			"

												CONSORTIUM is an odd beast. I can honestly say I had a great time with it, and can tell that the developers put a lot of time, effort, and heart into getting this indie creation to function like it does. I'd compare it favorably to the sections in MASS EFFECT where you just chat it up with your crew on the Normandy, learn a little bit about every one, affect their lives in little ways.In CONSORTIUM, the crew is a lot less diverse (sometimes, I had trouble telling them apart), but the reactivity is absolutely fantastic. Going through the achievements, I can see so many different outcomes to choices that I made half-heartedly at the time. There's a lot of opportunity for replayablilty here. That is if you're on-board with the game's premise of spending 4-5ish hours getting to know its cast of characters in a confined flying command center.If you love the dialog/choice-heavy sections of modern RPGs, here's a great little game that's built entirely around that. As someone who always puts points into charisma in RPGs (I know, I know), CONSORTIUM was right up my alley.It's definitely not perfect. There are entire systems (inventory and ammo management) built around its very clunky combat mechanics, but I can only think of a few times when you have occasion to use your gun. You'll probably see more combat in the combat training scenario than in the rest of the game combined. It gives the impression of a game that's trying to ""check a box"" rather than make it a key part of the experience. It is a-okay to not have combat in a game like this. When CONSORTIUM was at its best, it reminded me of TITANIC: ADVENTURE OUT OF TIME. No combat, intriguing story, interesting characters, worthwhile investigation sections. An all-around great game.There was also a bit of story-bending to an ARG that I didn't know existed, but apparently does. In the moment, I felt a little lost, like there was a crucial part of the story I was missing.Overall, really enjoyed my experience. Confined and relatively brief, though it was, the game is also very dense. I can easily see myself playing through this a couple more times to see different outcomes. Eager to see how Part II of the trilogy eventually plays out!			"

												this is a fun and interesting game, i have wayted a long time for sutch a game.here is my review of it :)-------------------------------------------------------★★★★★★★★☆☆PROS- the artstile is nice and calm and fits the game nicely. but some of the textures should be updated as thay are a little low res- the story is interesting and engaging and you realy feel like you are ther on the ship/plane- GUI is easly understood and easy to use- the voicing is good- no bugs or glitches found other then wade siting in the air insted of his seat :PCONS- the game is too short for the cost of it.one timeline takes abaot 2 -3 hours to complit and thay all end in the same conclusion. you can ofcorse go to the start and take another rout but it all comes to the same, and doing the same thing over and over agen is just boring. this is aperently gone be a trilogy. and since the first game here is soo short i see no reson other then money to have 3 games that are posebly the same lenght------------------------------------------------------------------------i give this game a 8/10 because it is an awesome game and the game experience is a nice one, but the game is just to short for the pricethis is just my opinien.(IF U DISLIKE OR PRESS NOT HELFUL ON THIS REVIEW, PLEASE COMENT ON WHY THIS IS WITH A RESENEBOL ANSWER IF U DO NOT DO THIS I WILL ASUME THAT YOU ARE A FAN BOY/GIRL OR HATER)			"

												Pros:+ Excellent voice acting+ Fairly interesting lore and meta story+ Simple but effective dialogue system+ Potential for completely branching story+ Warrants multiple playthroughs+ Nice sci-fi setting+ Decent graphicsCons:- Combat is so-so (though it can be completely avoided in the main story depending on your actions)- No map system (quite difficult to navigate if you haven't completely memorized the ship's layout)- Can potentially only be an hour or so's entertainment- Long loading times- Some bugs/glitches (though none game-breaking from what I've seen)CONSORTIUM is a strange little experiment which is surprisingly enjoyable. Although I consider it a hidden gem, there are definitely plenty of things that may put other people off. If you're looking for combat, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a short-ish experience with some decent atmosphere, characters and story, I'd say this is worth a look. I got the game for free as part of a free weekend, and I've seen it discounted as low as £2, so I would recommend getting it on sale, as the £6.99 asking price feels a little steep. Also bear in mind that if you're one for satisfying endings, this will most likely disappoint you. The ending is a cliffhanger, leaves lots of unanswered questions, and encourages you to buy the sequel; CONSORTIUM: THE TOWER (which is currently being crowdfunded (the devs have also stated that if it does not meet its target funding then the sequel will be put on hold indefinitely)) when it comes out. At a discounted price, and especially if it's free, CONSORTIUM is well worth your time. "

												To me personally this was an incredibly interesting game. It completely subverted my expectations about it when I started playing it. I am so used to getting into a game, listening to 10-15 min of expostition and story content that isn't developed or focused on again until the end, that when I went past that point with CONSORTIUM I was slightly taken aback and realized that this truly is a story focused RPG. And best of all it managed to hold my attention to the story throughout the whole game, and only games with great stories have managed that (sadly, there aren't too many of those). Perhaps this is only a side effect of the fact the game is unexpectedly short, even the story itself doesn't have a good conclusion. It is very much dependant on a sequel, however it is not yet clear if we are going to get one.The game also has an FPS element to it, which is very much underdeveloped. You have an inventory and equipment system, which you manage throughout the game, so that you will be optimally prepared for combat when the need arises for it. But sadly, that moment doesn't ever come. Not really that is, there are two seperate instances in the game where you can use weapons, in the first one it is clear that the game is pushing you towards the non-violent path. The second one is a bit more mandatory, however you can win that fight simply by waiting it out...CONSORTIUM reminded me of the times when you are aboard the Normandy in the Mass Effect games and you go around talking to your crewmembers, getting to know them and their story and actually progressing the overall story somewhat. I enjoyed that part in the Mass Effect games, it made me connect with the characters. This game only has that part, but it does it so much better. It would appear they also tried to make the combat part, but given how little importance it has I would imagine they simply didn't have the budget for it.There are two major disappointments I have with the game. Firstly, its short lenght, and secondly, the present but never developed FPS portion of the game. Seeing all the possibilities this game has on offer I was starting to think this game would be something truly amazing, with a meaning story that made you care about the characters within it, which would connect all the different missions you would embark upon. However, the sad fact is, the game ends before the first mission truly begins.With that said I can also now reveal that the whole story in the game takes place aboard an airplane (supposedly also a spaceship), and you are fully confined within it throughout the game. All the story elements come from interacting with the people within it (well, almost all), and so it is a good thing that, for the most part, they are well written and voice acted. And with a multitude of dialogue choices and possible story paths there is never a single clear choice to take, there are only the choices you want to make. That is what is most appealing about this game, and it is also what gives it replayability, despite being so heavily story focused. I am a bit disappointed with how it ended and so I won't be replaying it any time soon, only when the sequel comes out (hopefully).Perhaps the game I envisioned after a couple of hours of play could only have been achieved with a large budget, or perhaps we will get that game after all with multiple sequels of this one. Despite this, CONSORTIUM is worth buying and playing, you just need to be prepared for a fully story focused game and you'll enjoy yourself.7 / 10			"

												Consortium is a little bit of an odd duck - the best way I can decribe it is as a 'poor man's Mass Effect'. Both have similar main ships, both have similar multiple choice dialogue systems and both have the choices and consequences of words and actions. Consortium's graphics are very different tho, they sit firmly on the blurred line between serious and cartooney, but I personally like that. I also liked the fact that it felt like you had complete run of the ship, it felt like interactions between yourself and other crew members was more natural and less forced/scripted. I also liked the fact that lots of things were there to discover or not, it didn't really matter.On the downside, I didn't like the fact that once in a while I would feel a bit lost, not helped by the fact that some crew are 'unavailable' for interaction at certain times, without any sort of rhyme and reason. I didn't like the fact that accidently pressing the wrong key meant a conversation (and who knows how much else) was terminated and irretrievable. Even tho I liked that fact that it didn't matter to the game whether you found out stuff or not, I didn't like the fact that I finished my first runthrough with a measly 5 achievements!!All in all, a fun little (short) game with decent graphics, a decent, well thought out story with replay value and a nice little cliffhanger at the end - after all, it IS part one of a planned trilogy!

												This game is basically just a talking decision simulator. So if you want to play the dialogue from Mass Effect, but with less interesting characters, as less interesting story, and only set aboard a single ship for 4 hours, then this is the game for you. The dialogue tree is extensive and choices have impact. The combat is bad and the inventory energy system as well as the weapons don't make much sense, and poorly designed, and don't work they should half the time. The game spends all this time trying to build up this world, but things like king, queen, you, the consortium, are all poorly explained. They seem like they would be touched on in later games but aren't at this point. There are mentions to this being a video game and other things, but this game raises tons of questions and answers none of them. The murder mystery, 2/3 of the game, isn't solved at the end. Game ends right before your first actual mission. Short, kind of boring, and highly unfinished. Good dialogue system though. 5.5/10			"

												Haven't finished the game yet, but I want to write this review to say this game deserves more attention, I have been waiting for a game like this to come out. True there are glithches but with so many options the game give you to solves a problem it is not a surprise. But if you can live with a few bugs it is still a good game. The story is great;You play as you in the body of an officer named Bishop-6 a new and important crew member on ZENLIL a Consortium Command vessel. Your job is to get the crew out of trouble and they get into a lot.You can talk to the crew members wou all have there own unique personalities, and I even uncovered a Hilarious star trek references in a few conversations I had. Love it.I love this game, it isn't perfect but for what it is I can't seem to put it down it is just briliant.Update!/EditHave played the lastest version of Consortium and all the bugs reported when the game first came out have a vanished, and say again this game deserves more attention then it has gotten it is a really brilliant game and the hard work the Devs have put in to fix it up and keep us updated is wonderful. I wish there were more games like this and I can't wait for the next installment of the game.			"

												After reading almost all of the discoveries and completing 4 or 5 streams over the past few months since the game was released, I'm still finding out new things. Well done guys, well done! I wish they had a budget of a couple of tens of millions of Euros and be able to make a sequel whithin a year since the initial release, a TV series, a movie, comic book series... So many things to explore!And trust me, I'm both a Marketing BSc(Econ) and a veteran gamer.In the coming months I'll be sure to hop on the Zenlil a few more times.			"

												The best mystery solving game I've played. The dialogue is pretty good overall, the choices are varied and very rarely I found myself chosing an option that resulted in the opposite of what I intended. The game mechanics are simple and the game has great replayability, as you won't see all it has to offer on the first playthrough. The sci-fi world it puts you into is quite decent, and the voice acting is actually great; pretty impressive for an indie game and much better than big budget games. I'm glad to have backed this on KickStarter!			"

												If I had to describe this game in a phrase, I'd say ""kinda like Star Trek on a high-tech jet with Mass Effect dialog options minus persuasion stats."" I could blab about what everyone else has already said, but I'll just say ""ditto"" to what the positive reviews are in agreement about. It's a fun experience. If you are wanting a first person shooter, I can promise you this game will not deliver on that front. You play in first person and there are a couple of parts where you may shoot, but they're pretty weak and not very good. I kinda feel like the game doesn't actually need any first person (or third) shooting at all, but I suppose that might be for the sake of empowerment and a bit of realism. Long story short, the shooting sucks, but that's almost non-existent in the game. I feel like I'm making the game sound bad, but I really liked it and will buy the sequel at launch, if/whenever that might be. The story is great and there seem to be a lot of different options and ways some events can play out. Good stuff!Take note that almost every negative review is about game-stopping bugs that supposedly no longer exist. I didn't encounter any myself now that version 1.2 is out. So think about that when considering those reviews! =)			"

												CONSORTIUM is an odd beast. I can honestly say I had a great time with it, and can tell that the developers put a lot of time, effort, and heart into getting this indie creation to function like it does. I'd compare it favorably to the sections in MASS EFFECT where you just chat it up with your crew on the Normandy, learn a little bit about every one, affect their lives in little ways.In CONSORTIUM, the crew is a lot less diverse (sometimes, I had trouble telling them apart), but the reactivity is absolutely fantastic. Going through the achievements, I can see so many different outcomes to choices that I made half-heartedly at the time. There's a lot of opportunity for replayablilty here. That is if you're on-board with the game's premise of spending 4-5ish hours getting to know its cast of characters in a confined flying command center.If you love the dialog/choice-heavy sections of modern RPGs, here's a great little game that's built entirely around that. As someone who always puts points into charisma in RPGs (I know, I know), CONSORTIUM was right up my alley.It's definitely not perfect. There are entire systems (inventory and ammo management) built around its very clunky combat mechanics, but I can only think of a few times when you have occasion to use your gun. You'll probably see more combat in the combat training scenario than in the rest of the game combined. It gives the impression of a game that's trying to ""check a box"" rather than make it a key part of the experience. It is a-okay to not have combat in a game like this. When CONSORTIUM was at its best, it reminded me of TITANIC: ADVENTURE OUT OF TIME. No combat, intriguing story, interesting characters, worthwhile investigation sections. An all-around great game.There was also a bit of story-bending to an ARG that I didn't know existed, but apparently does. In the moment, I felt a little lost, like there was a crucial part of the story I was missing.Overall, really enjoyed my experience. Confined and relatively brief, though it was, the game is also very dense. I can easily see myself playing through this a couple more times to see different outcomes. Eager to see how Part II of the trilogy eventually plays out!			"

												Pros:+ Excellent voice acting+ Fairly interesting lore and meta story+ Simple but effective dialogue system+ Potential for completely branching story+ Warrants multiple playthroughs+ Nice sci-fi setting+ Decent graphicsCons:- Combat is so-so (though it can be completely avoided in the main story depending on your actions)- No map system (quite difficult to navigate if you haven't completely memorized the ship's layout)- Can potentially only be an hour or so's entertainment- Long loading times- Some bugs/glitches (though none game-breaking from what I've seen)CONSORTIUM is a strange little experiment which is surprisingly enjoyable. Although I consider it a hidden gem, there are definitely plenty of things that may put other people off. If you're looking for combat, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a short-ish experience with some decent atmosphere, characters and story, I'd say this is worth a look. I got the game for free as part of a free weekend, and I've seen it discounted as low as £2, so I would recommend getting it on sale, as the £6.99 asking price feels a little steep. Also bear in mind that if you're one for satisfying endings, this will most likely disappoint you. The ending is a cliffhanger, leaves lots of unanswered questions, and encourages you to buy the sequel; CONSORTIUM: THE TOWER (which is currently being crowdfunded (the devs have also stated that if it does not meet its target funding then the sequel will be put on hold indefinitely)) when it comes out. At a discounted price, and especially if it's free, CONSORTIUM is well worth your time. "

												Very interesting game, with a few issues with it. Very unimpressive graphics wise, some voice actors did a mediocre job at best. Story is decent, what impressed me the most was the tone it managed to set through subtle shifts in mood. In certain parts of the game, I felt very creeped out by small things. Thankfully, it does not pull a FNAF and leave the small parts up to interpretation and lets the player learn it very quickly. I would love to see the sequel, and hope the game recieves much better designers and voice actors for it.			"

												This game blows me away with its story telling. Never before have I seen a game so changable through player action. I truly felt like I was making my own universe as I played through the game.Gun fights have good mechanics, but the actual shooting game play is a bit lack luster, but this doesnt take away from the experiance the game is trying to deliver.Over all I give this game a 8/10, bleeding 1 point for the shooting sections, and 1 point as the game is a bit short. But what is here is very much worth the price on admition.			"

												This is a game that can easily be beaten in 5 hours or less. It would be more accurate to call this the first episode out of three than the first game out of three. The reason I say this is that there is one set of issues to be resolved in this first game in an overall arc.While to me it is a design choice, I feel that where they cut off this game from the next is probably in the wrong spot. Its like TV series that put cliffhangers in seasons when you have no idea if they will get approved for a second season. Instead they should have had it concluded with this arc all wrapped up and mostly just hinting at what comes in the next games.The graphics and voice acting for this game are very hit or miss. If you know the original Deus Ex, you have the idea. Complaints aside, this was actually a pretty fun game. It allows for multiple resolutions to situations and creating circumstances that are affected by past choices. The dialogue is at times funny and the gameply entertaining.Overall, I would say at $20 it may be a bit steep, but still worth the price. If it is on sale then it is a definite buy in my opinion if you like games with little combat and mostly npc interaction.			"

												This game is honestly one of the best I've played in a while. Sure there were A LOT of bugs (some of which were game breaking) but they were eventually fixed.Storywise it starts out making little sense, but as you get into it and begin learning about the characters and kind of the story of the world it starts to make sense and gets more and more interesting. Some events within the game leave you wondering what's going on as much as the characters in the game do...and I don't find that to be a bad thing. This game is one of those that makes a lack of info about the goings on a major part of game and does so to great effect.It's one of those few where certain characters within are aware they are in a game, and crack jokes about it as result. I love it when games make fun of the fact that they are games. Don't ask me why I don't know.:PAnyway, Do I recommend this game? Hell yea I do. :)Also I've played this game via other means for much longer than the 12 minutes Steam says I have.			"

												A very fun game to play, it tests what sort of person you are in subtle ways like what weapon you use will affect large portions of story. If you love stories that are changed by lots of choices then this is the game for you. My only complaint is the combat seems to cause my fps to drop by a large amount although the rest of the game runs perfectly, I probably just have one of the settings wrong or something. The atmosphere in the game is very immersive. It can also be quite creepy, for example, getting stuck in the crawl and the lights go out. All in all a very good game that I am going to go and play now so bye!			"

												Tl;Dr -  A good game with a lot of potential with interesting writing and world building marred by poor combat.  Unfortunately felt like an incomplete experience that ended far too soon. Consortium is at heart an adventure/rpg tasking players with finding who the traitor is aboard an airsip and bringing them to justice.  The premise alone sounds interesting but the problem is unlike both RPGs and adventure games items in the game world are essentially just fodder to be recycled to provide power for your armor.  Despite a few times the game tryign to bring attention to certain items, at no point could they be picked up and examined making rifling through people's storage lockers and whatnot pretty pointless.  At no point did I feel like I was a detective trying to get to the bottom is a mystery but rather just going around having a casual chat with murder suspects with no actual ability to dig deeper and snoop around their personal belongings to try to contradict their stories.  As a matter of fact most snooping and gathering of information is taken from a newsfeed console that works like a text based ""Her Story"".  Keywords are used to search for documents and those can be read and new keywords attempted to piece together background and knowledge about characters in the world.While I liked this in Her Story I found it rather tedious in Consortium.  On the one hand, yeah it's nice to have an abundant amount of lore I can read through and learn from but on the other hand...the console isn't very well explained.  Half of the...articles?  Documents?  Whatever I'm supposed to call them are sometimes written as though they were intended to be actual posted texts and other times are written with action cues in them as if they were works of fiction or we were expected to imagine we were watching a video.  This confused tone gave the overall experience a bit of a amateurish vibe as if they weren't quite sure what they really wanted to do with with console research...so they did everything with it.  Also many documents you can search for are obviously meant to be top secret yet anyone and everyone can pull them up with relatively mundane search terms in terminals found in common areas.  I would of rather much of this information be put into the actual game world such as a paper in someone's locker or personal computer or find some notes that lead me to think they have a background in programming, search under someone's bed and find some other tidbit of information...you know...actually doing stuff with the game world.  Trying to pick up a book or examine something will simply destroy the item and recycle it's energy to power your armor as stated before which...is...mostly pointless.  It seems strange so many junk items are littered around the cramped spaces of the plane when the game has only two or maybe three combat encounters total.It also doesn't help that when these sparse combat situations happen the FPS elements are clearly lacking.   The entire experience felt as if this game had come from a past generation where early full 3D FPSes were just stepping out of Wolfenstien 3D's primordial FPS ooze.  Gunplay lacks finesse with mindless enemies running at you guns blazing with no real use of cover or indication that the people you are fighting are real people (a story trope that is hammered in a few times) but rather mindless drones sent at you like so many Doom Imps from times of yore.  You are given essentially a lethal and non lethal method of dealing with enemies but without a system in place to aid in actual non lethal combat it becomes an excercise in tedium.  Instead of methodically taking down enemies trying not to alert the hive, you're stuck with a gun having to charge blasts that may or may not take down an enemy down with very little to no feedback as to what's working and why.  Once and enemy is downed you're expected to run over to them and knock them out completely before they manage to get back up lending even more tedium to an already horrible system.  While you are given a generous amount of time to get this done, it's still very likely you're going to have to charge into the middle of the battle to try to snag all the enemies at once before they get back up leaving the rest to keep shooting you.  It's an utterly unrewarding experiance they were better off scrapping from the game entirely.Thankfully the combat is the least important part of the game as you spend most of your time wandering the plane and getting to know it's crew.  This is the meat of the gameplay and is actually done pretty well. You're expected to respond to people in a timely manner and just about everything you say is remembered and has some degree of impact later on giving a pretty good illusion of dealing with real people.  This attention to detail does come back to bite the game as you are often given a limited set of responces and have found on some occations the only sensible option was to stand there awkwardly and say nothing at all.  It's a shame the world itself wasn't given this degree of treatment as I think they could of crafted something rather special.  Each character's opinion of you is tracked seperately though I have yet to actually see this make any kind of major difference other than an indication of if they like you or not.  Only the officers in the ship seem to actually matter as you spend most of your time talking and consulting with them and some Consortium characters only appear for literally a single conversation (yet their approval is still tracked).  Replaying this game is pretty much mandatory as your first run will mostly be spent trying to figure out what the game wants from you and what you can actually do in the world to effect events going on; while this is all very well and good a full third of the game is tedious tutorial things that was interesting only the first time through yet were unskippable since.  In the end my lack of a recommendaiton came down to one thing;  The original demo for Deus Ex.  You see, throughout the entire game I kept mentally likening this to Deus Ex.  The RPG/FPS elements, the clunkiness of how just about everything works yet is not quite clunky enough to make me want to stop playing and, quite frankly, the very similar plot lines.  Deus Ex was one of my favorite games growing up and I remember being impressed by the size and length of it's demo...which was about as long as this entire game. Suffice to say I can't recommend a game that bills itself as a complete product when it's clearly geared to be an episodic release.  I have to admit the game started off on a bad foot with me when I booted it up, was immediatley told of the kickstarter for the ""direct continuation"".  So I just got this game and now you want funding for chapter two?  The entire plot of the game felt like it was leading to this long and epic storyline that never came.  The game just ended...on a cliffhanger no less.  A cliffhanger whose conclusion they now want me to go fund out of my pocket so I can go buy the second episode of this game.This has a lot of potential and I could gladly overlook all of the negative aspects if I felt I was given a complete game.  Unfortunately by the time I first saw those credits roll, my reaction wasn't ""Man that was awesome"", it was ""You have to be kidding me  All that buildup to the first actual mission in the game it wasn't even IN THE GAME.""  Perhaps if the plot was packaged differently and I didn't feel as though I was just railroaded into the next purchase I would be recommending this, but as it stands I just feel disappointed the game fell short of it's potential.

												Haven't finished the game yet, but I want to write this review to say this game deserves more attention, I have been waiting for a game like this to come out. True there are glithches but with so many options the game give you to solves a problem it is not a surprise. But if you can live with a few bugs it is still a good game. The story is great;You play as you in the body of an officer named Bishop-6 a new and important crew member on ZENLIL a Consortium Command vessel. Your job is to get the crew out of trouble and they get into a lot.You can talk to the crew members wou all have there own unique personalities, and I even uncovered a Hilarious star trek references in a few conversations I had. Love it.I love this game, it isn't perfect but for what it is I can't seem to put it down it is just briliant.Update!/EditHave played the lastest version of Consortium and all the bugs reported when the game first came out have a vanished, and say again this game deserves more attention then it has gotten it is a really brilliant game and the hard work the Devs have put in to fix it up and keep us updated is wonderful. I wish there were more games like this and I can't wait for the next installment of the game.			"

												After reading almost all of the discoveries and completing 4 or 5 streams over the past few months since the game was released, I'm still finding out new things. Well done guys, well done! I wish they had a budget of a couple of tens of millions of Euros and be able to make a sequel whithin a year since the initial release, a TV series, a movie, comic book series... So many things to explore!And trust me, I'm both a Marketing BSc(Econ) and a veteran gamer.In the coming months I'll be sure to hop on the Zenlil a few more times.			"

												Update: This review is old, from when the game came out.  The developer has asked me to play their game again since all the initial bugs are gone.Posted on January 12, 2014:Yes it has bugs, but the story is so good, it didnt really bother me.  I played the game from beginning to end and I was hooked on the storytelling.  The game is like a mixture of Telltale games Storytelling and enjoyable FPS'ing.  In this first portion of the game it was very story driven.  There were some fights, and the game has some glitches that are annoying and it has some bugs that♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... But if the developers fix all of this, you are going to have a very enjoyable and different game experience.			"

												If I had to describe this game in a phrase, I'd say ""kinda like Star Trek on a high-tech jet with Mass Effect dialog options minus persuasion stats."" I could blab about what everyone else has already said, but I'll just say ""ditto"" to what the positive reviews are in agreement about. It's a fun experience. If you are wanting a first person shooter, I can promise you this game will not deliver on that front. You play in first person and there are a couple of parts where you may shoot, but they're pretty weak and not very good. I kinda feel like the game doesn't actually need any first person (or third) shooting at all, but I suppose that might be for the sake of empowerment and a bit of realism. Long story short, the shooting sucks, but that's almost non-existent in the game. I feel like I'm making the game sound bad, but I really liked it and will buy the sequel at launch, if/whenever that might be. The story is great and there seem to be a lot of different options and ways some events can play out. Good stuff!Take note that almost every negative review is about game-stopping bugs that supposedly no longer exist. I didn't encounter any myself now that version 1.2 is out. So think about that when considering those reviews! =)			"

												This game may not look like much to start... but it captures ""role playing"" in a way that I seldom see done well enough. Your conversations feel a little more real and emersive, and the choices you can make can quickly turn a shakey relationship sour, causing not just that character, but others to react differently in entirety, not just a small quip or comment made at somepoint, highlighting your choice for 5 seconds of ""ah ha!"" and then fading into obsurity like nothing really mattered in the end. The characters you interact with all have unique personalities and react like people, not exposition-spouting info logs at your disposal. In the end, I was satisfied with it. It held my interest, made me think, and didn't make me feel like I was being held by the hand and led through a tour. It was an experiece I really enjoyed.			"

												The best mystery solving game I've played. The dialogue is pretty good overall, the choices are varied and very rarely I found myself chosing an option that resulted in the opposite of what I intended. The game mechanics are simple and the game has great replayability, as you won't see all it has to offer on the first playthrough. The sci-fi world it puts you into is quite decent, and the voice acting is actually great; pretty impressive for an indie game and much better than big budget games. I'm glad to have backed this on KickStarter!			"

												To start:  I love this game.  But, it can be little rough at the moment.I was a backer on this game during Kickstarter, I was very intrigued at the setting, art style, and gameplay premise.  It seemed to be a unique take and full of great new ideas.  In this respect the game did not dissapoint me.  The weighted crew interactions are very well done and I found the voice work to be pretty good.  The first core gameplay centers around conversations with crew members of the Zenlil, navigating dialog trees to increase or decrease approval with different crew members and opening up new lines of inquiry and knowledge.  The second is exploring the Zenlil craft and interacting with it, though in this game it is a bit limited by what the scripting allows.  Third is the FPS combat, and in my particular playthrough it took a backseat, though depending in your actions you could get a lot more.The story and plot started off well and became more and more intrigueing as the game progressed.  It takes place in the future, where your psyche has taken possession of a soldier on the combat aircraft Zenlil of the international Consortium.  Your mind has been sent forward to this realm through a special satellite system presented as a game.  But is it really a game?  What are the true motives of those who control the system?  And what might happen if you try to test the limits of that control?  Play to find out.The world of Consortium is surprisingly deep, and there is an in-game knowledge center for those who really like to dig into the lore.  Multiple in-game hints also indicated that there is an ARG that links to the world that provides more background.  By the end I found myself with a few ""Oh Wow"" moments that really have me looking forward to the second Consortium game. Now for a few negatives.  Despite the tremendous quality of the game from a small indie developer, the many branching pathways and moving parts are pretty complex, and I ran into quite a few bugs right off the bat.  I began playing with the Humble Bundle download version, and it seemed to have several issues with NPC pathing, especially getting stuck in doorways, blocking access and forcing me to start over.  I also ran into situations where the scripting would get out of sync and I would, for example, get caught in a loop where I ended a conversation and then the airplane exploded, only the reload at the last save and explode again.  The solution?  Save, save, save.  Once I got into the old school habit of making an incremental save between different encounters, I was able to work around various issues and continue playing.When I got my key and changed to the Steam version, I noted it seemed to work better and several bugs present in the Humble version were not present.Overall I am extremely pleased with my decision to back these fine folks on Kickstarter and have greatly enjoyed the game.  Those who are not patient enough to deal with progress halting bugs should avoid for now, and await patches which are swiftly being worked on.  The setting is incredibly rich and begs to be expanded in future titles, which I eagerly await.			"

												Consortium is the big boy alternative to the walking simulator.The first thing that is apparent once you start this game is the degree of bone-crushing depth to the world the developers have created. There are dozens of pages of lore contextualizing every character in the plot, every event in the meta-narrative, and the vision of the future created for this game. This is exactly what people of a certain old school demographic in gaming claim to want in an RPG, but it is instead built upon a mediocre Half Life-esque shooter's skeleton.I say that, but there is more than one path to progress through the game in which the player doesn't need to engage in combat at all. In fact, Consortium places gunplay in the back seat, leaving the plot to be the driving force. The more active gameplay is, however, still in the car, unlike other ""games"" lauded for their plot but devoid of anything but the simplest interactivity. There is challenge to the combat, sometimes born of the situations, sometimes born of the tight spaces of the ship or the sheer number of enemies players are expected to deal with in one fight. There are also minigames, most notably a Missle Command-esque game that, while not difficult, is engaging enough. The point is, Consortium, while focused on story, does not shun gameplay, or even the fact that it is a game. There are even dialogue options for players who wish there to be no 4th Wall at all.And the subject of dialogue options brings me to the final point in this game's favour: The degree to which the player shapes the story. Consortium is near the level of Obsidian's Alpha Protocol in terms of the permutations each event can have, and each conversation, no matter how trivial, has at least two different potential statements a player can make. This helps immensely in helping the player engage with the rest of the cast, who are all distinct in personality, and for the most part well acted, even if some performances are clearly better than others.As I said, Consortium is a big boy alternative to the walking simulator; games that use a focus on story as an excuse to be little more than a film with a few QTEs or childishly easy puzzles. It has RPG-level depth at FPS prices and is not ashamed to go into the absolute minutia about the world it seeks to build for future sequels. If those sequels stay true to this game while improving the more combat-oriented approaches, they would deserve consideration alongside the greats in the Science Fiction genre of video games.			"

												Consortium reminds me of the old school story telling games that you'd spend months or even years replaying. This titles depth caught me by surprise as I missed the hype and only caught the game once it hit steam but even ignoring the then omnious warning from the developers about the games bugs and to avoid purchase, I decided to leap in and take a look, I mean, the devs seemed dedicated so why not, right? And now that most of those are sorted, the game is a real gem.I was delighted with a well scripted, although with some sometimes flat voice acting (perhaps intended?) well laid out plot options and some pretty amazing gameplay during the FPS style scenes. But it does not stop there either, there are so many differing gameplay elements built into the game and melded together so gracefully it's hard to not lace this review with spoilers but I will behave myself and let you enjoy the game for yourself.

												Other than some crashes when attempting to load saved games, I highly enjoyed my experience so far.  I haven't played as many hours as shown.  I would minimize and do other things.  I retained it during the free to play weekend so for free it definitely rocks!  I've read it is short in other reviews.  But it didn't take long to become interested in this ""future world.""  I will post an update on the length after finishing it.  However, so far I highly recommend (if you enjoy a hybrid game of FPS, RPG, and some 2D style point and click for using the ships weapons) to snag this game.  It's worth at least $10 USD, pending the length $20 perhaps.			"

												I had my doubts about this game - there is quite a lot of negative reviews regarding game's performance, mechanics, stability. But during the last winter sale I've decided to give it a try. And the only thing I regret is not playing it earlier.It may not be a game for everyone. There are games that are longer, prettier, even deeper. But what ""Consortium"" IS - it's a great role-playing game. Not in the sense of tweaking your character's characteristics, but rather of living another life, while remaining yourself (literally - you are playing as yourself, only after being implanted into a different body). You choose your own actions and behavior, line of actions - and face the consequences.  Act kindly, aggressively, funny, try to flirt or impose discipline - and see the crew of Zenlil-2 react. You can even choose to reveal your true identity. Or act neturally, learning of how this new world works and adapting to its rules.Second part of the game is coming to KS soon - and I myself am waiting for a possibility to live in that world a bit more.

												SHORT REVIEW:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A absolutley wonderful game! I was lucky enough to start playing once the final patch was released, so I experience little to no bugs. CONSORTIUM is based in the year 2042 or something like that. You take control of Bishop 6, which at first, you know nothing about. If you make certain choices, you may never know about his past. I love this game, you can choose from so many paths that will ultimatly lead to one ending and one ending only. Although the ending dissapointed me, because I really don't like waiting for sequels and the way they ended CONSORTIUM leaves the player thinking about his choices that he had made, what he should go back change, and it also leaves the player craving more. Well, atleast it left me craving more. The developers said that the first public release about the next CONSORTIUM is going to be released very soon. You may not be able to tell, but I am VERY excited.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Rating: 9/10 One of the most replayable, and enjoyable games since ever!

												Undertale got popular for promoting itself as a critique of irrational violence, but for me its approach was done first in Consortium.It was so refreshing to have real, demonstrable moral options for your protagonist's actions. The pathway to pacifism is not obvious either: like Undertale it takes careful consideration of the motives and background of your antagonists. Unlike Undertale the lore of Consortium is deeply and richly detailed, with pages upon pages of news reports, intelligence analysis, character briefings, transcriptions, etc etc.Imagine if Undertale grew up. That's Consortium.			"

												A beautifully well-written game. It throws you in the deep end plot-wise, but that is actually a plus for this game as you work out just what kind of situation in. Quickly into the plot, it develops into mysterious and, for once, actually believable mystery game. The one (or two, depending on your choices, I hear) proper shooting sequence has mechanics decent enough to make it enjoyable and I assume it's a taste test for the sequel, which will likely have more. Kudos to the developer for making the mystery cohesive and giving the player a truly stumping series of events. I only got it right because I noticed the culprit doing some dodgy acts before the investigation. The culprit was believable and I did not find myself irritated by any cliches. The plotline thankfully avoids many, many cliches. It is also brilliantly well acted, and the variance of accents really gives it a feeling of a futuristic, almost united world. The plot also reminds me of 1984, and gives the player perfect reason to support any of the factions (or neither, like me). I find most games flop when they try to write as intricate plot as this, either falling into cliche or simply being way too over its head to be coherent or well written. This game, however, does it well and gets a high reccomendation from me. A little short, but still well worth the investment. Can't wait for the sequel.By the way, your choices change a lot. Unlike most games *cough cough* Telltale's Game of Thrones *cough cough*, every choice is significant and you also know when a significant decision must be made. You understand the severity of the events at all time and the game throughout is very intense. I'm so glad this game did its choices and consequences right.			"

I retained it during the free to play weekend so for free it definitely rocks!  I've read it is short in other reviews.  But it didn't take long to become interested in this ""future world.""  I will post an update on the length after finishing it.  However, so far I highly recommend (if you enjoy a hybrid game of FPS, RPG, and some 2D style point and click for using the ships weapons) to snag this game.  It's worth at least $10 USD, pending the length $20 perhaps.			"

												Aweful, aweful game. First playthrough expect to spend *alot* of time in the dark, literally and metaphorically. Some objectives are very vague, some are so easy to fail simply because you didn't notice something, some seem to be impossible to pass. Examples, I was told to ""defend the crew"", shot or incapacitated maybe 8 attackers, 2 of them standing infront of a wall yelling but not moving, searched the entire plane and couldn't find anyone else, objective is still the same 15 mins later. Ummm... huh? Reload game from the last auto save, this time 12 attackers where I found the first 8 and I move on. Okay so major bugs in that mission that they didn't fix.Another mission I am supposed to rescue the pilot when he is at risk of being electrocuted. Objective says to go through the access point in the cockpit. I do that and people are yelling ""help him! quick! get out of there!"" I look around, it's a small room with an access door that I came through and a door to the infirmary where some of the people are yelling, but the door is locked. I think ""okay, they already got him to the infirmary and I am supposed to go there. I go back through the cockpit and people really freak out. ""Go back in there and help him!"" Except now the access point is locked. Oooookay? what was that about? Second playthrough I find out he is in the corner of that small room. That would have been nice to know before you wasted my time.Another easy to fail mission because they didn't make things clear, those 8 attackers that I said I found in that mission? That was technically my second time playing that mission. the first time I was told to follow a crew member to a weapons lockup. she walks 20 feet and a door opens, she turns and looks at me, I walk through the door, it closes and locks behind me. Huh? she didn't follow? where are my weapons? The objectives just read ""protect the crew"" and tell me to go to the hanger bay. I go there, unarmed, and think alright I'm supposed to knock out an attacker and take his gun. nope, punching them does nothing. I spend another 5 mins searching for that mysterious weapons catch I was promised, no where to be found. Reload, Oh! she was walking up to (and blocking) a small panel built into the wall with some weapons, and I'm not supposed to go through the door, just wait until she opens it. lame.Finally a mission that I'm apparently not supposed to succeed? I'm supposed to convince the pilot that there is a virus in the system. Ok, easy! Except when I get the mission I am standing next to the cockpit door and it is locked. A woman walks in and locks it behind her again. You can see through a ""window"" to one side and they are making out, they tell you to go away and there is nothing else to do. The woman doesn't come out until you leave the area, and when you return the pilot is already down below where he gets electrocuted, so you are notified that you failed the mission. Oookay? So why is that even a mission?Oh yeah, so as for being in the dark literally, for some reason you spend at least 30% of the game in near or total darkness because the lights are malfunctioning. As you can imagine, that makes it a bit difficult to navigate the ship, especially with out a map, since sometimes you have no idea if you are even moving or just stuck at a poorly made doorway that you have to walk at just right to walk through.Now a word on game length. I've played through twice. 7 hours on record. The first playthrough took over 5 irritating hours of being left in the dark wondering ""what am I supposed  to be doing?"" Which means the second playthrough, now that I know what I'm doing, only took 2 hours even though I tried different options and unlocked some things that either weren't available or simply bugged during the first playthrough.Finally, the game has a few bugs. Some of them irrelevant, like the pilot saying that he is going to check some systems, you go into the cockpit and he is sitting in the air acting like he is pushing buttons 5 feet from his chair. Some of the glitches halt your progress, like the 2 enemies staring at and pointing their guns at the wall while yelling at you then nobody else shows up and you can't move on.Overall, a terrible game. I'll try it once or twice more to make sure I'm not missing something major that caused others to give this game a high rating, but it looks like it's a waste of time.			"

												Tl;Dr -  A good game with a lot of potential with interesting writing and world building marred by poor combat.  Unfortunately felt like an incomplete experience that ended far too soon. Consortium is at heart an adventure/rpg tasking players with finding who the traitor is aboard an airsip and bringing them to justice.  The premise alone sounds interesting but the problem is unlike both RPGs and adventure games items in the game world are essentially just fodder to be recycled to provide power for your armor.  Despite a few times the game tryign to bring attention to certain items, at no point could they be picked up and examined making rifling through people's storage lockers and whatnot pretty pointless.  At no point did I feel like I was a detective trying to get to the bottom is a mystery but rather just going around having a casual chat with murder suspects with no actual ability to dig deeper and snoop around their personal belongings to try to contradict their stories.  As a matter of fact most snooping and gathering of information is taken from a newsfeed console that works like a text based ""Her Story"".  Keywords are used to search for documents and those can be read and new keywords attempted to piece together background and knowledge about characters in the world.While I liked this in Her Story I found it rather tedious in Consortium.  On the one hand, yeah it's nice to have an abundant amount of lore I can read through and learn from but on the other hand...the console isn't very well explained.  Half of the...articles?  Documents?  Whatever I'm supposed to call them are sometimes written as though they were intended to be actual posted texts and other times are written with action cues in them as if they were works of fiction or we were expected to imagine we were watching a video.  This confused tone gave the overall experience a bit of a amateurish vibe as if they weren't quite sure what they really wanted to do with with console research...so they did everything with it.  Also many documents you can search for are obviously meant to be top secret yet anyone and everyone can pull them up with relatively mundane search terms in terminals found in common areas.  I would of rather much of this information be put into the actual game world such as a paper in someone's locker or personal computer or find some notes that lead me to think they have a background in programming, search under someone's bed and find some other tidbit of information...you know...actually doing stuff with the game world.  Trying to pick up a book or examine something will simply destroy the item and recycle it's energy to power your armor as stated before which...is...mostly pointless.  It seems strange so many junk items are littered around the cramped spaces of the plane when the game has only two or maybe three combat encounters total.It also doesn't help that when these sparse combat situations happen the FPS elements are clearly lacking.   The entire experience felt as if this game had come from a past generation where early full 3D FPSes were just stepping out of Wolfenstien 3D's primordial FPS ooze.  Gunplay lacks finesse with mindless enemies running at you guns blazing with no real use of cover or indication that the people you are fighting are real people (a story trope that is hammered in a few times) but rather mindless drones sent at you like so many Doom Imps from times of yore.  You are given essentially a lethal and non lethal method of dealing with enemies but without a system in place to aid in actual non lethal combat it becomes an excercise in tedium.  Instead of methodically taking down enemies trying not to alert the hive, you're stuck with a gun having to charge blasts that may or may not take down an enemy down with very little to no feedback as to what's working and why.  Once and enemy is downed you're expected to run over to them and knock them out completely before they manage to get back up lending even more tedium to an already horrible system.  While you are given a generous amount of time to get this done, it's still very likely you're going to have to charge into the middle of the battle to try to snag all the enemies at once before they get back up leaving the rest to keep shooting you.  It's an utterly unrewarding experiance they were better off scrapping from the game entirely.Thankfully the combat is the least important part of the game as you spend most of your time wandering the plane and getting to know it's crew.  This is the meat of the gameplay and is actually done pretty well. You're expected to respond to people in a timely manner and just about everything you say is remembered and has some degree of impact later on giving a pretty good illusion of dealing with real people.  This attention to detail does come back to bite the game as you are often given a limited set of responces and have found on some occations the only sensible option was to stand there awkwardly and say nothing at all.  It's a shame the world itself wasn't given this degree of treatment as I think they could of crafted something rather special.  Each character's opinion of you is tracked seperately though I have yet to actually see this make any kind of major difference other than an indication of if they like you or not.  Only the officers in the ship seem to actually matter as you spend most of your time talking and consulting with them and some Consortium characters only appear for literally a single conversation (yet their approval is still tracked).  Replaying this game is pretty much mandatory as your first run will mostly be spent trying to figure out what the game wants from you and what you can actually do in the world to effect events going on; while this is all very well and good a full third of the game is tedious tutorial things that was interesting only the first time through yet were unskippable since.  In the end my lack of a recommendaiton came down to one thing;  The original demo for Deus Ex.  You see, throughout the entire game I kept mentally likening this to Deus Ex.  The RPG/FPS elements, the clunkiness of how just about everything works yet is not quite clunky enough to make me want to stop playing and, quite frankly, the very similar plot lines.  Deus Ex was one of my favorite games growing up and I remember being impressed by the size and length of it's demo...which was about as long as this entire game. Suffice to say I can't recommend a game that bills itself as a complete product when it's clearly geared to be an episodic release.  I have to admit the game started off on a bad foot with me when I booted it up, was immediatley told of the kickstarter for the ""direct continuation"".  So I just got this game and now you want funding for chapter two?  The entire plot of the game felt like it was leading to this long and epic storyline that never came.  The game just ended...on a cliffhanger no less.  A cliffhanger whose conclusion they now want me to go fund out of my pocket so I can go buy the second episode of this game.This has a lot of potential and I could gladly overlook all of the negative aspects if I felt I was given a complete game.  Unfortunately by the time I first saw those credits roll, my reaction wasn't ""Man that was awesome"", it was ""You have to be kidding me  All that buildup to the first actual mission in the game it wasn't even IN THE GAME.""  Perhaps if the plot was packaged differently and I didn't feel as though I was just railroaded into the next purchase I would be recommending this, but as it stands I just feel disappointed the game fell short of it's potential.

												When I saw this game being free for a weekend I thought to myself ""Probably another mediocre, sci-fi Shooter"". After finishing this game in one session, I realized that I couldn't have been more wrong.CONSORTIUM is best compaired with story-rich First Person games like the original Deus Ex or the Mass Effect series. First, I'll get to the games strongest points. The Story is kinda weird, but in an awesome way. You make up your own background story, your seekings and how your attitude. Since you are in an to you unknown world, this leads to some comical missunderstanding, both showing a great humor and sometimes breaking the 4th wall. There are also no cutscenes in this game, never robbing you of its control and always being able to decide whether you want to be nice to someone, ♥♥♥♥ them off, just walk away from a conversation or simply staying silent. There are a lot of choices and interessting stuff to explore that you will miss in your first playthrough. In addition, most characters are enough fleshed out to be interessting and have an own personality.If you are searching for a good shooter, CONSORTIUM might not be the right choice as I found the combat system and ammo managment to be kinda confusion. It works for the time being but has much room for improvements. If you want a great story, great characters, many choices and an awesome time, get it. An amazing masterpiece that only Indiedevelopers can bring forth.			"

												Well, at least its got cards...Terrible gameplay, graphics from the late 90's and awful performance.Interaction with NPCs and objects works basically on and off. If a door opens once, don't expect it to open again by interacting with it from the exact same angle; go take a walk, come back and it will (hopefully) then open. Same with NPCs, even worse when you have to either incapacitate or heal them. Weapons behave weirdly and not very dynamic; the whole combat system doesn't feel very intuitive and up for the challenge; add to that the fact that this game is so poorly optmized that playing it gives me headaches.Also, the lack of a map with objective marks makes for a hellishly infuriating experience, especially on missions where time is key for completion. How the hell am I supposed to know where all the rooms in the ship are by name? How can I know where I'm heading to? Also, how am I supposed to know I'm some sort of ""time traveler"" if there's no background explanation and no hint about it? Some of the dialog choices makes no sense, and seem to be more appropriate for end game rather than beginning.It's a real shame that this game didn't really take off and they're basically giving it away at just about every indie game website. It had potential, and someone did put a lot of work into the story, and also the voice acting is quite decent.It kind of angers me when part of a team puts in all the work, and the other half (usually made of unmotivated, uncaring, often inexperienced individuals) simply makes no effort to dish out a decent product.I cannot really NOT recommend it, but since Steam is so avant-garde as to offer reviewers the option to stay neutral (yes, sarcasm...), I'll have to say NO.Sure get it if you like, but only for free like I did... or very, very cheap. No way it's worth 10 bucks.EDIT: I was just having another go, and five minutes in, I was hit by 3 NPCs chatting to me at the same time, with their voice-overs on top of each other. Made it impossible to know what answer to choose for one of them because I couldn't understand what was asked.EDIT 2: Hit by another bug, it happens when you manage to trap the traitor in one of the bedrooms or in the area that goes towards the medical bay: the traitor freezes up, doesn't move or shoot you, and both his health and stamina bar doesn't deplete as you keep shooting him, even after you depleted his armor. You have to get out of the way and let him go, so the combat resumes normally. "

												The first two levels were on a ship where there is pretty much only talking to do. And the story is not particularly interesting to justify that there is no gameplay during the first hours of play, you could pretty much take your hands of the keyboard. The tutorial is the best part of the game that I have played. But then, I got stuck in a room and couldn't reach the next ""quest"".On another note, the sound design is decent, so is the voice acting. Unfortunatly, the game look terrible : the animations are horrible, the textures are not expecially nice and the shadows are the worst I have ever seen in any game.			"

												Consortium nails the communication with NPC part of RPGs.  If you enjoy the conversation part of games like Mass Effect but want it to be more meaningful you will love this game.  Unfortunately the combat is sparse, flat and buggy and the animations cartoonish.  The voice acting is decent which is huge since that’s most of the game.  On my first attempt I ended up in a shootout after a bunch of talking to NPCs, however there was a bug and the NPC bad guy was shooting before I even got close, so I started over.  On my second attempt I noticed that my changes in dialog really affected the direction of the story, unfortunately the story and dialog choices never interested me and I never felt engaged in my role, felt more like I was part of a Saturday morning cartoon world.  In addition the bugs and cartoony graphics really killed the immersion for me, which in a game where you spend most of the time talking to NPCs without immersion there is really no point.  I ended up getting bored and moved on to other games. Consortium is alright I guess to see how conversation trees leading to different paths should be done, and I hope all the devs and talent involved in that aspect catch on with other studiosn (cough...bioware...cough) and impart some of Consortiums success on to big budget games in RPGs when it comes to dialog.  But as a game in its own right nailing the conversation aspect of RPGs only gets you so far when every other aspect of the game is bland or broken.			"

												CONSORTIUM is exactly the kind of game that I have wanted for years and yet it misses the mark so badly. You find yourself as a player transported into the body of someone in another dimension (yes just like Nomad Soul) who is kind of a heavy gunner type assassin for the crew of a high tech Bowing747. The idea for the game seems to have been to throw crises at the crew and allow the player in an interactive fiction type way to be an instrumental part of the crews survival, with a combination of free roaming, actions on the ship, dialogue and if the player wants to, combat.Your experience here is short without any completed story arcs, not that the game is long enough to do a good one. The poor writing starts when you are thrown into a world without any boot strapping to tell you anything about what is going on. I only became comfortable with the organisation I was working for and even knew what my character's role on the ship was after doing some reading outside of the game, after my first play through. The dialogue is poor, mainly because the characters lack real depth, the events in the game are pulled right from badly written 90's films (Under Siege 1992). Combat is clunky, when there is combat, and the combat simulator missions are unfinished and not, fun.This game has so many bugs! And I played the 1.2 Master Edition which is a re-release, as the first version contained a lot of bugs. CONSORTIUM does not feel like a well tested or polished experience. This really needed more time in development. The component parts are here, but it hasn't been crafter or polished into a fine product.3/5			"

												I cannot recommend this game as I encountered a game breaking bug about an hour or so into the plot. This also invalidated and corrupted my auto-save which was the only save game I had to go back to. The bug report thread on the forum is also full of other game breaking bug reports that apparently wait for me further through the game should I find the will to restart and sidestep the one I already encountered. Other than that, I was having fun up to this point although this game felt more linear than I was expecting, for instance you can't even initiate dialogs with people the plot doesn't want you talking to right at that moment which was interfering with my immersion.

												Consortium is a sci-fi'ish game set in the near future (there's more to it than that, but that's the easiest way to classify it). You play as Bishop 6 quite literally. It's a meta sort of thing, though that's not spoilers. The Good: I loved the plot and the character interaction. It reminded me a lot of Mass Effect 2 in that regard, but with more life to it because people aren't always in the exact same spots. The graphics are nothing special, but they do fit with the art style. I loved that every choice in this game seemed to matter (we'll have to wait until part 2 to see how much), but it was nice to see immediate consequences and not just a change in an arbitrary karma bar llike some games. Yes, I'm looking at you Mass Effect 2. Speaking of a sort of karma bar, there isn't one, at least not one visible to the player and I for one loved it for that. As long as it's done well having no number attached to your actions that the player can see makes it mroe immersive and stops the player from ""counting karma"". The choices make a difference and aren't just things referenced in one line of dialogue lateer and forgot. A lot of your choices determine who lives and who dies, a thing most games are afraid to do and save for the last minutes of a game. The Bad: Glitches. There are quite a few, but there's nothing that can't be fixed fairly easily. Aside from the game crashing when you alt-tab, there's no crash related bugs I've encountered. I run two 660 ti's in sli so I fully expected crashed and other stupid stuff, but it never came to that. The framerate is a bit choppy and others have mentioned it as well. I don't know if that's because of sli or just some other weirdness. It wasn't ever bad enough to where I couldn't play the game. It's a bit on the short side for 19.99, but I think the replayability makes up for it. Going through the game again with vastly different choices should have a huge effect on the story and make your game completely different.The Ugly; I don't really have anything for this section. There aren't any really bad bugs, at least nothing on the scale of bluescreening or anything that severe. In summary I loved this game. It is a little weird, but if you like the idea of a plot driven game then this is it. By plot driven game I mean it's not like most games where they wait for you forever and ever. This game will go on without you to a certain extent, but not to the point of where you feel like you're being dragged behind a car. I would say right now, get it on the sale that is going (at the time of this review) if you think you might want to try it and then wait for a patch. Like I mentioned before the glitches aren't super bad, but they may irritate some people. The developers seem quick on the uptatke and seem to care about fixing the bugs however. :)			"

												Consortium is a FPS/RPG, a bit akin to Deus Ex as the setting is futuristic, there is an inventory system with a character sheet, multiple lines of dialog to choose from, and a sub-par shooting experience.In Consortium, the player ""controls"" a soldier in an intervention outfit. There is a very interesting hierarchy in that group, as if each person was a chess piece. The game takes place in the aircraft of that outfit undergoing an assault from an enemy militia. Discussing with anyone lets the player choose how they respond (play dumb, flirt, and so on) and stand in a positive or negative way relative to each character. The dialogs are to me the meat of the game, quite interesting with well fleshed out characters.Sadly, the First Person Shooting is so bad that I could not go much further in the game. Enemies have too much health and the combat is stiff and uninteresting. There are lots of opponents that can easily pin down the player (the combat takes place in an enclosed space), and it feels frustrating that such a bad shooting experience is also so difficult to overcome.Overall I think the game is an interesting and well written piece, but the FPS part is so badly executed that it prevents from appreciating the rest of the experience.

												Mhmm, it's an odd one. The game certainly is different from what you're used to, but it's a bit disappointing.Pros:-The music feels great-The characters are unique-Multiple ¨paths¨ to the storyCons:-The game took me only 2 hours to complete. I understand you're suposed to replay it and see other paths by having a different personnalities, but I don't think most players theses days want to explore every single dialogue possible.-You wander around a single location ( I still managed to get confused as where to go )-Gun-game mechanic feels like an empty-shell. It's there, but it's useless to the story I believe.-Game strongly encourages you to go and support their Kickstarter for the next ¨Episode¨.Overall, it's too pricy for what it gives you..			"

												There are good and bad parts about the game. For example, you can't skip dialogs, and that makes game so boring. I spend 5 hours listeting to people talk without doing much. On the other hand, you have a lot of good character with thier own rutine, feelings, and history, and that makes you feel like a real person on a real spaceship. Sadly, minigames a not great. If you can bear with people talking endlessly or unless company patch the game to skip dialog, I would not recommend this game. P.S. some Japanese dating games have an option to skip dialog, why can't this game have the same thing? "

												Seemed like a nice game, with leading a crew, fighting, and relationships between each other. but its more like an interactive movie. the fighting tutorial is longer than the actual fighting scenes later. There are a few weapons (enough) and you have shields and armor. but half of the game is talking and making some choices. i expected something with a sandbox touch, but it was actually just a story you played through, that even is pretty lame and lacked action. Absolutely underachieving. Not for that price.			"

												I can't recommend a game which doesn't exist, this title is actually a book with 3D graphics. The defining element of video games ""Gameplay"" isn't there. It is built around a single puzzle, which is solved after gathering information from several sources.If you wanted to read a story, you'd get an actual book. If you wanted to play a FPS, this is not what you're looking for, and it's the same answer if you were looking for puzzles or challenges.The actual gameplay may come in a sequel, this is just an attempt to get you to buy that concept of a game.

												Although the game has a great concept, the interface is a bit odd (using the F1-F4 keys for conversation) and the game itself isn't nearly as stable as it should be.

												**Worst Indie Game Experience to date**The fact they want $14 is a hilarious joke, you get 3 hours of gameplay at it if you go REALLY slow. I got this when it was FREE and feel like I need to be compensated for wasting my time on my horrible Source-engine simulator.I normally just do TLDR reviews so see below:Pros:-NoneCons:-Horrible scripting-Buggy as all get out, I had several instances where the storyline bugged because a trigger I walked over would replay a conversation between various NPCs I'd done an hour ago-Horrendous animations-Only one instance where you actually shoot a gun-Again, the pricetag.To sum up, this game is NOT an RPG, it's NOT a simulator, it's definitely Indie but beyond that this plays like a couple of teenagers pulled up the Source SDK over their summer break and cranked this joke of a game out.And guess what popped up as soon as I launched the game after getting it for FREE? A bloody ""Hey back us up on KICKSTARTER FOR CONSORTIUM: THE TOWER!""I've never felt like contacting Valve/Steam over being ripped off, but if I'd bought this game for $15 when it came out I would've seriously taken it up with Valve to get my money back. You get 3hours of gameplay, there's no point in replaying it to see if you could've ""Done things differently"" like in KOTOR or Mass Effect.Simply put, don't waste your time.			"

												The controls are, oddly, split between controller, mouse, and keyboard. You can do 80% of things using the controller, but navigation of the inventory menu requires a mouse and jumping requires a keyboard. It's a fairly useless support of controllers why basic, critical actions require two extra peripherals to be accomplished.Beyond that, the game gives very little direction of where to go. Mission objectives flash briefly the screen, only to be forever lost once the dialog disappears (and it will disappear quickly, often before you have time to read it). Even if you do manage to catch what your objective is, there's no map or directional indicator to help you know where to go to accomplish the objective.			"

												This is a post-patch revisitation review. It contains no plot-revelation spoilers.Consortium is a game I very much enjoyed, and I plan to play the future installments, but the game is also a victim of its own ambitions in certain ways.The game concepts and mechanics are often novel and welcome, and the dedication to rpg storytelling is evident and appreciated.And yet ...... not all of the storytelling concepts are executed as well as someone seems to think they are. Nowhere is this more evident than in the mystery featured in chapter one.You are charged by your superiors to investigate the possibility of a traitor aboard the Consortium aircraft. I spent real-time hours trying to perform due diligence on the investigation; reading files; questioning suspects; and the like.The end result was only mountains of contradictory ""evidence"" any court would dismiss as circumstantial at best. Certainly not enough to assuredly accuse anyone, let alone convict them.To compound the problem, even though you are investigating on the authority of the three ranking Consortium members aboard the aircraft, potential suspects routinely evade lines of questioning, or are flat-out uncooperative (however politely) -- even though everyone tells you that they want to see the problem solved.Worst of all, the very people who set you to investigating shut you down when you complain of lack of cooperation -- but subsequently demand you produce a suspect, and express annoyance when you refuse to offer someone up on little more than a hunch based on circumstantial evidence.It ends up making your superiors seem corrupt at worst, and heavy-handed fools at best. On my first playthrough save, I actually resigned from the Consortium over this.I only solved the mystery thanks to a hint a fellow player gave me -- when you first arrive aboard the aircraft, look around. Someone appears to be working in a place which may later prove to be ... problematic.None of my detective work led me to the suspect. Only this.So, yes, Consortium is an enjoyable, and often novel, take on the rpg genre, and worth its price (in my opinion) -- but the game's clever systems and techniques are only as good as the content powering them -- and someone needed to spend a little more time inside the mystery plot to insure that it hung together as well as they believed it did.When you succeed in drawing the player into your game-world -- as Consortium did with me -- it's important that the game world maintain its plausibility and consistency once the player has engaged.My opinions, anyway,			"

												The game is just coming out and I was hooked when they showed off an internal view of the air ship.  The game litterally puts you in control of a character aboard an airship.  You play ""Bishop"" aboard of crew ranked by chess pieces.  Acting as the 2nd in command to the Knight, your job is to ensuring the crews moral and ship safety.  The voice acting is great, the story well written and the game allows the player to make decisions that affect the outcome of the story and how the crew likes/hates you.  What is one of the more stand out moments of the game is the fact that while YOU, the player, view this as a game.  The characters view the world as ""Reality"".  So you juggle between all the past experiences normally seen in a games cliche story arch and the ""reality"" of the world in which you present.Now the game is still with glitches and bugs.  But the developers have rescently released a notice stating they are aware of this and apolgiesed for any inconveniances.  Which is a bonus in my book when a developer owns up to their mistakes and spends time too work everything out.This game is worth a buy.  With a multitude of outcomes based on your actions, the replay is high.			"

												I was very very impressed by this game. At first I thought that it was not going to be that good, I thought the action was gonna be dull and you were going to be stuck in long monolagues forever. That, however, was not the case. Even though the storyline and voice acting as well as the flow of the conversations you have (which also has a really interesting reputation system) was amazing to say the least (I would compare and even would dare to say that it puts mass effect to shame), the action comes at you early, hard, and fast, and boy is it a kicker. I definatley would recommend this game and If I had a rating system I would give it a 10/10 because I have not found a game that has surprised me and kept me excited like this since Far Cry 3, and setting this apart from Far Cry 3 it is a truly original and new expirience that I think could start a whole new crave for these kinds of games kind of how Minecraft did for Voxel Sandboxes.

												Without question, this has been one of my most enjoyed entertainment experiences to date. The story is excellent, the world is well fleshed out, the characters are unique and believable... Its like a Telltale Games adventure but you get to jump in guns blazing to be the hero at times as well. I'm so hopeful that the sequel will come around because I'm enthralled enough that I need closure on this, and just more games like this in general. I could not reccommend this highly enough to other gamers who value an engrossing experience. There were a few graphical glitches and gameplay/physics bugs that would normally have been a bit infuriating but, in this context, I just didn't care; they couldn't detract from the rest of the wonderful time spent in this gem of a game.[Edit] I've just finished a second playthrough and now I'm even more in love. Discovered so many extra details and options. The sequel can't come soon enough! [/edit]			"

The gameplay is good as well for how you have lots of dialogue with others and deciding if you will reveal who you truly are or not and wether or not you shoot to kill, stun or not shoot at all. It's great! I hope you support this indie game as well, it's another Kickstarter sucess game and the dev team have done a great job of fixing up the game (especially performance) with the master edition. Now's a great time to give it a shot. :)			"

You have a clear choise to play lethally or nonlethally.What really makes the game for me is a very interesting backstory and universe what you are inserted into.

												I think this game has amazing potential, but mediocre application. If you play the game for the first time, you'll be ridicously excited about the different possibilities in the game. You'll enjoy it. Perhaps so much that this will be worth the price of the game alone. However...If you replay it to discover the differences in the game, and try to get a different outcome, you'll realize you've been cheated into thinking that all these possibilities were there, when in fact they were illusionary.  (It's as if the Stanley Parable only had dead ends in all but one path) Your role in any replay will vary only very slighty from your first playthrough, and let's face it: the value of this game is the freedom and your role in the story.Summary: This game could've been revolutionary, instead its passable and forgettable. I would not recommend it to anyone, but also hope they continue the franchise with major improvements.			"

												Consortium is a short adventure game set in a Thunderbirds TV series-like environment, nice story, terrible game.The game is worth a try, devs put a real effort into it and clearly cared, but I don't think I'll play it again.Pros (where all the efforts were put to good use)a rich branching dialogueseveral possible endingsSci-Fi background storyvery good voice actingcons (where the lack of experience shows)all characters look the same, same build, same head, but different hair colourdialogues overlap, you are talking with a character and various messages inform you of other (important ?) events, not easy to listen to two people at onceno sync between dialogues and subtitles, they disappear before the character says them, and if a character talks quickly OR if several events happen at the same time, subtitles lag behinda count down limits time to read the dialogue options (???)screen shaking – in the future planes still fly like♥♥♥♥♥♥(hate this feature, in any game)screen blurring – communication with the past is tricky, right, but horizontal lines every thirty seconds are  just annoyingmovement is awkward, characters push you aside when walking, they block your path in the corridors (there are only corridors), invisible walls block your movement, crouching is painfully slow, invisible walls slow you even more, even entering a room is trickycontrary to what the game says, you do not need any FPS experience, as combat is nonexistent – also your class is fightersome missions have count down timers you are unaware of, you’ll discover them when you fail the missionthe game forces you to act quickly and use techniques you never practiced – maybe once in the simulatoryour character doesn't evolve, this is no RPG for me "

												This game gave me exactly what I was looking for. I wanted an interactive story, and I wanted to explore. Yes I did encounter a few bugs on my way, but nothing game breaking. If you enjoy games that are limited in scope but give you the oportunity to explore every nook and cranny then this is for you.			"

												I have suspected this for a while, but I can conclued that the best games do in fact come from Canada.The ending hyped me for the possible sequel immediatly. I love this game's atmosphere. Its plot line can be compared to that of Telltale's The Walking Dead, it was ultimately linear, but your choices did matter. I would even go as far as to say the developers surpassed Telltale here. Screw Metascore this time. This game has the potential to be at least as great as Bioware's Mass Effect or Valve's own Half-Life. I can only semi-complain about the cliff-hanger at the end, so I must beg the developers to please actually release a second part, (Half-Life 3 anytime soon, Valve?) I feel as if this concept can be greatly expanded upon.			"

												Consortium tends to play like an adventure/detective title, with branching dialouge options and Alternate Reality Game based lore, and a smattering of FPS elements thrown in.  And by ""branching"" I mean ""be warned, your decisions and actions will *actually matter* in this game!"", which already makes it rather unique.Movement through the certain areas of the ship tends to be a bit awkward, due to the realisticly cramped quarters, but the overall design is very well put together.  You will be challenged with the exploration and usage of the detailed ""micro-environment"" setting you find youself in, and forced to make quick descions based on instinct and whatever information you can glean from your surroundings or the NPCs.  Combat is not a huge portion of the game, though tends to be intense when it does happen.  As for the storyline... without giving away too much, it's about as twisty and complicated as they come, with a MASSIVE amount of backstory to flesh things out.Overall it's a good game with a unique design and plot, where one can wind up exploring a small yet incrediably detailed worldsetting.  I'd reccomend it as a purchase for anyone.			"

												-THIS IS NOT AN EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-This game is something really great. I've waited for the final release of the game, for all the bugs to fix, and, unlike the other weird people, I reviewed the final release the game. Generally gameplay reminds me of System Shock 2, bit of Deus Ex and bit of first Half Life too. Speaking of Half Life, and fighting by the way, all the game can be finished without firing a single bullet - conversation is of course the most important thing here -  or of course you can fight your way through the game, and doing that be carefull when you firing grenades - you are in a pretty BIG aircraft, you know what I mean and yes - I tried this once and almost flew away through the hole i made :d Combat is though. Even on a easiest level, it's still challenging. But, I am sure that the great characters, interesting plot with many things to discover, (not through the first gameplay - i've played two times and everytime the game was MUCH different as I was choosing other options and deeds), a LOT of dialogues with a perfect voice acting and dubbing will convince you to check this out.PS. I don't care about how the game looks, Consortium is poor in graphics but pretty rich in other stuff. Go play Far Cry 3 if you want good looking games and don't even try this in that case.			"

												The first great game of 2014! This game has personality and it shows in every interaction. The scope of the game may be small but the details keep you wanting more and many of the actions you take really feel like they are impacting the rest of the game. Like the great RPGs of old you can complete the game without killing anyone and be a saint to your crew mates or a silent killing machine feared and respected by everyone you come across. The only downsides are that combat can get clunky at times and the color blue is a bit overused. Imaginitive and unique Consortium is a fantastic fist person experience that can be played over and over again.			"

												I have only played through the game once all the way through, but I really enjoyed it. It was very personal and intimate, most of it focusing on dramatic moments between multiple people in the crew, and it also featured choices that were organic and natural, to the point were I made game-changing desicions a few times without ever realising I was making a choice. This game is thought provoking and interesting, and I would recomend it to anyone who wants to play a game where they feel like the things they do matter, or if you just like a game with a good story. 10/10 would time travel by satellite again.

												Well I don't have a lot to say about this Title, it has OK Graphics, So/So Shootermechanics and a Good RPG System. The Lore is extensive and the decisions you make are plentyful and yield high impact on Gameplay and your Surroundings. For someone who has not played it's Predecessor the Lore is a little Hard to understand but if you are Willing to listen and read you get dragged into a Lorerich Universe.The Game is very well thought throug, it has a lot of Secrets to find, although the Surrounding you can explore is limited.This one is very very Hard to recommend without spoiling, but this should be for you if:- You like an immersive Gameplay- You like reading lots and lots of lore.- You like to be praised if you do something well and scolded if you're acting evil.You will dislike the Game if:-You're looking for a shooter-You're looking for next-Gen-Hardcore Graphics-You're looking for a Falloutclone. (It has nothing in Common although both have weapons and dialouge, this one is wayy heavier on the dialouge and Choices)-You like scanning for life signs (if you play it, you'll get this joke)I enjoyed my Consortium Expirience and I am looking forward to the next Episode.

												This game is shockingly short, but the storytelling more than makes up for it. In just 5 hours of gameplay, I actually beat the game while realizing that there is much more inside of it...The music is outstanding, the character voices are wonderful (Aside from a certain blabbermouth, but I think that's intentional) and the only major problem I had with most of the scenes was them waving their hands in the air as if they are constantly typing on a holo-screen.For five hours of gameplay, I successfully saved lives, and failed at the plot. But there are no bad choices in this game (Aside from standing still under fire...) and my best choice is rating it 8.5/10.I just wish I realized it was a trilogy before I bought it...SIDE EDIT: Just remembered, this was made in Source, the next is gonna be Unreal, just like how much they pulled out of the first engine.

												As I type this, this game is available for free this weekend, and will stay in your library permanently.Consortium is a fun little first person mystery/adventure game which takes place on a futuristic jet liner.  I'm partially through my first playthrough and am actually rather impressed in the amount of quality in aspects like game design and voice acting.  It's rather open ended, so you can play it how you see fit.  You can role play the character basically anyway you like.  Definitely worth free!			"

												I really like the game. I have managed to play 19 hours roughly, and damn they were intense. The story has enough twists and turns in the story with elements that may not contribute to the main story but give it context.Example: You talk to a crew member, and find out that they have a deep friendship with blah blah crew member. They then defend said member in a disagreement that splits the crew, this actually now makes sense.You get a lot story context, with things like you are supposed to be a combat specialist, and due to this you can use the virtual training program. People are suprised when you don't know about weaponry and what country made equiptment. It makes sense. That is why I love this game. But it at the same time manages to break the fourth wall 3-5 times intentionally in a good meaningfully way, with a good amount of plot twists that make no sense else where, but due to the story delivery due make sense to the nth degree.

												Great game. Has that Quantum Leap Feel to it. Minus the Fact that your controlling another person via remote control for the most part.The game is worth it for a laugh and doesn't spoon feed you anything, that you should know while taking over the person your in. You get the control prompts and tool tips required to navigate the hud.But, anything else is for the most part you are so and so and you got to fill in the blank with out Al or Ziggy giving you any help you would expect from the TV series.You have to play the game like you attempting to solve a mystery, and remember everything as best as possible. You will find if you play a certain way you won't catch any one off guard because your taking the role of a new transfer to a ship. Clearly you don't know anything the first time playing, and so helps soften the blow for your first time playing through.Is the game worth it. Yes if you enjoy reading into things and documenting things personally yourself.Get the game and Enjoy the Talkies and Virtual Simulator Challenges. "

												A great game for those that love interactive stories in their games. Good writing, good characterization, and good voice acting come together to make a solid piece of video game storytelling. There are plenty of permutations in the story to justify multiple playthroughs, and your choices genuinely affect the way the story plays out. Considering the fact that there are so few games like this that focus on player choice, it's good to not only see it released, but to see that it is done very well, and in a unique way. For this alone, I would recommend the game. Though the game contains combat, there isn't very much of it. This is a bit odd considering how much detail they tried to put into the system. In the higher difficulty levels, individual parts of your suit and body can be damaged, and you can repair/heal those specific parts. There's even an inventory system, wherein you can trade energy (which is used for repairs and energy weapons) for physical space to carry guns, ammo, etc.Despite this level of detail, it isn't particularly polished. The AI spews fire everywhere while running around like headless chickens, and the inventory system is more annoying than it's really worth. The creators of the game either had a grander vision than they were able to actually execute, or they are just trying to establish the skeleton of the combat system for the future titles.Don't get me wrong, the combat isn't unplayable or unfun, it's just nothing particularly special. This is not a AAA FPS.It's also worthy to note that, when this game was first released, it had several game-breaking bugs. However, the vast majority of the bugs have been mopped up now, and I have had no trouble since the first few patches they released to fix the major bugs.			"

												Just got done playing CONSORTIUM after picking it up in the humble bundle, I heard good things about it and this is what I took away from my experience.Great-Characters, pacing, atmosphereThe characters are written well with their own motives and quirks, without being transparent enough to feel like an NPC. Pacing of these interactions and the overall plot are not bad at all, and when combined with the setting deliver a game you can jump into and feel hooked. I personally enjoyed the voiceacting and sound design.Alright-Play length and amount of content to experience on a single playthrough leaves something to be desired, don't blow your horn about a trilogy if they're all going to be this quick and rely on multiple playthroughs to deliver full circle. Content is one thing, double handling gets old after awhile. I appreciate that we have many choices, but some of them lack follow through if you play certain types of characters. Sometimes there is no foothold for a player with too much intuition that will scour out of the way areas.Lore dumps-the lore contained in this game is handcrafted and certainly interesting. The only problem outside of limited audio broadcasts/conversations is that if you want to experience any of it-have fun reading codex lore dumps in the menu. No offense but it was more fun to fly by the seat of my pants than do that and try to figure anything out, which seems to be a huge waste. Why gate so much great stuff behind one of the dullest interactions in your game?Plain bad-Shooting, Inventory management, sense of progression, jaggy shadowsThis is a game worth playing but it feels at times if it is grasping for too many things to have that ""feature list"" that tends to accompany recent steam releases. The shooting is just plain bad(especially if you want to play non-killing), the hud sucks for it. If you want to play a decent shooter don't come into Consortium expecting even that. To make the matter worse any inventory management feels like it is there just to be there. Most of the items I encountered had no practical use inside the story, and anytime I did use a weapon/ammo/armor it was unintuitive, a huge hassle, and most of all not even fun. These two areas need some polish or even to be redone completely if you want to really tout them as cornerstones of the gameplay experience. Which leads to my next point-progression. At the end of the day I felt like I made a difference, and was a set piece for some cool stuff. Even though I kept being swept along to the next issue there were a few ""AHA"" experiences in the plot or character interactions which left me wanting more. But you still feel very gated off from what is really happening, with few avenues to approach it in an otherwise very thoughtful and ambitious setup. Also the shadow jaggies are downright terrible, expect them to be a bit jarring even if you have a nicer PC. My final comments will be aimed at the developer review-you need to decide on what you want and get it right the first time, and budget the appropriate timelines and resources to it. There is a vocal audience that bought into this game when it released, and you can tell they felt let down by the compromises and changes you made to the content and schedule. I can believe how buggy the initial playthroughs probably were. You can't look back and say ""Well I should have done it that way"" or ""Well we have this awesome system, but the way it was presented in the first game didn't suit it well""I don't say this to be harsh, but to let you know those were both areas of your responsibility during game production, and to say it didn't work or wasn't presently appropriately falls on you. It is easy to say how you would change past design decisions or player encounters at the end of the day, for obvious reasons. Perhaps a wiser approach towards future projects would be to set clear, concise goals on how to approach past issues while being mindful of what worked well.			"

												I found this game to be mostly impressive. You take the roll of Bishop 6, a soldier serving on a ship trying to find out what is going on.The game is good because there is no cutscenes to interrupt you, you stay in the same location, a very good dialogue mechanic and a very good story with alot of betrayel.Honestly, it feels like Game of Thrones because of the betrayels and the turn-ups but its differant, its more sci-fi and takes place in the world where we live in the future. And the team names are names from chess which is ok.Good game, neat graphics, good combat system and a very Rich story.I'd put this game 10/10.Hoping CONSORTIUM: The Tower comes out on steam.			"

Combat is very old school with some neat gear based mechanics, but my most recent playthrough involved almost zero fire fights until the game crashed.It launched with a lot of rough bugs, but the devs seem hard at work fixing them by the end of January.  I can't wait to see more from this studio, they really seem passionate about what they're doing, and it has produced some great results.

												This review will be split into two parts as not everyone will want to look at the huge wall of text i have written.The long versionThis game is quite honestly one of the best RPG' s i have played in years. To be quite honest no game has resonated with me story wise as much as this game has. The story was brilliantly written, and quite honestly this is one of the best games i have played in years, and is one of the few games i have completed more than once. The characters are quite interesting, the story is brilliantly written, and you can tell the amount of effort they have put into this game is extremely large. While the combat is the worst part of this game by far, the game isnt there for the combat, it is there to tell a wonderful, interesting story. I loathed every time i had to shoot people, as i would much rather talk through all of the conflicts in the game. This indie game blows most AAA stories out of the water, and i dont think any game could come close to the quality of this games story. I have to reccomend this game to absolutley everyone who isnt a ""HURR HURR SHOOT THE DUDES HURR HURR."" sort of person, if you are looking for incredible combat look elsewhere. The other negative thing i found is that it is quite short, though it does reward reloading often, and even multiple playthroughs.The short versionThe positivesWonderful story that trumps most AAA gamesGreat CharactersIncredible amounts of effort put into itThe NegativesTerrible combatSomewhat short "

												I was pleasantly surprised at how encompassing the world is. The backstory is super fleshed out and very captivating. It's like a sci-fi 'choose-your-own-adventure novel' video game, with guns, and a murder mystery. Definitely unlike anything I've ever played before, and I mean that in the best way possible.The art style is different. It's almost cartooney-looking and the shadows look really bad. Which I wouldn't mind but although the textures and all around graphical quality is sub-par, the game is very gpu intensive at random points in-game. I'm playing with a r9 380 at 1080 and some instances such as a terminal displaying a hologram would drop my frame rate from 60+ to -30 fps.The actual shooting mechanics aren't great, but they aren't a huge part of the game. Consortium is definitely a story-driven adventure game with fps elements. In my story, I only experienced combat twice outside the training sequences.The story is pretty short in lenth, but rich with substance and a high replayability value. All-around, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I'm eager to continue the adventure.			"

 CONSORTIUM: A very Interesting ""game"" For starters, the game  does not  consider what it does as a ""game"", simply more of a mix between time travel and the matrix. The game begins with the simple and not soul crushing experience of  ""THIS IS NOT A GAME, THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE AND REAL LIVES"" (Really gets ya hyped up doesnt it?) and puts you into the ""game"" (You'll be seeing me use the term ""game"" throughout the review, simply because the game does not consider itself as a game, more simply ""an experience"")VISUALSSolid, runs off the source engine yet even through its source I get a somewhat decent framerate (averaging about 20 or so in a crowded section of the map) which is odd. Sure the game is new but in slightly older games (say, Portal 2 for an example, solely because it too is a source engine game) I got a wonderful amount of framerate (Averaging a 32 to 60 on my ""crap-top"") but graphics seem to be a major issue to me. even on the lowest setting and at a ridiculously low resolution the game still runs poorly, Definently would not recommend for older PCs.GAMEPLAYLike almost all source engine games, the gameplay was solid. I had fun and generally was interested in the plot (Which i will not spoil because reasons and even i'm not done with it at the time I wrote this review). I rarely encountered a game breaking bug or glitch ( the worst being when an NPC didn't spawn in the VR training section) It was fun but still challenging to an extent. The story(Though i like it cause y'know, i'm a major nerd for all thing futuristic) seems somewhat bland at first. Imagine the largest, Most chaotic and futuristic game of clue you can think of. Got it? Now add in EMPs, Rockets, US F-16s, an angry slavic man and then throw it all up at about the cruising altitide of a Boeing 747.Because that is essentially CONSORTIUM. VALUEIs it worth the $10 that Interdimensional Games is asking for?Sadly no, I (like many others) had picked up the ""game"" for free as part of the steam winter sale when this ""game"" came out. An asking price for a story that (Though very long) is rather mediocre shouldn't really be this high (though i should point out that the replay value of this game is totally amazeballs[thats right, amazeballs]) I would have been happy to pay the $10 in truth though, because c'mon guys. There is so much worse you could get for more than $10(Garfeild Karts anyone?)FINAL VERDICTI'd give it a 7/1110, The game is Solid in terms of gameplay and originality but is lacking in storytelling and plotOverall, CONSORTIUM is a truely great game. The mechanics used in the game are (as stated by the game) truely ground breaking. When i played it it felt like every choice I made had a reaction, had a consequence and I even felt regret for one.Pick up the game some time if you like Action RPGs and want to try something new			"

General ImpressionsCONSORTIUM is a short but great story-driven game for $9.99. It was a game that lay in cobwebs in my Steam Library for some time even after I was able to retrieve it during its free weekend. Having tried it though, I think it's safe to say that the game hooks you in and doesn't give you much chance to get out of immersion unless you're going for that route. Gameplay-wise, you can't really expect much in regards to the gun mechanics. Not that you should, that does not seem to be its main purpose in the game. The main purpose is really sort of exploring this alterntive universe, I do not consider myself to be a particularly heavily story-driven person, but having said that, you're not ramshackled to a ball and chain to the story. If you want to breeze through it as quickly as possible, you can. If you want to know this story better than anyone else, IDGI doesn't stop you.My Main gripe over the game ended up being the level layout and its room naming. I think it would be safe to say that I probably should have put more attention into looking at the map on the second floor, but with timed events, save-scumming is the only way to progress.			"

												     The game's story is dynamic and changing on a Life is Strange scale if not better. The world interacts with you (more so characters) based on your play style and there's a choice in every action; from being a rebellious psychopath, a merciful soldier, or a truthful person no one seems to believe.

												Murder on the Orient Express, meets ME2's Normandy, meets Deus Ex.It's awesome.   Full stop.  Get it.  Now.  It's short, BUT because of it's very nature it's almost impossible to get thru it ""the right way"" the first time thru.Heck, I'm now on my 3rd playthru and /think/ this may be the one I take thru to the next chapter.  (When it's released.)I'm not even sure you could get the whole shape of the story without a few playthroughs.  Note, this IS part 1 of 3, and 2 & 3 aren't there yet, so it's short AND ends with a very definite ""to be continued.""			"

												Surprisingly good. I got it a while back and never played it, and started it with no knowledge at all about what it was, and it had a fun story, the characters felt realistic, you had plenty of dialogue choice, and it got surprisingly creepy at moments, which is something I hope they expand on in The Tower. It seems like it has a lot of replay value, too, but I have too many games to be playing the same one over and over. Fun game!			"

												Good game all round. Just wish there was more. I regret reading all of the flavor text. I thought that having knowledge of the  enormous amount of in-game lore would somehow help me to make informed decisions. There was a lot of text. I read it all. Absolutely no benefit. The game takes roughly the same time Skyrim's main plotline takes to complete. What is there is good, there just isn't enough. Contrary to what they might say in the trailer, there is no replayability. I still liked it though.			"

												To me this game is not worth full price but if you can get it in a bundle or half price i would say get it. It has a few bugs with the saves at times and when you punch something you get this ongoing static noise that doesnt stop until you  reload your save. Also the ui is not very good and has too much blue so its hard to read the text. Another thing the game is just too short you can beat it in 3hrs. Once i got use to the ship and controls I had use my weapon only once (training bots doesnt count) then had this stupid mini game to shoot down planes, then had to suit up to jump out the plane, then game over roll credits     -_-But will I buy part two (for a decent price) HELLS YEAH I loved the story & how ppl react to what you say. Also the layout of the plane makes you feel like you're in a space ship. It could have been a much better game if it didnt have the bugs and the lack of times to use your weapons outside of training. Also the stupid mini game god I hated that part. PLEASE DONT HAVE IT IN PART 2Ok the price got cut in half so now its worth a buy. It still has all the problems I said but now at this price point it's worth it.			"

												I adore this game. It's difficult to find much wrong with it now that they've meticulously patched it, fixing all the performance issues and irritating bugs. This is possibly the first game I've played where the characters seem like real people with real relationships that really matter. You feel as though you're really leaving an impression on them as you attempt to solve the myriad mysteries of Zenlil, the futuristic plane, while a conspiracy of powers you can't hope to understand weaves its web below the surface. I'm even a big fan of the graphic style, which brings back nostalgic memories of 90s CG television shows like Reboot. Who knew flat-shaded textures could have such a charm to them?While it wraps itself in the guise of a first-person-shooter, Consortium is a conversational game first and foremost, with almost every encounter with danger solvable without needing to resort to circle-strafing and machine-gunning. As such it can be a more sedate experience than you're comfortable with if you're looking for a more conventional FPS. I'd very much recommend it to people who are more inclined towards adventure games and other more story-based genres.With how open-ended the game is and how many ways you can alter and affect the timeline, I reckon I'll be giving Consortium a bunch more playthroughs before the next installment.A+ - Very Recommended.

												EDITED BELOWI am quite upset with this game. I helped with testing the game and giving feedback to the developers hoping to improve the game to a playiable state, and they have done significant patches which have helped allot. However, the game is still broken. Issues:- Allot of crashes related to the User Interface (moving items in and around your inventory) making the game unplayiable untill this issue is resolved- Clipping issues- And more crashesPros:- Excellent voice acting and setting, I cannot believe the amount of options and intereaction between NPC's. It is truely amasing!- Great feel to the gameConclusion:This game is not ready for release. The Dev's are working hard to resolve the issues and are doing a great job. However the game is still broken. I'd only reccomend purchasing this game if you can handle allot of crashes or if you are going to try and help the Devs.My rating of the game in its current state:3/10My rating of the game ignoring the crashes:9/10EDIT: The bugs are fixed and this game is amazing! Very good job considering the amount of work the developers have put in. A solid 9/10			"

Quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played.An interesting concept which seems a little silly at first, but after only a few minutes of actual play you'll be totally immersed in the whole idea behind it. Not to mention the rich and highly developed setting.The whole experience is very head first. There's little telling you were to go or who anyone is, or even any names. Freedom is given entirely to you to figure out everything about the whole experience, no annoying HUD popups telling you everything. I love it.If you like role playing, this game is for you. I struggle to think of many finer examples.If like me, you're looking at screenshots and thinking it looks a bit crap, trust me; Try it. The plasticy looking environments and people are perfectly suited to the entire lore of the game.I hope you enjoy as much as I am right now.			"

												Interactive media and motion picture had a baby.  CONSORTIUM is an outstanding example of how immersive storytelling can be accomplished, with decisions and impacts that really matter.  A quick example: forgetting to charge your energy reserves before meeting with your boss can determine whether or not a crew member dies....  Not because it's scripted that way, but because you have to run to need energy reserves in order to inject a wounded crew member with healing nanites.  And if you aren't prepared, they bleed out before you get back.There are numerous other instances that truly inspire that this game is indeed another universe, that the characters are living, coping, and otherwise dealing with the stress of being in a tense military situation.Sadly, the graphics do not live up to this - The game went for a slightly cartoony look instead of a realistic look.  That said, it works well with the chosen art style, and it isn't the visual art that makes the game.  It's the audio, the writing, and the humanoid interactions and reactions.The game is a little short for what I was hoping (was able to fully complete 1 variant of the story in 2 hours), but it has quite a bit of variation and replayability based on what you do and don't do.TL;DR - Highly recommended if you want a story-driven adventure game that doesn't rely on logic puzzles or item gimmicks.  Plus, its story is awesomely meta.			"

												It took me a little while to get past Consortium's fairly ugly, Reboot-esque graphics, but I'm glad I did, because it's a pretty interesting game. In some ways, the game feels like a tutorial level for a bigger game - the game teaches you how to manage your health and armor and use one of five weapons, with loading screen tutorial texts to match, but there's almost no actual combat in the game, amounting to a single optional firefight and some VR training missions. But it also uses this to have a somewhat interesting setting - the entire game takes place on an airship on the way to your next mission, and along the way you deal with a locked room murder mystery and unearth conspiracies. The gameplay is mostly dialogue-based with occasional bits of action, and the dialogue offers enough variety to highly encourage multiple playthroughs with the amount of choices you get and secrets to find. The dialogue is made interesting by the fact that rather than just breaking the fourth wall, Consortium doesn't really have a 4th wall to begin with, and the player is recognized in the game as a person using the game (described in-universe as a software that allows you to view the future through someone else's eyes) to control the main character in the future. This also ties into a pretty extensive ARG that leads up to the game for those who find themselves wanting more of the game's lore, and if you don't want to play the entire ARG there's a free DLC package that gives you all of the documents to clue you in, but it's a pretty substantial read, running several hundred pages of PDFs. The game can be enjoyed without ever acknowledging the ARG, however. Consortium is a game that feels like a smaller part of a bigger game while still holding its own as a standalone experience, and the next game, Consortium: The Tower, is currently in development and will presumably start off where this game ends. At the base price of $15 I'd consider Consortium to be a decent purchase, but at its current sale price of $1.50 I don't see any reason not to give it a try if you're into dialogue-based stories.

												I think there is a great game to be found here but right now the game feels like an early access title and not a good polished one. The fps is so low and the game is laggy most of the time that I've started over a few times and there is audio lag as well, almost sounds like an electrical device is making sparks and about to blow up at times. It's pretty annoying to buy a title that says its complete only to not be able to play it because the frame rate is so bad and makes it completely unenjoyable, this is coming from someone who plays all his games jacked up to the highest settings most of the time, its happening to other people with good rigs too, so its bad optimization and I hope it gets fixed so I can try to play and enjoy the game to its fullest, honestly though it says I have 3 hours of game time, I really only have an hour at most because of restarts after messing with the settings and doing vr training over several times where the lag jumps from bad to really really bad (any combat for that matter). Based on other reviews as well as posts I've read there are plenty of other bugs as well which I haven't ran into all of them yet because I haven't played that much of it yet because of what I said above. Changing settings to the lowest makes no difference in performance either, in fact it may have even gotten worse. Hoping someone comes up with a fix or the devs get it patched asap because its in a horrible state right now for me as well as others. Like I said I think its a great game but I'm not sure yet, haven't been able to invest any time into it.  Couple of other things I've noticed bug wise and just not liking wise is the first mission where you defend you ship with a gun (shooter part) and kill all the enemies, well I think they just constantly respawn, I passed the mission but even when it said I had completed the mission and to come back to the command center there were enemies shooting me and I died several times right there because the game created a save point right in the middle of this chaos so I would spawn in the middle of getting shot on my ship (mission already achieved) and friendly fire was turned on on my gun because I completed the mission so I couldnt even shoot back at the respawning enemies lol, it was ridiculous, so basically I just sprinted out of the room and left them to do whatever they did, leave the ship I assume. Also during that time I noticed the main bad guy at that time whom I already killed and was lying down on the ground dead, there was another one of him shooting at me and running around so that was jacked up as well and was not normal. Another couple of things I dislike so far is when I give my opinion or input on a subject we're discussing, whether it be not to move a body because its a crime scene or suggesting we attack etc they just blow you off and do whatever they want, so far you have no power in the game, you are just a long for the ride and told what to do though it starts as if you're the leader etc and there is some sort of military ranking system used but with pieces from a chess game from pawn to king, you play a bishop and there was a moment where a pawn just talked with total disrespect right to my face and I couldn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it and the knight which is apparently the leader says oh I tell everyone to speak their mind etc, its really annoying and she is the most unliked character so far because she's so passive about everything and you can't make a damn decision to save your life, cause they ignore any suggestions you make etc. Maybe that'll change but that's what its like so far.

Product received for free
												I got this game for free, and after reading about it, decided it was worth giving a try. The premise is interesting, as is the fact that your choices change the story, so there is replay value if you are interested in that sort of thing.Graphics are... well, they are bad. Luckily this is more of a story-game than an action game, so once you get into the story it bothers you less. Sound is okay. Voice acting quality varies from so-so to good.I disliked the game controls. I found myself enjoing the game for several hours until I hit a major plot point where you have to defeat a heavily shielded opponent. No matter how many times I tried, I just could not defeat him. I checked online/YouTube, followed the strategies provided, but just could not defeat this one opponent. Since it was a critical plot point, I could not advance in the game. I am unsure if it was a bug or a feature, but after 20 tries or so I got frustrated enough to uninstall the game. So, yeah... not a big fan.I rate the game 2/5 stars.  For those who do not encounter the bug/feature, or perhaps have far more patience/skill than I, I rate it 3.5/5 stars (my satisfaction level prior to frustration).			"

												This game runs r..e..a..l..l..y slow. Load times are outright painful (plenty long enough for a full trip to the head). The game lag makes combat nearly impossible. Not bad enough to ask for a refund at 80% off, but close.An excellent concept, poorly executed.UPDATE:1. OK, I finished the game in 5.5 hours. It's really NOT a game, it's a LONG DEMO. If you pay full price for this game, your're going to feel Really Ripped Off. I paid $2.99, and that's about what CONSORTIUM is worth. Not horrible, just not good enough.2. My machine can play DCS World at just below maximum settings. To run CONSORTIUM I had to turn Everything on my computer off (no other game I play requires that). When I posted the review above, the developer, Thrie, very kindly looked into it and said my graphics card wasn't up to minimums. I'm very sorry, but CONSORTIUM is not a photo-realistic simulator like DCS, it is, to put it politely, a glorified cartoon. I don't how many pixels they slaughtered to make this game such a huge graphics hog, but it doesn't show up in the end product.3. CONSORTIUM is Very Talky and never really delivers or even makes sense (reminds me of far too many dates I've been on).4. Even with every other program on my PC shut down, the load times are like Chinese water torture.5. I stick by my initial judgment; CONSORTUM is a brilliant concept, poorly executed. Unless you can get it 80% off like I did, wait or avoid.			"

												I had a lot of hope for this, but held off from purchase upon initial release.  I made the right decision, but should have waited longer.  It's been over a month since I came across a game breaking bug, preventing me from progressing any further.  I am not the only person who has encountered this either.  I have now come across another issue, which prevents me from loading my Steam Cloud Saves.  Effectively making me restart over.I figured I would wait before submitting a review.  That wait has now been long enough.  The issues I have encountered have not been fixed.  Dev's have gone quiet.  Why bother playing a game you cannot progress in?  If you are interested in this title, then have patience and continue to wait.  There is suppose to be a sequel, but if they don't get this first title working right, then why bother with anything else they release?			"

												This game was disappointing. Sure it had its perks, but in the long run, I felt like I was ripped off. Like really? 3 hours of gameplay? The gameplay itself is O.K. seeing that it mostly teases you with some 'fps combat' that you never get to do. The graphics are O.K. They get the job done, and don't look too ugly. The music in the game is very well done, but I feel was wasted on a game thats literaly three hours long. Anyways, moving on to the story, [SPOILERS] you play as a timetravaler using a sattalite made by none-other than the developer of the game (Self-centered?). You use this sattalite to controll the charectar 'Bishop-Six' who is apart of the crew of the ship Zenlil. Bishop-Six is basically a warrior class on the ship (but you dont get to do anything). blah blah blah, the game teases you with more garbage that you can't actually use, then you engage in your first real combat scenario... where you don't have to do anything.... You either surrener or die. After this, the game tries to delay you for quite a bit so you cannot complete your objective, then brings up a really story-killing arc... Your first mission is to kill Osama Bin-Laden's son.... REALLY. They couldn't have come up with something  a little better? Anyways, more crap happens and then you end up and the end of the game before you even know it... Yeah...Anyways, I give it a 3/10. If its on sale, by all means try it out, but otherwise, It is not worth the full $20.			"

												(I stand by my review despite having only 40% helpful rating at this time. I CANNOT recommend this game. It just isn't good enough to do so.)Its an interesting game. Not great or anywhere near. The presentation is lacking. This may have been a bit better back around year 2k, but today its a bit difficult to get into.Much of the time I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing or why I'm supposed to be saying something. It seems to be run into this room to talk to this person or stand around and listen. During two parts where you actually do something important, I'm doing it in a way that the crew didn't want me to do it and I had no idea. It was just like OH! but I did what I did anyway. And so much of the game gives that feeling which takes away from the fun factor - its similar to attempting to get into a locked room without knowing why you want to.Anyway, I really can't see most people getting into this. They will have their customers that will like it so that's great for them. Even with getting it for free, I still wouldn't have bought it. Its just not that good enough for me to have spent money on it, and even for free, I may not ever finish it as I don't like it that much to care.In the end, if I never finish it, then I can't recommend it.

Maybe... or maybe it's the hit-and-miss voice acting, script, and dialog.And the conversations wouldn't be so bad if everyone wasn't EXTREMELY similiar looking. And using NUMBERS AND NAMES to separate everyone? That's horrible! People have both a Callsign AND a name, and people use them interchangably (So you have to learn both!) and the ship has like 20-30 people so you don't even begin to recognize names until a few hours in. At that point, the game is 90% over. Moreover, the conversations move (even with subtitles on) WAY TOO FAST.I ABSOLUTELY support the indie devs for reaching for the stars. But the actual gameplay is 5 hours of that ""5 minute period"" of most games where you wait for the actual action and fun to begin.They have an entire ""combat system"" that... and I can't believe I'm even saying this... that you never actually use. I went through the entire game with ONE BATTLE. ONE. FREAKING. BATTLE. Why even have an inventory system? Why have me manage and decide what weapon to use?The game is very hard to pin down. It makes it very difficult to naturally feel and understand WHAT the game is asking you to do. It's a game that you have to play to the end before you realize any of the boundaries and scope of the game. That's great if you want to make the world ""seem"" huge and beyond what you actually play in. Gemini Rue did that BEAUTIFULLY. But when done wrong, it leaves the player feeling very unsure and constantly ""thinking"" (more like guessing) about what he's doing.This game is a GREAT EXPERIMENT from a new group. But it's also a deeply flawed experiment. So I both applaud them, and look forward to the sequel, but I can't really recommend the average person to play it.If the game is cheap, it's WORTH risking a couple of bucks to support these guys. But if you're strapped for cash, and don't like flawed-but-original games, I wouldn't recommend this....OH, and I also had to turn on cheats (which disables all achievements) to pass a certain section. The game has an area that constantly hurts you over time, the bug makes it kill you so fast it's impossible to pass without god mode.			"

												Starting playing this game upon release (with all the bugs!) and aside from the flaws, Consortium is amazing. If you are looking for a heavily story driven shooter that forces you to move quickly, make hard decisions and has a unique world, this is just what the doctor ordered.Is the game perfect? By no means. Does Consortium deliver a unique and engaging experience? Yes! I can't remember the last time I played a game and said ""Did that just happen??"" Support this Indie developer, we need more like them!			"

But once you dive into it start solving riddles on the Internetpage and go into the game and talk to all the Characters the Idea gets very appealing. I counted my blessings when i was getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of backstory and character presented by the NPC's this is one of the really rare games that has an idea behind it and is actually showing you something with much what ifs and other stuffs. You got a lot of possibiltys to solve situations and equaly options that actually mean somthing. I wish for a lot more depth to be honest ;) Let's wait and see what else is coming from this.			"

I started playing at 12:00 and by the time I look up, it is 4:00 in the morning.Like a lot of reviewers said already, voice acting is excellent. The best part is that you do not feel like you are the only intelligent in the world. The NPCs feels alive and have their own personality. The story move at a brisk pace and keep you interested throughout. The only problem I have with it is the combat. It is servicable but definitely not the strongest part of the game.			"

I know it's part of the plot but I could do without.The gameplay/combat isn't the greatest but it holds up, they've gone for a slightly dated aesthetic but it fits with the overall feel of the game. The voice acting and dialogue occasionally strays into the bizarre but for the most part it works.A decent (if short) game. If only it took itself seriously.			"

												I spent the first twelve hours of gameplay just reading all of the articles on the info console.I'm not really sure what to think of this game.  I enjoy it (I can't say ""enjoyed"" because I don't think I'm really done with it after one playthrough).  I like the immediacy that comes with being able to control my character all the time during conversations, although I haven't tried doing arbitrary things like walking away from conversations or just punching people for no reason.  Like any good game, I wish that it had been longer, but presumably the branching nature of everything that happens limits how long any particular path can last.I recommend playing it.  I can't really tell you if it's a good game.  It baffles me more than possibly any other game I've played.  I hope that more are made, and that the next one has a larger budget.			"

												It is an interesting mystery rpg/fps hybrid. Graphics are a bit on the primitive side, but it is easy enough to get used to. There's a lot of dialog tree, and 'like' points for each other character that you meet and interact with. Supposedly they made the game have many different possibilites and permutations, but I'd need to replay it to see how that works. Unfortunately, the launch version (1.0) has a few game-stopping bugs, but the devs have acknowledged it and hope to have it fixed up in 1.1 by the end of January. Alas, I ran into one of these bugs so I guess I'll have to await the fix.If you like mysteries and story-heavy games, this probably will be worth checking out when they get it fixed up.			"

												Consortium is a really wierd game. It has enough going for it to warrant a reccomendation, but it comes with some warnings. Both the writing, and the graphical fidelity are pretty decent; from what I've seen so far there isn't anything that stands out too starkly as cheap looking or terrible sounding. The characters, while overly perky to the point of mild irritation are voiced well and move smoothly more or less. If you don't like stories where the game talks freely about it being a game and breaks the 4th wall while attempting to work such breaches into the lore itself, then this isnt for you. It's quirky and funny but it can come off as a bit trying and boring at times. The UI, on the other hand looks like it was made in flash, or paint or something and isn't all that great and is fairly confusing to navigate, especially in combat. Equipment is also sort of oddly priced. For some reason your basic armor you get at the beginning of the game costs 72 MILLION dollars yet your helmet - of equal technical complexity- costs a mere 75k.  Combat feels wierdly tacked on. Your suit is essentially this big vaccum cleaner that just sucks up EVEYRTHING and converts it into 'utility energy' This is then used for healing and weapons, but has modes where you can just passively heal/repair or repair/heal specific parts of your body. It's just unecessarily complicated and does not really translate well to the general flow of combat. Enemies have a similar system although here the complexity is welcomed and you can maim them in a variety of ways rather than just killing them outright. I personally like this because it makes combat more interesting and engaging than simply pointing and clicking. Those small nitpicks aside, I would say that this game is certainly worth it with a 10 buck price tag, so wait for it to go on sale.			"

												First off, this game has so much potential. Its worth every penny you spend on it even if the price is a little steep for a 2-3 hour gaming experience. Choices really do matter in this game and even how you talk to certain people will open more gameplay experiece and knowledge about the game world, which is not fully explained at the jump and its up to you to find out and explore the enviroment you're in.The game starts off by breaking the Fourth Wall with a metaphorical bulldozer. This means this game is actually a rift into a futuristic utopian Earth in a parallel universe and you're controlling a ""real"" person interacting with ""real"" specialists aboard a big plane. Each character is unique and interesting to talk to and it feels gratifying when that character takes a liking to you when you choose the correct dialogue options kinda like in real life. The story is pretty interesting as well centering around a murder on board the plane which may or may not have something to do with your arrival to this foreign universe. Replayability is very high. I guarantee you'll discover something new about the characters and the story in each playthrough.The only downsides with this game is the combat. Thankfully you can avoid combat alltoghether by choosing your dialogue carefully and I definitely recommend doing so. Also the game ends on a really bad cliffhanger. Hopefully the devs are working on a continuation but it may be awhile since this all started from a Kickstarter. So buy this game. Its worth it.			"

Product received for free
												I played this game once, got it free, before the apparent bug fixes I keep reading about.So this review is based on my experience from before the bug fixes (as spoiler free as possible):The story isn't something to write home about, it is just about you a 'Bishop', or a sort of warrior, who wakes up and then talks to people back and forth throughout the ship. That and the game is short but I could never finish it due to bugs, there was even one point where I close to the end killed everyone who boarded the ship and walked around, not able to reach the last guy. Soon enough the script for me comming peacefully started but the guy was stuck so the game didn't progress. I retried the part three times and I can say that the UI is poorly optimised and the combat isn't much better and you only need it at two points from what I get and both are optional (which isn't nesserarly a bad thing).The gameplay was somewhat clumsy at times but usual it was pretty smooth and the jokes got me to snicker a bit now and then though most fell flat in my opinion.Even free it isn't something I can recommend as it wasn't really that good and I have to say that it didn't feel like a well made game. It could possibly be remade in around 1-5 months if you know what you are doing which says a lot about the game. Overall, don't buy it and if you can get it free you could check it out and judge for yourself but I don't think there is much to the game.			"

												CONSORTIUM is a pretty good SciFi-RPG. Unfortunately, there aren't so many of those. There is a lot of story to discover (e.g. via terminals or by talking to people) and it is really interesting to get to know this world.You seem to have taken control over the protagonists body and you do not know anything about why or how that happened. This is a very interesting take on creating immersion for an RPG and it works very well.I also did not encounter a lot of bugs apart from some minor graphic glitches, like I read in the other reviews. It seems like the developers patched a lot of the flaws in the game and it is definitely playable now.			"

												The game is developed by a small team, and at certain times it can be felt, the interface can be a bit wonky at times, but for all its faults this is one of the best games I've ever played. It is amazingly immersive, the game breaks the fourth wall a few times, however it's done in a way that sort of drags you into the gameworld rather than tearing the illusion down.The story is quite interesting and for the majority of the game you can actually think your way through it without going gungho.The graphics are interesting, they are neither bad nor exceptionally amazing, but considering how small the team is they are quite good.I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and I'm very excited to play the followup!

												This game is really intriguing.  It's fairly short to work through once, but once is most certainly not enough.  Keep exploring the game, keep trying new things, see if you can find the answers, work out what's going on, find the easter eggs!			"

												Consortium is one of those games that (a) defies a strict pigeon-hole; and (b) slips under the radar at release, but comes to be seen as a classic in time, like Hostile Waters or Sacrifice.Set in the sealed environment of a futuristic plane in an alternative reality, your connection to the world is through the mind and body of Bishop Six, a sort of peacekeeping commando belonging to the Consortium, this world's UN/global goverment.However, not all is as it seems. You are actually accessing this reality from our own via iDGi's proprietary technology- a satellite link across multiple realities. ( This is an excellent plot device for explaining the ""gaming-ness"" of your visuals, they claim not to have perfected the technology yet). As a result, none of your colleagues know that you are controlling Six, and in order to not arouse suspicion you must play along, learning the story-and your past- as you go.To further complicate matters, shortly after your arrival a murder is committed, and with the suspect sealed on board, time is running out for you to find them before things get worse. Much worse.Where this game succeeds is in creating an incredible sense of place. The environment, the crew, the world building- all of it combines to make a believable future- if somewhat overwhelming. Keeping apace of all the new information can get a little much at times, although there are extra materials available outside of the game to give you a little more grounding.Hands down the best thing about this game is the voice acting. One or two dodgy accents aside, the pace, delivery and impact of the cast is outstanding- you really do start to feel the personalites shine through. Add to that a conversation system that is timed, and you have to think carefully and quickly about what you say- making enemies on board probably isn't wise...Combat- of which there is little- is not particularly satisfying, and mercifully avoidable. Despite being FPS, it just doesn't seem to have the kick you'd expect it to. However, this is a minor gripe, as the game really should be played more in the style of a police procedural, finding clues, teasing information from crewmates and suspects, and choosing whether you can trust someone enough to reveal your existence- without dropping Six in trouble.The game does finish on a high note, albeit a cliffhanger- this is the first in a trilogy, with the second due to hit Kickstarter this year.It's a bit of an oddity, Consortium, but when it gets it right it's worth the price. Most reviews were for a release that had quite a few bugs, but the support from the developers since has rendered the game stable and enjoyable.			"

												I loved CONSORTIUM.For me it was one of experiences I went into mostly blind, and came out of completely blown away, and because of this I don't want to give away any details about how the game plays out. I will say this - it's quite a short game, with my first playthrough taking around 3 hours, however it is also a game full of meaningful choices. I know that I missed so much content in that playthrough, and I will absolutely be returning for seconds!			"

												This game it's absolutely stunning in the way how to tell a story. For me it's have everything, good written characters and voices, great screenplay and very detailed lore. The game mechanics are great, your choices make a difference, every game its different, i have never seen such a replayability. And I like the graphics, it's suits the game.About the bugs, I was waiting to patch 1.2 and they did good job, not a single crash or bug. I have played the game for 17 hours (finished it twice). Only some graphic glitches, nothing serious.			"

												Well The first few hours of this game where absolutely fantastic. However Crashes were fairly consistent through out. Exiting the UI causes the game to crash for me and certain glitches with the game prevent me from playing the game how i want to play it. Unfortunately i'm at a point were until they patch it to the point where most crashes are fixed i refuse to play the game. Because I cannot play it how it was meant to be Played. I don't want to say don't buy it but expect a lot of bugs to get in your way. Or if your like me the expect to not be able to play it as of right now.			"

												A futuristic Sci-Fi adventure where you work your way through situations by diplomacy and/or action. Graphics and sound are good enough, controls play well enough. If I had to compare it to games I've played, it's a little like a mini Mass Effect with no aliens/exploration, more choices but worse combat? Conversations/actions affect your relationships with characters (via a point system) which may influence the options you have in the story (which branches out well enough).Probably the best point of this game is the world/lore. It has very extensive lore in the form of ingame articles, out-of-game documents and files, and a website. However, the rest of the story hasn't really been explored because you have to wait for future games to see more (their next game is going through Kickstarter). I think you will be able to carry over your save to the next game so relationships and decisions may hopefully play some part in the next game.The way I played the game I spent much more time in dialogue than combat (but I don't think there were too many opportunities for combat besides the V.T. simulation). For combat, you have an inventory system with equipment slots and a small variety of weapons to use. You can choose between lethal and non-lethal, though non-lethal is less effective. I think it's a shame you don't get to really play around with it outside of the V.T. sim but the story plays out as the story plays out and combat is limited in this episode.I think Consortium is a very nice opening chapter/episode to a world that has more going on than what has been presented. If you want to run and gun and skip all the text then there are better games for that. If you're looking for a Sci-Fi world you can immerse yourself in and enjoy reading optional text to flesh out the world (more text than Skyrim/Dark Souls) this may be what you're looking for.			"

												This is a very different, very cute game!It definitely FEELS like a first game from a new developer. They had a million good ideas, but couldn't make time to really make good use of all of them. Much of it is a murder mystery (with interrogations), which is rather solid. Some of the voice acting is a little rough-hewn, and parts of how dialogue/plot plays out feels either obvious and heavy-handed, or a bit amateur. The majority, however, is extremely servicable, and downright good at times. The mystery part of it is great -- it was 100% unpredictable and honestly, a real challenge to figure out. I got it on the first try, but really only because I save-scummed a couple times in important conversations to see how dialogue/actions would play out if I said X or Y. You have to REALLY pay attention to the small stuff.My only real complaint about the murder mystery is that it went by too fast. I wanted more time to hunt for clues, get to know the characters, and piece details together.There IS fighting in this game -- extremely basic FPS stuff (with a way overcomplicated item management system). It's just extremely scant, and actually almost 100% avoidable. The devs put all this work into this FPS system, and had you go through basically two sets of tutorials on how to do it, and then they butter you up by saying that ""oh wow you're going into something REALLY dangerous!! You're gonna need these skills!!!"" ... And then the episode ends.I get that there will be another episode, hopefully, someday, but TBH it would have been REALLY nice if the devs had tossed in one big battle at the end to make the FPS tutorial stuff worth your time.All the negative stuff aside, I recommend the game (if it is <$10) ... If only because of how extremely DIFFERENT it is. I've played a lot of games that it had elements of, but I've never played a game that had this particular combo of elements.			"

												When you first play this you'll probably think 'Wth am I playing?' The mechanics have an old skool feel to them, the graphics are a bit underwhelming and navigating the space is, and remains, something of a frustration throughout. I'm fairly sure this is a deliberate choice on the part of the developers. You can basically forget all of that because what drives this game is story and character. It's kind of like bits and pieces of your favorite sci-fi shows and games pulled together into a coherent whole. The fact you're in the middle of it all as it plays out, whether you like it or not, is just a bonus. You can of course play it any way you like, but you're almost certain to get involved at some point.One of the smartest things about the game is it's played out in a single environment - a plane you happen to be stuck on. The fact this doesn't get stale at any point gives you some idea how much thought has gone into it. The constant crew banter and the pace of events certainly doesn't hurt either. Overall it's a good few hours of breakneck storytelling and decision making and the claims of replayability are certainly true. My first playthrough was 5 hours odd and I still don't know what the hell was going on...			"

												7 hours in and all I've done is read through the news stories and documents found in the in-game data console. I didn't have to, but it was just that interesting. Update: Having finished the game, I am stunned by the content. The story is absolutely brilliant, constantly keeping you uncertain of who the real enemy(ies?) are and whether or not you might be working for them.Just from a few save and reloads, I can already tell the replay factor of this game is going to be amazing. It's far beyond the usual shoot everyone/shoot no one replay choices.I am terribly sad to hear there are problems with the sequel and very much hope it will work itself out.			"

												The first installment of what will likely be a few games, the game ends with the promise of Consortium II and the story remains unfinished. Really fun, a lot like Deus Ex, less combat orientated though, for this installment at least. You converse with people and investiage things to navigate through an open game where you are able to make different decisions. The games all culminate in the same ending though, so as to pathway into the second game, but you are reminded of all your decisions and a promise that they will matter down the line. tl;dr great game, a bit like Deus Ex, more installments comming to finish the short story, and due to that shortness not particularly worth the $20 price tag. I'd wait until it comes on sale or is in a finished bundle with all the story finished.			"

												I'm a gernerous person, so I will recommend this game, but only if you manage to find it on sale. If you pay full price, currently $16.99 - you'll be extremely disappointed. You've been warned. With that said, for $3.39, which I paid, it was worth the 4 hours it took to complete. It's a neat idea, well crafted and it's clear the devs put a LOT of time into this game. I can honestly say it could stretch easily into 7-8 hours if you're reading every single piece of information to its full extent, and attempting (without the use of google) to achieve every secondary quest. But in the end it just didnt feel worth it.Overall it just doesnt feel like the game is complete - apparently there is a talk of a trilogy with this game, and yes there is the option of replayability - but it wasn't really good enough the first time around that I'd waste another 4 hours just to see the minute changes that can occur with some different choices.Some people might love it, you might hate it - but its worth playing if you've got some time to waste, and it's less than a 5'er...

												For those that enjoy the start of Half Life 1 and Deus Ex Human Revolution when you're just walking around and deciding what to say. Like me! There is a small amount of combat mind you. It cuts short and leaves you wanting more but at least a sequel looks well on the way in production. There is replay value in doing things differently but I'd rather play part 2 when they make it first, before trying again.			"

												When it first was released, this game had a lot of rough edges. I thought it aimed too high for the dev's ability to execute. After the latest round of patches it's all working as intended. It's got an interesting story that's well told, and characters that are well-developed. It relies perhaps too heavily on having played an ARG, and it wraps up a little abruptly, but I think it's a story worth playing.			"

												This is a great game. You play as the new security officer on a commandship tasked with monitoring global security. It goes a bit deeper than that, you are part of a mysterious time warp experiment who happens to take the body of the new security officer. Soon there is a murder on board and ransomers outside and you have to deal with the situation. Clues start adding up and you really wonder who is behind the conspiracy, what do they want from you, do they know your secret?The developers really went all out in the writing and voice acting of this game. The characters all have their own personalities, quirks and back stories so you really feel like you are a part of a team. They go about their work day throughout the ship.  You can follow them and see what secrets they are hiding or you can joke around with them. I began to like these people and actually felt bad when I tried to do a jerk playthrough.There is a combat simulator on board and two optional combat situations.It is very short, the game world moves on with or without you so there is no real down time. Things happen fast so the game isnt long. Its worth multiple playthroughs tho and I enjoy the atmosphere. Plus there are from 3-4 responses to dialogue and the writers really fleshed it out so there are a lot of options to explore.So if you want to take an afternoon to become an officer on a space ship, meet some new friends (or enemies), solve a murder and shoot some badies then I highly recommend this game. It will be memorable.			"

												Let me say this much...the game will pan-out and play differently for everyone.There is literally no right or wrong way to play this game, and the choices you make will feel actually important even when they aren't. Aside from the base game, there is a plethora of secrets and lore hiding at http://interdimensionalgames.com/ which range from breaking codes to listening to the scrambled ramblings of audio clips.The developers put ALOT of effort into this game, it's universe, and it's lore. I will say that while it isn't remarkably long (I capped out at only about 5 or so hours), the experience is enjoyable and will bring you back multiple times to try and make you try and get all the various little achievments and to uncover secrets you WILL have missed on your first playthrough.Overall this is a 10/10 game not for it's length or it's graphics; not even for it's gameplay, but rather the fact that it was one of the first games in a looooong time that has actually sucked me in and forced me to both embrace and love it's quirks/secrets, while also just being fun all-round.In the end I will say that the absolute best experience to be had is if you allow yourself to enter this game with a open mind, and simply try and have fun. Play serious, cautious, smart, dumb, peaceful, or violently bloodthirsty because there is ALWAYS another alternate timeline where you can make different choices.			"

												CONSORTIUM is a pretty good SciFi-RPG. Unfortunately, there aren't so many of those. There is a lot of story to discover (e.g. via terminals or by talking to people) and it is really interesting to get to know this world.You seem to have taken control over the protagonists body and you do not know anything about why or how that happened. This is a very interesting take on creating immersion for an RPG and it works very well.I also did not encounter a lot of bugs apart from some minor graphic glitches, like I read in the other reviews. It seems like the developers patched a lot of the flaws in the game and it is definitely playable now.			"

FPS parts, not a big fan of those, but since I suck at FPS anyway, it didnt take any enjoyment away from the game. The ability to complete the game and not have to fight just made it all the better. Can't wait for the next one, keep up the excellent work.			"

												This is a spectacular game, and I'm surprised it's free-to-play. This is one of the best role-playing games I've ever experienced, and I love the almost Douglas-Adams approach to sci-fi and augmented reality gameplay. You'll find yourself playing it over and over and over and over.If you're a fan of Mass Effect, Star Trek, Dr. Who, or Stanley Parable, this is a must-play. Believe me.There's a sequel coming out soon, as I understand. I can't wait to play it.			"

												Let me say this much...the game will pan-out and play differently for everyone.There is literally no right or wrong way to play this game, and the choices you make will feel actually important even when they aren't. Aside from the base game, there is a plethora of secrets and lore hiding at http://interdimensionalgames.com/ which range from breaking codes to listening to the scrambled ramblings of audio clips.The developers put ALOT of effort into this game, it's universe, and it's lore. I will say that while it isn't remarkably long (I capped out at only about 5 or so hours), the experience is enjoyable and will bring you back multiple times to try and make you try and get all the various little achievments and to uncover secrets you WILL have missed on your first playthrough.Overall this is a 10/10 game not for it's length or it's graphics; not even for it's gameplay, but rather the fact that it was one of the first games in a looooong time that has actually sucked me in and forced me to both embrace and love it's quirks/secrets, while also just being fun all-round.In the end I will say that the absolute best experience to be had is if you allow yourself to enter this game with a open mind, and simply try and have fun. Play serious, cautious, smart, dumb, peaceful, or violently bloodthirsty because there is ALWAYS another alternate timeline where you can make different choices.			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone who likes choose your own adventure books and murder mysteries. I played the game twice, and I loved it.The beginning is a bit disorienting, and I feel like my first playthrough reflected that. I was hurrying to get through and get to the next phase, not realizing until my second playthrough how much I really missed. I was shocked that the game ended in what I felt was the middle of my playthrough, but I still really enjoyed the ride. I like to think of this game as fully exploring a moment in time.			"

												CONSORTIUM is a pretty good SciFi-RPG. Unfortunately, there aren't so many of those. There is a lot of story to discover (e.g. via terminals or by talking to people) and it is really interesting to get to know this world.You seem to have taken control over the protagonists body and you do not know anything about why or how that happened. This is a very interesting take on creating immersion for an RPG and it works very well.I also did not encounter a lot of bugs apart from some minor graphic glitches, like I read in the other reviews. It seems like the developers patched a lot of the flaws in the game and it is definitely playable now.			"

												The game is developed by a small team, and at certain times it can be felt, the interface can be a bit wonky at times, but for all its faults this is one of the best games I've ever played. It is amazingly immersive, the game breaks the fourth wall a few times, however it's done in a way that sort of drags you into the gameworld rather than tearing the illusion down.The story is quite interesting and for the majority of the game you can actually think your way through it without going gungho.The graphics are interesting, they are neither bad nor exceptionally amazing, but considering how small the team is they are quite good.I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and I'm very excited to play the followup!

												Consortium is one of those games that (a) defies a strict pigeon-hole; and (b) slips under the radar at release, but comes to be seen as a classic in time, like Hostile Waters or Sacrifice.Set in the sealed environment of a futuristic plane in an alternative reality, your connection to the world is through the mind and body of Bishop Six, a sort of peacekeeping commando belonging to the Consortium, this world's UN/global goverment.However, not all is as it seems. You are actually accessing this reality from our own via iDGi's proprietary technology- a satellite link across multiple realities. ( This is an excellent plot device for explaining the ""gaming-ness"" of your visuals, they claim not to have perfected the technology yet). As a result, none of your colleagues know that you are controlling Six, and in order to not arouse suspicion you must play along, learning the story-and your past- as you go.To further complicate matters, shortly after your arrival a murder is committed, and with the suspect sealed on board, time is running out for you to find them before things get worse. Much worse.Where this game succeeds is in creating an incredible sense of place. The environment, the crew, the world building- all of it combines to make a believable future- if somewhat overwhelming. Keeping apace of all the new information can get a little much at times, although there are extra materials available outside of the game to give you a little more grounding.Hands down the best thing about this game is the voice acting. One or two dodgy accents aside, the pace, delivery and impact of the cast is outstanding- you really do start to feel the personalites shine through. Add to that a conversation system that is timed, and you have to think carefully and quickly about what you say- making enemies on board probably isn't wise...Combat- of which there is little- is not particularly satisfying, and mercifully avoidable. Despite being FPS, it just doesn't seem to have the kick you'd expect it to. However, this is a minor gripe, as the game really should be played more in the style of a police procedural, finding clues, teasing information from crewmates and suspects, and choosing whether you can trust someone enough to reveal your existence- without dropping Six in trouble.The game does finish on a high note, albeit a cliffhanger- this is the first in a trilogy, with the second due to hit Kickstarter this year.It's a bit of an oddity, Consortium, but when it gets it right it's worth the price. Most reviews were for a release that had quite a few bugs, but the support from the developers since has rendered the game stable and enjoyable.			"

It's supposed to be a trilogy, but as of right now, it seems like they took one complete game and released the first third. I say this mainly because I'm very confused as to what's going on with the story. There are still many unanswered questions that I'm assuming will be explained in the sequels. But I don't like when games do that. Look at Shenmue or Advent Rising. If the sequel gets canceled, then there's an incomplete story. That's the biggest flaw with this game. That, and the combat feels a bit rough. Other than that, I liked the game.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is one of the best sci-fi games i have ever played! All i knew about it going in was that it was a real-time adventure with multiple paths, which is why it's been sitting on my ""to play"" queue for months - who has time for replaying multiple paths just to get the most out of a game? Well, i've just completed my first playthrough and it was an insanely well-realized story, even just once through. But, much like Life is Strange, the meta-game explicitly encourages you to try different approaches. Perhaps it will be the first time i actually do go back to a game just to play another path.Essentially it is a first-person narrative adventure, with a few FPS elements. You are thrown in completely blind, teased with reams of world-building text in the information console, but immediately confronted with situations and dialogs that push you to skip it with absolutely no idea what's going on. As you start to learn the story, there are a few clues that lead you back to that wall of text, and the story is so ♥♥♥♥ing intriguing by then that it no longer feels like a chore at all. The characters are believable, the mythology is one of the richest i have ever seen in a video game and the whole experience is great.If there's one thing i didn't like, it's the FPS segments. These days i am much more into stealth and skillful one-shot-kills, but the shooting segments here are oldskool Doomguy bullet-sponge strafe-em-ups. Fortunately it seems there is only one of these, plus some training missions. The storyline is truly great, though, and totally makes the shooting worthwhile. Could it be better than Gemini Rue? Yes. Better than Mass Effect? A million times yes. Better than Deus Ex? Almost. Probably. If you like science fiction you owe it to yourself to play this game right now. Don't sit on it. This is excellent.			"

												It's kinda like 3D chess. You habe absolutely no idea about what's going on and there are pawns everywhere, you wish you'd have more rooks, your knights is just goofing around on either the top or lower level and your king is...well, maybe it isn't so chess-like in the first place.You can punch some people, so that's definetly making it a 10/10.

												Somebody has got to give this developer Team a ton of Money, so they can add more playtime to the next episode.It is short but has A LOT of replay value.I hope you all buy this so they can make the next part.The Game is stunning.Think Deus Ex and Star Trek TNG having a wild night... this is the child.

												A first person shooter where the only combat is in the tutorial. An RPG with an inventory you never have to use.  An adventure game with a single puzzle.  A social intrigue where all the characters are poorly acted and really eager to prove themselves to be the most courteous Canadian of the near future. A murder mystery that none of the NPCs seem to be concerned about, has no clues, and ends without anyone being even wrongly accused. At one point, near the end, the game literally asks you if you've played the associated promotional ARG, as if to apologize for the lack of content.Presumably I may have missed the entire game because of my milquetoast choices.  That's fine.  But I don't see how a well designed game can allow a player to accidentally skate past every possible interesting event. I'd probably buy a sequel, but I feel pretty confident they'll never make one, and that's probably for the best.			"

												Its basically a futuristic whodunit game.  Its a great premise, but not well done.  Within the first 45 minutes, I ran into 7 game crashing bugs, some of which, it couldn't detect that I was in the right room, or talking to someone stopped the story character from ever talking again, or characters being stuck in inaccesible areas when I needed to interact with them.  Besides that, the game essentially holds your hand the entire time, the games speed is slower than expected, and there is very little freedom to anything you do besides the dialogue choices.			"

												I bought Consortium after a favourable writeup on Rock Paper Shotgun, however I am inclined to disagree with that article.Consortium is essentially two things. It is both a game, and an interactive art piece. And deserves to be looked at in terms of each.As a game, Consortium is incredibly forgettable. The animations are jerky, the graphics are dated, and the bugs are frequent and irritating. There are a lot of interesting ideas there re: combat, with customisable loadouts that change how you play. And besides one possible battle there's not really anywhere in the game where combat exists, outside of the VR training sim. Which is a shame.As a piece of art, it walks the line between being a meaningful experience and pretentious. Unfortunately this one falls on the side of being pretentious. It has a ""play this game a thousand times with tiny variations to see all it has to offer"" rhetoric, which would be fine if the game part worked well. But it doesn't. And attempting to experience other parts of the story through the experience of others actually gets censored by the developers on the steam forums. Want to know who the murderer was, but can't piece it together? Play the game repeatedly until you find out! No thanks devs, just let someone else tell me what I've missed. That's MY choice, not yours; thinking otherwise shows that the developers have no real understanding about creating art for the consumption of others.Consortium gets the concept right, but the execution is not quite there. It is ultimately a forgettable experience that is begging for someone else to take the core idea and do it justice. Not worth buying, not worth playing. Skip it.			"

												The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they still aren't terrible. The story and gameplay on the other hand are fantastic. The best part of the game in my opinion is the ability to explore the ship, it's huge and has numerous different places you can go. So far I haven't played much of the game but even with the little I've played I really enjoy it. If you don't mind having to deal with graphics that aren't as high end as many other games, and you enjoy games rich with story lines and converstation options then I suggest this game. It's not very well known but I truly believe it is worth the $20 it costs. Consortium is vastly underated.			"

												A Scifi Adventure game with an excellent storyline and character interaction. you play as Bishop6, a special agent of the consortium on board a futuristic airplane in a mission to monitor world events and keeping the peace. the whole game is on board that small map that is the Zenlil (airplane) with characters from different countries. the characters themselves seem to escape stereotypes and are great to interact with and they are very well voiced. Jeremy Soule lends his art to the game's soundtrack and that gives it a great immersive atmosphere. highly recommended for Adventure fansthere are RPG/Action elements, but those are very week, and take a second place to the adventure itself.English video:

												Graphics: 8/10. Great, but lacks that AAA shine. Remarkably well animated. Some may not like the Toony style, but it's consistent and works. Gameplay: 10/10. Holy crap, It's Deus Ex on a plane! The closest that gaming has gotten to Warren Spector's Mythical ""One Building RPG"". It's... Short. But so was Portal. It's WELL worth the price.Story: 9/10.Consortium is actually a continuation of an ARG that's been running since 2010. Knowledge of the events of the ARG are NOT Required for the most part during the events of the game, but if you played or researched the ARG, This game becomes all the more special, especially near the end, when more concrete links to the ARG become apparrent. Eveything, and I mean everything about the game, from the basic mechanics down is explained in the ARG, and there is an extensive encyclopaedia in-game that explains many of those concepts. Check http://steamcommunity.com/app/264240/discussions/0/630800444109595332/ for a few helpful tips on the ARG itself.Music and Audio: 9/10. Not only is it Jeremy Soule, he brought his A Game for this one. Sound effects are good, but the weapon(s?) lack punch. but then again, if you're playing right, you won't fire a shot anyway...Overall: 9/10. One of the Top 10 Indies of 2014, IMO. If you're at all a fan of the Deus Ex/xShock First Person RPG Genre, pick this up RIGHT DAMN NOW. "

Pros- Complex, well-developed characters.  Voice acting and scripting is done very well and they all feel to be believable people with individual goals, desires and motivations.- Simple, intuitive controls.  It uses the WSAD movement with hotbar standard, but I like that the inventory screen doesn't stop time so much as vastly slow it down.  It's far more believable than Skyrim's stop-time-sort-through-inventory-resume-with-opponent-naked while still getting the job done.  It also forces you to make quick decisions while in combat while still acknowledging that you're a human being who might take some time to think.- Incredibly deep backstory and history.  While not everyone will be interested to read into the pages and pages of historical documents, I found them to be great reads that really helped define the world and paint a vivid universe in which to live, breathe and play in.- Notable attitude and path adjustment.  Unlike Mass Effect (which I did still enjoy quite alot) it's not good/evil/neutral in black and white.  Killing vs Incapacitating does much of the morality course adjustment, but social encounters between characters also play heavily into affect.  There are more branches than the three standards, or at the very least, it appears to be as such.- Simple, intuitive ship design.  It's a little confusing at first but once you figure it out, you can get anywhere and everywhere quite quickly.  Also, it all makes plausible, practical sense; something of a rarity in game design.  There's no wasted space, no unexplained areas that defy the overal structural design.- Fantastic atmosphere.  The music, the occasional static surge in the linkup, the turbulence that the plane suffers, it all makes the experience far more believable.  When you hit a pocket of turbulance, the plane shakes and people react to it.  When you get signal interrupts, your view goes staticy and people sound as if underwater.- Clever balance of inventory to sustainability.  Your energy bar is used to heal yourself and repair your armor, but it also serves as a 'carry weight' limit to your inventory.  You can only store so much in your PCU before you run out of energy buffer; energy that could be used to heal you and fix you up.  Energy is relatively easy to get but healing is expensive, so it makes for a unique mmicro-meta.Cons- Very short.  While doing every possible path can really make the gameplay quite long, if you take a direct course the game finishes very quickly.- Graphically average.  You won't see this thing rivalling Crysis or getting any visual awards.  The colours are very primal, really makes me think of classic Star Trek with the polar blues and whites and reds.  It gets the job done, and I mean no offense to the graphics team, however it is 'average' by big name standards.- Minimal combat.  Personally, I love the amount of conversation and depths in the game, but I would have liked to see a bit more action.  I expect far more of it in the second game, considering the ending of this one.Neutral/Grey Areas- Bugs.  They exist.  This is a temporary Con, but one that should be mentioned all the same.  However, it is a mild one as the support staff seem quite responsive.- Graphical hiccups.  There are shadows cast by crew heads that don't react well to the texture meshes or the general line of the neck.  I'm not an artist, I'm not sure what the issue is.  Still, it's rather distracting.  Technically a con but super super minor.OpinionThe game was worth the money spent.  It was a wonderful delve into a rich universe where I sincerely felt that my actions would cause a multitude of paths to open up for future content.  How well that translates into the second game will be a strong determining factor in this one's final value, but I feel it was worth my time and expense.TL;DR - Get it if you like story over action.  If you want a many-levelled shooter, not the game you want.Personal Rating = 7.4/10Though I will site a slight bias as the game seems a bit more polarized to my preferences.			"

												Ever wondered what it would be like to play System Shock (1 or 2) while everyone on the ship was still alive? And you could interact with the crew and witness the drama directly and not through audio logs after the fact? I did, and CONSORTIUM plays a lot like what I imagined it to be. Beginning of this game was some of the most exciting stuff I've played in a long time. You're on a military vessel in a middle of a crisis, helping the ship's survival, building relationships with crew members, trying to outsmart your foes, on the outside and on the inside. The writing and voice acting is good, the conversations are sharp and the game is very good at acknowledging what you do and shifting the events accordingly. But the murder mystery at the core of this episode proved to be a tough nut to crack. I'm currently beginning my third playthrough (the second one was interrupted by a progress-stopping bug) and I'm still no closer to discovering the real villain. At this point I'm not sure if I must calculate it logically by using what I know, catch the evildoes in the act somewhere or just grill some witness until they reveal something. Making logical conclusions seems unreliable when the world is so full of ~sci-fi magic~ that the rules change all the time. ""We can telepathically see and hear all through your eyes!"" ""But no, there's been a hack, and now no-one can see you!"" ""No, wait, I did a counter-hack and I still totally can!"" (And I bet Sherlock Holmes never had to deal with bs teleportation before.)So I'll keep trying until I stumble on a solution. At this point I've done some save reloading and checked the ways the plot forces some events on you no matter what you do. The more freedom a game promises you, the more invested you become in your choices, the more jarring it gets when you finally hit the bars of the cage, the limitations that the videogame has to impose on you. In the same vein as Aplha Protocol and The Walking Dead became disappointing when you realized how little you could actually change, this game promises you so much more, and it's inevitably a bummer when you cannot always do what you believe you should be doing in a given situation. But it's still a big step in a very exciting direction, and I'm eagerly waiting to see where Part 2 will take us.Now the words of warning. The game looks an controls like crap. There's no getting around it. Moving around the plane is a chore. You get stuck on ladders, you can pass through closed doors (and sometimes open doors become impassable), lights go out in different sections seemigly at random (why can't a super soldier pick up a flashlight?) You can never reliably interact with anything - only a certain part of any object is clickable, but a similar object can be non-clickable at all, leading to constant pixel hunts. The same goes for people: half of the time you cannot even click on them, which makes them just part of the scenery. And don't even get me started on combat. I had to go with the non-lethal route during a fight with a certain person, because the rifle that was in my hands refused to acknowledge I had bullets, both in my pockets and in my inventory! And I had no way to test it beforehand, because combat mode was locked until the scoundrel was all up in my grill. Multiple replays are mandatory to see all that the game has to offer, and this makes you feel almost like the character from Source Code, who is aware of the fact that he relives the same sequence over and over. What's wonderful is that your dialog choices support this mode of behaviour. Too bad you have to sit through several long unskippable holochat conversations throughout the game that get pretty old once you've sat through them once. One excruciatingly long, detailed briefing explains to you a mission THAT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING IN THIS GAME. On the next playthrough you might as well start the sequence and then go drink some tea.But is it still worth it? Absolutely! Don't try it if you are easily annoyed by lack of polish and poor production values. Consortium has been made on a shoestring budget by a small team who were too excited to explore new ways a game can interact with the player, and they're not asking too much for their work. It's an interesting experiment that has potential to lead to better things in the future. If you ever found yourself enjoying E.Y.E., Pathologic or Deadly Premonition, you are the kind of person who can appreciate it when a game offers you something new, even if playing it requires an open mind and a bunch of patience.

												Excellent....This game scratched an itch that I've been having for a long time.....a game that presents you with a convincing, fully realized, cohesive alternate universe to explore and to interact with in depth.  It's something that I haven't experienced since Deus Ex.  Even if this game is shorter(and consequently lacks the depth of that game's mechanics and story), this game has been the only one I've played since then to do as good a job of pulling me into it's universe and make me feel like I had a personal role to play in the story.""I sense something.....a feeling I've not felt since.................""

												CONSORTIUM is without a doubt one of the most unique experiences I've had in my years as a PC gamer. With elements of Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, and Deus Ex thrown in to a weird-filtered, post-state one world government blender and given a good whirl, it is certainly a beast of its own. Combat is fun if a mite simple, but thats not where the depth of this experience is. This is a game that respects your free will. Make the choice to kill, to spare, to enrage, to befriend, to say nothing at all. Everything is valid and have consequences that make sense. Characters are likable or believable. Backstory is provided in veritable heaps if you care to read it. This is a game for someone who wants to digest a world, not someone who wants to shoot a whole bunch of people. I imagine you could speed through this game in a quarter of the time it would take you if you took your time reading files and talking to the crew. If you want an action game I suggest you go elsewhere, but if you want a game that immerses you in it's story with good voice acting, extensive backstory, and player choice this may be right up your alley. Reccomended, and I look forward to future installments.Note: I am aware of the issues others have run into regarding game breaking bugs. Having not witnessed them myself, I cannot speak to them, but Caveat Emptor.			"

												This game certainly surprised me. It is very short but has a high replay value. It's a bit of a mix of Sci-Fi RPG à la Deus Ex and Mystery Crime Adventure. Therefore, your (dialogue) choices matter and there are many of them. This allows you to replay the game several times and see many different outcomes.The setup is that in the game, you are playing an Augmented Reality game in which you take control of a real person in a parallel Earth universe in the year 2042 (iirc). You take control of this person, who is a ""Bishop"" on a (military?) aircraft, where the ranks are named after chess figures (Pawns, Rook, Knights, Bishop etc.). While you are controlling him, you do not know his name, his past, his background, nothing... which results in interesting dialogues where you try to converse with people who know more about you than you do.All of the game plays on this aircraft. You need to know that they have planned this game as a trilogy and this is the introduction. It took me around 4 hours to play through and the ending is a real cliffhanger. Howevery, the second game, called Consortium: The Tower Prophecy, will be out soon and you are able to take your save game (= all your decisions) with you into the new game. (like in Mass Effect)The graphics are a bit dated (the new game will be on UE4 and the trailers suggest that it looks way better than this one) but that did not lessen my enjoyment of this game. It was full of surprises, there was a lot of background info to find out (and to read, yes, read! If you don't like reading in videogames, this is maybe not ideal for you... the dialogues are voiced), the story was incredibly well written, the choices really mattered (and I'm very anxious to find out what their influence will be in the future Consortium games) and it motivated me enough to play through in one swift session - which is rare nowadays for me.While I really enjoyed Consortium, it may be off-putting to people who expect an action FPS (there aren't many shooting sequences and they are very short, it's more an adventure than a FPS), who do not like to ""play detective"" and find out what's going on on their own or to people who expect a huge skilltree and character modifications (there are none, except the items you equip). Consortium is an adventure game first and foremost, with RPG-elements in it.If you like adventures, mysteries, solving crimes, exploring every crook and nanny, meaningful dialogue choices and a futuristic setting, this game is for you and I recommend it highly. I'm already looking forward to the next episode of this intruiging story.			"

												A decent game for sale price for any fans of old text RPG. It feels kind of like a lower quality Mass Effect with little to no combat. It is completely story based and details play out differently depending on your choices. The story is extremely short and this recommendation is for buying it on sale. Retail price is only worth it to support the next game in the series as supporting the game at it's current price seems too much like a dev cash grab seeing how short this game actually is. Not trying to dirty the name, it just seems a bit pricey for what you actually get.The ending was also kind of a buzzkill but definitely paved the way for the next game in the series.			"

												Consortium is in essence, the video-game equivalent of the film Source Code.It combines the dialogue and action based choices of The Walking Dead with the scheduled timeline of Majora's Mask, in a way that gives an INCREDIBLY immersive and cinematic experience that allows for multiple playthroughs as the player learns more and more about the world giving them new clues about what to do on the next time through.For instance you could find out information about a character towards the end of the timeline that could be exploited at the start of it.I won't say any more about this game. If you like immersive choice-based games, just get it and play it, it's in the same league as Deus Ex Human Revolution, The Wolf Among Us and Mass Effect.			"

However, it will say (and here comes the cliche!):  8.5/10 would restart from last save, hit the reset buttom, blow on cartridge, etc.!			"

												CONSORTIUM:Is a very interesting game. The combat is secondary and pretty old school, but the dialog parts are very good. The game itself is not huge, but the story is interesting and has allot of lore to it.While the game is short, the whole point of the game is to play it a few times to actually figure out what is going on. Well, at least figure out whats going on in this episode of the game...The first play through is like playing a mix between Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper, Star Trek and Dues Ex.If you are looking for something that is not like most other games you could give this a try.The Master Edition v1.2 was stable for me and I had no issues playing through the game. (Win 8.1) Cost wise I think the game is worth around 15 EUR. So waiting for a sale might be the thing to do. That said, if the price is around that for the next episode I might just get it.A few minor tips when playing [No spoilers]:*While Primary seems important. The meat of the game are the secondaries so do not make yourself feel rushed by the Captain when she gives you primary stuff to do. Basically the primary is more about ""continuing"" the plot rather than resolving. So enjoy the game and, mostly, do what you think is most important rather than what other people say.* The inventory is based on you having energy OR inventory items. So you have to balance the two. Thats why you some times cant pick stuff up. However you can vent energy whenever you want and regain new from terminals all over the plane.Suit slots do not take up space though. So put the weapons you use in the dual mini slots above and under the backpack.* I recommend getting to grips with the controls, totally, when you are in the VR section at the start so you are not caught off guard later.Oh yeah and... wise people are cautious about trust. :P			"

												So, here's a fresh review - my first was briefly after the game came out, and the devs asked me to re-consider what I'd said following a series of updates to the game.The experience I've just had was infinitely better than that which my first review was based on. Each issue I had before - largely gamplay bugs and annoying crashes - has been fixed and I did notice a few dialogue changes since initial release too. With the aforementioned issues fixed, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and did get a lot more sucked into the story this time. Its a good mix of a developing narrative which creates as many questions as it answers, along with reasonable inventory and combat mechanics that can be quite challenging when tested. Its quite short, though there are promised future installments, but it definitely pulled me in (I finished it in two sessions and can't imagine playing it in any smaller chunks).I'd highly recommend it despite PC Gamer's criticism of the graphics; they are what they are, to be honest.

												Don't quite know about this game...it's nice and all, but not easy to get into. You're left searching your way around the plane, with little help from the game as to where you're supposed to go. Missions fail all of a sudden with no warning bc. some hidden time limit which you weren't told about ran out, people you're supposed to talk to hide in locked rooms with no way to reach them.Most annoying however is the enormous amount of talking. After a while you'll feel like you're sitting in a meeting at work...it just drags on and on and you can't interrupt it ro speed through it.I'll leave the game for now and wait till I find a walkthrough.

												At launch it was more or less a technical mess (to be honest) and i was several times on the edge of giving up with the game. But the development team's message about their mistake was a good step in the right direction.Now the game is fully playable from the beginning to the end and it's a really good indie game.Ok it's a short experience but the whole purpose it the replaybility of the game, with a little different option in any dialogue at the beginning, you can experiment whole change in discussion or even events later.It's a really good game if you want to see your choices taken into account and have impact. the concept itself is great and now, with the patch, the game is a really enjoyable.My only complaint would probably be the fact that the game is short but the devs promised a longer sequel and since they kept their words until now(which is a rare today) i'll trust them and buy their future products day one.If you to play a game that show you the effect of any choice you make, play this one.And yes, the fact they apologized, they recognized their mistakes and they worked hard to improve their game is, in my opinion, one of the best thing i ever saw in recent years. Just do a comparison between this team and the one that made War Z... You know why i'll support them.			"

												Consortium walks a line between an adventure game and an FPS. The concept of the game is very good, and the interior of the  aircraft you're on seems well designed if not a little TARDIS like, the colours of the interior though are drab and rather monochrome, a little more attention in this department would have improve the surroundings. Little bits of random turbulence and interference in the game adds to the feeling of realisim.The game plays out a lot like a film, but you also get a feeling your not completely in control. Your actions are via dialogue with the AI characters and though you do have choices you don't really feel as if these choices will have much effect and are mostly a choice between your character looking dumb or acting like you know whats happening (when you've not got a clue). At another point I was told to surrender and holster my gun by pressing H key, I did but the AI still told me I'd regret not doing as I was told and a shoot out happening anyway.The general path of the story is good but some of the actions that occur don't feel very realistic (like simply requesting a priate lets your aircraft pass and all will be forgotten). There are other little things and snap you from being drawn in, the character eyes sometimes turn too far and show all white as well and limbs clipping objects (like gestures from arms slicing through chair arms). If there was a scale of how much potiental the devs have got with this concept it'll be 11 out of 10 but you get the feeling playing the it just missed the mark. I desperately wanted this game to draw me and at times it did but those little oddities just broke my from the depth of the game and I was just playing an adventure game again. I get the feeling I'm missing lore in the game that would improve my involvemtn but get the feeling that I'd have to invest a whole lot of time reading computer enteries to get to this level and I'd rather be playing than reading to be honest. This said thoughI hope the dev's produce a follow up to this.			"

But then I guess if Team17 can refer to their Worms games as GOTY then I guess anything goes.---Initial review:Very buggy and generally quite juddery. Feels early access but released as a full game.

												I purchased this game out of curiosity (the endless posibillities of outcomes, dialouges can change peoples opinion about you; even change or open up new alternatives), and BOY DO I LOVE IT! Let me tell you, I've never played anything like this before. The endless possibilities of outcomes to every situation is something I've never seen in a game before. The universe they have created it so convincing due to really good voice acting and background lore. The best thing about this game is the engaging and hillarious -even surprisingly- story.Sure, there are one or two bugs in this game, but noting gamebreaking at all. The team consist of only six people, give them a breake :) I suspect some of the negative reviews are a consequence of the developers releasing the game before it was polished, but now they have worked so hard to fix all reported problems; and the result is the master edition, which is totally playable. Sure, the story as of today takes 5 hours, but they will be releasing more of the story later. In the meantime you can go back and playthrough again with an toatally different excperience. I'll definately do it, and I'm the type of guy who never playes a game twice. Buy, buy, BUY!!			"

												This is definitely worth your time and money. I bought this game on sale, and I can safely say it was my flavor of the week! I haven't played an RPG with so much emphasis on decision making as this in a very long time, if ever. There are a couple times where I felt the game lacked interactivity with the environment, like not being able to pick up things that you would think should be picked up (books, trinkets etc.) but by no means is this a deal breaker. The story is facinating. I was immediately drawn into this scifi universe because it feels very alive. The weakest point of this game would probably have to be the gunplay. It's cool, it's fast, but it feels very unrefined. There were times where I was just standing in one spot holding down the fire button because the enemies spawned in the same location. Again, not a deal breaker, but you probably shouldn't expect a gunfight-stravaganza of a game. Overall, it was fun! Get it if you have the means and you love RPGs! High five to the maker of the game.			"

												I purchased this game after what seemed to be a large amount of patching and found almost no problems with the game apart from the alt-tab crashes, door locking issues (exiting an area that I was confined to after a npc opens the door and getting lockied behind with no way of continueing the game without reloading one of the many auto saves the game provides) and load times. The issues raised on the forums on my system seemed non-existant, even the frame rate was stable on high graphic settings. The game was engaging, well paced and adaptive if a bit short but well worth it for a £15,00 release. The backstory was vast and the character integraction almost seemless, everyone on board has a job to do and each one is believeable.The ship has plenty of unique features and it seems that there are almost no copy pasted regions (yet expected from an environment that is so small). I believe the game as well worth the money and I am eagerly awaiting a sequel.			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  It has an interesting story that is well told through the interactions, events and background material that you find in the world.  I played through it several times see how my actions could change the ending in multiple ways.The weakest point of the game is the combat system.  The combat is kinda meh.  Not bad, but not good either.  But this is a game you don't play because of combat, but for the interactive storytelling.Personally, I would recomend this game to anyone who likes mysteries or adventure games.  If you are an rpg fan, you also might like the game as well.  "

												Before we begin let's get this straight: This is a game very heavy on story and interaction with NPC's. If you're the kind of person whom likes to skip as much dialog as possible and just want to spend hours shooting things up, this game is not for you.Also, AT THE TIME OF WRITING, there were bugs in the game that made you save often should something go wrong. However, the devs pretty much responded to them instantly and I'm quite confident this game will be fixed by the end of January 2014. (Remember this is a small Indie team game with limited testing resources pre launch.) If you're worried, check the forums. (Try to avoid spoilers however, since finding out everything for yourself is 90% of the fun in your first playthrough.)That said:This is one of the most refreshing games I've played in a while when it comes to an ACTUAL First Person Role Playing Game. You have the basic, an inventory system, your quickbars and as the items you require get stronger, so do you. But feature is used in probably only 10% of the actual game, and even that can be skipped if you play it like a smooth criminal and talk your way out of things. (Remember this is the first episode, the next 2 might contain a lot more combat)But the real juicy part is the dialog system. As you make your way though the game, you gain and lose status with people. if it gets bad, you have less options, if it gets high, you'll have an easier time interacting with them. The problem? Certain actions boosts one, but lowers the other one. So be careful what you say.There is no hand holding in this game, do you make the wrong choice, you'll have to live with it (unless you reload a past save, you cheeky basterd). Conversation is fuild, engaging and unless you do a blanc carbon copy of your last playthrough, not one playthrough is the same. You'll have to actually think, consider or ignore facts, make split descisions, explore and live with the consequences if things pan out badly.The conversation system gives you a pretty diverse amount of conversation directions, and there are events that happen that can change the course of the game if you react badly. A crewmate could be injured, and you have about a second or 2 to heal them, you don't get prompted for this, you don't get warned this might happen, but it will impact your story on a decent scale. Especially if you consider your story will continue in the next episodes.The lore behind the game is pretty vast. And there is a reason why the description talks about satalites and such, and the game will remind you of it through hints and events now and then.Is it worth the price? Remember this is an indie game, and all money they earn will be funded mostly towards the next episodes. But then again, it really depends your tastes. For me, I had a lot of fun with it, and with multiple playthoughs, the game will last you quite a while. However, it might be a decent sum if you're not sure if it is the game for you.The Graphics are a little outdated, but their cartoonish look, combined with a calming enviroment, make it easy on the eyes and you won't even care after 10 minutes. It has a Star Wars the clone wars cartoon series vibe going on in the looks department (Jar Jar free).			"

												this is a good game very short can be beaten in about 4 hours i like the interaction with the crew. it seems many conversation's you have an impact on the actual story and i like that in an rpg. There are few cons though one is it's length i heard it's short but i did not think it would be this short. This game is meant to be played as a trilogy with your save file transferd but it's actually hard to get immersed in the story with this length good rpgs as you know take many hours to develop a connection with your charcter and other charcters. proberly the worst con is a desing decsion when your low in health or have brain damage in battle the game fades out like when you watch white noise on a tv it gets unplayble it's a mass effect special effect i think in new installments it could be done more suttle. There are a few issues with background sound sometimes being louder than the voice acting and with problems with closed captioning. At launch there was a few game breaking bugs i found only two bugs playng with patch 1.1 there is a time in the game when you might have to do battle but your on a chair all you have to remember is to get off the chair it may seem simple but when i saw the game glitch out i thought the game was broken. Summing it all up this could become a very good rpg with it's same lentgh in new installments i dont think it could price wise it's ok it may be too hard to make it longer for the need of higher sale price, proberly a smother launch will help too.

												great little game, very enjoyable my only gripe is that it is a very short game, yes there are multiple paths but it doesnt make up for it, not for the price. With that said id still recomend the game as it is fun, and very unique. but at the £15 price tag i was expecting more then a few hours gameplay.			"

												Quite possibly one of the best little adventure games I've ever played. It keeps you guessing and trying to figure out what exactly is going on. There are a few hiccups still with stalled scenes, odd animations from NPCs, and one small FPS drop during prep for the final sequence.I highly recommend this game and cant' wait to see the sequel. This is definately worth the money, and something you can play with someone else in the room and seeing what the different choices have on the story.			"

												Alright so I tried consortium out. It seems like an exploration/rpg type of game with fps elements. There are some slight horror elements hinted at here or there, but those are tiny. The dialoge for your character seems fine for the story but other characters feel almost forced. The enviroment is kind of cool, a security firm airplane is exactly how it  feels. The story of the world on the other hand feels like its somewhere else. People just naturaly kind of ignore it while a little drama plays out on the plane. But that's that. So it seems good, but we'll see how it progresses.			"

												I was very intrigued by the description and trailer for Consortium. While nothing special to look at, the game has a unique visual style (though graphics aren't really my thing, I would say the game 'looks' functional but unfinished - it needs textures). Uniqueness is really the quality that carries this game. If you fancy trying something very different, give it a try. The game manages to blend the rich and involving atmosphere of, say, Deus Ex (right down to detailed news feeds and history, excerpts from books) with an original, self contained setting like Portal did (as in, a setting that is already there whether or not you have 'revealed' it through gameplay). The Stanley Parable was billed as a game about choices, if you prefer not to spend your time making banal choices, this might be preferable. Everything in the game guides the player back into its setting, which is something I find very refreshing these days. The plot itself is seamless and although the choices are obvious, the possibilities are not...However. It is well that the game relies on its atmosphere, mystery and dialogue - these form the meat of the game, with combat being a rushed and simplistic affair that fortunately only arrives in short doses. I must also gripe about the length. Though the game has great replayability, if I had any idea quite how short it is, I would never have paid £8 for it in the Steam Sales...as it stands the regular price before that was nearer to £15 and that is simply asking too much for a game that took me about two hours to play through. Replayability or not, I was hoping to be told a story and all I got was the first chapter of one. Which is annoying, since the games credits sequence is basically an advertisement for a second game. I can't help but feel Consortium was a missed opportunity, as I actually feel a little bit conned by the length and this will certainly colour my decision to buy the next installment - that said, I was *very* gripped by the plot. I think people should experience Consortium, but I couldn't honestly recommend paying the current rates for it. It felt, to be honest, like buying a demo.			"

												This is not a stable, not even a beta. Sorry!It is a great game, it offers good interaction possibilities with the NPC, with a interesting story starting to unfold while playing. Consortium takes place in a small but open world interesting enough to explore and with some action if reading and listening gets to troublesome.But it is the buggiest game since STALKER.Qicksave every minute (at minimum) or you will lose a lot of time. The dialogues are great, but none is worth listening three times in a row because of the crashes. Last but not least: I have never, never, never reloaded any scene in any other game as often as this free fall here.Sorry, this is not playing, this is gametesting and paying for it :(Better Luck next time!

												Consortium is an interesting mix of SYS Shock and M Effect, among other titles. It's also a murder mystery, a sci fi adventure and more. The choices you make make some difference to the story, but not a whole lot. Still, the chioces you make, and the discussions you have will alter and affect the behaviour of those around you. THe graphics may be simplistic, but that's not why I bought it. The VR missions are tough, and also rather pointless in my opinion. I focused mainly on the story, and it developed gradually and effectively.However, I have to say it's also cliched and rather unimaginative. An ex-terrorists son taking hostages? Really? Couldn't have come with anything brighter than that? The final sequence, the JUMP, is really interesting, and apparently it will affect the way the sequel plays if there is a sequel and what happens to the Bishop 6 (the char you play).It hits more than it misses, but it does miss sometimes very badly. For example characters just standing around doing nothing except tapping at an imaignary keyboard in the air. I guess air keyboard woud be the the term.I like the characters, I liked the story for the most part. What gets me is that at the end, is a real big shock. I won't tell you what it is, but it makes replayability redundant, and that makes me wonder why that is so when it's one its selling points.I'd give the game 7/10 or a B- or something. It's a solid game that deserves to be played at least once, I pray there is a sequel, but I also hope it's sensibly priced as this first chapter is way too expensive for a 6 hour game. I guess time is not how it shoudl be judged, but if you were paying 30 dollars for 6 hours, wouldn't you ofeel a tad ripped off even if the game was amazing?Hopefully these short comings can be resolved in a sequel.Overall I really, truly enjoyed the game, and haven't played anything like it for a long time. A justified purchase, but perhaps at a lower price point			"

												This is really imaginative game that is highly reviewed by many respectable folks, yet despite all that my initial playthourghs were very frustrating and I'm not motivated to keep trying. So many things just resist me ejoying it:A murder is committed and a book dropped that seems like evidence, but I can't interact with the book or the body.Many somewhat interesting dialog trees later I find myself trying to navigate through a chat with a madman and attempting somehow not to anger him. Failing to appease him (not sure what I said wrong) I end up having to fight his platoon of mercenaries to save the ship and its crew.I grab a rifle. head in, and am able to gun them all down pretty easily, but then everyone in the crew is very upset at all of the deaths (?!). I go back to a save (this is very well implemented ) and grab a non lethal weapon. Sure, okay ...After some trial and error I am able to stun and incapcaitate the first two waves of mercenaries without any killing, but the the third wave is randomly immune to my stun weapon (has shields) and guns me down. A couple times. And the stun grenades are for a rifle I didn't pick up (learned that in Steam forum threads). You can only carry one weapon. I guess having stunned 10 mercs I could take  rifle off of one of them and shoot their mates and boss dead...When I went to reload to try the conversation with the madman again, the the game crashed and steam is updating it now synching all of my failures to the clouds. I learned that the fight I kept losing is avoidable from the forums as well  ... it seems pretty bloody inevitable in my plays of the game.Brilliantly conceived, pretty well executed, but barely playable.

												So I was pretty excited about this game, so much so, that it was my Birthday Gift to myself.  I read some reviews, watched some gameplay footage, watched a trailer, and it looked like a game that would be right up my alley.  Talked about it with a few friends, we all put the game on our wishlist, so it seemed like it was a game to buy, so I did.First thing I did, when I started the game, was I went to the options menu, turned the sound down, it said would you like to enable controller support, don't mind if I do, sadly only had two button presets to choose from, so I chose the one that I thought would be better for me.  I get in the game, the intro is confusing, it's very blurry, it's trying to simulate that you've had a bad hack, the upload isn't responding correctly, and it takes what feels a few minutes, of standing and doing nothing to get the game started.Game starts, short introduction with your security office, who directs you to med bay, which I spent the first 25 minutes of the game, exploring the ship to find med bay, and in the course of doing so, I would walk, with my controller, I could respond to conversations with the controller, but that's all I could do, I still needed the keyboard to interact with the environment, to tab open my inventory, and the mouse to look around, so then when you're doing all of that with the mouse and keyboard, why am I using the controller, so yeah, I stopped using the controller before I found med bay.So in med bay had the option to just be like, I'm from the past hacked into a video game, and the character I'm talking too, calls me Neo, so was kind of a funny, yet cheesy reference, but this guy, he has no personality, is very monotoned, lacks emotion, so I'm hoping, that he's either the traitor, or an android, because either way, I want the opportunity to kill him, and I just met him.So the game is suppose to be about choices, 4,000 lines of spoken dialogue, you're choices bear a reaction, no, not really, basically most of the time you have two choices, which are decent, one choice of why the hell would I ever say that, and the option to say nothing, and sometimes instead of 4 choices, you only have 3, with the option of saying nothing always being viable.  So yeah, you use the dialogue tree, and sometimes they acknowledge your input, and other times they disregard your input, as if what you said was frivolous.  It gives you the feeling like the option you picked wasn't the right choice, and next time pick the correct option Jackass.The most amusing part of the game so far, was when we discover the dead body, and the female security officer attempts to get emotional, attempts being the keywords, when really, all she is, is mad at you, and of course when you pick the option of hey, calm down, he was just a redshirt, while it was amusing to say it, yeah, you just feel her scorn all the further, and of course when they start moving the dead body, and you tell them not to disturb the body, this needs to be investigated, once again, you're just dismissed, and we're going to move the body anyway.So in revenge for being snuffed, about moving the dead body, I recycled the evidence intentionally.  They were like, why did you do that, and I was like because I felt like it, and then, oh well, no bother, whatever could be gathered was gathered when you recycled it, so it's all fine. :cfacepalm:There was a moment, where I had to choose about whether to let a crew memeber live or die, and instinctively it was, I have to save him, which within two minutes, he started speaking again, and it was, why did I save this redshirt!?!?  One of the selling points of this game was that it had tremendous voice acting, man if you call cheesey over the top Aussie impersonating, and puffy british pouting, and some guy that sounds like an android, tremendous voice acting, I mean I game with several Austrailians, it would have been like Mick Dundee coming to the party all over again, and they don't want that.Also, again, they are trying to make it evident, that you hacked in very shottiley, so the sound is sometimes static filled, the video becomes blurry, and you can fail to interact with several pieces of equipment at anytime, more annoying then going for immersion, in fact it breaks immersion, because it is so annoying.I talked to the crew, I don't feel emotionally invested in any of them, the one flirty chick is married, so where's the self destruct button on this ship, I'd like to blow it up myself.So if you were thinking about buying this game, before a sale, during a sale, after a sale, do yourself a favor, and regardless of the price, just skip it.Other then that, the brief moments of cheesy humor is the only thing saving this game, so, 2/5 stars...

When damage is taken you begin to lose vision rapidly until your sound and sight are both not only useless but attacking their respected senses, the game has alot of good points in the story  but you soon realise that when it comes to actual gameplay it falls drasticly short			"

												I have a weird graphic issue in which there is a diagnal line running from the top left of the screen to the bottom right.  Only about an hour of gameplay on record and I feel like this ""odd"" line shouldn't be there.  I'm running an nVidia 755 GTX with 2gb of dedicated memory and I have 8gb of RAM so I know it's not a hardware issue.  Hell, I run ArmA II on high settings with no hiccups.  Not sure what the problem is.  So it's annoying and makes it hard for me to want to even play the game.As far as gameplay goes...haven't made an opinion.			"

												In short:- Really a particular and strange adventure game (for the moment, FPS and RPG ""parts"" are still... in BETA, I think, they're not very ""used"" during the game- I liked it, for the most part- Innovative, intelligent, good story, some really good ideas, some really surprises, sometimes positevely creepy, nothing to say on these, but...- ... not great graphic, pretty short game, the developers think to have created the BEST Sci-Fi Alternative Dimension story in the world (no, it's not, sorry... really not), some poor designing choices, difficult to understand how to ""play"" the game, sometimes, the base price is too high (but is worth the half: 10 $, take it for that price), I REALLY hope for a sequel (guess why... it's another !?""£% game with no end!) (At least, however, is a good game)RECAP:Really worth 10 $, more not. Look for it at that price.COULD be a really GREAT game, but, also with no major or disturbing bugs, it lacks polihing, or better... it is part ""really good"" and part ""could really be improved""I reccomend it, because is really interesting and ""different"", but not at the current full price.RATE:7,5			"

												After giving this game another go since the last time I've plain it when you couldn't play it for five minutes without something going wrong in terms of the game working properly this game now runs pretty smoothly. As far as the game itself It is a little confusing at first but after a few playthroughs and after understanding it, it is very interesting what you find out about the game and how many options there are to wind up getting from your choices. HOWEVER the one downfall about this game that is a huuugeeeee pet peve of mine is how short it is after waiting so long for it to be fixed to playablity. I was so excited, played it and then before I knew it, I beat it... It doesn't take that long to get through this game and if your not one for re-playability then this game is definitly not for you because it is a very short game. The only thing that can make you play this game over and over again is the desire or interest in seeing what other and how many other different outcomes you can get/ wind up with. However if that is not your style in a game then look elsewhere because this game will definitly not be for you. You will play through it extremely quickly and then after beating it, you will think that you've just wasted the worst $20 of your life and think the game is a rip off. However if re-playability in games is your style and seeing what different things you can wind up happening story wise then you'll be playing this game for hours. Following the achievements this game has helps in getting the different story outcomes and each one is unique in its own way.			"

												The game look good and i was excited to play it after i got it, but i had one rather major issue that has stoped me from even starting the game, and that is the defualt resolution. Now normally that wouldn't be an issue but the default resolution not only cuts off a large portion of the bottom and right side of the screenbut the button(s) to both start a new game and confirm changing the resolution is in the cut off region (and thus can't be clicked). Not to then also mention that they thought it would be a good idea to make it to where you can't even select the cancle/confirm options with the arrow keys/WASD.TL;DR default resolution has made the game literally imposible to startat least i got it for free...

												The developers contacted me by email asking me to give this game a thumbs up, telling me it does not matter what I actually write about the game so long as I rate it positive. So here is my (negative) review. Consortium is a first person shooter/action/adventure game. The game is all very fourth wall, where you yourself are transported into the game world via a satellite. You're a ""Bishop"" in the Consortium, aboard the ZENLIL ship, where everyone has ranks matching the game of chess. Your task is to stop rebellion forces attacking the ship and ensuring it safely reaches its destination. However things go south and you're tasked with trying to uncover which person on the ship is a traitor to your cause, using a speech system similar to most RPG games. The game is incredibly short, at around 1-2, maybe 3 hours, with some minor replayability. The game ends abruptly, which left me incredibly disappointed. I was extremely excited for this game and even pre-ordered, but once the game ended I suddenly saw that it's episodic. This is something the developers never indicated which left a -very- sour taste in my mouth. I was incredibly let down which is why I cannot recommend this game. I'm sure the sequel will also be just as short with an ending just as abrupt. Wait for the next two episodes to release, and pick all three up on a sale. Maybe Consortium as a whole will be good as all three games, but this sole entry is too short and lacks the depth for me to recommend a purchase.			"

A fun space puzzle game much like Mass Effect although not as action-packed.You purchase technology to travel into the future (2040) and become someones Avatar, whom is a space cadet aboard a ship containing Star Trek like people/rankings.Discovering a murder on the ship the rest of the game is you basically trying to find out who the traitor is. While still having a side story of flying to Ireland without being shot down.It's a neat game, and I would definately give it a shot if you like dialouge-influenced story and mysteries.8/10 "

												Choppy fps makes this game unplayable. Just tried to play this for the first time, and it is so choppy! My computer plays way more graphic intensive games without a hitch. What a dumpster piece of trash. When I join the game, they are asking for money for a sequel. Why would they make a sequel when it looks like the FPS issue isn't fixed on this one?Uninstalled. No time to play shitbox games that were released years ago and still have issues.			"

												This Game is very cool. You can do so much and you have so many choices. I find this game can stand next to games like Life Is Strenge. But one aspect is better than LIS, you can shoot. this aspect makes a bit more exciting.  My onlyes little Problem is the ending!At first, its a really good ending. It`s  fast and you have a little strengenis, but it was a very hard ending for me. I hopend of a last big fight but before it starts, the game is over.Personaly I would say the game is good and with the 3.9 GB not really big, but I think a good/aceptable English is needed    ( for me It was a bit hard, because my english is not so well) but It`s a really good game.

												A really good game. I enjoyed it a lot. Can't wait for The Tower sequel. But you should probably wait for a sale to buy this because their isn't enough content to justify the $9.99 price tag. Maybe worth $3-$5. I read some reviews about this game being a demo-like cliffhanger game and I agree but if you follow the devs, they want to make this story a trilogy. Kinda like how Mass Effect 1 ended with a cliffhanger (lets just hope they don't screw up their trilogy's ending like mass effect 3).Pros:-Engaging story-Great characters-Decisions matter (branches the story and how characters view you)-Breaking the fourth wall-Awesome soundtrack-Fully voiced (and its good voice acting)-High replay value (Played it twice)Cons:-Kinda buggy (Would get stuck sometimes in the middle of a room and have to reload an earlier save file)-Terrible file saving system (autosaves don't overwrite each other and each quicksave generates a new file)-Awkward controller layout (much more enjoy with keyboard and mouse)-Fake interactions (many interactions are there just for show, you can click on them but it will just say you have no access)			"

												I really enjoyed this game, and it's a unique experience, for sure. Deep world building and near complete free control of the game and story elements. It absolutely feels like you are in a simulation, and I strongly urge someone to make this game VR compatible if they can (yes, I know the text might be a bit of an issue). A person can miss complete parts of things in dialogue or plot depending on where in the ship they are and when, just like real life. This isnt a negative at all, because it adds to the experience and adds replayability.STARTER HELP: Try to understand the rank structure onboard, which all relates to chess pieces. FOR META-FUN: Try to convince everyone that you are a real person playing a computer game, because you actually will be.			"

												My main points after playing the game myself mirror portions of multiple other reviewer's:- Agree somewhat with reviewer that said it feels a lot like ""Mass Effect but restricted to only the Normandy"". It does have a bit of that feel to it, but I would say there's more to it than that description since the entirety of Consortium's story progression is on the ship itself. Perhaps more akin to a compressed Mass Effect where the whole story takes place within the confines of the Normandy, and with only limited time spent on pure combat.- Despite lots of patches there are still bugs. Lots of them. Some are humourous, some are mildly annoying, some are hellishly frustrating, and some are game-breaking and require a reload to progress beyond. My experience after 2 full start-to-finish playthroughs and half-a-playthrough-worth of reloading to experience alternative decision trees was most definitely diminished by bugs, but not enough that I didn't still really enjoy the overall experience.- The game is indeed somewhat of a ""blue balls"" experience. There's a solid 5-10 hours of enjoyable story-centric gameplay in a game-universe which did a good job of pulling me in, but you can really see that the game isn't quite fully fleshed out in multiple areas. Combat has some promise, but is barely utilised outside of a training simulator thing. The story has many --most would say too many-- loose ends and unanswered question which are not tied up even if you go to the trouble of investigating additional dialogue and backstory. It ends on a cliffhanger right when you expect to get more answers. What exists is not bad and it's not unejoyable. It really feels like they're (intentionally or not) showing the player ""dude look at how much potential we have here - look at <X, Y, Z, all actually implemented to some functional degree in the game>, help us make the sequel everything it can be!""- Graphics aren't great and the game isn't well optimised. Load times are on the longer side given the asset quality and the same goes for performance in-game.- The story is quite engaging, supported by reasonably good voice acting across over a dozen characters. Decision trees are fairly broad, if only moderately deep on average (which I don't strike against it considering the breadth). As I discovered when playing through a second time with someone else, if you're mid-conversation with a character and then walk away, they'll react to the fact that you're walking away / being a♥♥♥♥♥♥Would I recommend it? Yeah, absolutely, and I already have to a few people. I enjoyed most of the time I spent on this game - I just hope the sequel can adequately address the first game's problems.			"

												A rare masterpiece of worldbuilding, suspense, and mystery. Eveything about thins game from mechanics to characters to the behind the scenes details you have to figure out for yourself, nothing is necessarily what you expect or what it seems on the surface. This game creates a whole world from the inside of a single airplane in a few short hours that can be revisited and bent in different ways over and over again. The only thing this game lacks is polish, it's buggy and stiff and strange but all around definitely worth experiencing.			"

												The main mechanic of Consortium that strikes you is the way that dialogue plays out in the world, in a very real time manner, with conversations flowing relatively realisticly and without too many pauses between lines like you'd expect with most games. It sounds simple but the way that the conversations and the action in general tends to flow makes you feel as though you're in a very real situation and you have a limited time to choose your words and actions carefully. The world set up in Consortium I found very interesting and the characters are well developed for a short experience without being too on the nose or stereotypical. The mystery and whodunnit aspects of the story in the later half and the various ways the story can play out (and I reccommend multiple playthroughs) makes for a very very enrapturing experience worth playing, for anyone at all. I am excited for the further prospects of the developers and the successfully kickstarted game they have in development. While there are some flaws with combat being somewhat simple and graphics being servicable at best, this is a very engaging experience and a new experience; one like I've never had before.			"

I hopend of a last big fight but before it starts, the game is over.Personaly I would say the game is good and with the 3.9 GB not really big, but I think a good/aceptable English is needed    ( for me It was a bit hard, because my english is not so well) but It`s a really good game.

												The game is interesting enough through the story. The graphics, while not innovative, but still a good style. There are a few bugs accompanied protagonist the entire game, but they are insignificant. I liked the game very good voice acting, style and storyline. 8/10. I advise you to play			"

												This game has some nice ideas, I love games where you are able to choose which one you want to help what you want to do and making decisions in general. My PC is a bit slow so I can't say how good the controls are but it felt like it would be pretty much alright. I think there was a bug with one of the missions, but again that could be part of my PC's fault.Well I enjoyed the game, it looked like you could decide on which side you are and I wouldn't mind a nice romance, if it is done right then I just really enjoy that. I write this review after a few month's when I had really played it, so I'm not to sure how much has changed till now. "

												I really enjoyed this game. I will start another play-through soon, once I play the prequel. The game play is fine, if a tad clunky at times, yet the story is well written. Which brings me to the next point; the story.From what I can tell, there was a game before this one that contained more lore for this universe. Apparently (I was told this by a game character) I would be able to make educated decisions if i had played the first installment of the series. There seemed to be an excessive amount of lore in the form of ""info terminals"" with the lore read as reports. I confess that I did not bother reading any of said material.I finished the game with more questions than answers, but the story was compelling enough to make me want to finish it. The sequel will be called ""Consortium: the Tower."" I look forward to learning the answers I Seek.			"

												Consortium is quite a unique game. Imagine if Deus Ex and Star Trek had a baby. Do NOT play this game expecting anything from the combat other than Deus Ex without all the special abilities and augmentations (And Deus Ex's combat is nothing to brag about in itself). However this game surpasses both Deus Ex and Bioware titles like Mass Effect when it comes to the flow of the narrative. Because the narrative is so short and focused (about two hours max per playthrough) you will feel like you are in an episode of Star Trek because the story never lets up, there is no time time or break in the narrative, just pure plot while you get to know the characters over the two hours you will spend with them (or more, for additional playthroughs).You take the role of Bishop 6, a member in the Consortium whose ranks are made up like ranks on a Chess Board with everything above pawns basically being the officers. The game takes place on an airplane but absolutely feels like a Starship with crew quarters, a bridge and a ""view screen"" encounter right out of Star Trek. If you're a fan of Star Trek you can think of your place in the narrative as a sort of cross between Commander Riker and Lieutenant Worf. Being a fan of Star Trek is not required but you will find additional enjoyment in the narrative if you are.Pros:The characters, the branching storyline and the amount of voice work. The last one in particularly makes this game stand out and it is constantly taken for granted- From start to finish you go through several plot narratives and will come to expect the constant communications of officers on the crew due to the large amount voice content that is in this game, the story never stops so why should the characters. A large amount of games either fail in this regard or fail to truly take advantage of what a large amount of voice work (actually pertaining to the plot) can doThis game's weakest point is easily the combat, I honestly recommend putting the difficulty on easy and cruising through because the combat is there to represent two types of choices (Fight/Not Fight and Lethal/Non-Lethal) and it serves it's purpose for that but nobody is going to play this solely for the combat. I personally can no longer take a FPS game with guns seriously unless it has ADS (aim-down-sight) but that's just me. The ""guns"" in this game feel lousy, shoot lousy and hit lousy. The second weakest point is that if you make it to the end of the game, it will leave you wanting more (which is a good thing, and a sequel is on the way). If the developers could find a way to make this game episodic in nature and roll out content on a regular basis they would really be on to something especially with the branching storylines and character relationships involved. There are also a few bugs here and there and you will more than once catch characters ""miming"" at you like they are working a computer in thin air (could MAYBE be explained by some kind of augmented reality system... but that's a stretch)Summary:The game is cheap, if you think you might like a Bioware type RPG such as Mass Effect WITHOUT the good combat system but with an emphasis on the plot or if you like Deus Ex, get this game, beat it a few times, and join me in anticipation for the sequel at this website here. http://thetowergame.com/ "

												It's a difficult game to review. It's not bad but it's not really all that great either. It's got some great ideas but it doesn't feel all that well implemented.I'm hoping that the developers learned from this game and that the sequel will fix everything that's wrong with Consortium.So in my opinion it's not a must play but worth playing if you already own it or can get it for very cheap.I've got a good feeling about the sequel.

												I recommend you buy this for the sake of when the second one comes out, it's looking as if it's going to be a lot bigger than this. Plus the dialogue is a'ight 'n' all. "
