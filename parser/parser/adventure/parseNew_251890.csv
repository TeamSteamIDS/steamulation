Early Access Review
								I generally don't write negative reviews unless something is truly amiss.  DISCLAIMER: THIS IS MORE OF A CONSUMER WARNING THAN A REVIEW. One view of the forums or the recent reviews will tell you everything you need to know.  Vertigo Games has been abusing the Early Access Program to build a game on the backs of duped early adopters. What they promised years ago was to deliver a randomly generated, open world diving simulator with unparalleled realism, graphics, and gameplay.  What they have delivered over the past couple of years is a completely unstable, unplayable fantasy game with built-in monetization and in-game purchases, with small and broken maps.  Their screenshots DO NOT match the actual gameplay.  When the game used to work, it was a multiplayer gameplay clone of Depth Hunter 2: Deep Drive, a decent if barren clone.  Starting in November 2014, World of Diving has become the culmination of false promises of progress, game-breaking bugs, eye-splitting visual glitches, dysfunctional online servers (used for authentication and multiplayer), a failed and forced migration to Unity 5, and a game with a backward-moving progress bar...all which make for a very angry user community.  But alas, you can help!  They request additional cash donations on their website in return for future updates.  To add insult to injury, updates are so broken, you are sometimes forced to redownload the previous (and still broken) version.  Each update is roughly 2GB in size.  Each is released with ""new features"" that no one asked for or wanted, and introduces new glitches while none of the on-going game-breaking bugs seem to get fixed.  There is something called Quality Assurance and Testing, which shouldn't be confused with a Beta Community. It's all very frustrating.  So this kind of business practice doesn't work for very long, and word has gotten out.  Now, this multiplayer game has literally nigh zero players, new or old ( http://steamcharts.com/app/251890#All ), the money stream has run dry, and Vertigo Games has already repurposed many of their developers to work on other projects.  In the summer of 2015, after years of retail availability as a playable and ever-improving Beta, Vertigo Games demoted World of Diving from Beta to Alpha on the Official World of Diving Website (with no communication about that on Steam).  It has become that broken now.After over a year on Steam, in an endless spiral of worse update after worse update, it's amazing that this kind of baitware can still be sold to new, unsuspecting consumers. How Vertigo Games goes about their business is atrocious and offencive, and they should all be very ashamed of taking advantage of their early adopters and taking thousands of dollars in ""donations"" for false deliverables, and finally, for providing such a HORRIBLE Early Access experience.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME/DEVELOPER AND WARN YOUR FRIENDS.  I ask that you please rate this up. "

Early Access Review
								I bought this game last december, at the same time I bought Subnautica. I usually wait a year to review early access games. Thats the amount of time I think is fair unless I find the actions of a developer particularly frustrating and/or disgusting.Back then Subnautica had so little content there wasn't even a save feature. This game had content, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the Bismarck, but there were a few areas that said ""this area isnt available yet"" because it was still in development.I didn't touch this game for nearly a year and just recently reinstalled it. Low and behold, there's nothing new besides a map with visual fidelity far, FAR worse than the others, and those undeveloped areas are still off limits.Meanwhile look at Subnautica. The amount of content added in just a year is staggering.As far as I'm concerned this game is abandoned. I was able to ignore the always online, the microtransactions. The stupid XP system, and the lack of content because its early access. But it's been almost a year and there's basically nothing to show for it. I LOVE diving. I love the ocean. I love sailing. I love everything water themed. But this game is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ To sum it all up:Almost no noteable changes.Pathetic options menu (you cant even turn off the in game music to play your own)You can see everything there is to see in about 2-3 hours.You can customize your character, but expect to either need to play the game every day and grind for dozens of hours, or purchase microtransactions.Graphics seemed to have downgraded since the last time I played.Nothing to really do, levels are boring, tiny and incomplete, and missions are laughable.The 30 or so minutes I played checking up on this game I spent wondering what could have been. The Bismarck alone could support a dozen hours of exploration, salvage and history. And it's really sad that this didnt get explored, and there seems to be no intention of it.If you love the ocean and exploration as much as me then get Sunless Sea/Subnautica instead. Don't waste money on this.UPDATE 3/5/2016No devblogs or update in monthsSeems they've finally stopped pretending. No new developer blogs of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ photoshop renders that will never be added.			"

Early Access Review
								Ive had this game since it was released and put just over 16 hours into it which isnt much compared to othersbut enough all the same.WoD had potential and was very exciting in its early stages as the dev's seemed quite active and showed that they wanted to add more content to this game..Fast forward 2 years thereabouts and sadly this game seems to have died, the devs barely update it and as many other reviews have stated when they do its with minimal content and with little to no fixing of previous bugs and problems.This saddens me alot as i love the ocean and anything underwater based (Insert high reccomendation for Subnautica here)As stated this game had potential to be something great.. something unique but we have all been let down.I hate to post negative reviews but this game gets it.Unless now in 2016, Vertigo Games decides to fire up and fix this game and add new content as they promised earlier then this game gets a big thumbs down from me.Honestly dont bother with it, as good as it may look in the pictures and the videosSave your money!Buy Subnautica if you want an amazing underwater ""alien world"" game "

Early Access Review
								A Missed Opportunity.What would a person coming to a diving game want?  I'd venture the same things as someone actually diving in a real reef - exploration, loads of aquatic wildlife, relaxation.World of Diving ignores all of this, instead presenting you with lots of cheap challenges (Race here, photograph three fish at once here).  There are hardly any fish and the environments are sparse.  To make matters worse, this paid game presents itself like a mobile phone freemium title, offering microtransactions for all sorts of (lets hope non essential) stuff.For an example of how to do it right - look at Endless Ocean (Eternal Blue in the US) for the Wii.  This offering is no substitute for that.  Really disappointed.			"

Early Access Review
								*****Sharks will not attack you***********************************************Update 10/30The developers have added some much needed structure. There are now several types of challenges that renew each day as well as the addition of a metal detector that guides you to collectible coins which can be used to purchase various cosmetic additions like diving suites, watches, etc. The daily challenges range from relaxing to frustrating. You’re told to take a picture of an object or group of fish and given some vague idea of where the thing is located. Some aren't timed which is nice, but the other side of that is the find a hidden object missions. In some cases I had to replay those missions over and over because I couldn't find a tea pot wedged in some obscure corner of the map (though you can kind of cheat if you know how).The collectibles (which also include hidden pearls) and challenges give you a solid reason to explore every corner of each environment. There are even community missions and an editor to create your own. So far this a great looking game that keeps getting better and better. Original review below.*****************************************I pre-ordered this from their website so my play time has been almost entirely outside of steam. Would I reccommend this? Yes. It's a work of passion that deserves the following it needs to bring to all of its ideas to life. That being said I would like to offer a word of caution only so that people know that they're buying into now and don't potentially complain in the reviews.In it's current state there isn't much to do beyond dive in the available areas and simply explore. Each area has a wreck that you can swim around (or inside) and each map is reasonable big, but that's about it. There is a daily mini game you can play where you have to find an object within a time limit, but the game basically tells you where it is so it will last 2 minutes max. You can clip directly through fish and plants, and you can't manually change your orientation. So no swimming upside down. There are microtransactions, but they're purely cosmetic and don't at all lock off any meaningful content.To sum it up: In its current state it's more a virtual museum than anything. That aside the game looks great. It has full controller support and the multiplayer works really well. I personally find it both thrilling and tense to swim around the detailed enviroments and you can even tread on the surface. You can also take pictures of anything you like and save them to your hardrive.This is a very cool game and a work of love, but very much Early Access. Given time I have no doubt it will be amazing!P.S. Rift Supprt			"

Early Access Review
								Do not buy this game. After playing 67.2 hours and following the game for 1.6 years I can say it’s nothing but a glitchy almost unplayable mess, that is assuming you can actually get into the broken game server. Features are being dropped left and right with updates containing little to no content other than cosmetic fluff for the microtransation store.  The game looks nothing like the trailers used to sell the game, from the world and all of its inhabitants being static, to the removal of game features that to this day are still advertised on the games main gallery.  The devs have been promising from the beginning that things will get better but they never do and when asked about it they either ignore and continue as they were or make some hollow apology and promise it will change.Your gameplay options are limited to exploring 8 small levels who aside from the river all look exactly the same except a central ship wreck which most remain unfinished. You can also take pictures and go on photo hunt which after the play though has already been mastered, the models appear in the same exact places…. And that’s it. The game was originally going to include a spear gun but was removed when a select few people on the forum whined that they didn’t like it, so the devs decided to silently remove it without a community vote and as mentioned previously is still used to this day to advertise the features of this game. This game has nothing to show for its 2 years of development.  the devs too preoccupied with working on their other games when not just cramming more of the exact same cookie cutter content into “new” levels, 8 whole levels of the exact same models and gameplay with nothing new in sight for the foreseeable future as the recently posted road map for the game is just 8 months of bug fixes and art with no radical changes or updates to gameplay or the lack there of, oh and that they will start porting the game to Xbox in December.  It’s just a matter of time till the devs incompetence finally kills the project altogether. TLDR buy subnautica instead. And maybe come back in 3 years to see what progress the game has made. If it’s not dead by then.			"

Early Access Review
  Introduction            	World of Diving is an amazingly beautiful and relaxing diving simulator. I found myself just wandering/swimming around the different levels just looking at the beautiful ocean life and ship wreaks. World of Diving is a great break from the usual fast-paced shooters, but it is not without faults. The in game “dive shop”, where you buy customizations, is filled with micro-transactions. Although you can unlock everything without buying it with real world money, the prices in the dive shop are very inflated. Along with the inflated prices, the updates are very slow coming. World of Diving also supports VR and player created content. (I’m waiting for steam workshop to be implemented) Even with the faults of this game, the multiplayer is a huge reason to buy this. It is tons of fun exploring the ocean with a few other friends.  Pros                Beautiful graphics Several varied maps/locations Easy and fun multiplayer Tons of customizations  Beautiful and interactive ocean life Plenty to do Very relaxing VR support    Cons               Requires secondary sign-in Micro-transactions  Very slow movement Slow updates Repetitive “objectives”     Conclusion                 	World of Diving is a beautiful and relaxing diving simulator, but it is not without faults. There is a few issues with buying customizations and as well as the fact of the updates are taking forever to come out. Even with the few issues (will most likely be fixed before release) the multiplayer is a huge asset for World of Diving. If you are looking for a relaxing game to play by yourself or with friends this is for you. Don’t expect anything fast paced and exciting.  Video Review

								Out of all the first person diving/swimming games out there, this is the best one out there in pretty much every aspect. The first person view is great, the diving mechanics are great, seeing your buddy and exploring is fun, and fun selfi pictures with the fish. It's still in-development (early access) so there isn't much to do yet but as far as what i have played, it's worth the experience and the wait for more updates. The game is in a nice state to play with but without much content and stuff to do, so it's either you get it now and try it out with all the up coming update, or wait until it launches to get the full experience in one go.

								This is my post about the game from the discussion forums. When I thought about what I had written it became clear to me that this sums up the game almost completely. --This game is just a complete and total joke. The devs don't listen to what the people want added to the game. Since day one many people have been asking for optional ""hardcore"" modes where air consumption, depth, and bouyancy keeping are core features, and yet they take damn near 8 months to release an update that, near as I can tell, just bluescreen's everyone's computers. The devs have made it abundantly clear that they don't care about their customers or World of Diving in general. They are too busy with their other cash grab projects. I sincerely wish I could get my money back for this lump of crap. I was looking for a good, down to the bolts diving simulator, and unfortunately, World of Diving is NOT the game I was looking for. Save your money and pass over this crap. It started as an occulus rift tech demo, and that is all it has remained. I hope they choke on my cash.			"

TL;DR: (On top because of convinience)Do i recommend this? Really hard to say as this title is so very different. If you want some underwater action or competition or a challenge then this is as wrong as a game could be.If you like a total relaxing chill from time to time without the slightest pressure at all, or simply like diving (although this is by no means a diving-simulator!), this one could be of your taste.Can you even call ""World of Diving"" a ""game""? There is no real goal, no enemies, no story, no threat, not even the fear of running out of oxygen and no deeper meaning at all. You just go, well, diving and do, well, diver-stuff. For that you have some tools at your disposal like the Metal-Detector (for finding gold), the camera for taking photos (you don't say!), the diver propulsion vehicle (DPV) for getting around faster.On each map (there are around 9 at the time of writing) you can do some missions or even ""challenges"" (some with, some without a timelimit) for which you'll get some gold. These missions consist of stuff like ""photograph these 3 fishes"" and the likes.Also there is a mission-editor which lets you create your own stuff, and on each map you could do missions others have created.What is the purpose of all this you may ask? Consider this game a total relaxing chilling ""game"". You don't have to race time, there is nothing to win, you can't even fight anything and nothing will hurt you either.And you can even do this online with others (there is no chat, you'll have to communicate with handsigns. Nice idea). But to keep you mildly motivated to relax even more, there is a progression. You will get XP for missionswhich will ""level"" your character. The higher you'll get, the more stuff to equip your character will be unlocked. Among those are e.g. cute companions like a clownfish or even a shark.But there is a dark side too. An itemshop. Yes. An itemshop for a totally non-competitive game :-)Right now these items are all of cosmetic nature and you could get the bought items by collecting too (which of course will take much more time). Still it leaves a bitter taste for the critical customer.One thing to really judge in this title are the graphics: Really fitting, nothing next-gen but still beautiful. Yet quite demanding. With my rig (see profile) i won't get higher than 30-60fps on Ultra with FullHD.But OK, it's early access, and if you're fine with lower fps that is totally acceptable for a title like this.BTW it supports Occulus Rift, but no 3D-Vision yet (DarkStarSword, the holy knight of 3D-Vision-fixing is working on a fix though).

Early Access Review
								World of Diving feels like something I *want* to like, but it's too inconsistent at this stage.  Graphically, it's quite beautiful.  The undersea world is rendered with appropriate murkiness; fish and dolphins flit about, sharks glide menacingly overhead, and shipwrecks look suitably weathered.But that's about where it ends for me.  As nice as it looks, the ocean in World of Diving seems too static and artificial.  The fauna just swim about without much regard for the player.  The undersea wrecks are impressive, but non-interactive.  It looks real, but it doesn't feel real.In fact, the only undersea interactivity is in the form of contrived ""challenges"" or hunting for coins or pearls.  Those elements don't really fit with the more realistic presentation.  It's like the developers are attempting to shoehorn a game into a simulation.  The result ends up jarring; I was simultaneously immersed in a wondrous environment and yet constantly reminded that I am playing a video game.My recommendation would be to allow an option to ditch the more obvious ""game"" like elements in favor of a more immersive experience with better interaction with the undersea world.Updated August 15/2015: Since my original review, I've been following the game's development hoping it would get better with time.  Unfortunately, it hasn't.A few months back the developers migrated from Unity 4 to Unity 5.  The upgrade took several months and introduced a host of bugs and graphical issues with it.  Despite the engine upgrade, the game feels like it's taken a step back particularly with the water graphics.The game's popularity has also dwindled, with typically no more than a couple people playing at any given time.  For a game that boasts multiplayer, not having any players renders that feature moot.  Add on periodic server connection issues and you have a situation that doesn't seem too optimistic.The developers also revealed a roadmap of future game features, but other than improved fish AI, there isn't much to get excited about on that list.  Anyone looking for a more hardcore diving simulator is going to walk away disappointed.This game is simply not worth the money and the way it is being developed, probably won't ever be.  Pick up Subnautica instead.  It's a much better underwater game.			"

								I don't usually write negative reviews but you have to trust all of the negative reviews. You have been warned!I bought this game for £3.50. I don't mean to be harsh but it's not even worth that. The game has almost nothing to do. Multiplayer is dead. Singleplayer is boring after 20 minutes of exploring and furthermore there has not been any updates for a while. It's like they just forgot us.Another thing is that the game costs £14.99 from Steam yet in-game you have to purchase items to customise your character.EDIT: It's been 4 months since I bought this game. I have 32 mins gameplay because the game is COMPLETE CRAP! STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! SERIOUSLY! KEEP YOUR MONEY!			"

								World of Diving is a good game.  It's really zen and relaxing. You just swim around and look around. So if something like that doesn't sound interesting, you probably wouldn't like it. There are a few maps to explore right now, but supposedly someday it will be open world. Overall, there isn't a TON of content, but it is in Early Access. For the price, as long as they deliver on their promises, it's definitely worth it and then some.I experienced one crash while playing, but I think it had to do with the server, as the person I was playing with crashed at the same moment I did.  But besides that, it's very responsive, no lagging of the other players.  And I rather like that the other way you can communicate with the other players is through hand motions.Works great with a controller. Movement is fluid and natural, I didn't need to look at the controls to figure out what to do almost immediately.			"

								Moje česká preview: http://www.playhit.cz/2014/10/world-of-diving-velky-modry-ve-vasem-obyvaku/The name pretty much sums it up! If you like diving, this is a game for you. It's beautiful, all the fish, wrecks, corals and plants will make you glad to have an in-game camera to catch it all on. You can swim around with friends and together explore what the ocean holds. There are many pretty cosmetic enhancements that you can buy even without mini-transactions, by collecting pearls and dubloons yourself. Missions can be made by community, just like maps in workshop. The developers listen and answer to the feedback on forums very frequently which makes my heart sing. It's full of bugs and floating rocks but keep in mind it's still in pre-alpha. It's just my kind of a game. 9,5/10I'll edit this when the full version is released.			"

No, buying them lets you be on the boat not the diving base.Gameplay updates needed.The devs dont listen to suggestions.Subnautica is better than this.2/10Buy ""Subnautica"" instead its much more fun.

								Diving games are pretty rare, so I do love the realism WOD provides, intead of being arcadish as others, it feels pretty realistic and gives the illusion of being under water. Love the fact you can customize your character & gear. Multi-player will be a big deal and so far works very well. Should get much better as pepole get the game. I'm waiting for the new update to finish as I write these comments....cant wait to see the editior. If you like diving or even curious, don't hesitate to buy the game you wont be sorry. It modest price is very fair. I am running on Ultra settings with never a crash or technical issue. I also have an older/outdated system... Intel Q9500 Quadcore, 8GB DDR2,  2x GT460 -768mb video cards, Win7-64bit. The game runs smooth even on my older hardware so looks like they've done a decent job optimizing the engine. What few issues I would have would be regarding lack of underwater treasure, etc. but to be fair I'm sure this will be improved as the game evolves since it is in it's early stage. So thumbs up all the way from me!			"

								I was very enthusiastic about this game and I bought it around the same time as it hit Steam.  The trouble is - there is almost no ""game"" to play.   All you do is run around and scoop up coins, open clams to get pearls, and the missions are just taking pictures of things.It's not really a proper diving simulator either. Yes, the developers keeping saying they will add this and that, but unfortunately they can't afford to spend much time on this game because they have to work on other contracted jobs to make money.I've finally lost patience and uninstalled this turd.  World of Diving is a perfect example of how not to handle an Early Access release.  I don't believe they have deliberately tried to mislead people but I can see why other people would be thinking that way.			"

They have a great community,lots of ways to be involved with the directions the game takes, and even options for getting some custom stuff of your own design into the game. The devs are responsive, intelligent, and care about happy customers seemingly just as much as creating a great game. All around recommended. If you think you might enjoy the world under the waves this would be the game to do it with. Take some photos, look for some gold/pearls, explore some caves, or just play in the water with some friends this game has quickly become one of my favorites. Hope to see you in the water!!			"

								I highly recommend this game for people looking to relax with friends in an underwater setting without fear of death.After playing about 2 and a bit hours with my girlfriend just exploring a few of the maps that are on offer, I can wholly recommend this game as something to do with friends in spare time.The graphics, of which I couldn't max out sadly due to my toaster of a CPU, are actually pretty lovely, enough so that I can view my Diving partner's face with quite the amount of clarity. I have a few minor gripes with clipping in the case of the futuristic helmet and the continuity error of wearing the Futuristic mask but having only one overlay for them all.Other than those small problems, I love this game already. It's rare I enjoy something so casual, but Vertigo have nailed it.			"

								Not since the days of Endless Ocean 1 & 2 has there been game that brings that peacefull Zen like feeling of traversing the ocean floor at your pace looking for marine life, treasure and hidden secrets.World of Diving is once again bringing me back to that era of exploration and curiosity.  The good part is, the game is only in Alpha state and already worth the early access buy in price.  I can see it only getting better as they add more content and features as well as the one thing Endless Ocean couldn't offer, Multiplayer and co op.Obviously being alpha there are a few things not implemented yet like cataloging and Interacting with marine life, but I'm sure those are obvious add-ons for the future.Bottom line, even if the game never went any further, It's still worth it to me just to bring back the magic of ocean exploration.  I am SBVIPER and I approve this message.			"

Dive without getting wet behind the ears!Amazing attention to detail. Lovely locations. Great visuals and over all great sounds.Been waiting for this type of game on PC for many many years and it finally arrived. All of us who love scubadiving in real life  will love this game as it takes us to the ocean once again but without the hazzle of carrying all the gear, wetness, bad weather, murky waters or zero visabillity. Ofcourse there will be murky and dark waters with little to see but in this case it's your CHOICE to go there.Overall World of Diving has a great feeling to it and the experience is very nice. In this early stage of the development one can expect things to look a bit funny here and there but it's nothing you won't survive. I say give it a go, try it out, team up with the dev's and support their cause. We've seen these type of games on consoles, now it's here for PC and can be made so much better with all the power that comes with out rigs.Come on in and get your feet wet!

								Lots of fun exploring the treasures and mysteries of the deep.... Very realistic for this stage of the build!EDIT: game crashes quite often on OSX. Sometimes while loading levels. EDIT 2: I turned down the display from max resolution to a lower level, and the rendering setting from ""Ultra, Ultra"" to ""Medium, High"" and the game runs MUCH smoother and more stable. So, if anyone is having issues with crashing, turn down the graphics a bit!Still crashes once or twice an hour, but I'm confident that the folks at World of Diving are on it... they release updates pretty regularly.My computer was absolutely bleeding-edge 4 years ago, but I guess these things... *sniff*.. happen...THE GREAT NEWS:  The game still looks bloody spectacular even at ""Medium, High"" !!!

								This is a great little game! I don’t know whether there has been an update prior to my purchase as I have not experienced the problems other users have. The only slight glitch I have had is that the camera wobbles from time to time but it quickly goes and this has not impacted my ability to play it. I have only played the single player game so far but from what I have played so far I have really enjoyed! Maybe it’s because I am a diver myself but I have found the attention to detail excellent! Everything about the ‘gear’ is spot on and even the posters on the beach shop have the phase ‘plan the dive, dive the plan’ which are indeed one of the golden rules of diving. This is a slow but relaxing game; you are swimming around looking at fish, collecting treasure and getting rid of rubbish and I have found it a calming game. I just hope the negative comments don’t put of the developers to keep expanding the ‘world of diving’!!!			"

								This game is hard to review....Should you buy it?This is a pure zen game where you sit back relax and watch the underwater world go buy as you explore 'real' shipwreaks and key locations around the world which is actually pretty cool I like his feature. You can explore these wreaks take photo's of stuff you find interesting and hell maybe you might find something special. Graphics and character and marine life models look amazing, but unfortunately this isn't obvious as the ocean it's self seems somewhat lifeless in my opinion...I was expecting 'Endless Ocean' style when I brought this and was mildly dissapointed, but it is early access we will see what happens. This game is good for a cooldown after a busy day at work and hell maybe thats all they wanted and im expecting too much from it but for me in my own opinion it can't hold my attention due to lack of everything.. Really it could do with:-More marine life and fish (The Ocean is too empty!)-Larger areas (Dam invisible walls!)-Animal interaction (More immersive experience)-Learning (Maybe a MarineO'pedia so you can learn about the species you found)-Oxygen (Add more of a immersive experience)These are just some idea's I can think of...I will give the game one thing that is a huge strength it is nice to get away from the mind numbing FPS games once in a while :)			"

								I bought this when it first appeared on Steam at a sale price (thankfully). It took me awhile to get around to trying it and after starting it up... no tutorial. Okay, click on some things and read what button does what, would rather a box popped up and actually told me what I was supposed to do, but we can just wander randomly and see what happens. I'm smart, I finally figured it out after restarting the mission part three times. I got through the first few photo missions, until I had to swim into a tube (claustrophobic anyone?) and had one minute to locate 5 starfish and photograph each one of them. Um... maybe if you had 1 minute per starfish, but after at least a dozen tries I wanted to beat my controller against my laptop, but decided it wasn't worth it and just shut it off. The graphics were really nice, although I expected them to be a lot more realistic than they were, a little boxy. No tutorials, controls are clunky and horrific, in my opinion, but I'm not used to these type of games so maybe it's me. I would say ""mission impossible"" and ""clueless"" were good terms for this game so far. It's a great concept, but falls flat on execution. I hope it does evolve into something better, because I was really intrigued by it, which is why I bough it in the first place. However, right now, can't recommend it. I’ll probably go back and try the multiplayer mode someday when I’m really mind-numbingly bored and swim around, but I’m steering clear of the other parts of the game.			"

								As a real life diver I was excited to come across a diving game that actually did what a diving game should to do; simulate wrecks, aquatic life, adventure and exploration. I've played eDiving (simulator), Infinite Scuba and WoD (the three diving games I know of as currently supported) and without a doubt WoD is the most polished and has the most potential to continue to be the best available.The new mission creator is cool, and integrates pretty well into the way the game maps work. The wrecks are intriguing and well laid out, the aquatic life is interesting and the new schooling behaviors are great.The game is still early release, and as such features, maps, and even bugs (to be expected) are rolling out on continual basis, but the developers keep a weather eye on the forums and user communications and do a pretty darn good job of addressing everything as it comes and goes.The graphics are decent, but could use some frame rate optimization which the developers have acknowledged and are working on currently.There's definately a few things I'd like to see added/changes (and you can read posts from myself and many others on the official forums), but the developers are doing a great job of communicating their plans and taking our user advice.If you're a diver, a fan of games like Endless Ocean, or just the ""explorer"" type, definately take a moment to look at this game and hopefully you'll join our network of divers in game.

Otherwise, you can find the pearls and dublooms while diving and searching shipwrecks and other things. I can't wait to see more of this game as it progresses, especially the aspects of customizing my own tropical island and having real estate.			"

								It's fairly basic at the moment, but still enjoyable nonetheless.  I like the fact that you can drop your camera, swim in front of it, and remotely take your picture.  The planned features, like metal detectors, fish interaction, mission creation to share with the community, and advanced cameras look promising.  I'm glad that a ridable underwater jet is available so that you can move around more quickly (hold in space to bring up a radial menu).  Coupled with the GPS (tab), it makes swimming from one location to another very easy.  I reserve the right to change my opinion as the game is still ""Early Access"".

								I use a Vive, so this is a Vive ReviewPros:- One of the more complete games on the Vive- Nice diving sim- People thought Dev wasn't updating, but they actually are. They just were taking longer for a larger update.- Headset not as heavy as actual diving gear, and conditions are always nice.- For added realism, I suggest laying on your stomach as you play.Cons:- Customized character through character generator, yet still I don't have a body in Vive. Tired of Vive games not letting you have a body. Gamepad interface gets bodies, motion interface doesn't seem to. Dissappointed DEVS, PLEASE LET VIVE PLAYERS HAVE BODIES TOO!!!- I was not eaten by a shark.- Underwater filling tanks is a bit unrealistic. May kill off players irl if they don't have a habit of checking their remaining tank pressure and NDL time and go diving for real.			"

Here I am going to tell you the pros, cons, and things that I think you should add to make the game even better!!Pros:~The graphics are amazing, and the water is a real amount of murky when it needs to be.~The camera feature is amazing, and the pictures that are taken are breath taking.~The camera feature allows you to take a ""selfie"" with the wreck or something.~The looks of the sharks, dolphins, and fish are beautiful!~The wrecks of the ships look so realistic!~The custimazation is plentiful.~The buddy thing is adorable, and I can't wait to get enough to buy one.~The hand signals are super accurate.Cons:~A bit laggy at some points, mainly with the multiplayer.~Requires a secondary login, which some people hate. (I was okay with it, and I think it was totally worth it)~Whilst it is meant to be a relaxing game, the murky waters can make it a little scary for more anxious people.Advice to make the game better:~Whilst it may be meant to be a relaxing game, i think it would be better to add more territorial and vicious creatures.~Caves that you could swim in and find money would be cool.~A selling feature so that you could sell your pearls and other stuff.~Collectable items that you could collect, sell, and get information on.~A book that you can access while playing in the menu or something to give you information on the wreck and the creatures you can find.~Being able to walk on the beaches and set up a camp.~To go along with the above feature, there should be a fishing feature to let you spear fish and stuff to get and cook food just for fun.That's all for me, and I hope that this helped you if you were considering to buy it. Have fun, and I highly recommend this  game. See ya!                                                                                     ^PEACE^			"

								Purchased this game when it first came out, Played around with it for a little bit, checked back from time to time to check on updates. Nothing. This game is pretty well given up on. Since it was added to steam the only new things that were added was a shop ingame to buy cosmetics. Not worth buying unless you just like the soothing sound of water and swimming around with no goals. Wouldnt bother with this one.			"

								Update 13.10.2016A year has passed and it's time to see whats new. This time i can say that there have been some changes! A mission structure has been added. No longer can you start new levels from the menu before enough tasks has been completed in the previous. It took about an hour to complete the tasks in tutorial level, before another map opened. These tasks are the worst kind of fetch quests that make you go from A to B and back to A so much, that i wrote my notes while playing with the other hand. This also speaks about how much input the swimming requires. I had to force myself to complete it. There are still ""Coming soon"" notes around but not as much. Maybe it's because most of the content is no longer available from the start and i'll never waste the time required to open the later levels. A load of collectables have been added to the levels. In the tutorial alone, there are 118 pieces of treasures, 8 pearls and 271 pieces of trash. I collected a total of about 90 while playing and was rewarded with nothing. The collectables make no sense anyway, since they are mostly the same and placed seemingly at random.Camera has been changed from DSLR type to a tablet style device. This brings needless issues with the UI since the device also acts as main menu, mission list etc and it's hard to land on the thing you want. You can no longer leave the camera floating and take selfies with it, which was one of my favourite things a year ago. I cant remember if zooming and other things were in the game a year ago, but they are no longer. The camera in it's current state is really limited.The game runs fine now even at highest settings but the terrain twists and bends as the player gets closer and more detail is added. This seems really odd since the draw distance is really low underwater anyway and even at it's best World of Diving looks dated. Currently the game has no shadows anywhere. Not just real time shadows, even the pre-calculated shadows of stationary objects are missing. This makes the game look really flat and dull.Fishes react to the player but not as creatures with AI. Instead a magical force pushes them away from the player without any regard to the direction the fish was facing. Also they have no problems swimming through rocks. It looks hilarious when a fish is suddenly pulled away sideways and the look on it face is just as baffled as is the players.Character customization has new gear again, but they don't seem to affect gameplay. What is the point of adding a weight belt when it has no impact on swimming? Also the gear is bugged and with a classic helmet (think big daddies from bioshock) obscures the pictures taken with camera, but not your view while swimming. Even without special gear, swimming backwards in an angle let's you see inside the divers face.Options are as bare bones as they were a year ago. No control mapping, no sound options etc. Now there is an option to 3d print your character, which is nice i guess. The game also supports VR but since i don't have the gear, i wasn't able to test it.My recommendation from year ago still stands but now i can say that World of diving is a work in progress with some progress. Forwards or backwards is whole another thing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review 25.10.2015World of Diving has a great idea: It let's you dive in realistic setting and around interesting landmarks like the wreck of Bismarck. Unfortunately in it's current state idea is the only thing it has.Biggest issue is that there has been very little progress since i bought this game a year ago. Wreck of Bismarck is a key selling point for this game. What happens when you try to dive under deck? ""This area is not available yet"". Some oysters you can open and find pearls inside, others just say ""This oyster requires a tool to open (coming soon)"". These two things you will see just after five minutes of gameplay and it has been like this for a year. So what has changed during the year? Framerate is much better than what it was a while ago. There are new diving suits. Also there is one new map which is different from the rest in it's setting and is kind of interesting.Graphics are just not good enough for this kind of game. This game needs a lot of work with light and shadow for it to have any kind of mood or atmosphere. For example your flashlight only lights but doesn't create shadows. Also, darkness really isn't dark: You will have no problems seeing inside a shipwreck with no natural light or flashlight. Those places should be pitch black! Movement does not kick up dust or anything like that, which would also be nice. Atleast in it's current state it runs well.The maps are quite boring aswell. For example you can dive inside some shipwrecks and in it are okay looking walls and maybe something like a torpedo bay but all the little things are missing. This means all signs that someone has lived there: No tools, no tin cans, no bottles, no cutlery, no clothes, nothing. The places are just empty shells. Real joy of i guess diving but atleast exploring lost places is the little stories that your mind creates from all of the items and their relations to places. Nothing like that is in this game. This also makes the photography part of the game meaningless since you can't create stories with it either.Options for graphics and such are just not there either. Can you adjust brightness? No. Can you adjust sound levels? No. Can you change key bindings? No. At the time of this review World of Diving is still very much a work in progress with little signs of progress. If you are interested, wait. Do not buy yet. If you just have to play a diving game, click the ""More like this"" button insted of ""Add to cart"".If you are still not sure then check the forums here and on the official website. See how active they are and what people are talking about.			"

								First of all: if this game releases, I will play it and love it!But it seems that this game will never release. There are no updates, even no devblogs anymore. The developers only work on interface and fish AI, I mean guys, please try to complete the main part of the game! An interesting map and story, but not graphics and fish AI!As I already mentioned, they now fully stopped to post devblogs. I think because there are not working anymore on the game.It will be forever ""Early Access"".I am really sorry for this, I bought the game because I am a diver and I wanted a good game, but I spend 20€ for nothing...If I am wrong, please correct me.Daniel			"

								I've played this game for a good amount of time and i must say the following:Alot of bad reviews that got on top, things i do and don't agree with.Most of these reviews were placed earlier this month/year and alot had changed since then!All with all i'd like to say that the game has changed a lot in a good way.the game let's you play in a relaxed beautifully crafted atmosphere with many fish and surroundings to explore in nice graphics! I do agree the game may seem to stay in early acces as it is, since the devs are busy on another game that needs their attention more for the time being, but i personally like the game as it is for vive aswell as 2D, especially for the price it costs. Ofcourse the game got it's pro's and cons wich i won't really have to go over since other reviews all get close to what i experienced in the game itself so theres no real reason to, but i have to say that the company did a great job overall!If you like relaxing games that don't have or accuire action in them, i really recommend this game, especcialy if you have a vive, Go get it!

								World of Diving despite it's early access state has become one of my favorite games. Why? because it's so damned chill. I have never been more relaxed playing a game than i have this title. You create a diver and carry out missions. That's the gist of it. But the presentation is what kills it. The graphics are very smooth looking and you really feel as though you are diving somewhere in the pacific with not a care in the world other than making sure your camera is ready to take those snaps when you need to. The developer and community mission makers take care of the rest. You can customize your diver with cool bling as well. I was getting so relaxed i had to make a cup of java to keep my eyes open and that wasn't because i was bored. I was quite content to just swim around and check out the many species of fish that populate each map. Well worth the money. I can just imagine how awesome this game is going to be when it's finished. 5 out of 5 stars, without reservation.			"

								World of Diving is quite simply the best looking dive simulation. With a strong community to match, this game will force the genre to step up its game to match.World of Diving is currently in Alpha so my review may change. This game not only involves the simulation itself but also a vibrant online community and forum structure. The forums are filled with experienced real world divers, hardcore gamers, glitch finders, and people who simply wish they could dive in real life. But the one thing they all share is a desire to assist the developers Vertigo Games - create one of the best looking and best playing dive simulations on the market.As far as the game itself - it already looks beautiful even without any sort of optimization. This facet can only get better with the addition of a day/night cycle and environmental effects. However, as a person who has grown up on the beaches in South Florida, I can tell you one thing... they have captured the lifestyle perfectly so far. Water effects like ripple and water light diffusion are spot on. And diving to a deep wreck already conjures up a feeling of excitement as you get closer and closer, and it finally comes into view. Wrecks themselves have very early versions of their final textures - the last major update changed them dramatically from before. Yet they do have some weight to them - it feels like the objects have been underwater for some time.Fish interaction is nearly nonexistent - however, there are flashes of greatness - Dolphins playing and following divers to a wreck - Fish scattering if a shark swims into their school - Some fish not being overly concerned about the presence of a diver and others seeking safer places if you even look at them wrong.Overall, it is a promising alpha - and I encourage all fans of diving to join us in the World of Diving.

								Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, just a few flaws. The game's animation is not bad, kinda original, the game can be glitched in quite easily done ways, and the story, quests, and overall idea is played out pretty fast, easily boring. There is no actual story in my opinion, while the quests are great, they're just repeating sometimes, for example: You must take pictuers of certain animals, which is done multiple times and is boring to a high extent, thus making it less fun. When it comes to the animals and seas to explore, the animals are good, just not that many, out of the infinite amount of life, they choose such original and normal animals, making it less creative. The seas are animated and detailed well, just they are plain other than the animals and occasional ships and wrecks you find. In my opinion, this is one of the more glitchy ocean exploring games I have seen, you can glitch into stuff, and many things don't work, atleast the way you want them to. Last is, this game is confusing, in the beginning I had no idea what was going on, no idea what to do, how to build tubes, the main place you spawn is just confusing, it needs better explaining, it's just a slightly modified version of a lot of ocean dive games, DEPTH, Subnautica, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a reluctant recommendation of the game in its current state of developement.I'm reluctant to recommend because I'm finding it difficult to get excited to play the game and I'm finding its limitations of movement to be frustrating.You can't alter your axis and swim sideways which can be very odd underwater especially when swimming along the length of a sunken ship. I'd like to be able to turn to face the ships orientation and drag myself along certain objects and the lack of this makes that freedom of being underwater further away from how you actually feel in the game.The most frustrating part for me is that I see this as an MMO, not the usual MMO though, it's a Massively Missed Oportunity. If you've ever watched the TV show 'Tanked' you'll likely know what I'm getting at here. The living eco system in our seas is sorely missing from this game. The graphics are more in line with those aquariums in the show where the customer doesn't have enough time or knowledge to be able to look after a 'real life' aquarium with living rock and coral being substituted with acrylic, silicone, rubber, painted pieces that are too bright and unnatural.This may be ok for some but for me I'd like to see something closer to a real life reef than the artificial reefs that are used in that show. This day and age I think the devs could aim higher with transparency brought into the fray and annemonies and corals showing some real colours and movement, not these bright pink and blue stuck on cheapo immitations. Under water there's a lack of distance viewing which should have been an opportunity to really cram the details into the surrounding area of your swimming zone. I can't help but feel that the Unity 5 engine may be partially to blame for the lack of this. But I live in hope that the life that is sorely missing for me will be gradually introduced over time with this being still an early access release.From a lifelong marine tank enthusiasts perspective I can't help feeling really disappointed with the lack of realism but at the same time I do enjoy the game, so I have to give it the recommendation for that reason alone. I hope that over time the realism will be introduced to bring us a game that really uses current pc capabilities.			"

								There's potential here but it's not really swaying me.. The world just doesn't feel physical, tons of pop-in and a limited set of lighting conditions that make it feel more like maneuvering a camera around a 3D scene than diving into the ocean. Repetitive camera missions and ""easter egg hunts"" do it no service. Endless Ocean on the Wii was more immersive than this, no pun intended.A shame, because the developers do seem to have the right idea. It's just not there yet.			"

But I love it! A game where you can't die. And even a better feature! (Might change) There is no chat yet wich sounds anoying and it particly is. But there are no anoying people and it's fun to comunicate with the hand signals that you can make.The game is in a very early stage and it has bugs and more problems but a good thing is that there is a nice community that nicely points this out to the devolpers that accept it with open arms. The devs are good people really pushing to get a good result, and the result is not clear yet because they are asking us. The community what we want, for example when you load up the map there is a little message where you can vote on the next thing they will develop!All with all the game is in a very early stage but with this community and these devs there is nothing to worry about aslong as you speak out to them.If you are thinking about buying this game then think by yourself if you would like a relaxing game, where there is no pressure of being good fast or anything.

								I got this game not knowing what to expect. I had my doughts about it,  but after playing it, it quickly became clear that it had potential. As a diver in real life, I was really quite impressed with the detail put into the equipment and environments. Of course, the game is still very muh in early access, so don't buy it if you don't want to play something unpolished. The way that early access games have been going lately, we can't be sure how this will turn out, but I have faith in the developers and am exited to see where they take this game.P.S. There aren't many people playing this game currently, so if you want, feel free to add me on steam so we can play some.			"

								Bought this game because my daughter loves Ocean Rift and this game looked like it was a bigger version of that. I'm pleased that I wasn't off the mark. The Oculus really makes the game shine. Movement feels pretty realistic, some bugginess at times, but it is early access. Wildlife AI I could do with some fish being more curious or more interaction other than run away. I'm glad the sharks aren't there as an ""enemy"". Sharks can be dangerous, but generally don't care about people unless they scare or♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. But...more than anything...poked a dolphin in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 99/10.			"

								Very fun diving simulator for an Early Access game. Dive in with other divers (or by yourself) to search for treasure and sunken wrecks and also defy the laws of physics by diving down to 4700 meters below sea level (and @ > 70,000 pounds per square inch).			"

								Well, World of Diving is very relaxing. Sadly also very boring after a while. You cant die or get injured, theres no pressure or stress in any Form (besides some easy Timelimits at the Challenges.) you cant hunt or kill fish, you cant run out of Oxygen. You can swim and dive around, do Challenges, take Pictures with your Camera, collect Pearls and Doubloons which you need to unlock some extra Character Customization, or just enjoy watching at some well animated Sealife. World of Diving is a Casual Game, not a Diving Simulator  Positive:  + The Controls are easy to understand and use.+ You can customize your Character+ Mission Editor with some hilarious options.+ No Violence, so the Game is also good for younger Children.+ Oculus Rift Support~ Graphics and Lighteffects are okay. But not really impressive.~ The Playtime value is about 5 Hours. Then you should have seen everything. After that you only play for Achievements, do repetitive ""swim there, take Pictures""-Challenges and then you might keep playing in the hope for new features.  Negative:	 -The Game could need some more different Species, like Crabs, Lobsters, Sea urchinJellyfish,... or in general a higher population, cause some Areas of the Game feel like a ""Death Zone"",  theres nothing to see besides Sand, Rocks, Plants, Corals and Anemones.   - The Game is in Early Access, so theres Hope to see some things in the Future. -- There is a Multiplayer Mode, but for now i havent seen many other People.- You can communicate only via Handsigns. NO IN GAME CHAT... - There is a Brony Ship in the Game. Yeah you heard me right. - Another big issue of the Game is the Price. You pay 19,99€ for an Indie Game that still has a form of Moneytization inside. Even if its just for cosmetic Items, this system just avoids having a larger Playerbase, and kills the Game.- When the Servers are down, you cant even play the Singleplayer ModeSo far i havent seen any Bugs (besides some video/texture glitches), the ability to ""swim"" on Land seems to be an Easteregg. ) I got nothing really negative to say about this Game at the Moment, besides the mentioned Points that need to be worked on . (Add more Sealife, Text or Audiochat...)  Well, i changed my mind about that.the actually Playerbase consists of about 10 active players and its really boring to have a Multiplayer game without a voice or text chat.  I hate to say it so honest, i had a blast with this Game while i had hope that there will be more Players more Features, but now im afraid that this Project is almost Dead.So ichanged my Review from positive to negative.  [/b] Unless there will be large changes like the removal of the dumb Moneytization which scares away most customers, and adding an additional in Game chat,  i can not recommend this Game for 19,99€ "

								First-person bikini wearing simulator of the year 2014.Now that that's out of the way, this isn't really something you should get if you're looking for an intense underwater action/survival experience. Because there is not either of those things. It's just sort of there for you to relax and swim around exploring the underwater environments. And it does its job excellently. Most things are quite detailed and the graphics are rather good. On the other hand, it can and will bore you very quickly. Worth the $20 to pre-order from their website? Absolutely.			"

								 This game is a virtual diving sensation. With the new update you get Oculus Rift support as well. So far missions include taking 'selfies' & snapshots of items of interest & treasure hunting for dubloons & pearls with your cool new metal detector. There are some new areas to explore as well like the shipwreck of the renowned WWII german battleship 'Bismarck'.  The game has a great character customization UI with some really cool looking equipment and skins. It's developers are very interactive with the community & there are some very cool community based missions already included & playable. Multiplayer is also a treat with a variety of underwater hand gestures to communicate with. I'd like to see more points earned for multiplayer co-op based missions. I would also like the idea of having to check & refill your limited oxygen tanks in real-time. Oh well, I guess I'll have to visit the game's forum & post my ideas.  Speaking of forums, their forum is point based so more interaction & mission completion earns you more diving points although I still haven't found out what the point system earns you yet. All in all, I'm definitely giving this title more well deserved diving time.			"

								Disclamer: I recieved this product for free(I am reviewing my VIVE expierence, I used full room VR)I freaking love this game, it's really pretty and relaxing to just swim around and hangout! my first time entering the ocean I was scared as heck, because I guess I have a phobia or somthing of vast emptyness, but once I got the curage to finally go out into the ocean I had a blastI was just swimming and snapping pic of fishies and ETC. my only gripe about the game is the ""quest"" and the unlocking. Th e quest are kinda boring and dont really have any need, and to unlock new levels you have to do quest, but I soldiered on to unlock the next area, and boy oh boy is it pretty. I freaking love this game even if it is kinda terrifying.			"

								Back when computers had just started becoming a household item, there was a lot of excitement about what might be and what would be, given time. This game is a fulfillment of that kind of promise personal computers had. My memory isn't perfect, but if I didn't hear someone longingly talk of someday being able to ""explore underwater worlds"" once, then it's only because I heard it more than once. And here we are; the future has become the present.I love aquatic biomes and the ability to visit one so detailed as this when I'm unable to do so in real life is something I adore having. The diversity of life you find in the waters of World of Diving necessarily doesn't equal what you'd see in an actual ocean, but there is enough variety that it stays interesting. As far as the fish go, they're so impressively detailed that you can easily tell their species at a glance if you know them in real life. And their behavior seems to differ slightly by species, as well.The sunken ships and the like are interesting and seem to be very well done. Those aren't as interesting to me as natural formations and flora and fauna, so I can't say much more than that about them. Well, I do remember that as I went through one sunken ship looking for Jack-o-Lanterns around Halloween, I remarked that the ship itself was a horror movie waiting to happen. Spooky. These sunken ships (and one plane, I believe) are often the hub or target of some of the available missions.This is such a beautiful experience and if you came looking at it with any hint of interest in the first place, you couldn't go wrong with it.

								A great game that is really nice to chill out on, unfortunately not that much content yet but for an early access game it is enough to keep you occupied for a decent amount of time.However the currency system seems a little bit broken as the dubloons can't reaaly be viable for purcasing things due to the amount needed for items, the pearls are solid but there is only a limited amount available at this stage which makes customization very limited unless you wanna buy pearls with real money which seems od as you have to buy the game in the first place.All in all though this game is a real breath of fresh air from all the shooty shooty killy killy games we have now a days, I highly reccomend this game because of this and just how calming it is swimming with friends investigating ship wrecks.

Early Access Review
								This game is still in early access, and the genre is not a usual type you might play; one of exploring underwater areas and collecting things, but it has many perks and a few drawbacks at this time that I will point out.-Beautiful graphics for an indie developer, solid design concept-When you first start playing the areas are vast and you will easily get lost exploring if it was not for your handy dive computer-If you have the coin($1500)  you can fund the design of your own shipwreck, name it, dive it, and the incredible community will gladly throw in ideas on the forums to help you along.-Community wrecks, the members all thrown down some money and when it reaches 1500 bucks we get designed with OUR ideas, our own community shipwreck to dive and explore.-Levels with increased rewards at each one with the goal being crowned, A POSEIDON!-Amazingly helpful, respectful and mature players in game and on the forums.-The dive shop gives you a vast amount of items to pick from cosmetically.-Very active and informative forums, that if visited each day reward you not only with daily XP, but the comraderie of the community-The endless possibilities this game has if the developer keep going are amazing, sandbox generated dive areas, with multiplayer sessions galore, doing races and games together underwater.-Did I mention the community is awesome?!CONS-We have been waiting for a huge update for quite a few months-The inability to communicate at this time in game.-Once you have played it daily for 6 months it lacks content until they release procedurally generated maps and more content.Overall this is a must buy for 12 bucks! You will have the chance of being part of a community that truly gets input into what the devs do in the game, new wrecks and community and player wrecks, in all my time gaming I have never witnessed a dev team try so hard to please the players. Easily worth the buy to be a part of this great community and watch a game you have a hand in grow.			"

Early Access Review
								World of Diving is a fun, neat game about, well, diving. There are various dive sites with plenty of vibrant wildlife and plants. The main focus of each area are shipwrecks. While fun to explore, the wrecks themselves feel small and don't take a while to explore. While being very fleshed out, the dive sites also feel a little small, but this is still early in development. For an early-access game, I came across very, very few bugs. The mission editor is also fun to tinker with and easily lets you fully realize amazing coral reefs. It was also clear to me that the developers are working very hard to improve the game with polls on loading screens allowing you to vote for what content should be added.The core gameplay is simply diving. There are also missions which have you take certain pictures within an allotted amount of time. However, I didn't really come for the missions, they served as fun, little minigames that I did once in a while. The game is very set on experiencing things with a community, and in-game you could make all basic diving gestures.The game does get a little boring sometimes, but I enjoy coming back every so often to explore and look for things that I've mixed. There are in-game currencies, doubloons, and paid-for currencies, pearls, that allow you to get certain gear and even diving buddies. However, these are purely cosmetic.Overall, World of Diving is a fun, interesting game that I look forward to coming back to in the future. I can't wait to see how the game turns out from here and expect nothing but the best. This game has a lot of potential and Oculus Rift support makes the game a must-buy title for Rift users. Diving alone or with friends is a calming experience that is very refreshing coming off of the violence of most video games. This is a game for people who enjoy diving or nature, or are just looking for a cool, little sidegame with no real story elements that they can just pick-up and play without worrying about story elements or character progression.SCORE: 7.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								Update: I'll keep this short and sweet since there's not much to be said. Development on WoD has been painfully slow since I got this game a few months ago with very little actually being added to the game. The most recent update broke the game so the devs reverted back to an older update which is also broken. Despite my playtime and my original review the game is incredibly boring and bland, perhaps looking at it in hindsight is what has made me change my mind but there's very little to do apart from swim around and take Screenshots and the different maps don't really change anything. Furthermore there's very little communication from the devs apart from, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""we're a very small team and most of our studio is focused on three other projects so it's hard for us to get things done"" which you can see for yourself on one of the Steam forum discussions about this game being dead.On top of all this the game is now riddled with bugs and issues, many of which are game breaking for people trying to play it. None of the updates the devs are working on address any of these issues and each update seems to bring more and more issues to the game. WoD is a great example of Early Access done wrong and you should steer clear of this title until development picks up and interesting content is actually present in the game.Original Review: World of Diving is a diving simulator game that is currently available through Steam Early Access. In World of Diving you take to the water at a number of different locations ranging from a diving school (and the surrounding waters) to a sunken WWII ship. World of Diving has both multiplayer and singleplayer but due to the lack of players I've only experienced the singleplayer.This game does include microtransactions but everything in the game's store can be purchased with in-game money (if you can be bothered to collect the stupid amounts necessary).+Great graphics+Extremely relaxing to play+A number of different dive tools to help you out+Community challenges are well intergrated into each map+A reasonable amount of maps at the moment+There are some really cool cosmetic items in the shop if you like that kind of thing+Wildlife is well designed and they seem to behave quite realistically +Easy to use mission editor+/-Sea predators, such as sharks, pose no threat to you. It benefits how relaxing the game is but it does take away from the realism+/-Apart from some pretty unimaginative challenges which have you take pictures of things there's not much to do which is fine if you just want to have a relaxing experience but makes the game get boring quite quickly-Progress on this game is painfully slow, the devs do release weekly devblogs (which just show how little they get done each week) but it has been a very long time since the game actually got an update-Itemshop prices (whether you're using real currency or in-game currency) are way too high-Currently oxygen needs aren't in the game so you don't have to worry about your oxygen levels, takes away from the game's realism-The game has a 'brony' level. Whether you are a fan of bronies or not this map really breaks the realism of the game as of course you wouldn't find such a thing in the real world-The maps are very small and the wrecks within the maps also feel a bit too smallVerdict:6A nice diving game with great visuals that is let down by painfully slow updates and its lack of realism, I'd suggest buying this on sale and playing with friends.El K.

								This game is ok. It's pretty much a coin hunting/picture taking simulator. I was bored within 10 minutes. Plus the shop is kinda skeezy. Subnautica is much better and prettier. If you have to choose between the two, get Subnautica.			"

Early Access Review
								Seems to be another ""permanently early access"" game (""early access"" for nearly 2 years now), and abandoned.Save your money.Edit:I re-installed this game to see if anything had changed with the recent updates.I originally bought this game (some time ago), because it seemed from the advertising that it was a pleasant casual game that you could fire up when it suited you to relax and swim around in an attractive and pleasant underwater environment. - kind of like a ""walking simulator"" game but underwater.And I originally uninstalled it because when I first played it, I could not get past the initial timed tasks to photograph star-fishes. (You had to do this in order to unlock the access to the rest of the game). I quit because it seemed rather stupid to lock the main game if you couldn`t complete this mandatory (and quite pointless) task. I got bored because I could not progress, but I figured that the game was in early release and would improve so I`d come back to it.Seems I was wrong. It`s exactly the same.This time I forced myself to swim around in circles endlessly until I had found and photographed all the flipping star fishes, persuaded 3 angel fish to hold still long enough to occupy a single picture (another mandatory task), and THEN... discovered an exit from the underwater glass tube... Yippee! (I thought...), I had entered the main environment/game.After swimming around for a while I came to the following conclusion:- ""Ray"" (the scuba shop/island paradise proprieter), needs sacking.If what I saw is a representation of a tropical paradise then I`m quite glad I live in suburbia because Rays island and reef is RANK.It`s disgusting...Bin bags full of god knows what, (Bodies? - drowning kittens? old picnic`s?), everywhere , empty bottles, old gas cannisters, oil drums, spent batteries etc.After swimming and walking around for ages and picking up over 50 pieces of trash I`d seen enough (especially after seeing my ""statistics"" which reliably informed me there were hundreds MORE pieces of trash to pick up....I decided that this game should really be re-named ""ocean trash hunt"" as that seems to be all you have to do in it.Sooooo..Uninstalled again... and still not recommended.BTW.  if you want to see an underwater game done RIGHT, - grab Abzu, it`s miles ahead of this.

								I am truly sorry.  I owe the developers an apology.  I wrote this very negetive review when I first bought the game and could not get it to start.  Although I've had computers most of my life I never knew I had to update video drivers.  As soon as I did this game and another one (subnautica) loaded up perfectly.  I haven't played much yet but this is a beautiful looking game and I can't wait to get into it.To the devs I apologise for my ignorance.			"

								World of Diving not only is an awesome game, but it also turns into a really beautiful screensaver when left unattended.This is another one of those games you'll probably either love or hate. If you are into diving, or interested in diving, this may be a game for you to check out. Otherwise you may be put off by the relatively slow pace and lack of action.Pros:Diving without getting wet.Diving without getting eaten by sharks.Unlimited oxygen-supply.Cons:It's cool, but not as cool as real diving.Diving without your significant other getting eaten by sharks.

								This game is just what i thought i was getting, diving in an really nice see with all kinds of fish.The surroundings are nicely made and i think this is going to be one of the ""games"" I'm going to show to my family that isn't font of super high action games.The movement is something that needs you go get used to, I often need to make a quick sidestep not to fall.My wife cant play it for to long, she is getting dizzy of this mechanic (not sick!)There is a nice way to gain points and progress in the game, that makes you visit a spot for multiple reasons. I like that!All in all, i'd recommend this game if you are looking for some nice looking game to calm yourselves.			"

								As much as I want to give this game a good review, i really can't for the following reasons:1. Graphics are not very good (i have seen a similar game on GearVR with ++ on graphics).2. Not very immersive, kinda directly affected by 1.3. Not very much to see, the area to explore are like 300 meters or so.4. Graphics+content doesn't really justify the price of this game, even though it's an alpha/beta. I did expect more because the game has been available for a long time.-it's important to rememba dat graphics are da golden rul' 'bout gamin'			"

								Good start, I mean graphically it is breathtaking (normal you are underwater)... But I hope it will evolve to contain more simulation related difficulty, like limited air supply, depth and pressure management, ability to breath normal air on the surface. And maybe a smooth transition to and out of the water, rather than a loading screen. Still I reccommend to buy and support this game. We also need those times where the PC takes us out of his world in a peacefull, poetic and differnet way! Cheers, splash!			"

								World of Diving is worth buying if you are looking for a game that is all about exploration and not much actual gameplay. Other than swimming around, the only actual gameplay is doing short little challenges that mostly consist of taking pictures of different things. It could turn into something great, but there isn't much content for the time being for the general person to buy it just yet.Some gameplay of it:

Early Access Review
								World of Diving is a first person diving and exploration game with challenge elements. In its current state, it’s quite clearly early access, missing a large portion of content and functions, although what is there is looking relatively promising.Overall it’s hard for me to really recommend World of Diving as it currently stands. Although I rather enjoyed my time with the game, I honestly don’t feel that in its current state that it’s justifiable as a purchase. Perhaps once some more polishing up of the optimisation and addition of more mechanics, I could have a much easier time giving it a recommendation. However, I would certainly keep it on your watch-list if the idea of an interactive diving exhibition interests you, because it certainly has some potential, it just has a little way to go yet.For some extra info, there is a video preview below:

								Since this game is still in developpment, it is not easy to give a review.The project changes a lot and the dev team frequently add and remove features because of logistical or technical reason. The community is very active on the forum and gives a lot of feedback, some of their members pressing the dev team to go forward faster than they can manage. The dev team tried to rush things because of that and the result was catastrophic. They came with a half finished adaptation of their game on the new game engine they worked on. Half demonstration, half game. It was a fail. Now they work on their own pace and build up the game again and the half game is becoming a whole game again, slowly.Indeed this project will not be finished in 2015. They have a todo list untill may 2016 at least.So : I strongnly advise NOT to buy this game now if you want a finished game. It is permanently changing and you will always be disappointed. The project is great and a lot of ideas already came through, but a lot didn't, some has been cancelled, or at least frozen. Other has been worked hard and are almost finished and results can already be seen. Anyhow, buy this game in early access only if you have strong backbone and wishes to see a game in developpement with a lot of broken features. Wait for the final release if you wish a brand new polished game : the dev team showed they were able to create a fine working game... They could, so they still can.But be honest with yourself before you buy it. This game is not expensive : $20 at the moment I am writing this review. You'll pay more for less, but you'll pay less for more too.If you wish to spend a little time with people wishing to go forward : dive in. Water is hot and fishes are colorful. If you wish to play a game of the same quality and professionalism than call of duty... Just walk out. It will never be that great. The dev team is a small dev team with humble capacities... But they have a strong resolution and no hidden agenda...That's more than a lot of greenlight games but that's less than all AAA game.This game is not Metal Gear. This game is not Mass Effect. This game is not Subnautica.But this game is a project that will go through. There is no doubt about that. Whether you will be amongst us or not is up to you.I RECOMAND this game but not to everyone. If you don't have an experimental brain, forget it and come back next year.			"

								Absolute Crap.  Would not run in true VR mode.  Only in the big screen TV mode within Rift.  Tried to start a game and my character just stood in a dive shop.  Couldn't move.  Oh yeah, and while they stood there, the sound effects and visuals were of them being under water.  Breathing through the regulator... bubbles, etc; while standing in a dive shop!  I don't mind paying a bit of money for a game still under development... especially for something as cutting edge as the Rift.  However, wasting $20 on something that I would not even consider an alpa... that pisses me off.  Navigating the menus didnt even work right!  Wow... just.... wow.			"

								Vertigo does an exceptional job simulating the diving experience either with or without the Oculus VR enhancement. It may even be too realistic; I looked forward to exploring a seemingly endless ocean floor like in Ecco the Dolphin or even Treasures of the Deep to a lesser extent, but World of Diving offers a more organized, site-specific experience. With only a few maps to explore at this point, this will be another test for the Early Access development machine.http://zbronpsn.blogspot.com/2015/02/steam-quickies-2.html "

New tech.  11/10 now!!Absolutely love this game!   10/10 as it stands!  Sent the devs a message yesterday about a bug and today it was fixed.  Beat that?- If you love scuba diving in real life and can't wait for your next dive then BUY IT!- If you've never tried scuba but always wanted to then BUY IT!- If you're too scared to try scuba or can't swim then BUY IT and see what you're missing!- If scuba diving doesn't interested you then..... YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!Multiplayer works very well, as does solo.  Lots of things to do (mini-missions) and explore.  Actually feels like you are underwater (I don't have a VR system, just a regular monitor, and it looks incredible - but this game is worth buying Oculus Rift for!)Come and join me for a dive :)			"

								Completely fell in love with this game. After a while I got tired of all the action and decided to go for something less extreme. Sure, the graphics are beautifully extreme but it is so ""chill"" that you cant help but invite friends to play along. If you like to occasionally take a trip from all the booty kicking,  this is for you.	 "

								Really fun and relaxing. Some sound assests can get a little bothersome but other than that a good game to unwind and just enjoy. Devs also are showing an intrest in what the players want which is an all to rare plus. The only down side is i belive there are microtransactions, just a warning for those who will have none of that.			"

								As a PADI license holder I wanted to indulge in one of my passions without all the expenses of scuba-diving in real life. So, I saw this game and it looked just what I wanted, so I bought it. Bad idea.Why? Because this game is still rated as ""Early Access"", but not only has there been NO update in the months I've owned it, the game has also been out for almost TWO YEARS!!!! Two years in early access! That says everything about it's state and fate and I seriously regret I didn't get myself more informed about it before wasting my money.Not only is the game early access, but also feels like it. Very little content, enough bugs and sadly most of the players have left, so you're usually diving alone or, if you're lucky, with another player.There is no reason to believe this game will be ever continued, much less finished, so save your money and go buy something else. Subnautica looks promising, though is also early access so can be another trap, or if you don't mind old graphics, campy dialogue and plot and worse music, but want scuba-diving as realistic as it is possible on a PC, try to find Diver: Deep Water Adventures. That game gave me infinitely more pleasure and enjoyment than WoD ever did.			"

								  World of Diving is a first person underwater exploration game in which you explore the wonders of the ocean.  If you were expecting anything along the lines of Far Sky or an action-style type of game, then you will be dissappointed, as World of Diving is literally an underwater exploration game.  And it's pretty good for what it is.    World of Diving's gameplay is very limited.  You can explore the sea, explore the wrecks of ships, and take pictures.  It is very little to work with, but the game is a state of Early Access, and for the most part, these activities are actually more fun than they sound.  You can explore the sea for treasure to unlock new gear (which is only aesthetic), explore wrecks with a group of people, which is really fun since the wrecks are designed in a nice way, and picture taking is picture taking, though there are challenges, which are nice and spice up the gameplay.    In terms of movement, movement feels very fluid, and feels pretty realistic, it actually makes you feel like your swimming, and it's cool.  In terms of sounds, the game has a very ambient sound design, there isn't music, there are only the sounds of the ocean.  It's very immersive, though it would be cool to see an addition like an MP3 player.  In the graphics department, World of Diving shines.  Everything graphically is pretty beautiful, with the exception of some character animations and dolphin animations.  Besides that, the visuals lock in the feel of realism that the game creates so well in every department.  The  flashlight is also very good, the lighting visuals are superb.  Overall, it is obvious that the devs have a serious passion for what they are creating, and while it is a bit lackluster at the moment, it is still very fun.  If you have ever wanted to explore the ocean without getting wet, World of Diving is the best choice for that experience.			"

								So ....... world of diving this game is by far one of the most enjoyable diving game ive played in a long long time my main reassons for buying this is that I recall the days on the good old PS1 on a game called divers dream now that was an amazing game! you could salvage stuff to sell, explore, rescue trapped divers and even have to defend yourself from the odd terror of the deep here and there it was just perfect and I had hope I would live those days again in World of diving. The short andswer is no ..... well not yet at least but its something I could hope for as this game has tons of potential to be something great it really does. Would a recommend it? Yes I would as you can play and fully enjoy the game as it is and makes for a good casual game to kill some time with.			"

								I've had this game before it ever came to Steam.I bought this game originally apart of the Kick Starter, then it changed to Indiegogo and then the official website, or I could be wrong it was only Indiegogo and then official website (It was a very long time ago)I might have only played very little time but I've been on this game offline mostly without loading through Steam and before the game came to Steam, I had over 50 in the game and wow!This game is beautifully made with some amazing features built in.Graphics: The graphics are really well made with some really nice indepth looking feal the game, it really makes you feel special and like you can almost see a real atmosphere of the game, superb work!Audio: The audio is really good too, which some people might find annoying because of the underwater and little hearing, but that is due to the realism of the game....Controls: The controls might take a little getting used too, they are a little slow at times but you are swimming in tons of water and movement is going to be slow, but overal you can learn them very quick.Game: The game itself is just a simple, chilled sit back and relax game without the usual run and gun mayhem or whatever you are used too.You have the option to dive in some of the most beautiful diving spots in the world and the team behind the game are actual divers aswell, so the realism feel the game is greatly felt when playing, the game is also massively supported by the community offering some amazing feedback, options, dive locations and more.You can dive, take pictures, complete things and even create your own awesome locations to browse around, earn gold and so on to buy some amazing ingame items like yachts and so on and dive from them, in a vast giant ocean.Overal the game deserves more than it is getting and should be up there with the top games because it is very different at heard.Would I recommend this game? Yes in a heart beat, great game, great development.			"

								A couple years ago, I had the fortune to spend a week at a tropical resort with a little fish-filled cove attached to it. I spent every spare moment with my little waterproof camera snapping pictures of all the amazing life under the water, and then I spent days at home happily going through and saving all the photos that turned out, on my computer.That's what this game is, but in larger locales that often include wrecks to explore.If this appeals to you, you'll love it. If it doesn't, move along.No, you can't harpoon whales, wrestle sharks or lasergun aliens. It's fish. And plants. And water. And a camera. Which, if you are not completely warped by the idea that you have to be ""winning"" something in a game, can be incredibly engaging.Play using audio headphones if you don't have a VR headset yet - it will vastly increase your immersion*. I'll be buying the Oculus Rift for this game.*pun intended.Edit: One more thing that will be helpful if you're on the fence. I find that you need an exceptionally good machine to run this game. My little integrated-graphics laptop cannot do it, and it wasn't until very recently that I got it back up and running on my older gen quad core desktop with a 1 GB graphics card. I can run most MMOs I've tried pretty close to max graphics settings, but in this game, have had a lot of lag around the diving base, and it keeps forcing me to lowest, or second-lowest, settings. I love that the graphics have been upgraded since the pre-Steam days when I played regularly, but I do wish there was the ability to turn it down to the graphics levels they had available before.But hey, it's early access, and a lot can happen before Oculus finally releases their consumer headset, right? I do hope Vertigo keeps in mind that a casual sort of game like this needs to be accessible across a wide range of rigs though. A lot of amazing games have shot themselves in the foot by putting visual quality before accessibility.			"

								This game looks very promising as a VR showcase, however, they have to come up with an alternative to using the mouse to rotate the player.  An earlier version used an extended head turn to rotate the player.  That was preferable to using the mouse which is too jerky and causes acute nausea Unfortunately, once a game makes you feel sick, your brain remembers.  Even looking at the video makes me ill now. Thats a real shame as World Of Diving looks really good and is very promising.VR is in it's infancy. There will be a set of Do's and Don'ts clearly defined one day.I will re-visit this game once the VR movement has been improved. "

								I've been following the development of this game for a long while now, and so when it came out, I was thrilled. Great controls, beautiful graphics. Totally want to get an Occulus or VR headset to play this so baddly.Great for a wide audiance, but best for casual gamers I feel. Totally awesome for anyone interested in diving that doesn't yet have the oppertunity to try it IRL yet.			"

								Cannot create a new account in game. Tried creating an account on the website, could not login with that either. Cannot start the game. Is it only Linux, I don't know. Yet another early access getting zero love from me. When/if this problem is fixed I will rewrite this review. I have about a dozen games in my inventory that still (after many months) aren't playable. It's difficult to say what devs use early access as a quick cash grab scheme and who are serious about it. I've seen both good and bad examples on Steam, in particular for the Linux ports.That said, I will continue to support Linux ports in early access with both funding and, given the opportunity, bug reports with whatever information the devs request.

The only controller referred to (and actually displayed) is an X-Box style controller.  Despite that fact it's apparently 'not' a console-port.  I haven't seen any indication that basic keyboard controls will be fixed.			"

								Strictly for HTC Vive VR use. It's a pretty decent VR experience. Considering that Subnautica is currently only for Oculus and has issues working via Revive, WoD is currently the better underwater experience for HTC Vive. The game itself is a little tedious, but as means to experience underwater VR gaming, I'd say it's the best choice. Everything ran smoothly with my GTX 980 cards (I now have GTX 1080 cards) and didn't run into any issues. It's still being improved, so it'll be good to see how World of Diving improves.			"

								Stoked to get a glimpse at the future of VR & its potential in a broader sense. So much to see, so many possibilities, right at your finger tips. Or eye balls. Whichever ;)With the choice Vertigo made to explore diving, a brand new world is opened up to you. The depth of the ocean becomes a lot less intimidating without water pressure on your head & lungs, and the risk of running out of oxygen. ...though, I'm sure witnessing bitey ocean critters would still scare me personally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, if I get there.I'm pretty sensitive to VR-induced nausea so I can't play for long stretches at a time, but I'm glad I can enjoy it occasionally!Plus, when I got distracted by a phone call for a minute or two, the elevator music at the surface didn't manage to bore me yet ;) (Aka: The environmental/ambient sounds in general are pretty great!)

								Apparently, people didn't like my original review. So let me try this again with more elaboration. I'm not deleting and re-typing a new review so all my upvotes and downvotes will remain from the previous review.The atmosphere, the graphics, the feeling of actually being there swimming and diving is excellent and top notch. The game itself, though, is hardly there.Your character can be somewhat customized and upgraded as you play and earn virtual currencies. The charcater models and textures are excellent. This game has one of the best first person views of any game. If I had a VR set it would only multiply how awesome it is to see my flippers and hands and chest and even my groin while swimming around. Top-Notch stuff there.There are very well detailed enviroments and every level/map/zone is different than each other keeping that part fresh and unique. Each level/map/zone, though very detailed, are relatively small. In comparison they are about the size of a Dragon Ball Xenoverse stage (which is not very big), possibly even compared to a Quake III standard map size.The ""game"" part of this game consist of mini tasks like snapping photos collecting objects like tedious fetch quests. Follow the marker and do the obvious.I think what I was more expecting from this game was a casual exploration game where maybe I could catalog stuff and aquatic life and just swim around in a large(er) space than what the game has to offer. Especially if the game has VR support that'd be what I want to do the most. The wonder, the awe, and the getting lost in underwater exploration factors are just not there.Yeah I know the game is still Early Access. But after so many years it just needs more TLC than it gets. If the game had some larger maps and just a basic free roam mode I would change my recommendation.Good day.			"

I look at this shop as I log into the game each time, and each time Ive wanted to visit it less and less.			"

								I like this software.  I won't call it a game though because it isn't really in my opinion.  It gives me a sensation very similar to how I rember diving (although tha was a few years ago now since I last went).  If you wan't a 'game' though I would have to agree with the other not so positive reviews that it isn't much of one.Now, the reason I'm pipeing up is because I want to say WHY ARE (THE DEVELOPERS) NOT DEVEOLOPING THIS OR A NEW VERSION INTO THE BEST DIVING EXERPERANCE POSSIBLE IN VR??  VR is just made for diving and there are billions of devs out there trying everything and anything to find out what works and what doesn't and diving WORKS but no one is doing anything about it.  Subnautica is just a game (an irritating one at that in my opinion).  World of Diving is the only thing close and you guys (devs) are doing god knows what but seemingly not making the most of the VR oportunity. "

								This is a good game for the Vive, especially if you need to ease non-VR players into a movement-based Vive game. It's beautiful, the maps are suitably different and nicely laid out, the fish are fun to watch. Downside: there's very little content. At this point (Early Access) it's still basically a sandbox world with a few photo missions and that's it. The world and gameplay are solid, even on the Vive, but aside from swimming around looking at things, there's just not much to *do* in the game. I was hoping this would be a replacement for Endless Ocean: Blue World, and I think it has the potential to be, but for now it's just a very pretty sandbox.Still, there's more content coming so I'm optimistic about what World of Diving will become. And it's a good game to show off your Vive if you have people nervous about getting attacked by sharks; nothing really bothers you in this game so your VR-timid relations can swim around without any inconvenient jump-scares.
