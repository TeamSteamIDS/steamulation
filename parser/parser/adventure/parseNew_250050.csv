												Interesting mix of platforming and puzzle gameplay. You know you got something special when I couldn't exit the game until I finished every challenge on the first 20 levels. Still itching for more.Edit: I just finished the game and I can say for sure it's a must-buy if you love puzzle games and platformers. Most of the puzzles are on the easy side though, but there is still some challenge to be had here with some of the optional objectives. Absolutely love the music!			"

												I was asked to check out Life Goes On for my first impressions video series. I'm very glad I was as it's a very imaginative puzzler that I've continued playing in my off time as a result of enjoying it so much. The game has a much needed sense of humour about things (since otherwise you're just commiting mass puzzle solving murder) and is a lot of fun. The puzzles themselves vary a bit in terms of difficulty but once you get a grip on the mechanics I don't think you'll ever get frustrated to the point of giving up. New mechanics get introduced with each new location you visit also, such as being able to freeze your knights or make them levitate.If you're curious to see it in action my first impressions video can be seen below.

												As the trailer suggests, this game is a humorous cross between puzzle platformer and lemmings, where you take advantage of the deaths of your predecessors to progress through the different levels.With an unlimited number of knights at your disposal, you control one until it dies, then another, and so on, and on each try to die in a way that your corpse will be of some benefit to your next knight. But doing well at a level means using fewer knights (wouldn't want them to die in vain, right? ;)Progressing in the game uses more of your puzzle skills than your platforming skills, and for considering you will only be using 3-4 buttons, the game gets surprisingly complex.Completing the various levels and achievements feels reasonably satisfying, and it can be amusing to overcome any obstacle by throwing numerous knights at it in various ways.The game contains several references to other games, most of which I found quite amusing, but more than anything else I found myself laughing out loud at many of the messages describing how varyingly successful I had been at the end of each level.

												This game is just the kind of fun puzzle game that needed to be made. With so many games concentrating on the aspect of keeping your player alive this one does the 180 and you NEED death in order to succeed.Each knight is named just so that you can get the brief moment of attachment before you send him on his way to die in the name of winning.This company for being a small company knows what it means to value your and interact with players even before the game was made. They were at a local expo before the game came out and you could write a knight name you would hope to exist and even do death screams that could potentially be added to the game.10/10 company and game			"

												As someone who frequently dies in video games, this game is wonderful. Dying is expected, necessary, and actually fun in this game. It's simple to understand, but solving the puzzles efficiently is challenging enough to make it fun without being ridiculously difficult. Life Goes On is definitely a game that everyone should try.

Note: video review embedded below.I took me a long time to pin down exactly what it was that felt so strange about Life Goes On. I knew it wasn’t just the morbid nature of repurposing your corpses as puzzle solving tools, bizarre and unsettling as that is. And it wasn’t that there was something wrong with the puzzle themselves, because even with this odd feeling swirling around inside of me I was having a grand time solving them.When I finally figured out what had been bugging me, it was both surprising and a little amusing. With how deeply the concept of death has been incorporated and mechanicalized in games, and then instilled in me through years of playing them, I realized Life Goes On felt off because it was doing precisely the opposite of what I’d been trained to do above all else: stay alive. With how many countless grotesquely violent and gore fill games I’ve played I’ve become rather horrifyingly numb to using violence as a mechanic against others, but through all of those keeping myself alive was always the objective above all else.To do otherwise in most games is to effectively stop playing. Death is simply failure by another name, often meaningless but nearly always present and in some cases even romanticized as one of a game’s most notorious traits (Dark Souls being an obvious example). Life Goes On asked that I rethink the concept of death and in doing so it made it mean something again. Each time one of my knights died I felt an odd mixture of joy at being able to move forward, and distress at the very thought I was taking pleasure from leading my character to the slaughter.What’s special about Life Goes On is that it doesn’t treat death the way so many modern games do. It’s not cynical, graphic, or intended to shock and appal you. It’s more like a cartoon where someone gets an anvil dropped on their head. Its situations are so absurd and everything drawn in such a delightfully cheerful tone, that I couldn’t take anything seriously because I wasn’t supposed to. Life Goes On recognizes how ridiculous its concept is and mostly manages to come off as silly, maybe even hilarious to some, rather than disturbing.The way this unorthodox view of death is then applied to puzzle designs helps make a tired genre feel fresh again. There are a lot of the usual devices at work here, be they buttons, blocks, or various hazards, but the way you interact with them with the help of your past failures makes them feel original and inspired. Spikes become walkways, freezing beams create pushable blocks, and sticking yourself in an outlet completes the circuit opening the door. With death being directly integrated into the game design, it also helps take a lot of the edge off of missing a jump or screwing up a sequence, which removes most of the frustration so typical of the genre and had me playing through the entire game in just a few extended sittings.I realize I’ve sort of come full circle with this review, beginning with how Life Goes On made me remember that death isn’t just a meaningless game of numbers, but then arriving back at how I enjoy its mechanical use here. Ultimately Life Goes On has its cake and eats it too, so any attempt to make it out to entirely subvert the usual violent video game trappings would be dubious at best. But that it made me consider all of this, with seemingly no intention and while delivering an excellent puzzle platformer, feels like at least a modest accomplishment. It got me thinking about things I never even recognize in most games, and though it didn’t quite go all the way, it started a discussion and even managed to have a lot of fun in the process. Odd praise to be sure, but it’s a rather odd game itself isn’t it.

												Life Goes On reminded me a bit of The Swapper but instead of creating clones you're creating dead clones. See the resemblance ? Well, they're clones, but not in a traditional way. Each knight is given a random name to make you think you're dealing with other persons here. But they don't fool me. It would've been nice if every now and then a knight would get different equipment. Then, and only then, will I get the illusion that I'm dealing with different persons here. But it's not important, so let's just drop it.Anyway, you have to use your dead clones to make it past the levels. See spikes but can't cross ? Just jump in the middle of it and you'll be able to jump on that guy's head with another knight. The game starts with basic puzzle platforming but halfway through becomes more difficult when it throws other puzzle elements your way. It never becomes frustratingly difficult, as long as you pay attention. I got stuck in a level or two and in hindsight they were actually very obvious. So it also depends on the person eventually. The game isn't very long and you should be able to finish it in 2-3 hours max, depending on if you want to earn all of the available medals.The graphics aren't great, they are actually pretty simple but they get the job done. I personally thought it lacked a bit of personality. The voice acting is also very basic, with only a scream whenever a knight dies. The music on the other hand is better than expected and I enjoyed it very much.The last 2 levels of the game (the true last level and the credits level) are the most impressive levels and it's unfortunate that the other levels are so static in comparison (even if some of the puzzles are harder). If there ever will be a sequel I sincerely hope they'll make use of more platforming, just like those last 2 levels. Or maybe a combination of both, who knows ?Life Goes On is an enjoyable puzzle game and if you liked The Swapper I'm pretty certain you'll have fun playing this one, too.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Got this game during a sale for about 5 dollars. Just played it for the first time for about an hour and a half straight. Very fun puzzle game and the twist of having to kill your knights off to solve levels is really fun. I think this is the first game I can remember where dying is actually fun and sometimes I can't help but laugh when I accidently jump into a swinging blade, or an incinerator. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game for someone who is looking for a relaxing puzzle game and who doesn't take themselves too seriously.			"

												The demo of this game was awesome and promising. I preordered it and really waited for the release. The time passed extremely slowly. The release date finally came and I have the chance to play it in it's complete state. The only thing I can say now is this: YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME! IT'S DAMN AWESOME!It's basically a puzzle platformer, with the twist that you need to die (several times) to pass each level. You need to burn, crash, electrocute, stick up, jump to death with your knights to progress and all of these in the funniest ways possible. The puzzles have several unique method I've never seen in other platformers before. There are several goals besides that you need to reach the cup, like time, number of deaths and you need to feed Jeff on each level, but these are just optional. And the completely free DLC (for previous owners) with several new puzzles is coming soon!			"

												Life Goes On is one of those games where a small, simple concept really carries the game through the whole experience. The idea that you need to die to use your own corpse to get through a puzzle is really cool. Most of the puzzles force you plan a few steps ahead to strategically die in one spot to use that corpse later. The puzzles hit a sweet spot where they're not so tough that they leave you crying in frustration, but are hard enough that you'll need a few tries to see the solution, giving you a solid sense of satisfaction when you do solve it.The game has a lot of charm and great sense of humour. It's pretty self-aware of how morbid it's core concept is and takes more than a little delight in punishing the main characters over and over again. I laughed out loud a couple of times. Most players will finish the game in a single night, which is fair value for the price. I like games in which you can have a full experience in a single sitting. In that sense it reminds me of Thomas was Alone and similar indies. Each level has extras challenges and a target number of deaths needed to get to the end. I found myself replaying levels to try different tactics to avoid piling up bodies as a brute force solution to a puzzle. The only complaint I have is that jumping feels a little loose at times. There's a particular sequence with ice blocks that I felt held me up because I had trouble sticking my jumps, not because I hadn't solved the puzzle. Beyond that, it also feels like the game shows you most of its ideas around 75% of the way through. Even so, I suggest sticking it through to the end because the final level for each world is epic and a great example of using level design to tell a story.			"

""Stop at nothing"" not just an idiom here.It's about:logic and sacrifice;death screams and reward;efficient use of human resources... or not.Why you should play this:you played Blocks That Matter and/or Divided by Sheep, liked it and looking for something similar;thoughtful level-design:usually puzzles not very hard because time pars or ""death"" pars not tight at all, but if you looking for challenge and want to waste as less as possible and beat the level as fast as possible, then the same level starts to look differently;more than that, each puzzle includes another puzzle - you need to feed a beast with one of knights and how to get to the beast is a puzzle itself;great soundtrack - only few tracks, but all very pleasant;best ""Credits"" in this part of the Galaxy.Why you may not like it:you are obsessed member of labour organization/trade union and care too much about human rights.No, it's not Putin sent these knights to die... even if ""BBC"" tells you so.

												This game, while perhaps a bit morbid in the sense of building a bridge to your objective through the stabbed, exploded, impaled, burned and eaten bodies of your knights, is brilliantly executed. Simple enough to jump right in, and there's no problem that can't be solved with more dead knights, of which you have an unlimited supply.			"

												A very interesting take on the 2D platform puzzle game. Instead of trying to not die, you strategicly die to use the corpses of your fellow knights to make bridges, press buttons & trigger traps so that one knight may complete the mission. The gameplay is straight forward but doesn't lack it's complexity (especially later on in the mission list). Each mission has a time goal, life goal and a chester goal (finding a monster in the environment which will eat the knight and then sleep) which adds a lot of replayability as it isn't easy to hit all of these on the first attempt. The music & art makes for a humorous game which partnered with the gameplay is well worth the price. One of the best mechanics is the ""name"" of the current knight which is usually pretty crazy (i.e. High Royal Knight Sir Edward The Grey) and gives each knight a bit of uniqueness and adds to the humor of these prestigious knights being used as sacrafices to trigger traps and make human bridges. Anyways, long story short - it's worth the price for sure and isn't quite like anything I've ever played before - which is a good thing!			"

												It's a pretty fun puzzle platformer. I'd call it medium difficulty -- usually the solution becomes obvious within a few minutes, although ""executing"" it could take a few (... dozen ...) tries. I've never gotten completely stuck so far (currently on the 4th area or so) so the game only occasionally gets frustrating if you're just playing through and not focusing on the time/death challenges -- although I always try to do the Jeff challenge.

												This game is a fun little physics based puzzle game that has you valiantly send brave knights to their deaths so that they can help the next knights solve the puzzle!Basic game premise is that you need to retrieve the golden chalice on the level while avoiding the various hazards. Thing is, the hazards typically require you to kill one of your knights in a creative way so that a future knight can take advantage and proceed further along on the puzzle.  Mix in a twist of some dark humor and it's a fun experience that is easy to play in brief or longer sessions.It also provides additional challenge modes such as completing with fewest deaths in certain amount of time to add some replayability.It's morbidly hilarious at times with some good puzzle progression to get you thinking about how to use mechanics culiminating in some interesting and well designed puzzles by the end!

												If you don't like puzzle games at all, you're not likely to enjoy this game. If you do like puzzles (or at least open to the idea) then read on! The difficulty of the puzzles ramps up nicely so you'll likely find some challenges in later levels, but not overly frustrating ones. The game also provides achievements beyond just finishing the levels, for those wanting more brain teasing. And the game just oozes charm, with its cartoonish knights (taking some of sting out of what is actually a pretty macabre game... a dark sense of humor may help) and death traps. One of my favorite things is the roster of, often silly, names at the bottom that get steadily crossed out as you kill more of your knights.It has an expansion coming too, which likely means I'll be revisitng the game myself soon.

												Who thinks of something like this? Who sits around a table and says, ""Let's make a game where you use corpses to progress?"" I mean, if you pitched it to me, I'd tell you it's a silly idea. But someone did it. And it works - quite well.I am really enjoying Life Goes On. So far, I've spent around 3 hours with it, and I've finished a third of the game. You will finish it quicker, but I am a completionist so I'm trying to get the fewest deaths and the fastest times, and man, let me tell you it's not easy! The concept of the game is actually quite sound, and the execution is pretty good. In Life Goes On, you need the corpses of humorously, randomly named characters to succeed. It's not necessarily the corpses of your failures (although it certainly can AND WILL be...) - sometimes you need to strategically die to buzzsaws, spikes, and other such things to trigger traps and switches so you can open a door, turn off a flamethrower, get to a higher area, or just finish the level. The game only has one button - jump. (and of course, directional pad) There's no attack, or anything else. This doesn't get too boring though, because the graphics & music are quite nice. Also, the levels and challenges are varied enough that you aren't focused on the fact that you are just hitting jump the whole time. Speaking of levels and challenges, they are relatively easy to complete, but difficult to master. The levels are relatively short, most under a minute and a half, so you move through them pretty quickly, and they feel differing on the types of puzzles involved. There are three 'worlds' total. The game itself is pretty forgiving, because you have unlimited knights, but you can replay each level to try and get the best rating on both time, minimizing your deaths, and finding Jeff. Jeff. What do I say about Jeff? You'll meet this adorable looking fuzzball, wander over to pet him, and he'll eat you. Yup. You heard me. In every level. And just when you think you're safe... HE'S IN THE CREDITS TOO. Sorry. You'll have to learn to love Jeff. Don't forget about Jim. Who's Jim? Well, each time you die, the knight that spawns is randomly named (the name shows up at the bottom of the screen). Jim is quite prolific and has at least 40 family members (some variant of Jim or James), that have a random chance to spawn when you get a new knight. There's even an achievement for wiping them all out. Trust me, I'm working on it. Eventually, you'll take care of the problem at the source. There's an achievement for that too. All in all, I highly recommend Life Goes On and think that if you like puzzle or platforming games, this is a must-buy, even at regular price (which I feel is quite reasonable). My only complaint with the game is that it is quite short, and I would have liked to see more out of it. Regardless, it will not disappoint.			"

But as Life Goes On, an indie puzzle game by Infinite Monkeys shows, sometimes it can be used to solve environmental physics based puzzles.The hook of this game is a little tricky to wrap your head around, but simple to understand once you see it in action. Basically you control an infinite number of little knights and want to get them to the golden chalice at the end of each level. To do so, you can respawn a knight whenever a death occurs and make use of the previous body to further your cause. For example, you might be faced with a spike pit which is too wide to jump over. In this case, simply jump a knight into the middle of it, respawn and use the lifeless body as a stepping stone to get to the other side (The game gives each character a name, but you'll never bother to read it).It is a base mechanics that works extremely well. If you played the demo (and you should) you would quickly have got into the swing of using your minions to get a little bit further each life. It is clever and the initial levels make great use of the different possibilities the mechanic presents. Unfortunately, like a lot of clever ideas it runs out of steam far too quickly.Life Goes on just doesn't have enough good variety to maintain your attention. By the end of the first set of levels you will have had your fill of the different types of puzzles and so it is a let down that the next set is more or less repeating things all over again. The levels get longer and the challenges more difficult, but really the game is just chaining the same challenges you have already faced over and over again into growing chunks. Worse, whenever a new mechanic is introduced, it tends to lean more towards frustration rather than fun, especially when compared to the very solid base (trying to avoid activating respawn points is never a fun time).To be fair, although the 3rd ""world"" on drags a lot, there are still a couple of memorable stages here and there. One in particular pays homage to a popular steam themed game and the ""final level"" in each group represents somewhat of a boss battle, that is much more fun to play through. If only these levels had been the norm, rather than the exception this review would be a lot more glowing. As it stands the game only shows glimpses of potential and innovation, perhaps a lesson for the developers next game (quality of puzzles over quantity please!).Mixing it up is the set challenge of beating the clock and set number of deaths for each level. You will also have a ""fuzzy"" creature to find in each level which will eat one of your knights. While this promises diversity, the reality is it just means you are beating the level three times with a slightly different focus. Sadly there doesn't appear to be much scope for earning all three in one run consistently and there is seemingly no payoff for doing so anyway.The rest of the package is well put together. The graphics are functional and the sound and music is nicely done. The menus work, but are a little uninspired (think ios style) and there is basically no story to drive you on. The environments are nice though and have a lot of good touches such as moving power cables. There isn't a lot of variety in the caverns, but later levels do at least provide a slightly different colour palette.In terms of gameplay, the knights themselves are perhaps a little inconsistent as platforms (you'll often try to jump on one and ""miss"") but this isn't something you can't adjust and plan for and there is a very low penalty for failure. The controls in general are tight and it is nice that the game automatically ""grabs"" you onto other knights so this is nowhere near as fiddly as it might have been.Is there enough content for the asking price? I'd still suggest that there is, at a push, but it is walking a very fine line (looking at 4-5 hours I would think). The base game here is so solid that I highly recommend everybody tries it, but the lack of ideas means even the demo might just be sufficient (or waiting for a deeper sale might be the best option).So ultimately a bit of a disappointment despite still being a solid game. But then, life always goes on.			"

												What's Life Goes On?Life Goes On is a puzzle game with a special twist. You can't win without sacrifices. What's your Job? Well, you have to kill those little worms-like knights until one grabs the golden goblet. The environment, the shading, the graphics and effects are beautiful and the music is just your medival genocide music, calm but the killer.Since the Done to Death Expansion has been added, everything has been changed overhaul. The map changed, the knights are now randomly fancy dressed and the easter eggs were put in the game very geniusly (if that is even a word). For example, there is one Portal level (without the portals but the cubes) were you have to escort a heart cube (it's a knight frozen) to the oven, so it can...die.The Translation is perfect (mine is german) for three canadian nerds. I have never found a translation error.I love how you progress through the levels, Wenn you finish one world, the second world will be the sequal of the other map, so at the end of game you'll get a adventurous story.I'm giving this game a 10/10.

												It's kind of depressing.. Like sending lambs to the slaughter. I spawn countless knights, and just.. Run them to their demise. I don't even try to win the level with the least amount of deaths I can get. I just.. I just let them die. Sometimes I even mark the entire level with bodies. I'm a monster.. A Tyrant.. 10/10 would slaughter the masses again.			"

												I first played the demo months ago and instantly fell in love with this game.The full game did not fail to deliver.The whole concept of (literally) standing on the shoulders of those who came before is presented wonderfully. See a deathtrap? Die on it, then respawn and walk on your corpse. Switch that has to be held down? Die so that your corpse falls on it, then respawn and walk past. Et cetera, et cetera.The controls are a bit inaccurate at times, and will most likely leave you dying slightly more often than intended. Although since this game is all about sacrificing one knight to make a path for another, a few more corpses lying around aren't that much of a problem. (And if you're finding it difficult, a few more corpses aren't a problem at all.)The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and make great use of switches, platforms, corpses, and checkpoints. The solution is always there, if you know where to look.The music is unintrusive, yet amazing. It fits perfectly into the game. The sound design, too, is brilliant. Everything just works together really well.There is tremendous replay value in this game, too. Times (and deaths) to beat, secrets to find, more knights to sacrifice... And if you want a quick game (or want to prune Jim's family tree further), there are no lengthy menus to keep you from killing knights. This is evident even in the demo. Ten minutes worth of content, and I had over an hour logged.There's also a great (if morbid) sense of humour present. The knights' death cries are hilarious, the names are generally overblown (and if they're not, it's funnier), and the victory screens... well, ""VICTORY is failure rounded up!"" is just one of the possible messages to recieve upon finishing a level. And then there's the credits of the demo.If you haven't played the demo yet, you should. Even if you know you want this game. The credits alone are worth it. Possibly the title screen as well. And if you're undecided, the demo is basically a slightly earlier version with less levels and slightly different graphics (mostly just checkpoints and the victory screen are different, really).			"

												Played this when it was in Demo stage and loved every second of it. Puzzle games can make me frustrated sometimes but this one is fun and humorous even when you're screwing up. Simple mechanics and puzzles that won't drive you insane but offer extra challenge with time limits and goals to reach. Something your inner completionist will love! Life Goes On is such a charming game that is well worth the insanely cheap price. Well done guys, can't wait to see what you do next!			"

Enough to highly recommend it!(And I do wish this small-scale company all the best, and that we get to see both more from them but the little Knights as well since I'm already fond of them, although short-lived as they might be.)

												Do you believe in casual cruelty? Do you believe in murder and death for the sake of honestly rather pointless goals?Do you enjoy the screams of your knights as they sacrifice themselves to your will?Of course you do! This amusing game centers around using the dead to help the living move forward. Often with their corpses. There's the joy of carefully thinking through your path in order to sacrifice as few as possible, making use of timing and skills to avoid needless casualties. There's also the joy of having a carpet of freshly dead bodies to safely and leisurely walk on as you make your way to the end. Don't forget that murder is fun!			"

												This game involves using your own death in various ways to overcome puzzles. It invludes laying down on spikes to create a death walkway, opening switches,getting flung from a cannon ball to open more switches,being a zombie. It is just like having any number of alternative selfs who could do button pushing for you. It is not something new but the death mechanic in the way of doing things I think is never been done before. the puzzles are pretty simple and you can breeze through the same as each level as subcheckpoints. The checkpoint system is itself unique in the way that it spawns you there after you did and that is used in many puzzles asa mechanic. Overall a good game if played in bursts. A long binge makes it very repetitive and boring. Recommened for a short playthrough each day over a period of a week.			"

The lightheartedness and humor was placed in the right moments. I always wanted to see what was next and kept thinking ""okay maybe just one more level"" and push on to the next part. The one piece of advice I have for new players is if you're stuck try restarting the level and tacking the puzzle from a different angle. Believe me, the ""Aha!"" moments are worth it!			"

There are multiple puzzles in this game the first being the path to the goal, the second being the efficiency of the path you take and getting to your goal killing the least knights possible, the third being time sure you have to solve the puzzle but how quick can you do it? the final puzzle is the little fuzzy fluffball Jeff i have spent more time trying to figure out how to get to Jeff then I do solving the actual level itself and its fun! after you finish the game it becomes an achivement hunt youll find yourself playing the game soley for achivements and the one that will drive you insane is Beat the Devs this achivent has the most insane challenge and can get pretty frusturating that and room for one more (i dont think there is) all in all though great game but its short and I wish there were more levels and I hope Done to Death will satisfy that craving and I personally eagerly await its release			"

												This game is simply amazing.  The art direction and music and sound design work together to bring an extremely simple and unique concept to an unbelievably polished finished product.  Not to mention that it doesn't hold your hand for the ""tutorial"" levels.  The level progression and puzzle design was clearly developed to teach you the new mechanics by adding a new piece onto an existing puzzles solution.  Overall this game is fun to play, what more can I really say about it (^_^)			"

												You now, there are a few platformers that come along  what grab my attention. Quite a few seem to be from DoubleFine, it's true. However Infinite Monkeys have created something unique. A game where your characters morbid death actually works to your advantage. Crazy I know.For the correct discount of 25% off, it's well worth spending the cash. Highly recommended, especially if you're keen to fun games that keep you laughing and gaming. It's ridiculous gameplay. Plain and simple.Kudos to Infinite Monkeys Entertainment for Life Goes On. :D			"

												Fun little puzzle game that does a great job of teach the rules and coming up with new ideas. Even though it's physics based, things are set up carefully so that you don't get cheap successes or failures. Some puzzles require a little timing, but for the must part it's thinking that solves it.			"

												If you're looking for a puzzle game with highly challenging  and hardcore gameplay, Life Goes On is not for you.  However, if you are looking for a lighthearted casual puzzle gaming experience with an optional challenge, you should definitely think about this game.  If you really want to challenge yourself, try not only doing all the side challenges, but also try beating your own records.  Solving the puzzles is fairly easy once you've learned the mechanics, but beating your records and even some of the challenges can be quite dificult, especially trying to get to that fuzzball Jeff.

												It's VICTORY! But not as you're used to. Sometimes Victory requires Sacrifice. Sometimes it requires a lot of Sacrifices. This platforming puzzler puts a new spin on how to solve puzzles. It's kinda like Portal! Except instead of using Portals to solve puzzles you are using your dead comrades. What I can't wait for are the mods and extra maps. If this game ever joins the Steam Workshop it will have so much potential. Not only will people be able to upload their custom maps, they would be able to upload specialty mods. Can I hear ""After Life Goes On""? Imagine this game played with Zombies and Brains instead of Knights and Cups. I fully look forward to any additions the Devs decide to make.I also hope everyone will join me as I put out my Let's Play videos for this game.

												Unique puzzle platformer that requires you to use your character as stepping stones to complete the puzzles.My favorite part is feeding the fuzzy monster, and in fact didnt realize until much later that you can just toss him a dead body and he will eat it!!This game however needs further content, and some of the puzzles are a bit easy.  I hit the developer up on Reddit and asked if we could get a tool to create our own puzzles, but unfortunately that is not going to be likely because of the development path they chose, but man what a perfect platform to release user maps or whatever.All in all, good fun game, and its good for a nice casual play session.

												I generally love puzzle games, but the last time I was this into the theme, puzzles and the humour was World of Goo. If you liked that game and don't mind some black humour (as in piles of dead knights) then make sure to pick this up. The base game is about as easy as said game and just like World of Goo if you want to do the 3 challenges for time, few deaths and Jeff you'll find enough of a challenge especially on the later and (few) optional puzzles. The only thing that might put you off is the linearity (need to solve each puzzle in order without skipping). But since the base objective is usually not that hard I see this as a non issue.			"

There are hundreds of minor details that keep amazing me about the game as I play eat, from the name of the character being shown to the funny visuals after a level showing how many deaths it took to complete it. This is one of my favorite Indie games I have ever played and am going to look for more games from the developers because they did such a good job.			"

												This is an amazingly addictive puzzle/platformer. Using the corpses of your previous characters to solve the puzzles is both hilarious and an interesting mechanic. The levels are challenging without being frustrating, and the difficulty curve is resonable. Optional goals such as using the fewest possible number of knights really adds to the replayability. I nominated this game for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award"" award because it's one of one of the most fun and interesting indie games I've played in a while. Overall it's a ridiculous game with an interesting mechanic, a great sense of humor, nice art, an enjoyable soundtrack, and Jeff.			"

												Good little puzzle platformer with a difference... Instead of trying to stay alive until the end of the level, you mercilessly sacrifice countless knights in a variety of entertaining ways just so that one can eventually make it to the end. Usually by trampling over the corpses of his fallen predecessors. The trick is to not slaughter too many ;)Recently the dev added more content, bug fixes, new maps and stuff for free to everybody that already owned the game. Bonus :)			"

			Cosmic reviews Life Goes On, a morbidly funny puzzle platformer. Get it on Steam - http://store.steampowered.com/app/250050/ Twitter - http://twitter.com/Cosmicengine99 Facebook -...		

An Indie platform puzzler that puts the mass in massacre. The game was developed by Infinite Monkeys Entertainment and was originally conceived at the 2012 Global Game Jam. The main aim of each level is to reach the golden cup, the holy grail so to speak. How do you do this with all the death traps you ask? Well its easy when your a king, with a portal and have an infinite number of knights to send to their deaths until you can accomplish your goal.In Life Goes On, if you die that's not the end, instead you just send another knight through the spawn portal. This is not just a piece of gimmicky morbid comedy, it is in fact a core mechanic of the game. Sometimes having to sacrifice your minions is required to progress or solve a puzzle. An example of this is if the objective is across a floor of spikes, lay down the lives of your knights so one can climb across the hole ridden bodies to reach the grail.In other platformers, you sole objective would be to avoid a deadly trap however in Life goes on, you may need to use that trap to accomplish your goal, perhaps you need to sacrifice a knight on a saw blade to strategically land the body on a button or build a mound of bodies to reach a ledge. What this means is that obstacles in Life Goes On are not just obstacles they become useful tools to use to progress.Overall Life Goes On is certainly a good platformer that provides a mix of enjoyment, comedy and challenge. The game provides a unique twist and this twist provides great synergy of the level design and mechanics. For anyone who loves the genre it will certainly cure that puzzler platformer itch. Don't forget to check out the full review!			"

												Soooooo much fun! Great puzzler, and hilarious concept: you have to kill yourself (often multiple times) to finish the level.  Definitely is replayable because there are achievements for getting the levels done fast, with few deaths and/or getting eaten by an adorable critter on every level. Even the credits are themselves a level with achievements.  Seriously well-crafted game.			"

												Solving puzzles by killing of your knights is both a nice addition to the genre and pretty funny. Graphics, animation and sound are adequate, the difficulty rather low (which I actually prefer to some rock-hard alternatives). Replay value is low, but I did most levels more than once to beat the time and casualties limit. After 50 levels and a few entertaining hours you are in for a final treat: The end credits disguised as an additional level - great fun.Definitely worth its price.			"

												Great Game with a familliar feeling to its precursers but just the grapics are amazing for a puzzle game. It also offers something new, the ability to sacrifice as many men as you need to without consaquence. Yep Life goes on is all about sacrificing knights to acceive the end goal, use the dead as stepping stones, ledges tp climb and even freeze them into blocks of ice to set on triggers. All in all I give Life goes on a 10 out of 10!			"

												Life Goes On charmed the living pants off me.  Which is weird to say about a game when you send knights to their horrible deaths by the dozen.  But the game revels in the comic, chaotic morbidity of it all, encouraging you to impale, electrocute, or incinerate your way to success.  Death isn't frustrating because it's too busy being comical - and half the time, it's bringing you closer and closer to your aims, even when it isn't necessarily intentional.  The mechanics are clearly (and subtly) explained, and the puzzles get just tricky enough toward the end that I felt like a boss overcoming them - without ever relying too heavily on skillful platforming or punishing the player for misjudgements (the error most physics-platformer games of this kind tend to make).This game isn't just underrated, it's a quiet masterpiece.  It's tonally brilliant, earnestly funny, challenging (but not punishing) and good fun from first to last.  If you were looking for the really great, weird indie platformer nobody's ever heard of but is a blast to play - this is it.			"

The puzzles are all the same (in a way) get from A to B, kill a few of your own men to get from A to B, then move to the next level.The only reason for the negitive review is because i have played better puzzles games on my phone.

I have played this for half an hour, but it became boring very quickly. Very repetitive and there is no story. Just small, seperate levels without much feeling.This is a game designed for achievement seekers.- Beat the level under par time;- Beat the level in fewer deaths than par;- Awaken the monster.			"

												What an incredible concept so poorly executed.Perhaps I expected too much. I had hoped for some sort of Lemmings/Eets style game.  But this is just pretty much boring.Essentially, you have a knight who you have to kill in certain positions for another knight to use to gain access to other areas,  The game graphics are nice, but the music is cliche and sometimes doesn't seem to fit the scene,  The UI is ugly.  Overall, this game needs a lot more TLC to the minor things. But the main level design is simply to boring to finish up.			"

												Life Goes On is a sidescroller that has you killing knights and then using their lifeless corpses to solve puzzles. It is morbid but enjoyable at the same time. Every new knight has its own unique name and the less knights you have to kill to reach the end of a level means a better score. I suggest trying out the demo for yourself. Here is my full video preview of Life Goes On:

												Such a beautiful puzzle game. I'm gonna be sincere. This game is not that hard to play - some puzzles are trickier than others but there's always one way to be discovered in approximately 10 minutes - in worst and hardest cases. What is really interesting is the combination of comic-based graphics and an amazing soundtrack (especially the stunning dramatic sh*t during the fast levels). Levels are pretty boring, they are all standing on the same mechanics - this is not the magic element of the game, though the true reasons to play are graphics, soundtrack, level design and DYING! (and some achievements)			"

												It's a solid puzzle platformer in it's own right: the levels are fairly easy to get through, but hard to master. The per level chanelges of fewest knights killed, fastest time, and finding Jeff, plus the hidden level goodies on certain levels give you a reason to replay levels and think about them in a new way. I especially life the gold vs. purple ranks. This is one of the few games I've gotten really frustrated with my failures, and still not been able to put it down.But the real icing on this razor blade cake is its personality, style, and dark sense of humor. It's a refreshing twist when the goal of most games is not to die. The most fun I've had since Portal.			"

YouTube™ Video: Life Goes On - Indie Puzzle Platformer - Review/Gameplay 

			Views: 411		

			Life Goes On is an Indie Puzzle Platformer which uses death as a core mechanic! Don't worry, it's all for fun! But is it fun to play?		

Puzzle platformer is a genre which the indie scene has taken up whole heartedly. It’s a heavily saturated market and because of this you need a stand out feature or gimmick in order to be successful. We’ve seen water manipulation, magnetism and some even let you wind back the clock. Life Goes On has chosen to use dead knights as its “gimmick”, using them as a platforming and puzzle solving tool. The problem is instead of using them as a standout feature and allowing for amazing puzzle design, it’s there for no more than a quick chuckle.			"

												Life Goes On is a silly puzzle-platformer game that I've definitely enjoyed playing.It has hilarious ragdoll physics, lots of silly messages, and an unusual attitude towards life and death. A game where dying is actually useful!I found the puzzles relatively easy to figure out, but that didn't stop them being fun. Also, the game definitely shares a sense of humour with me -YMMV, but that made it even better.Overall, a game which is fun and good for relaxing, or for playing when you don't want to sink hours into something.

												This is an interesting puzzle game.  I never really thought that it reached it's full potential, but I really did enjoy what was there.  You have an infinite number of knights who can do very little other than run and jump.  The basic idea is to throw your knight into whatever death trap that is there so that the next one can use his body as a platform, switch, electrical conductor, etc.  I personally found this all very amusing and laughed a ton.  Then I realized that I'm probably a deeply disturbed person.			"

												This game is like a nice mix between Portal 2 and Braid, however without portals and time-traveling for sure, but with dying as a mechanic (you have to die at least once in a level). The game gets harder the further you come, and there are multiple solutions, hidden stuff and shortcuts everyhwere and you get rewarded for being smart and thoughtfull. The humor in the game is actually quite minimal and most of it only there at the very end. Also it has a pretty good soundtrack, which sometimes reminded me to Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze, some songs are just epic. Beating levels as fast as you can or with less deaths are good replay values.			"

												This is an interesting puzzle game.  I never really thought that it reached it's full potential, but I really did enjoy what was there.  You have an infinite number of knights who can do very little other than run and jump.  The basic idea is to throw your knight into whatever death trap that is there so that the next one can use his body as a platform, switch, electrical conductor, etc.  I personally found this all very amusing and laughed a ton.  Then I realized that I'm probably a deeply disturbed person.			"

												I very rarely write reviews however I do believe this game deserves one. This is a very straightforward game however is incredibly fun and addicting. The levels are all unique and have some very creative gameplay elements in them.  The puzzles themselves are all at the perfect difficulty and very carefully designed to help you along and prevent repitition. Although the game has no real story they add a lot of fun things inbetween such as ""Jeff"" and the occasional ""Boss"" levels.  I also love the transition levels between areas which are exceptionally creative.Great game and especially if you can grab it for under $5!			"

												Imagine a kingdom of valiant knights, duty bound in their service to a cruel king. A king who does not mind electrocuting, impaling, burning or freezing them to find the cup of life his heart is yearning for. In fact he does not even mind sacrificing them to find a cup that might or might not, but likely not, be the cup of life. Not even when he is using his knights as ammunition in a cannon (insert cannon fodder pun here). And now imagine that you are this king.This is a really fun puzzle game. I am a bit reminded of lemmings, even though those two are still very distinct (among other things the goal of lemmings was to keep most of them alife, whereas here you sacrifice as many as needed to get one to the goal).And if you get it at a discount... there's really nothing you can do wrong there.

												Very unique twist on puzzle games. Lots of fun, with a silly twist, and at times very hard and requires some thinking. 9.5/10 would play again			"

												What an asthetically beautiful, funny, well put together, puzzle game. Challenges get gradually harder without being stupidly complex - well as far as I've got anyway. I love it.			"

												I first saw this game on steam as a sale item.  The commercial video was the hook for me, as it showed lively and emotional characters along with the gameplay. The sense of humor shown in the trailer definitely carried over to the game, as the escessive loss of life is portrayed with heavy, enjoyable sarcasm. The game itself is equally great, with challenging puzzles an even some boss ""battles."" The music is ambient and reflects the lighthearted mood, with the boss level track being my favorite.  If you're looking for a fun way to spend time, pick up this game, and don't hesitate to buy it if it is on sale.			"
