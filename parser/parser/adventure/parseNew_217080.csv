												Doctor Who….. A franchise that spans 50 years, with over 750 episodes, tons of books, a massive fanbase which, as of the last few years has grown ridiculously and an array of famous actors and writers. Making a videogame out of it sounds like a good idea. A bunch of cash is generated from sales and some new fans are brought aboard as well.However, if there’s one thing the videogame industry has never exceled at, is making videogames based on movies and TV series. And I don’t know which is worse: if the fact that a big Hollywood movie nowadays implies a videogame counterpart, or the fact that those counterparts always feel like they were made using the last remnants of the movie budget, and on a Sunday afternoon.DW:TEC, of course, is crippled by this cash-grabbing  mind-set and thus suffers considerably in most regards. But it does manage to get some things right. Let’s take a look.The plot here is simple at first. Something or someone is causing a temporal maelstrom, and it’s up to the Doctor to stop it from tearing up time and space. Well, in a way, it’s mostly up to the TARDIS, since the poor girl acts as a plug, keeping the many holes in the fabric of time closed. Consequently, the TARDIS becomes slightly omnipresent. “Slightly omnipresent?” Well, yeah, since there are several time rifts and she’s keeping them closed, she is wherever there are any of those, which is….in several places simultaneously. Needless to say, moving her isn’t such a good idea in these conditions, so the Doctor is forced to use several time corridors that seem to pop out of nowhere with an unsettling accuracy, both time and space-wise.Just as expected of a mess of this nature, along the way, the Doctor will face all of the major enemies of the most recent seasons, Cybermen, Daleks, the Silence and so on, each chapter being dedicated to outsmarting and defeating each one of these. All of this of course, while you go on with your quest of saving the universe once again and still be home in time for dinner.Soon enough, you will most likely run into problems. Due to the 2-player nature of the game, and due to the fact that when you’re playing single your companion is as AI, several puzzles involving both players quickly become frustrating. Sometimes the AI will take too long to do what it’s supposed to do, or sometimes it might get stuck, meaning it won’t do anything at all, forcing you to restart from the last checkpoint. There’s also the fact that the enemy AI seems weird, being completely unable to notice you as long as they don’t face you, but if they do they will detect you even if there’s a thick wall between you and them. Some controls aren’t intuitive at all, especially elevator controls: some require you to use the sonic screwdriver, some others require you to just push up or down and others require you to press the action button. This might seem minor, but an inconsistency of this kind becomes a major annoyance, since you will be riding a lot of elevators and platforms.On the other side of things, we have the configurations. The video options menu won’t save your chose settings, so you are forced to use the default graphic profiles (Low, Medium or High), which is also annoying (changing the config file directly had no effect whatsoever), and frequently, you will notice popping textures.The puzzles are all pretty mediocre and easy even on the highest difficulty. The mind map puzzles were the most interesting idea out of all the challenges present here, but even those are easy to figure out. In here you have to correctly align an image in a circle by rotating its sections. In easy mode that’s literally all you need to do but in higher difficulties each section you rotate will simultaneously rotate other sections, each in a different manner, thus increasing the challenge. The platforming element is decent and for any Doctor Who fan, using the screwdriver to unlock doors and other shenanigans feels delicious. Too bad that is everything you will use in this game (besides River’s gun).Still I can’t help but feel that this is quite a cheap cash-in. There was so much that could be done, and yet, we are left with a hollow game that consists in jumping across platforms, sneaking past enemies, and solving a few easy puzzles across the way. The collectibles don’t really add much to it, but at least there are several achievements for timed runs which will most likely make you do certain sections more than once. Good thing all sections are pretty small and can usually be done in under 10-12 mins each. Another very disappointing point in this game is the TARDIS herself. How could such an important element of the whole DW universe be shoved aside and just used as a cheap way to have a simplified plot? Fiddling with the inside of the TARDIS would have been a dream for any DW fan, since there are endless possibilities as to what can be found inside (as seen in Season 7’s “Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS”). The control room is so pretty and detailed, and yet it’s used for nothing. The ONLY thing you do inside the TARDIS in this game is…….walk out of it.Despite all its flaws, the game manages to get some stuff right. The ability to point your sonic screwdriver and use it to mess up with stuff is pretty damn funny, and it's pretty cool to personally evade and defeat the Daleks in a post-apocalyptic London, while listening to Matt Smith's occasional witty one-liners. That being said, some stuff, like the overall looks of Dr. River Song were totally uncalled for and are just a petty fan-service attempt. So, in conclusion, if you’re not a DW fan and you’re just looking for a platforming game…….don’t bother. There are so many better alternatives out there for you, and this one doesn't really stand out. If you’re a big DW fan like me, go ahead and give it a try, you might like it.			"

The behaviour, dialouges and the Doctor's comments on situations and remarkable things are 100% convincing ^^The game is a funny little plattformer. I needed less than 5hours for one runthrough without any problems. Most riddles and puzzles are self-explanatory and there are wonderfully straight to the point explanations for the mini-games.I recommend playing with a gamepad, because - in my opinion - it makes especially lockpicking with your screwdriver a lot easier and faster, but it's probably a matter of habit ; )I, personally, enjoyed this game, although it does not have this depth, length and high-end graphic a really great Doctor Who-game would actually deserve. But in some ways it summarizes all important elements that contributed to the enormous success of the Doctor's fascination during the past 5 decades. All these incredibly athmospheric scenarios taking place in contrary eras of mankind featuring most of the creatures, the Doctor met during his journeys (except for Weeping Angels, unfortunately xD).Some users complain about River Song's inadequate AI. I played this game March 2013 and did not notice any of those problems.~Conclusion~One should not expect a high-end game. It is rather a little adorable game for in between that completes your Doctor Who Collection and lets you smile about all those allusions to the Doctor's adventures ^^			"

												Doctor Who: The Eternity clock stars, obviously, the Doctor and River Song from the 2010 Series of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith as the Doctor. He starts out after an anomaly in time stuck inside a Bank and must find his way out. Alternatively - the character River Song, starts out on a Prison as she has to make her way across the prison, get her stuff back and meet up with the Doctor in the timeline he's stuck on. It's a very 'Doctor Who' premise, which I really enjoyed.One thing that must be noted, however  - YOU WILL MOST LIKELY NOT ENJOY THE GAME AS MUCH IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF THE SERIES. This may seem obvious, but in all honesty - unlike games like TellTale's The Walking Dead series, you don't need to be a fan of the series /original source content to understand what's going on as it's pretty self absorbed as a story - this game is not. The game very largely depends on you having seen the show and understand who the Doctor and River Song are and why they do what they do - otherwise clever references made in nod to the show (which are a lot of them) will whizz right by you and you'll most likely end up feeling like you're missing something crucial. There is no ""self absorbed"" Character Development with either the Doctor or River, it is literally like an episode of the show.The visuals are pretty serviceable. The Doctor and River, and of course the TARDIS are really well textured and done, but I feel the rest of the game was lacking that touch of polish. Some areas look very muddy, while some look like they weren't textured at all. Some NPC models had about the same issue - notably the Cybermen models - whom looked like a pretty standard mesh without textures and 'plastic-y'. The sound, however is masterful. Everything sounds like it has given special attention to care, even the voices to an extent. There's a lot to love if you're already a fan of the music found in the show like this theme which plays quite a few times during the game as well as the Title Screen having the full version of the 2010 show's theme.The game play is very simple. The game is set to be a puzzle-platformer, a pretty standard one, but it works for what it tries to achieve. The puzzles aren't particularly tough to figure out, but some ""mini game"" sequences (like to activate consoles, open doors or work computers to unlock passageways, etc) are amazingly tedious at times - given the fact that they overuse them a lot. *~> One has you redirecting ""energy"" lines to their sources, without them 'overlaying' so they ""overcharge"" the source, you do this by opening and closing lines/pipes. Usually these are done in multiple stages, they being timed - so if you run out of time and the puzzle is not complete - it will reset itself.*~> Another one involves you opening and closing ""gates"" as blue and red energy flows down some lines - you need to open the gates for the blue source to pass and close gates to dissipate red sources - ultimate they culminate in a bar that you must fill up with blue source energy. This puzzle is, by far, the most aggravating nonsense I have ever played. On harder difficulties - the red sources come out so fast at times they they can confuse you as to which line they are coming through so you end up unblocking a wrong gate, or a blue source comes down so fast you don't have enough time to unblock it's gate, and if a red source hits, the screen shakes a lot allowing for some confusion as more sources keep trickling down - by far my LEAST favourite of the minigames - but these are NOT done in stages, however these are used a lot more towards the end of the game.*~> Another mini game has you moving a small dot across a field of red dots that will ""kill"" your dot and force you to restart the field again - the field is usually divided in 3 sections, the outer side having the most space and most time to move your dot, a safe zone on between, a smaller zone beneath it, and then towards the center - you have less margins for error. Think of this minigame like ""Frogger"" in a sense. This one was, by far, the one I enjoyed the most. While it was being used a lot towards the end of game as well - this one never got too overwhelming or overly tedious that it crippled my enjoyment of the game.There is an additional mini puzzle that comes in the way of matching waves in size, lenght and pattern, which involves the Sonic Screwdriver. You'll be doing this one a lot as well, as it is used for unlocking doors and occasionally defeating enemies.On the ""Platformer"" side of things - there's not much to say. The Doctor and River handle fairly well. There's a bit of a stiffness to movement though, and it'll show more if you have to do a neutral jump (jumping without direction) because it's hard to get to ledges that aren't too far off you, but aren't close enough for you to grip on to them. Other than that, sometimes you move some crates and such to get to higher places - it's all very standard stuff here, but it works. River herself has a few different tools, like her gun, which you use the Right Stick on a controller to aim and RT to shoot - or use the mouse to hover and click to shoot - which you'll be using in a few segments during the game. I also have to give a special mention to the AI in the game... it is pretty horrendous. I had issues where River got stuck not jumping somewhere or not following (she is needed at times for dual puzzles) and the enemies break immersion a lot since as SOON as you're out of sight - they can still latch on to you (look at you) but won't chase you and give up and leave.As far as replay value goes - unless you're already a Doctor Who fan, or are a completionist, there's not much incentive to replay the game. Sure, it has 3 stages of difficulty to beat the game through at, and a fair amount of item collectibles - such as the Doctor's many hats (as seen on the show) or River's diary pages (Spoilers!) but the tedious puzzles found in between may very well turn you off trying to beat the game again if it didn't already turn you off beating the game in the first place. All in all though, I am a bit biased going into this review as I do love the show a lot, so obviously I got more into the notion of the game - however if you're not a fan of the show - AT ALL - or a fan of very standard, bare bones puzzle platformers I would honestly say ""Skip this one.""Pros:+Amazing Sound Design+Very true to Source Material (References & Nods, Art style)+Story is pretty cool+Some puzzles can be funCons:-Terrible AI-Poor stealth mechanics-Puzzles can get tedious and awfully random-Stiff movement-No replay value			"

This is a 2d 'sidescroller' adventure of The Doctor and River Song, the puzzles and challenges are fun and hard alike and you will learn to easily solve puzzles after completing the game, i just wished it was more 3d than 2d and it had trading cards, but nevertheless, its still a great game, I highly reccommend for Doctor Who fans and puzzle solving people!

												The good: The Doctor and River Song are voiced by Matt Smith and Alex Kingston, respectively, so as a fan of the show, that was fun for me. The story itself isn't a bad little romp, although it does leave you hanging a bit at the end. You get to see several popular monsters from Doctor Who, and the Doctor's running commentary is pretty enjoyable.The bad: The AI is occasionally dreadful. At certain points, you play as the Doctor and River's character is supposed to follow along and assist you. However, she tends to run the wrong way and get stuck in weird places. Sometimes you can get her unstuck, and sometimes you end up having to restart the level. The controls are pretty clunky as well. It's sometimes difficult to get the Doctor to jump where you want him to, and dodging Cybermen is trickier than necessary.General info: This is a side-scroller with occasional puzzle mini-games. You mostly play as the Doctor, although you have a few rounds in which you play as River Song. The story was meant to be the first part in a series, but the others weren't made, so the game leaves you hanging a bit at the end.Overall: I recommend this if you are a fan of Doctor Who and will just enoy having more content with the Eleventh Doctor and River Song. The gameplay is nothing to write home about, but it's an enjoyable way for a DW fan to spend an afternoon.System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

												Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock was released in 2012 following the adventures of the Eleventh Doctor, played by Matt Smith, and Doctor River Song, played by Alex Kingston. You can play as both The Doctor and River, as you solve puzzles, collect pieces of the Eternity Clock, and make choices, which affect your outcome. The game is supposed to take place sometime after the events of Season 6 When a Good Man goes to war, and Let's Kill Hitler in the Doctors timeline, and just before Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead in River Song's timeline. Unfortunately, I can't say a lot more due to Spoilers, but I will say this is a great addition to the overall Doctor Who Canon and brings back a lot of fond memories of The Doctor and River's adventures.

												Yeah, gameplay is a big dodgy. But you'd have to be a pretty mean hearted Whovian to not glean at least some enjoyment from the game. And lets be honest, it's way way way better than that God awful rubbish Doctor Who: Return to Earth on the Nintendo Wii from a few year ago. Not sure how much enjoyment non-fans would get from it. But yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend the game to fellow Whovians.Should also mention the very wise move of using Murray Gold's music from the series, adds a real authentic feel to proceedings. Shame they never got to finish the story. Hopefully we'll see the Twelfth Doctor and Clara in a game someday...			"

												Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock is a decent co-op platformer with good puzzles made of simpler puzzles. The experience as a whole is like playing any other platformer here you can't kill enemies. You have to time your jumps, cooperatively solve puzzles that involve both characters, and collect all the hats (which you can't wear, go figure) and all the journal pages (which you can't read either).The game features voice acting from original actors, and shows the Eleventh Doctor and River Song trying to solve a mystery. Nothing too far from normal telly episodes on the BBC, to be honest.It's a good story, but it isn't enough. It's just fun for wasting some time or for when you have to wait your buddies to play an online game. It's worth its discount price but not more, and it's only for the diehard Doctor Who fan.			"

Posted: December 15, 2013
												TL;DR - The ""Doctor Who"" bits are good; the ""video game"" bits are bad.THE LONG VERSION - The Eternity Clock is a game that had a lot of potential, but sadly fell short of the mark, mostly due to seemingly nit-picky problems with the mechanics of the game. The story isn't stellar, but the voice acting is good (of course) and it was engaging enough to make me want to continue until the end of the game.Overall, my complaint is the gameplay. First of all, the controls aren't particularly smooth, although I did get used to it after a while. Second of all, why make a completely 3D world, then doom the player to view all of it from the side? As hilarious as it is to watch the Doctor flailing around in profile as he jumps from box to box, it seems a bit counter-intuitive to produce a Doctor Who game in which strict limitations are imposed on the player. I'm not just talking about the sidescroll here; the story may be timey-wimey, but everything else is extremely linear. Even the puzzles, which should ideally be the heart and soul of a puzzle game, fall short in terms of creativity and difficulty. Instead of layering complexity or requiring the player to think outside the box, the player must contend with shorter time limits which simply require them to complete the same easy puzzle, just faster than they did before. This led me to a lot of frustrating moments where I felt that the puzzle completion was pointless, but I had to soldier on because it was required to progress the game.Speaking of those time limits I mentioned earlier, did I mention that the countdowns don't stop while looking at the instructions for a puzzle? One scenario in the game required me to complete two puzzles, and I had to complete the second puzzle in the same amount of time it took me to finish the first. The problem was that I didn't know that ahead of time, and since the first puzzle was unfamiliar, I took my time perusing the instructions. All the while, the timer was ticking without my knowledge, and when it came time for me to complete the second challenge, I quickly realized that it would be impossible to succeed. It took me dying ten times to realize that my timer started on some arbitrary number, like 2:43, and I thought to reload a previous save and try the first puzzle again. That time, I sped through it all without a problem, but I was extremely annoyed to learn that I had wasted a lot of time on a technicality.I spent a great deal of the game waiting for an opportunity to be clever, but I never found one. Most actions/puzzles in the game are repetitive (problems are solved in similar ways throughout the entire game), and some are downright confusing due to the player not having enough information to complete them. Puzzles that stumped me ended up requiring simple solutions that I missed only because I didn't explore this or that location, or I didn't interact with this or that object. Other puzzles just seemed arbitrary, like those in the Time Corridor. I didn't feel like intelligence was required to advance; I never really had to figure anything out, and that's a problem in a puzzle game.In my opinion, I think this is more of an adventure game with puzzles stuck on. The puzzles don't require thought; they require speed. The feeling of urgency that evokes in a game is good for certain moments of a story, but being consistently bombarded with ""You must outrun X enemy in Y timeframe, or you will die"" becomes both boring and frustrating. All in all, I liked the story, but the gameplay is irritating and replay value is nonexistent.Let's be honest, though. I believe the planned sequels for this game have been postponed indefinitely, but if they did come out, I'd still buy them because they have the name ""Doctor Who"" on them, even if the game was terrible. I know that those who buy a Doctor Who game aren't necessarily in it for the gameplay; they want the story. Still, if the developers want to use the video game medium to tell that story, it would behoove them to pay better attention to the mechanics of said game.			"

												This is my very first negative review of a game, it's frustrates me that it has to be on a Doctor who game. I wanted to love this, after loving Doctor who the adventure games I thought that I would enjoy this. I began playing it for my youtube channel and cringed at how badly designed and frustrating some of these levels are. The bank level is very boring and gets on my nerves every time I play it as it doesn't showcase Doctor who games at their best. The second level was more on the right track as you control River and you have to escape the prison. I enjoyed this level alot and found it very enjoyable, but alas I was about to endure one of the worst poorly designed levels I've ever played in a video game. The cybermen level is terrible, after I played this mission I knew I just wasn't going to enjoy the rest of the game. I've tried given this one a shot a couple times but it's very different to ""Doctor Who: The adventure Games"". Go grab your $10 and save it up to buy Doctor who: The adventure games. This one was a miss I'm afraid.Gameplay - 1 out of 5 (The second levels gameplay is fantastic and was on the right track, but the rest of the levels have terrible gameplay compared to it).Characters - 3 out of 5 (The characters are played by the actual cast members, which is fantastic however the dialogue lets down the characters in this game)Aliens - 1 out of 5 (Why do they have to use ""The Daleks"" and ""The cybermen"" why not use aliens or villians we fans haven't seen in the television series for a long time. Why not bring back ""Omega""? Loads of classic ""Doctor Who"" fans would enjoy playing as Matt smith and defeating Omega! Overall this game was a miss. Go spend your 10 dollers on Undertale or ten hamburgers at Hungry Jacks. If you enjoyed this one than thats great! Why not say in the comments what part of the game you enjoyed most! I'd love to hear! Thanks for reading, I apologize for my terrible grammar! Goodbye!			"

												I knew this game had mostly negative reviews, but hey, I love Doctor Who, I can get something out of it. Right?Wrong!This game is bugged to hell and back. Avoid it like the plague. Or be sensible and wait till it's under a quid. The Doctor deserves better than this. The 5 BBC Adventure games are miles better than this. Free from the BBC if you live in the UK, but they've been 'Greenlit' on Steam so should be coming here soon. Buy those instead!			"

												This is quite an enjoyable game, not a really brilliant game, but it wasn't that bad. It has collectables, puzzles, achievements, and decent game-play.Throughout the game you can collect hats and diary pages, you cannot wear the hats, but you can observe them and get a line of dialogue from the Doctor with a reference or a joke. You can collect River's diary pages, which you can read or look at. These collectables are quite easy to find, and they give the game some replay value, simply just looking for the pages and hats. The achievements are also quite fun to aquire, some of them are hard, some of them are easy and unavoidable. These achievements really add to the replay value of the game.When you start the game there are three different diffuculties, easy, medium and hard, these diffculties affect the puzzles. The puzzles range from using the sonic screwdriver to open locks (and somehow stuning enermies) to moving a dot through a circular maze whilst avoding deadly dots, which is normally what happens when you hack into a system. There are heaps of these puzzles in the game, and they seem to be a big part of the game, and you will need to solve them quickly, as the game rarely pauses for you when you do them.The game play is quite okay, it's not the best, but I have played worse. You can play two characters, Doctor River Song and The Doctor, River can shoot and kill things, because she is River and doesn't care about life, and the Doctor can somehow use his sonic screwdriver to not only unlock everything, but also stun just about any lifeform. This game is a platformer and has a lot of jumping and pushing things in it. There are a few glitches in the game, for example River song not being able to jump up a ledge (when you're playing the Doctor) and when she reaches the top jumps off, but they can be avoided. And there are some times when the game doesn't quite explain how to do something *cough* *cough* Elevator *cough* *cough*. The only way for you to really enjoy this game, not to say that it's easy to hate, but it's hard to love, is if you are a Doctor Who fan. Because there are so few Doctor Who games out there, and the few that there are, aren't really all that good. And this one might not be terrible, but it's not all that great. But for it being a Doctor Who game I am going to have to give it points. I wish there was a way to give it a recommendation of in between yes and no, but there's not.			"

												My favorite television show of all time has had a checkered history with videogame adaptations, as many television and movie franchises do. Leaving aside non-retail (The Adventure Games that were free for UK residents as part of the television license fee) and Nintendo releases, Doctor Who hadn't had a commercially-released game adaptation in 15 years until Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock was released in 2012 for PlayStation and PC. The original PS3 release did not win over critics (earning a depressing 39% over 21 reviews), and the PC port that came six months later received little attention and less acclaim.Some of this isn't necessarily Supermassive's fault; most of it is, but to some extent the game is a victim of excessively-high expectations. At its heart, TEC is a puzzle-platformer with a Doctor Who skin, so it's not necessarily the best kind of game to demonstrate the qualities that make DW so memorable and magical. It was suggested in one of the Cheapassgamer.com forums that a The Walking Dead-style adventure game (albeit one that relied a bit less on QTEs) would be a more suitable vehicle and I agree. None of the incarnations of the show in game form have even come close to capturing its essence and I believe that this is at least in part because an effective  character- and story-driven approach has not been tried (IMO, The Gunpowder Plot, the fifth and possibly last of the Adventure Games, came closest).Inherent limitations of the genre aside (and this is not my favorite kind of game), despite some of the extra bug-stomping and tweaking that we may presume was partially responsible for the lengthy delay between the original publication and the PC and Vita ports, this game is still a pretty buggy and frequently frustrating experience. The biggest issues with the PC version are with your companion AI, specifically with River Song. In the game you will switch at various points between playing as River (usually with her blaster and vortex generator) and playing as the 11th Doctor (usually with his sonic screwdriver). Often there will be bits that require the character you're not currently playing to turn a wheel, hold a lever, or do some other similar cooperative action. Sometimes, instead, River will vanish completely (maybe because of something in her diary?) or she will get stuck in a loop of repeating actions for no apparent reason (this seems unlikely to be due to spoilers).The other issues are that the game has certain chokepoints, both in a metaphorical sense and also in the sense that you will wish the developers were in the room with you so that you could step away from the keyboard and begin choking them and bashing their heads against the nearest wall, all the while asking, ""Why? Why would you do this?"" I identified four of these: evading Cybermen in the Underground, electrocuting Cybermen in the Underground, stealing the stasis field generator from the Silence, and obtaining the last piece of the Eternity Clock from the Daleks.Of these, the odds are that if you're much better at (or simply much faster at) puzzle-solving than I am, you won't have as much difficulty as I did with the Cyberman and Dalek parts. However, the Silence base area is worthy of special note. In keeping with the show's lore regarding this cult/race, River must keep at least one of the Silence in view at all times while she is running around disabling four separate stasis fields and finally stealing a stasis field generator. The problem with this area is that the Silence generally don't operate according to the same rules as the other enemies in the game. There are some static Silence that appear to be praying (?) and others that walk around on seemingly well-defined patrol routes. However, both types will randomly teleport away or otherwise simply disappear--and I do mean randomly.Between these chokepoints, the game is a fairly enjoyable experience, especially for fans. The game tells the story of River and the Doctor's efforts to re-assemble parts of a mysterious temporal artifact known as the Eternity Clock after it begins creating time corridors at various points in Earth history and causing the TARDIS to behave erratically. Predictably, the pieces are in the hands of various enemies of the Doctor who are siphoning off the energy for their own purposes. River and the Doctor are voiced by Alex Kingston and Matt Smith, respectively, and they both turn in terrific performances. The game looks decent and the ambient sound effects and music are culled directly from the show.The puzzles in the game are of about five basic types, most of which will be familiar to players of the Adventure Games. They include using binary switches to route or reroute steam or power in different ways; rotating pieces to direct the flow of energy from one point to another; rotating concentric rings of a wheel to form an unscrambled image; opening and closing gates to allow or block different kinds of energy from reaching a central point; and the ubiquitous waveform-matching oscilloscope puzzles used to open doors, disable devices, et cetera, with the sonic screwdriver.The game isn't terribly long. I completed it in 10 hours and, as I said, I'm not especially good at these kinds of games. It's a tough experience to recommend unless you're a serious Doctor Who fan due to its generally unpolished nature and occasionally significant difficulty. The story ends on a bit of a cliffhanger (which I won't spoil here), implying that the developer and/or the BBC anticipated that there would be at least one sequel. However, given the dismal commercial and critical reception the game ultimately received, I don't expect that this is terribly likely.			"

												I am a major doctor who fan and I am totally into this game. I love it so much. I love the voice overs, and the story line. I love that the baddies and what I love most about it is that River and the Doctor never have episodes of just them together, even though as the viewer we know that they must spend time together at some point other than what we see on the show. This game depicts an adventure that they must have in one of those periods where we aren't sure what the Doctor and River do together when they're alone. I love how the game makes connections to the story line of the show in little ways and through comments the characters make. I also love the collectibles and the short stories each holds. Definitely a game for whovians. Hands down, no questions asked. If you love Doctor Who, you will love this game. I'm not the biggest fan of side scrolling games, but just because this game is what it is, the side scrolling is completely covered up, in my eyes, by the shear whooyness! for lack of a better term.. Of this game! PLAY IT, don't ask questions, Don't have doubts, Don't even bother with reading reviews, if you like doctor who, its worth the trip.			"

												As a huge Doctor Who fan and a gamer, I was so happy when I found out Steam had a DW game! The game follows The Eleventh Doctor (who is my favourite Doctor) and River Song as they look for the Eternity Clock!Overall, the gameplay this game brought was very enjoyable! As a person who doesn't like puzzle games much, I found myself extremely into the game, and all its puzzles! The graphics are really good, and for a 3D platformer game, i was really surprised how amazing the game was!I plan on replaying this game in the future, and plan to get all the achievements.If you have some cash to spend, and you're a DW fan, I fully suggest you purchase this game.

												Being a big fan of Doctor Who, I was very anxious to try this game. While I can't say I was disappointed, it didn't wow me either. It isn't a horribly difficult game even on the hardest difficulty setting; however having said that it was challenging enough to keep me interested. The easy puzzles are pretty laughably easy so that was handy to go back and look for missing collectibles; as well as for some people who may like a little more relaxed approach to the game. The game layout is basically a super 2d scroller- It has corners you can turn but it shifts the whole perspective of the game when you do. Left and Right are your only real movement options. Which is kind of annoying when you have to push a box over to climb a wall when you are literally right next to a stairway that leads to the same place.I guess what it boils down to, for me at least, is if you are a fan of Doctor Who at all and want something to have a little fun with and occupy some time I would recommend it. If you are not a fan of Doctor Who, I recommend going to watch an episode or two and see if you change your mind :) With a 10$ price tag it is find of expensive for what it is, but worth it to me. I would give it an overall score of 6 out of 10.			"

												Hoo boy... What can I say about this game? First of all, the graphics are really nice, much better than in the Adventure Games. The character animations are okay, even though at some points they tend to skip a bit - at least for me - (most notably when you have to boost one of the two up a ledge). The controls are okay, even though there are some points where it can be a bit unresponsive, but usually it's no problem. One problem however is, that there are a few bugs within the game which can occur at random, sadly some of them can hinder your progress and supposedly can be fixed by restarting the game. I have yet to try out the co-op but I have to admitt that it's dissapointing that it only features a local one. All in all I would give this game a 8 out of 10.			"

Doctor Who: The Eternity clock is another in a long line of nearly-made-it-but-failed-at-the-last-hurdle Doctor Who marketting strategies. Personally, this deserves a middle button between the Yes and No recommend, but because of such a ballsed up puzzle section and a bad storyline I decided on the latter. I must warn you though; you probably won't like this game.The game excels in it's platforming features. Never before in a Doctor Who game have we had 2D platforming with 3D elements, and the graphics are fairly decent. They aren't the best graphics but they're not exactly what you'd call a dogs dinner either. Full platform integration with Steam/Logitech controllers also makes the platforming a very enjoyable and smooth ride. The game is also a far leap from the Adventure Games series, something that will not be mentioned again because doing so will probably make my eyes bleed - what an awful games series.Where this game fails though is the puzzles. It's like Doctor Who: The Adventure Games and Puzzle Quest decided to have a baby, but the baby inherited their worst features. The puzzle system does not integrate with the controller AT ALL, meaning you constantly have to keep moving from the keyboard to the controller in order to play the game. The puzzles lack a concept of entertainment and by the time the first one is completed they really become a chore.Last to mention is the storyline. Oh golly gosh the story line. Oh look, I'm trapped! Oh wait, River's come to my rescue almost coincidentally, and even more coincidentally there are some Cybermen down here. It feels like it was wrote by the pure anger of a runner up at a beauty pagent. It lacks context and meaning and sucks the life out of every character it touches. A bit like the Abzorbaloff.Overall, no. Don't get this game. Run for the fields of Trenzalor and go dig this game a grave. Because it needs it.			"

												Good: Game is short.Bad:  Arguably, everything else. Platforming gameplay is boring, animations are wonky, minigames are too simplistic, collectible items are hats but you cannot wear them (while playing on Steam, home of Team Fortress 2 - this is an outrage!)I can't say anything bad about plot, but can't say anything good about it either. That's because game is making absolutely no effort  to explain the Doctor Who universe to players not familiar with it, like me. With titular Doctor making funny quips and being voiced by same actor from TV series, this part of the game is at least serviceable. Summary: Don't buy it unless you are the series fan.			"

												It's disappointing that a game based off of such a long running and popular series is so utterly broken. Anyway, let's just get to the nitty-gritty of it: the game is impossible to complete. During Old London Bridge II, there's a sequence where you need to help River reach the top of the area in order to pull a lever with you and lower a drawbrige. Unfortunately, part of her sequence is broken, causing her to repeatedly jump the wrong direction at the top of the lift. This goes on without end making the scene impossible to finish. Beyond that, if you manage to do the right, strange sequence of actions that allows her to continue, there's a possibility that you'll soon come to a door that is closed. This door is not supposed to be closed, has no reason to even be able to close, and is impossible to open, once again halting the game entirely. Absolutely ridiculous. If these problems had arisen sooner in the game, I would have requested a refund.			"

												Do you remember those old NES, SNES, Genesis era licensed side-scrollers?  The ones that would take the main character from the source material and make him run through levels that are only vaguely based on scenes from that media, jumping over enemies and collecting items that were barely relevant?  Like the old Looney Toons games, where Bugs Bunny would have to collect carrots and dodge an inexplicable army of Elmer Fudds?This is pretty much one of those games.There are differences of course.  It's voice acted by all the right people, and a graphics engine that looks comparable to Trine when it's not doing a close up of Eleven or River.  The music is the same as the show, for better or worse.  At its heart, though, this game is just another one of those poorly-fitted side scrollers.  River has to search for the pages of her diary, which have been spread across earth for reasons even she lampshades as bizarre.  Eleven is constantly on the search for nicely-packed hats which seem to be speckled on alien ships and across a post-apocalyptic future, while pursuing the MacGuffin of the plot, which loosely strings as many of the Doctor's enemies together as possible.The music, as in the show, continues to be high quality, though oddly used.  For example, they play the bombastic ""I am the Doctor!"" theme right through the beginning tutorial.  While that's a fun song, it felt very out of place of learning how to jump over crates.The puzzles are the same hacking puzzles you've seen in every other video game ever - which is to say, they have nothing to do with electronics whatsoever.  Think Mass Effect and Bioshock's hacking puzzles, with a decent dose of crate puzzles.  Inoffensive, but also uninspired.  Matt Smith, to this games great credit, seems to be enjoying the hell out of voice acting this game (or just being the Doctor in general).  Alex Kingston isn't quite as interested, but pulls off a competent performance.  Theres some co-op built into the game, which largely gets in the way, but does lead to a cool moment or two.  Overall, this game isn't bad, but it sure isn't good either.  Don't expect too much from it other than a quick romp through space and time (mostly just time) with a cliffhanger that will never be fufilled.			"

												While it looks like most of the major bugs and technical problems have been cleaned up - I encountered only one major issue - it's still not a great game. If you're not a Doctor Who fan, there's absolutely no reason to play The Eternity Clock, because it does a pretty poor job of explaining what's going on for newcomers. Fans of the series will get a lot more out of the game and might be more willing to forgive some of its shortcomings, because the writing and voice acting are actually pretty good. Whether or not you should play this game depends entirely on how much you like Doctor Who and if you're caught up with the current series.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/03/doctor-who-eternity-clock.html "

												Great Scott! We're in 1955, Marty! We need to...Use the TARDIS to get some magical time vortex thingy? Maybe I'm looking at the wrong game.Compared to Doctor Who: The Adventure Games, this is the greatest thing to ever have been created.Even with that comparison, this game is pretty good.Pros: The plot is interesting, the controls are easy to use, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, there are plently of collectibles to fill your meaningless life with, and the voice acting is well done and funny.Cons: The only complaint I have is the NPCs that follow you. I swear, Riversong is out to get me. She cannot do anything by herself, and will consistently perform the same mistake OVER AND OVER.Overview...This game is pretty good, and I'm surprised at how well this game managed to be. It's a simple platformer, but with 3D aspects. If you're a fan of Doctor Who or someone looking for a good game, you're in the right spot.9.99/10, still mad at River(EDIT: I will keep my review the same, but I'd like to say the following.River has gotten even worse since the last time I played. I tried to do a puzzle requiring River and I couldn't complete it. She won't do anything and I can't get her to do what I need to do to finish the puzzle. This seriously needs to be fixed.)			"

												i find this game disapointing, sure it has the voices from the show and the good music, but its just done all wrong, first of all this game is a 2D platformer, let me repeat that, a doctor who game is a 2D platformer. the doctor does fricken wall jumps. not to mention the sonic screwdriver mechanic is terible and very slow despite parts of the game needing the sonic screwdriver segmants to go quickly. i really dont recommend this game, it should have been made by talltail.

												I think this game is fairly straight forward and requires a lot of logic and skills to complete each location.This game could really do with a co-op mode as I'm aware that the console versions had a co-op mode. As completing certain tasks can be frustrating and timely. Which would help those that are struggling to have a partner assistance as the opposite character.Don't let the Daleks beat you! "

Posted: March 3, 2014
												I really wanted to love this game. As a huge 'Who' fan.... finding a game where i can BE the Doctor.... seems like a jolly good time to me. However, in reality, I am left feeling as if I've thrown my money away in hopes of what might have been.Essentially, a mediocre platformer, with mostly not-difficult-at-all puzzles, framed in an uninspired Who-like story involving unnecessary time travel, and needless plot complications. Sure, there's Smith's voice-over, but in this game even they get boring.You play as the Doctor and River Song, taking turns (as a single-player or local co-op) to solve the simple puzzles to unlock the next levels. As it may be evident, in my opinion - these puzzles are way to easy. Increasing the difficulty did not seem to challenge me any more significantly. It's worth noting here, that in the past, I've found games with simple, yet fun puzzles can be worthwhile and enjoyable (see: Machinarium). 'Twas not the case with Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock.The level design was simple and easy to comprehend and solve with a cursory glance at your options. Each new level became increasingly tiresome as I was never presented with anything new, unusual, or interesting. The worst examples of this are the timed levels. Who enjoys running through a simple, slow paced, run and jump level as the enemy marches ever so slowly from off-screen? All in all, it felt as if the creative team was taking a nap.Gameplay movement is as basic as it comes. Think 'Trine' without the beautiful (and surprisingly interactive) surrounding environment. The Doctor can run, and jump (although limited), he can hang and climb (a bit). Oh, yes, don't forget crawling. His trusty Sonic Screwdriver can levitate and move certain objects. This could easily be ANY basic platformer... this one simply has a Matt Smith texture to go along with its classic Who villains textures. Graphics are a middle-of-the-road 'okay'. Nothing to blow you away with realism, but the representations of wooden boxes, platforms, and floors was recognizable enough. The Doctor is definitely Smith in terms of appearance... but then again, hardly photo realistic either.  A solid 'meh' in terms of scoring.Audio? Well there IS the standard Who score for certain screens, but no real background score during actual gameplay. The voice acting is standard delivery by Matt and Alex, but could have been cut out from unrelated clips from the TV series rather than separately recorded for all the emotional depth it brings. Hard to imagine that there was any direction for the actors, nor any real desire to make this game as good as it could be.So, gameplay is a solid 5/10 (no real flaws, but nothing to inspire and excite either), Graphics get another 5/10, followed by the lame audio (3/10). Story you ask? What story? Come up with any reason at all to have the Doctor skip around through time and jump through three levels of building to flip a switch. Your imagination is probably more compelling than this. (2/10).Question: Why does anyone want this game? Answer: They are a huge Doctor Who fan, and don’t mind throwing their hard earned cash at ANYTHING that has that logo.Overall - 4/10 "

												If you're a Whovian and you enjoy traditional side-scrolling platformers with nice puzzles, this game is definitely for you. Buy it now. It's not without its flaws, but the game as a whole is, as 9 would say, fantastic. The AI is kind of terrible, the controls can at times be just outwardly bad, and nobody likes restrictive time limits (which this game seems to have a lot of) but the voice acting by Matt Smith and Alex Kingston is incredible, the basic Doctor Who humour is there, and the game is challenging enough.

												It's not that fantastic. It's a puzzle platformer with the Doctor Who title and theme.Though I wouldn't call it cliche, I'd say it isn't anything super unique.The situational puzzles are decent. I got lost a few times, and I had no idea what to do, but that's the thing about puzzles that I like. But when I found out what to do, it turned out to be so obvious and easy that I felt stupid.The in-game puzzles are too easy and are re-used from other sources. Also, there are specific scenes where if you're busy trying to solve a puzzle, some enemies might walk up to you and kill you, putting you back at your last checkpoint.I experienced frame-rate drops whenever I decided to rapidly fire my laser pistol or whenever I died.Graphics aren't the best, but nothing too bothersome.Sounds and voices replay a bit too often.No replay value, other than collecting diary pages that you can read and hats that have a quote from the Doctor.Overall; Watch someone play it. Don't play it yourself. If you're a fan of the series, the gameplay is not worth it, and the story isn't really too interesting. For me anyway.			"

												Да, эта игра только для фанов. И дело даже не в том, что сразу возникнут вопросы - что за звуковая отвертка, кто такая Ривер, что вообще происходит, доктор Кто? Игра перенасыщенна паззлами, при чем не сложными, а нудными, разнообразие привносят паззлы на скорость, но это тот еще мазохизм. Нарисована игра ужасно, и тем ужаснее, чем ближе это показано. Одно дело, когда ты бегаешь вертя звуковой отверткой во все стороны, совсем другое, когда начинается заставка. Стоит отметить, что игра совершенно сырая, в ней ползает много надоедливых жучков, которые иногда заставляют желать разбить геймпадом телевизор.НО. Это доктор Кто. С озвучкой от оригинальных актеров. С музыкой из сериала. С амосферностью сериала. Игра держится только на этом, но ощущение того что ты доктор Кто и бегаешь вертя звуковой отверткой прикрикиваешь вместе с ним ""O! I like buttons"" и испытываешь ощущение от приключения - это да. Игра строго для фанов, как я уже выше говорил.			"

I am currently stuck in the sewers, trying to get to the door before the Cybermen zap River! She moves TOO DAMN SLOW, limiting the time I have to get the right frequency to open the door! And if you die, you have to go through all that level's crap again to get back to the door that was the issue! As much as it pains me, I am moving from this game, as should you - there are far better games available on Steam!			"

												I would love to rate up this game, as I really do like the puzzles and challenges of this platformer game. There's one major problem though. Part of the way through the game, in a crucial part where you're being chased by cybermen so you have limited time, the elevator you need to get up the floors doesn't work. This has left me unable to continue the game at all, and the only solutions I've seen are to reinstall or verify files and so on. Trying those, I did progress a little only for the storyline to go back to the same building and the elevator to not work even worse than before. Really want to keep playing, but seems as though I can't.			"

												It's a $10 game, and for that a good one.  There's a lot of posts regarding shotty AI or glitched elevators but the reality is those are very very minimal, and a lot of times the frustration sets in b/c of the games lack of guidance on how to do things (ie: operate an elevator). Or you're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥River won't follow you through a gate you got open but if you work it out you realize she wasn't supposed to.The dialogue is spot on for the show, the use of the sonic screwdirver for unlocking doors is clever and once you figure it out they add a new element. Suprisingly it can be a bit difficult (e.g. The Cybermen battle in the subway) but more often than not it's because you are overthinking what SHOULD happen as opposed to what you are supposed to do.I'd give it a solid 8/10 (keeping in mind it's a $10 game).

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 8.50/10SoundTrack: 8/10Overall: 8.87/10Doctor Who is without question one of the most influential television series in existence. The show’s nearly fifty years old now and has gone through some radical re-generations in that time. We currently get to watch Matt Smith play Doctor and tell us all about how cool bow-ties and fezzes while abhorring violence, nonchalantly flipping a sonic screwdriver around in his hand and saving the world in less than an hour.The first spin-off game in 1983 and all subsequent releases since haven’t really let people experience Doctor Who in a truly immersive, interactive environment that does the expansiveness of the show’s as-life universe justice. Most episodes of the television show seem to encapsulate that feeling of infinite exploration even when confined to the smallest budget sets. It’s about time there was a videogame that similarly captures that same wonderment.Shame that the episodic Adventure Games series released a year or two ago are as close as the BBC have got in reciprocating the show quality in videogame format. While they’re still a far cry from what fans truly want from a Doctor Who videogame tie-in, they’re still better in almost every aspect to the messy, broken puzzle-platformer that the BBC and Supermassive Games have coughed up for us this year. Doctor Who: The Eternity ClockOne afternoon with The Eternity Clock was enough for me. Once the paltry campaign was behind me and thus the entire game’s content was exhausted the disc went straight back into its case. Even if interested in acquiring the few in-game collectibles and trophies left after story completion, there’s little to no incentive to put the disc back in your console and fight your way through the issues for a second time.The Eternity Clock’s redemptive qualities are not just few and far between but enjoyable only the first time around. A second playthrough will only serve to make the technical issues all the more frustrating to deal with. The faithfulness to the show structure is apparent but Whovians can only appreciate this intermittently as they struggle to overlook the stack of cons that overwhelm, not least in the middling story and sub-par visuals.At least the pre-chapter TARDIS scenes allow Matt Smith and Alex Kingston to offer up some great vocal work, and the motion capture technology at work can at least attempt to do the exuberant mannerisms of The Doctor some justice. Once you step outside of the ship though, you get to experience drab environments with very quickly tedious puzzles and dull action sequences that strike close to home with the argument that a non-violent protagonist doesn’t work in an action-adventure game. Doctor Who: The Eternity ClockActions do speak louder than words with The Eternity Clock and in spite of the zippy, well-scripted dialogue exchanges between The Doctor and River Song the action is a tepid sequence of disenchanting, problem-rife 2.5D platforming schlock. The environmental puzzles are largely uninspiring, failing to strike the balance between accessibility for the young and challenge for the old: some puzzles are insultingly easy while others are infuriatingly punishing. At least the developers had the sense to give River a gun to play with: her ability to stun and the Doctor’s ability to wave a sonic device around to open doors and move platforms adds something to the co-op play at least.It’s advisable if you do choose to play this through to completion that you rope in someone to play this alongside you since the friendly AI becomes increasingly incompetent and prone to ignorance. Several puzzles will put you up against the metaphorical clock to complete them before being killed by a Cyberman or a Dalek or whatever else is rattling off a short list of menacing one-liners while slowly working their way towards you. A bemusing design choice but one that was perhaps inevitable given that the ‘flight not fight’ ethos of the Doctor creates the need for you to use your mind to defeat enemies: acceptable perhaps, were it not for the lack of puzzle randomization.There are a few puzzles that you have to solve via terminals and such but once you’ve learnt how to solve them it’s simply a case of remembering what pattern they each follow. Playing through on Hard won’t hide this oversight sadly, since the puzzles just become a little bit more arduous and longer, reducing the amount of margin for error you have. You do a fair bit of running away from enemies before being given the chance to destroy them; the lack of much wiggle room on the hardest difficulty at least keeps the tension felt from racing around going. Doctor Who: The Eternity ClockWhat does really take away from the tension and pacing of the game are the persistent glitches and technical problems which plague the experience start to finish. Several restarts were required on my individual playthrough: issues ranging from invisible enemies – not the Silence though, that invisible enemy type is subversively something the game makes surprisingly effective use of – to texture clipping and getting stuck in objects and walls. An almost non-existent checkpoint system meant that on several occasions – either due to forced restarts or poor game design coupled with these glitches – my progress was severely hampered as I’d be forced to redo large chunks of chapters again, compounding the boredom felt solving the puzzles and navigating through the mediocre platforming sections.What makes things just that extra bit worse is that there’s barely a story to help try to hold this all together. The narrative sees an amalgamation of some of the Doctor’s numerous foes individually trying to take swipes at him while he scampers evasively around the place. Fanciful jargon a-plenty is used to add a little Who-style faux context to the events transpiring but it’s all a little confusing and convenient at times, a story about a device of some kind that records all history and could potentially unravel it if baddies get their grubby mitts on it a scapegoat for famous show foes to appear and say a couple of catchphrases. At least the enemies don’t succumb to the erratic visuals that mess with the faces of The Doctor and River and rough up the environments some; the Daleks in particular remain glossily intact.Constructed like a one-off webisode and showing a disconcerting lack of care and attention, this is not the Doctor Who game counterpart the television show deserved. If the BBC are serious in wanting to bring this franchise to major consoles they need to try harder because The Eternity Clock is not up to scratch, not by a long shot. This may well be the first of three games in a series: if that’s the case, Supermassive Games and the BBC have a lot of work to do…onehitpixel.com "

Though this game is ""Doctor Who"" it honestly wasn't a fun experience for me.  First of all the game was barely playable for my computer (and my computer can run most games pretty well), the frames were terrible and because of that i was hard/impossible to get to some areas.  After struggling  to get past the first two areas of the games i was met with some pretty cool mechanics but shortly after that I was met with a minigame/boss fight that was impossible to beat (for me anyways) and ever since i have never touched it unless to fool around with some funny sound queues or animations.I cannot reccommend the game unless you have a good computer and you are a BIG fan of Doctor Who.In my old review I wasn't aware that video display changes could be made to make my game run smoother.  Though Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock is very buggy for a game that should better quality then what is given.  Aparently there is a lot of game breaking bugs in this game (I have actually encountered a few but luckily, solved them fairly quickly) which is not good if you like smooth games/gameplay.  Also this game has a lot of funny things to do such as: Innapropriate gestures made by spamming on and off the sonic screwdriver, voice spamming (Click on collected hats repeatedly) and somewhat broken animations to mess around with!Graphics :  7/10 (Pretty good, if your computer can handle it)Gameplay : 5/10 (Mostly good but has annoying platforming and movement.  This game also has puzzles)Sounds : 4/10 (Basically a lot of zapping sounds that are low quality and TARDIS (most likely) sounds ripped from the showMusic : 6/10 (Music taken from the show.  BUT IT'S SO GOOD!)Voice Acting : 6/10 (Riversong has, by far the best voice acting but the rest is ok)Puzzles : 6/10 (Platforming puzzles, generic image creation puzzles and somewhat original puzzles and they all can be made more difficult)Story : 9/10 (Story feels as though you are experiencing a DW story/episode though it's just that)________________Overall : 7.5/10The game is pretty good and I would recommend it to any Whovian, though there are some much needed updates (to fix bugs) that will sadly never come.

												Personally I LOVE this it's very fun and intriguing the puzzles can be a bit annoying now and then. But I think that it's really cool going from the present to the future to the past and to the future again, the dialogue is also hilarious. Something I liked but at the same time didn't like was (SPOILERS) it takes place in the same area of London throughout the game. Something I was really dissapointed by was that you can't pilot the TARDIS, or even explore it. I'd rate this game 11/10I wish this game was longer or that they had somehow fit the Sontarans into the game, though I did like the option to play the game with 2 people instead of 1. Currently I'm on a quest to get the remaining four hats missing from The Doctor's collection and six quarter pages of River Song's TARDIS journal. It's an awesome game plus you can shoot cybermen, cybermats, daleks, and even silence. Buy this game!			"

												In City Streets III. The elevators will sometimes glitch out and not let you proceed. It doesn't look like the dev's will fix it so don't get it unless you see they have fixed the errors, or your just certain that it won't glitch on ya.			"

												The story and voice acting for this game is amazing. However, everything else is just... well, meh. The puzzles are mostly easy to solve, with the exeption of anything having to do with the broken AI. I only recommend this game to extreme fans of Doctor Who, as the casual fan will get fed up with the atrocious AI and boring puzzles before they get through this game.			"

												Doctor Who fans will love this game. Though the ending confuses me and I'm not exactly sure if any of the other games tie in with this one or if it's just got a random cliff hanger as the ending. I haven't beaten the hardest difficulty so I can't say whether or not that unlocks a true ending.			"

												if you cant tell ""ahem""  I LOVE DOCTOR WHO AND THE 11TH DOCTOR ""cough cough"" so with that out of the way my review isnt going to be 2 in depth because i like simplicity the game is like it says a puzzle platformer and i normally dont like puzzle games but i sucked it up for this game and i really enjoyed it the story is very interesting and i dont think it will ever happen but i wish they would countinue this story the puzzles are simple yet fun i guess i shoulda expexted that from doctor who i like the dynamic between river and the doctor the numerous hats and dairy pages you collect throughout the game is a nice touch and the enimes are easy and fun the frustrating part that i had with the game was the silence part but that was probably only me all in all a good game for doctor who fans and anyone who would like to play also i ramble if that isnt obvious			"

												A great game except for a glitch where if you press the up and jump buttons at the same time the charactor gets stuck in the climbing position in the air and it is fixed by going to the main menue and going back. This makes you lose all progress on the level. My solution: make the up and jump buttons far away on the keyboard.			"

												awesome game I highly recommend this game who are doctor who fans like me. If you love puzzles games that are hard core than this game is for you. so many challenges you can even use the sonic screw driver which is awesome and not to mention excellent price for this game. so if you love a good challenge buy it after you beat this it makes you want to go and play it again trust me on this			"

												Really enjoyable and intereting voice acting. I flimsy plot but a great excusses to play the doctor. The sad part is the game is really short, i was taking my time and i clocked in at just over 9 1/2 hrs. However if you like Doctor Who you have to buy this game.			"

												Don't me wrong I'm a huge Doctor Who fan, but this game just sucks. It's buggy as all hell and the AI is horible. Do yourself a favor If you want a Doctor Who game buy the Doctor who Adventure games instead.			"

												Really good platformer with lots of cool (and non trivial) puzzles.Also really cool plot that will take you to enjoy time travel and fight with greatest dr Who advisaries: Daleks and Cyberman (and more). Also lots of great Dr Who humour and last but not least - River is companion in this interactive episode.The only cons is controls - when really cool most of the times, sometimes they're buggy (especially when interacting with objects). Through game I had hard-restart from checkpoint around 5 times because of such gameplay bugs. 8.5/10 from me :)			"

												Well What Can i Say:Pros:* Visually its a step up from The Adventure Games in The Graphical Department* It Features Alex Kingston and Matt Smith's Voice* Cutscenes are rather coolCons:* The Gameplay is horrible- The Adventures Games was more fun than this* The Controls are wonky* There are tons of bugs* The 2D Stealth athon action feels boringIf you are a fan of Doctor Who Games than avoid this and get The Adventures/The Gunpowder Plot- it might not be graphically impressive but its more fun than this or write to the BBC and beg them to give the rights to Telltale games			"

												A competent little puzzle platformer starring The Doctor (Matt Smith) and his wife, River Song. The best part of this title really is the fact it is voiced by the actors. The game, though pretty straight foreward, is quite fun and I am enjoying it immensely. I must say though, unless you are a Whovian, you may not like it since it is nothing new gameplay wise and sadly there's no internet co-op. It does offer 2-player, though.			"

												This Fun and quick platform puzzle game featuring the 11th Doctor and  River Song, is a must have for everybody that enjoys Doctor Who.One down side is that the game saves for you and you can't manualy save your progres, but on the other end the chapters are short so you don't have to play for houres to come to a new auto-save point.
