												It's not very common for a video game to have a totally satisfying and conclusive ending, even more so if it’s a series. The Blackwell games managed to stick the landing completely and Epiphany makes for one of the best conclusions I've ever seen in a video game.Do yourself a favor and buy the whole series right now and start from the beginning. The series grows and gets better with each installment. Epiphany is just a great culmination of everything that came before it mixing great writing and logical puzzles into an overall fantastic game. Epiphany has quickly become one of my new favorite games. I also would say that The Blackwell Series as a whole easily rivals the adventure game classics. Fans of the series should buy this game ASAP and for those who haven't played them I reiterate to just buy the whole series now if you're interested, you’re in for a memorable ride. I definitely won't be forgetting it anytime soon.			"

												Oh, where to start?! If you've never played a Blackwell game before you really should start with The Blackwell Legacy (or even The Shivah, which ties-in) because this is the fifth and final part of a story arc, and it just won't mean anything to you unless you've done the others. It is a fairly typical Wadjet Eye game - good characters, a deep, rich plot, great music and some lovely art that mixes modern with retro styles - and it comes with the flaws you expect from adventure games, i.e. moon logic and a rigid progression structure... ah, whatever. It doesn't matter.If you liked the earlier Blackwell titles, this will cap the story for you and you just... have to. Seriously. BUY IT.			"

God, I haven't seen a movie in forever... - Rosangela BlackwellBlackwell Epiphany is... or was... - gosh, I cannot believe that I'm putting this fact in words, my heart literally breaks - is the final installment in Blackwell series. You've been prepared for this final act throughout the whole series, and when you face it... you will know there could be no better ending. It is not the ending you want. It is not the ending you asked for. You keep whispering to yourself, even screaming in your head that this shouldn't happen! Yet you know that there is no better ending that this title deserves. We go out with a bang. It leaves you with a bittersweet sensation. We have to acknowledge that it is our time to say goodbye.A couple months after the events of Blackwell Deception, we learn that Rosa has established a symbiotic relationship with Detective Durkin. She has become a silent informant for Durkin, as he helps Rosa to reach inside information on cases that she works on. Durkin doesn't ask questions, Rosa doesn't impose answers. We catch up on this partnership when Rosa is sent to investigate a rundown hotel by Durkin. A casual enough ""ghost whispering"" case occurs and finds resolution by Rosa and Joey's already tried abilities. Just as Rosa was leaving the scene, she witnesses a dreadful murder! The next day, not a word is spoken on the news about the said murder and Rosa's suspicions do raise by the minute. Does the police cover up the story? Why? It is time for us to chase another mystery... Maybe our last.In this final game, we encounter many old friends, enemies and familiar bystanders. Sometimes we smile, sometimes we pout, other times we wish that we'd be capable of throwing a punch through our screen. We live through our saddest, happiest, weirdest, cruelest encounters yet. But in the end, what rests with us the most are no other than Rosa and Joey. We witnessed their growth, both in character and relationship step by step. Now we are able to see that Rosa has fulfilled her potential, and we can finally claim that we know who Joey Mallone is. They are the kind of characters that you'll keep carrying with you long after their stories are told. Rest is ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"".Gameplay wise, the game contains the longest playtime compared to all other installments as you can expect. There are many things to reveal, explore or dabble with. I'd say one play through would take around 8-10 hours, which would completely worth the full price. We are already familiar with all options and controls that the game has in store for us. Nothing changed. If I were to complain about one thing, I'd say there was some relevantly periodic backtracking which concerns casual visits to police station. Aside, I am silent on the complaint department.There are thousands of words that I wish to write about this masterpiece of an adventure game, but sadly the contents elude me as I ponder on. This was it. The one big finale. The grand exit. Literally no more Blackwell games to wait for. I found myself holding my breath as the story unwraps its countless unexplained mysteries one by one. Each crisp of information blew my mind. Each answer that I have been given, I anticipated for more. Flashbacks, metaphors, oddly exchanged dialogues, the gravity of choice and the collective unconscious; they all came back to present us the finale that we were waiting for. And that finale, was excellent!Just as I realized ""what the hell was happening"", the credits started to roll. I felt tears filling my eyes, and I cannot say this for a lot of games. Well done, Dave Gilbert. Well done and well played! I bow before you! I'll be missing everything about this game.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												111 reviews, only 15 bucks, published way back in April... how unfortunate.Only one guide for this game. One. The only one that I could find anyway. I only really looked for it because I had a slight difficulty with something I missed. I'd seen what I needed to do earlier, I just didn't remember, probably because I'd run out of coffee quite a while ago.Anything I could rag on this game would pretty much be nitpicking. In all honesty, if this game made any screw-ups, they are no worse than certain AAA titles that get stupidly enormous amounts of undeserved praise. The ending wasn't perfect, I kinda saw it coming, but it gripped me and it didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Granted, yes, a few holes were left unfilled, but ultimately they can somewhat be ignored due to the way things were wrapped up being quite final. It did seem a tad abrupt, though, but I've seen far worse endings, believe me.The gameplay tries to draw elements from all the previous titles and succeeds rather well. I felt it was a bit of a challenge without being completely convoluted and irrational as torturing your neighbor's dog for no reason, so I'm happy. At no point did I really need a guide, but nothing was excessively easy. This and the last game both did this pretty well, unlike Convergence which felt rather too straightforward to me.Maybe the series could have kept going, wrapped a few more loose-ends up, but overall I think this was a fine conclusion to an excellent series. It's a shining light at the end of it all.			"

												This review stands as a full review of the entire Blackwell series. I was introduced to this series a meager four days ago. I was intrigued by the old-school point and click ""talkies"" I had grown up with on old CD-ROMs from Fate of Atlantis through the Monkey Island series all the way to the newer Telltale Games products. I hardly knew what I was getting myself into.The Blackwell series stars the Blackwell family, mainly Rosa and introducing her Aunt, Lauren, in Unbound. At some point in the past, their Grandmother suddenly became saddled with a ghost, Joey, who was her spirit guide. Unable to take the pressure (limiting plot spoilers), she died and Joey passed onto the aunt. It turned out he is a spirit guide, destined to guide Mediums like the series protaganist Rose to lead lost spirits to the final destination.This is where the puzzle element comes into play. Like most adventure games, you interact with the environment through investigation, item manipulation and conversing with other characters. The first game in the series, Legacy, is fairly light on puzzles and is easily completed, but the series quickly grows into a satisfying old-school adventure title as the series progresses. Epiphany is the masterstroke of the series in this regard, with multi-threaded and complex puzzle threads that still fit well within the realm of logic.However, where the series truly shines is in the storytelling. The writing, character development and accompanying voice acting is near perfection. The series easily hooks you into the characters and makes you care about them. The slow reveal of the history, feelings, pain and emotion of each character over each of the five games easily drew me into the Blackwell world. With Epiphany, the entire series wrapped up in a way few games, movies or even television shows could ever hope - satisfying, even if bittersweet.There are a couple of hiccups in the game, primarily in code bugs in Unbound that cause voice tracks to trigger improperly, one being an ugly spoiler mid-way through that gave away part of a conversation from the game's finale, but otherwise is solidly coded and well designed. The graphics may also be a bit of a put-off to more modern gamers since it is intentionally created in a low resolution, non-widescreen format to mimic the old CRT monitors some of us older gamers were stuck with nearly two decades ago. But the artwork presented in close-ups, photos, desktop backrounts, and other areas is fantastic and feels alive.I whole heartedly recommend the entire five game series. Go back to the Blackwell Legacy and pick it up from there and don't stop until you finish up Epiphany. The game is a well build emotional ride with solid puzzle mechanics fit for a good old school adventure game. From someone used to adventure games being the high-energy comedy like Day of the Tentacle, The Blackwell series was a huge surprise. Though the surprise was pleasant and I believe it will be so for everyone else who gives this a try.			"

												The biggest and best game of the Blackwell series. If you've played other games in the series you'll know what you're getting into, but to put it simply this is Wadjet Eye's finest work to date - a point and click game that I can easily recommend alongside classics in the genre.Once again, players take on the roles of both Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone, their job is, as always to help lost souls move on, and as before there are a large number of ghosts that need saving, each with a different story to tell. Unlike previous games, all the ghosts in this game tie directly into the primary overarching narrative, adding considerable gravitas to proceedings and helping to shake things up. There is some assumption of prior knowledge of the series, the game doesn't waste time retreading how Rosa and Joey do their jobs but instead dives right into the main course. In terms of gameplay. The dual characters mechanic returns once again and players must make use of both Rosa's and Joey's different abilities to solve puzzles and overcome dialogue based obstacles throughout the game. Puzzles are for the most part fairly simple, there's no hair tearing moments and bizarre solutions to impede your progress - for the most part everything is pretty logical. The clue system from previous games returns, requiring players to combine topics/clues from their in game notes page to determine links and hypothesise potential solutions to problems. This works well for the most part, with Joey again serving as an in-game hints system that the player can utilise as much or as little as they desire. The focus here is very much on the story, there are also plenty of references to previous games for fans yet the game is also strong enough to stand on its own.In terms of game length, the game feels longer than previous entries, I think Wadjet has finally hit upon the optimal length for its games with Epiphany after previous entries were criticised for their short length. The narrative and writing quality are consistent throughout, Wadjet Eye have been going from strength to strength with this series and Epiphany is no exception. I did notice a new mechanic in play early in the game, where the two leads would spontaneously begin short, unprompted banters discussing their current location, etc, not unlike the party banter systems employed in several rpgs. Sadly this fizzled out quite quickly and is only seen in the first third of the game.The artwork in Epiphany is fantastic throughout, it's building on a similar aesthetic to Blackwell Deception but everything is more detailed and beautifully rendered in pixel art. They've found a really great style to use (and artist to bring it to life) and they neatly sidestep the animation issues that many other modern point and clicks exhibit because of it. Hoping to see future games maintain the same style and level of quality.The music is nice and fits well with the tone of the game for the most part, it did seem to be a little on the quiet side this time around and is very much in the background for most of game. In terms of other audio - Wadjet's voice acting on the technical side of things has come a long way now, there's none of the issues the plagued earlier entries to be found here which is great. All series regulars reprise their roles in Epiphany and they all give solid performances.In terms of story, this being the final game in the series, Epiphany wraps up the Blackwell series and answers most of the questions you might have had. I won't lie though, I wish we'd have seen some more entries to the series before the finale.Sadly there is one significant dropped plot arc which occurs (or rather should have occurred) between Deception and Epiphany that I felt hurt the continuity between those two games somewhat. Based on the ending of Deception and where Epiphany picks up it felt that we'd skipped a step in the story of Rosa and Joey and just leapt from there to the series finale, which is an unusual and unfortunate misstep. Aside from this one issue the series as a whole flows nicely from one game to the next. I won't talk about the ending here as I think that's something best experienced and I don't want to colour anyone's view on it, suffice it to say I felt it was a fitting ending but it's not the one I would have gone with.There's always been a certain sense of familiarity with the Blackwell series and the protagonists thankless task of helping the dead move on all the while the hustle and bustle of New York. There's something that's quite grounded in reality about the series that makes it quite endearing and relaxing to play, this is underlined through Dave Gilbert's commentaries that are embedded within each game you really get a sense that you're experiencing these locations through his memories and the series as a whole just really has a sort of personal touch that's difficult to describe and I don't often see/feel in most games. That, married with the real world setting really heightened the experience for me across the Blackwell series.Ultimately, Blackwell Epiphany is highly recommended, as a fan of the series this was a deeply satisfying game to play. If you've never played the Blackwell series before, or if it's sat in your Steam backlog, start with Legacy and work forwards from there - if you're a fan of the genre, you won't regret it.			"

												Rosangela Blackwell is a struggling author living in New York, and a medium. Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to ""the other side"" throughout the series. In BLACKWELL EPIPHANY, the fifth and final installment of the game series. Rosa’s now fully embraced her quest to find trapped spirits in New York and help them to move on.  We finally discover the origins of the two most prominent characters of the series, and learn a little more about a shadowy organization that is the antithesis of everything Rosa and Joey stand for. Many answers to things will be brought to light which have been hanging over the series since it's inception. The Blackwell series has always been focused on human stories, which has made this series so special. It definitely stands strong on its own merits with the incredible writing of Dave Gilbert.EPIPHANY begins and immediately takes a serious dark turn when people's souls are ripped apart right in front of Rosa and Joey's eyes. And there's the ghost of a little girl which hits Rosa and Joey harder than others -- but, for the most part, not treated as all that different or special than the others along their journey.  Death is unfair. Rosa and Joey know and accept that. It's the race to get the little girl's ghost ‘safe’ before whatever is destroying souls can take her death as easily as it took her life. There are other ghosts to be dealt with, too. From the TV news anchor desperate to leave her past behind, to the brother and sister striving to deal with childhood abuse. How does one end such a phenomenal series? When you get to the last act, everything kicks into high gear heading for the finish line ... the grand finale. And, wow! What a finale! The very last scene is ... dare I say ... perfect! Thanks, Dave, for such a wonderful experience over the past decade with the Blackwell series. Kudos!!! (To enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.)

Overview: Blackwell Epiphany is the fifth and final installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. Epiphany tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, an experienced medium (aka Bestower), and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in NYC and investigating cases related to ghosts who couldn't move on to the afterlife. Pros: Despite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable The story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun (despite the whole game being really on the depressive side) Great and unpredictable ending to the series--I've read some bad reviews about it, but I thought it was awesome Everything you've ever wanted to know about the series will probably be answered The puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either--if you're used to the series, you shouldn't get stuck or need any guides The dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough. Has a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme. This feature is even improved in this game, as good as in Deception or probably slightly better. Once again, you get to control both Rosa and Joey (whose roll is even bigger then in Deception), adding a lot to the puzzles Like in Deception, having the smartphone to do research and calls makes the game flow even better than the first three games Really gorgeous retro graphics, always going up in quality throughout the games BGM is awesomeCons: No in-game way to change the resolution Alt+tabbing and alt+escing kinda screw the game (keyboard stops being recognized, some dialogues get cut down in a split second and you can't listen to/read them anymore), so you'll probably have to quit it and load it again to solve this issue A few minor inconsistencies, like characters not reaching the conclusion at the right time, or combining clues not working until after it was reasonable for it to work and stuff like that (most of those were indirectly justified in the commentaries, like ""this was added in the last week of production"" or something like that) IT'S OVER!!! =(Bought on: Steam Store for R$ 11,19 (US$ 5.99 in the US at that time). I would've bought it last holiday sales even if it had no discount (and I wouldn't be disappointed).Verdict: This is the last game in the series. Epiphany is considerably better, deeper, longer, more clever and more emotional than its prequels. Definitely the most serious, depressing (in a good way) and enjoyable game in the series. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. Epiphany also imerses you in this intricate plot in a way like no other Blackwell game does (and they were already good at that). If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! Don't forget to play the other titles first! While you could play Epiphany as a standalone game, you'll miss a lot if you haven't played the other games. So don't do it! Start at the beginning. One thousand thumbs up!			"

The game gives emotion, will make you feel empathy for main characters. I seriously recommend this saga to anyone who likes old-school, pixelated point'n'click adventure games.			"

												Epiphany really nails the final and most ambitious chapter to a charming and engaging supernatural detective series. The production quality has taken an obvious step up with Ben Chandler stepping in as lead artist, and Dave Gilbert honing his writing skills and puzzle design to near perfection. We get further backstory, a tying together of previous story threads, and closure.I have more to say about the unique strengths & weaknesses of the series, but I'll put them into my 'The Blackwell Legacy' review. The above is a simple thumbs up for those who've completed previous installments.			"

												This game has achieved something I would not have thought possible: It made me cry! The last time that happened was somewhere around the release of the movie 'The Green Mile' (the killing of that mouse just hit me hard).I started playing the Blackwell series because the first game was on sale and I really enjoy the 'adventure'  games with great stories. After I finished the first one I couldn't stop and played through all of the other ones as well. The grand finale of the series, Blackwell Epiphany, is in my opinion the best of them all.The ending was just overwhelming and beautiful. These games had, no pun intended, soul!Dave Gilbert, thank you.			"

The following is my opinion on the Blackwell series (and not just this fifth and final installmentThough the design, length and quality of these games vary from one another (the production span is 8 years), it is nearly impossible to take them apart. Sure, the gameplay can change drastically, the tone may shift from giddy to utter dark but it never feels wrong. That's hard to explain but Dave Gilbert sure did great.The writing is excellent, the voice acting is great, the puzzles are logic (which is not a given in adventure games) and the overall feel of the series is spot-on.If you're a fan of point n' click you cannot miss those games. For the others, it may rest on your ability to enjoy a game under 480p with a slow pace. But it is absolutely worth it.Oh, and Ben Chandler, the God-on-Earth-of-AGS-community has worked on the penultimate game as well as this one here. Just so you know.			"

												The Blackwell series is a very very good point and click adventure with pretty good voice acting.You need to play them all to really feel the story and the depth of the characters. The Finale(Epiphany) was FANTASTIC(you may shed a tear). Its one of those games where the toil of playing all those hours actually felt meaningful in the end. The Voice acting was satisfying enough to make you forget its actually a point and click game.Some solutions to some puzzles may not be that obvious at first, but if you dont get it,plenty of guides there.Since almost all the blackwell games have similar mechanics, didnt think of writing different reviews for each of them. 9/10 for the series. Writing this after playing all the 5 episodes.Kudos to Dave Gilbert and The whole Team.			"

												Blackwell Epiphany concludes one of the best point and click adventure series in years.  It's amazing how the series developed for all this time. Each game in the series kept getting better and better. And this applies to every aspect of the games - the puzzles, the graphics, the sound design and dubbing cast and so on.The story in this one takes a really dark turn and it takes it graceully. The ghost stories are moving and much deeper than anything you've seen in games made by Telltale per example.One thing's for sure - I will miss Rosa and Joey very damn much.			"

Short version: 73%The final entry of the Blackwell series almost reached the status of a real classic… but by the end the plot just became so ridiculous it may as well be considered the ‘Lost’ of independent point ‘n’ click adventure games.Long version:The Blackwell saga is one of the most popular indie point ‘n’ click series, thanks to its memorable cast and the great writing presented in the everyday drama behind the many featured ghost stories.In some respects, the last chapter, Epiphany, is the best of the series. The ghost stories are all exciting, touching, and presented with great writing skill. The framing plot knows how to push you forward, but in a subtle way. The characters are as deep as ever with great dialogues.The puzzles are a lot closer now to a usual adventure game: they are far from being realistic, but they also offer better game play and balanced difficulty, if you can get yourself into the adventure game mindset.The majority the game follows the well-known path: you find ghosts, learn the tragedy behind their deaths, and send them to the afterlife. All of this is wrapped in a larger and disturbing mystery without all the forced conspiracy nonsense of Deception.We have a brand new kind of problem instead: the end of the plot not just jumps the shark, but it plays hopscotch on a sea of sharks. The somewhat believable dramatic storyline suddenly turns into the climax of a really bad 90s anime with meaningless pseudo-philosophy, godly powers, and an antagonist who, naturally, wants to kill everything.It’s a shame, really. The game shows creative genius all over. Too bad it lost all traces of credibility in the end, dragging down an entire series with another botched final.			"

 “Well, everyone already believes you are crazy. Becoming homeless is the next logical step.” Blackwell Epiphany represents the last of five parts in the Blackwell series. The most interesting aspects of these games, next to the excellent storytelling, are the characters and their development.A suitable example is the female protagonist. At the beginning Rosa’s behavior could be described as awkward and nervous. At the end of her journey she has become a confident woman, who is proud of her special gift. Overall, the Blackwell saga is a very charming adventure with wonderful characters and great writing.

												The final part of the Blackwell series does what you’d hope the final episode of a series would do. Every scrap of story left hanging from earlier parts is brought back and wrapped up here, rewarding you for sticking with it to the end. The production values are better than ever, and when I started it I hoped I would be here saying it was perfect.It might be because I played them all back to back, but I didn’t like how transparent the story structure felt. The second game established a structure which all the later games followed. This worked for the second and third game. But by the fourth it felt old, and doing it again for the final game made it weaker. I don’t want to overdo this point though, it didn’t by any means ruin the game for me. It’s just one of a few things that made it not as good as it could have been.Another weak point is the solutions to a few of the puzzles. A common point and click problem: the pixel hunting. In this game there are loads of locations, some with busy visual styles. There’s a couple times where I wanted to rip my hair out because I overlooked a 4 pixel thing on a table right next to a pile of identical stuff I couldn’t interact with.I also didn’t like how it ended. Parts of the third act were very exciting and made me giddy. But how it ultimately ends made me go “oh ok”, instead of jumping off the walls in excitement as I was hoping. That said, it wasn’t bad! I feel myself warming up to the ending as I’m writing about it. I still very much recommend this series to anyone who is on the fence about playing it. As point and click adventures go, this series, and this final chapter, are easily among the better ones.			"

The VO was superb and the writing was excellent as well. Great music all around. The puzzles were fun to figure out too. Any fans of the Blackwell series NEEDS to play this and see how this ends. Thank you WadjetEye Games for giving us one of the best adventure game series out there. I love Rosa and Joey!			"

												The Blackwell series as a whole is one of my favourite adventure ""games"" ever, probably second only to the original The Longest Journey game. It's really amazing how everything ties up in this finale, we get to meet a lot of memorable characters one last time from the previous episodes and it feels like that all those previous episodes contained clues and sidestories that foreshadowed what's to come in the conclusion. All in all Epiphany was everything we could have hoped for, it didn't really change compared to the previous games, but I don't think that anyone expected it to. Same, simple point&click gameplay with the characters we got to care about during these years. I strongly recommend playing the whole series (in order!) for anyone who likes these types of games even a little bit. I for one can't wait to see what Wadjet Eye Games comes up with next!			"

												You want ending? Blackwell will give you ENDING. The Blackwell Epiphany is the final round of Blackwell adventuring, and they make a point of going out with one, if not several, bangs.Rosa and Joey are back once more, even more dedicated to their cause following the events of Blackwell Deception and tracking a case that feels a bit heavier than their earlier workload. Things quickly spin into an even more grim situation, where bad times seem contagious and things are steadily getting less and less good, both for our plucky protagonist and, eventually, all of New York City.Of the entire Blackwell series, I'd say this round's change of sprite art is my favorite, and the portraits are up there in the ranking as well. Puzzles felt a bit easier this time around, but it could just be having gotten used to Blackwell logic after already finishing four other games in the series. There's not much I can say beyond that without spoiling, though I will say you might expect at least one twist if you've been paying attention thus far.			"

												Finishing Blackwell Epiphany, the fifth and final Blackwell game, feels like the end of an era. And it's impossible to talk about this game individually outside the context of the entire series.The Blackwell games are the kind of games you enjoy while sipping on a smooth whiskey and listening to slow jazz. Luckily, the games' soundtracks provide some amazing jazz, so you only have to worry about the whiskey.The art is a purposefully pixelated retro style, which works because the gameplay and philosophy behind it is very much in tune with the visually similar point-and-click adventure games of the 90's.The puzzles can be occasionally obtuse and frustrating, but for the most part once you learn the mechanics you'll know what to do next. And if you don't, the one tried-and-true adventure game formula of exhausting all conversation options and trying to combine every item with everything interactable will inevitably work.Where the game really shines is the voice acting. Dave Gilbert continually got very talented people to work with him and the games are so much better for it. Both Abe Goldfarb and Rebecca Whittaker deserve to win awards for their multiple performances.The series just kept getting better and better, making Epiphany easily the best entry of them all. The story really shines when it gets dark and serious, and Epiphany succeeds tremendously there. I'm so glad the writing didn't shy away from some really rough places and concepts. Bravo for taking a risk and going there.This game is like the icing on the layered cake of the whole series. Its creators should be very proud of it. You won't find better on the indie adventure game scene. I'm beyond excited for what the team at Wadjet Eye games does next.			"

												First of all, I enjoyed every bit second of it. This Game should be played as part (final part) of the whole Blackwell Series.The Story is astonishing told and has all the ingredients of a really good story. It has emotions, tension, humor and seriousness. The story is really well told and that strong to put this series in a league of one of the best adventures I played the last few years.About the different aspects of the this Games/Series:Graphics:The graphic is no highly polished, effectful 3D grahic, but it is always fitting to tell the story also in appropriate graphical way. The graphics get better with every part of the Blackwell series, but it never takess the attention away from the story.Blackwell Epiphany: 6/10 Blackwell series: 5/10Audio:The Audio is great. Every bit line is sychronized and well played by the different voice actors. This one is really great and support the whole game/series and how emotionally the story is told. The music is atmospehric and is never nerve-racking.Blackwell Epiphany: 10/10 Blackwell series: 10/10Story:I wrote it at the beginning of my review. This is one of the best told stories in an adventure / adventure series in the last few years. It has it all emotions, tension, humor and seriousness. It is well support through the graphic and even better by audio, meaning voice actors and music.Blackwell Epiphany: 10/10 Blackwell series: 10/10I can defintely recommend this game... WAIT... I insist I recommend the whole series to get the full experience out of the fantastic story.This game / series is worth every dime of it. You wil not regret it!Have fun with this adventure gem(s) :) "

												I never played one of the Blackwell games, and i don’t usually play point-and-click games because most of them are ridiculously portrayed with weird animations, voice acting, characters, and the ridiculously hard puzzles that would make you just click everything on the screen for something to happen, but then this came along, and thought, after seeing the pictures and trailers, “I like this” and was reluctant to play it but tried it anyway, and so after finishing Blackwell Epiphany i was glad and thankful to play this beautifully crafted game, and now have hope more games like this may come. Blackwell Epiphany is by far the best point-and-click game i have ever played.More info on http://www.ksalue.com/main/2014/04/blackwell-epiphany-review-the-good-the-bad-the-money/ "

												This fifth and final installment, Epiphany, is the culmination of all that the Blackwell series has been building up to. The art has really come into its own after a poor showing in the last game, and a focus on exterior locations has resulted in some truly beautiful backgrounds. Puzzles feel completely natural which could be an effect of the game design changing so little between Epiphany and Deception or simply from the fine tuning done over the past four games. This is also by far the longest of the Blackwell games. The story focuses on the job ahead of our heroes this time rather than mystery of the duty itself, but still manages to be epic. As a spirit medium, Rosangela is involved in the most important moment of each of these peoples' lives (existences), which is brought home by another string of excellent voice performances. Those individual stories are then woven together to create something that not only hits harder than it ever could have alone but also provides answers to what has become the Blackwell legacy. By the time the credits role, every loose end has been tied up as well as if could have ever been - save for one. Sadly, the society the pair vowed to hunt down at the end of Deception has been largely forgotten in order to focus on the finale of the series. As important as it was for the last game, it just didn't fit in this game. The writer includes a deleted scene in the commentary to point out exactly why that line of investigation would have overcomplicated an already complex story. The commentary track as a whole is more robust in this game than in the last. It now features explanations from the artist alongside Gilbert's traditional commentary and the occasional blooper from the voice recording sessions.This game has so much offer, but going any further in depth would run the risk of spoiling its stirring conclusion. So without giving too much away: this was a satisfying and moving end to a fantastic series.			"

												 Blackwell Epiphany is the last game in a series of five. The conclusion to everything. And, may I add, a magnificent conclusion. Epiphany mantains everything positive from Blackwell's previous instalments, and even manages to improve them, by a good margin.  Graphically speaking, there's been no evolution whatsoever. And that's pleasant, due to the already suiting, and fitting art style. Besides, after four games, one gets used to the low resolution, and pixel graphics, that are not a negative aspect, at all. There are still a bunch of achievements that add replayability to the game, as with the previous titles. Imagine if you grabbed all the action scenes from Legacy, Unbound, Convergence and Deception. Epiphany seemed to have about the same action and suspense as all the other games combined, if not more. That's amazing. And justifies the price tag, as well. As such, the title is also the lengthier of the five. Voice acting is still suprisingly good, and I will miss the sound of Rosa's and Joe's voice. Soundtrack is still a beautiful mix of Jazz, and the same theme is always being played, in different takes.  Concluding this not so long review, as I can never write about everything I experience through games, I feel like I will miss the Blackwell series dearly. I will miss to send ghosts to meet their peace. I will miss to hear both Rosa and Joe talking to each other, joking in the process. This was quite a ride. The quantity of games that can stick to a gamer's memory, at least for a long while, is quite rare, at least for me. Blackwell is not a forgettable game, I assure you. 100% recommended.			"

												Read my full review on Gamezebo: http://www.gamezebo.com/games/blackwell-epiphany/review[Score: 4/5]What seems like just another day on the job for spirit-wrangling Rosa Blackwell turns out to be an adventure cumulative of everything she has experienced through her entire life. While Blackwell Epiphany was my first experience with the series, it was clear in no time that the writers at Wadjet Eye Games were raising the stakes in Epiphany higher than they ever dared to raise them before. With guest appearances by characters from way back from the first game, Blackwell Epiphany powerfully and poetically concludes a game series which has lasted nearly a decade.Blackwell Epiphany is a point-and-click adventure where players control two protagonists (Rosalinda ""Rosa"" Blackwell and her ghost sidekick, Joey) who are tasked with finding restless spirits and guiding them to the afterlife to finally find peace. While Epiphany does feature a few puzzles, a staple of the point-and-click genre, the majority of ""puzzles"" involve uncovering facts by grinding characters for information, and conducting online research through Rosa's smartphone. About halfway through the game I fell into the rhythm of searching online, checking with the police, and asking suspects about a new piece of information I had uncovered. By the end of Epiphany I felt like I was ready to be a paranormal investigator myself. Both Joey and Rosa come with their own set of abilities which they can use in the hunt for information. Rosa comes equipped with her smartphone, which is the information hub of the game, and an always-warm cup of coffee that is used a handful of times during puzzles. Joey, being a ghost, has the unique ability to traverse through solid walls and locked doors, allowing Joey to discover information that Rosa may not have direct access to. Joey can also use his ghostly form to stir up a weak gust of wind in order to move small objects. In one case, I used Joey to blow a glass off of a table in order to distract the bartender, allowing Rosa to slip by unnoticed. The game takes place across real-world New York, and players familiar with the region may recognize a few landmarks. Turning on the commentary feature in the options menu will illuminate many real-world inspirations the game designers had for the game. I would even recommend playing through the game for the first time with the commentary, especially if you are not the sort of player who plays through a game a second time. Hearing first-hand from the designers and developers at Wadjet Eye Games really adds a level of personality to the game that would be impossible to inject otherwise. Beyond the inspired plot settings, the game's dialog is the highpoint of Blackwell Epiphany. The banter between Rosa and Joey keeps an otherwise gloomy game lighthearted. Joey, in particular, made me wish I had a snappy ghost sidekick to follow me around through my daily life. The great writing extends to many of the supporting characters as well. The five stages of loss (denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and acceptance) are all well represented within the characters of this game, and the voice actors present believable and at times, moving, performances throughout the entire game. Blackwell Epiphany does suffer a pretty substantial blow to its presentation in the form of a locked low-resolution issue. This issue has to do with Epiphany's game engine, Adventure Game Studio. On larger monitors, the game does not look great when run in fullscreen. A solution I found was to go to the game's properties in Steam, then to Launch Options, and type in ""-windowed"" to force the game to run in a small window. The end result looked much better, albeit it was about a fifth the size of my screen.As a newcomer to the series, I was afraid that much of Epiphany's tension would be lost on me as I had not experienced the buildup of the previous four games. But with such likeable protagonists, puzzles that elucidated the story further rather than slow it down, and plot twist after plot twist, by the finale I felt like I was part of Rosa and Joey's story. I felt like I was right there with them at the end when...well, you'll just have to see for yourself. "

												       A hugely enjoyable finale to the beloved series. It doesn't tie up every loose end, and not every plot development makes quite as much sense as you might like, but as a chance to reconnect with these characters and see them through one last, sweeping adventure, it is not to be missed. The voice acting and pixel-art backgrounds have never been better, and the story itself is longer by far than any of the previous entries, giving you chance to really lose yourself in the spectral mysteries and companionable snark of the Blackwell world.  If you enjoyed the other Blackwell games, it is unthinkable that you will not get a tremendous kick out of this one.Q. I liked some of the other Blackwell games, but not all. Which features does this use?A.You can still swap between Rosa and Joey, you can use inventory objects on the outside world, and you can once again combine entries in your notes to make fresh deductions (a feature I deeply missed). The art is SVGA-ish pixel art, as opposed to the cartoony drawings in some versions of earlier games, and as I say, it's probably the best art in the series (though the oddly stiff walk animation from Deception seems to have lingered just a bit).Q. Do I have to play the other games first?A. Technically no- most major plot points are recapped or alluded to in the game. You will, at the very least, be able to follow the gist of the story. But why punish yourself that way? The earlier games are funny, clever, and quick to play, and give the events of Epiphany a real impact. To say nothing of the countless grins and gasps you get from recognizing some long-forgotten plot development suddenly blossom on the screen. Unlike the vast majority or videogames, the Blackwell series has a real sense of *history* to it, and it's a treat worth savouring.			"

												The final chapter to the Blackwell series, 5 games that i've come to love for their humour and storytelling. But mainly the dynamic between the two main characters, Joey Malone and Rosa Blackwell. I've found that in adventure games, (or in most games you could say) you need challenging puzzles, a gripping story and Protagonists you can connect with.Meeting all three can be tough and can lessen any game if a story is dull, puzzles are easy or the character flat.Wadjet Eye manage to get the trifecta in this series and as such I hold it to high regard, alongside Broken Sword and the Lucas Arts adventure games.The finale is emotional and answers many questions about the characters and the backstory to the series. It's well worth playing if you've not got around to it yet, and especially worth playing the series if you're a fan of adventure games.			"

												If you've played any of the previous Blackwell games and enjoyed them, you'll enjoy the conclusion too. Epiphany is a few hours longer than previous entries in the series, and while some of the plot points are a bit far fetched, it's absolutely worth seeing how it all plays out.If you haven't played any of the Blackwell games yet, I still highly recommend them. The pixel art looks great (at least in my opinion), the voicovers are good, though some characters in the earlier entries are a little weaker, and the stories of each game are all strong on their own, and even stronger when taken together as each new game has more events to reference back to.I found the puzzles in this game were a little stronger than previous entries - what I had to do next made sense, without being overly obtuse. I'll admit I did look up a walkthrough once, but even then what I'd missed did make sense. If you do choose to pick up this game, try not to look things up unless you're really stuck - the feeling of solving a tricky puzzle is worth it.Overall, I highly recommend this series to any fans of old point and click games, ghost stories, or anyone just any game with a good story in general.

It's a classic style point and click adventure game, that avoids most of the more frustrating missteps of the genre like pixelhunting, mazes, illogical puzzles, etc.This one probably has the best production values out of the Blackwell games, it's neat to see how they've gotten better in that sense, the commentary tracks they all have provide some interesting insight into the production as well.

This is by far the longest (6+ hours) game out of the series and has the most cohesive story put together. The graphics also have been upgraded and look really sharp. The sound, voice acting and music are all outstanding once again in this finale. They did a really great job with this game, it's the best one out of the entire series and does a perfect job closing out the Blackwell series.

OverviewThis is the epic conclusion of the Blackwell series. In terms of story, graphics and characters, it's pretty much similar to all the other episodes that came before, but this one felt more extensive, perhaps due to the breadth of content and the complexity of some of the ghost cases involved. If you've played the previous Blackwell games...I would recommend that you play this one too so you know how things end. You can pretty much expect more of the same as before - there are a bunch of cases to solve, and a bigger mystery to unravel. If you've not played any of the previous Blackwell games...Then you should before playing this one, otherwise things will make no sense at all, because almost everything mentioned in this episode draws upon bits of the story mentioned in previous episodes.SummaryTo be honest I expected a better ending. There were lots of loose ends still remaining at the end of the game, and I didn't like what happened to the main characters. However the events, animation and build-up leading to the conclusion were done quite well. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy solving the individual cases involving the spooks - those were pretty interesting.			"

												Hmm...what to say. They really raised the bar in this one, as you no doubt have noticed in the trailer. The game is the final in the series of 5 blackwell games. It has such a memorable cast of characters that it's hard to ignore such a great game. I enjoyed every moment of it (even those frustraiting moments of being stuck like I get in all point-and-click adventure games) and I enjoyed it all.The ending is not what I would've wanted and I'm kinda bummed at it, but I believe it was possibly one of the best ways to end it, all things considered. I have been a massive fan of this company and though I wasn't too fond of the ending, that hasn't turned me off to their works. I hope to see more in the future.			"

												It is finally finished! This beloved series that just keeps growing on ya! I'm extremely impressed by the way that Dave Gilbert developed this story. By the end of the whole series I felt very connected to Rosa, Joey, and the cast of characters from the entire series. It is also amazing to see the games improve as they progressed, getting rid of elements that detracted from the game and replacing them with elements that helped push the game along. I'm not much of a mystery/clue finding type of gamer, so if a game series is able to get me to enjoy something that I'm not that into then the game is pretty special. For this fifth and final installment here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.Pro's: The storyline is marvelous in this game, lets just say everything wraps up rather nicely. I absolutely love Rosa and Joeys relationship and think that the actor who plays Joey does an amazing job and yes the hilarious banter is still there. The puzzles were fun, as usual. I was glad that this game had some different puzzles that the other four games had not done before and the continued ability to switch between Rosa/Joey. The length of the game was good, comparable to Convergence and Deception (Unbound and Legacy both seemed a little short).Con's: One word, the art. Still hate it and always will! I also think it is funny that I love and hate the consistency issues. I think that making the necessary changes from game to game is a good thing to do, but it really makes you feel like they should have done that in the previous games and can be a little jarring when Joey is drawn different, the style of music changes, the mechanics change, or the voice acting is different.As I've said in many of the other reviews, some of these games by themselves are not the greatest (cough...Blackwell Legacy), but if you can get through the first boring chapter in the book then you will find a pretty amazing series one that will not disappoint.Blackwell Legacy: 6/10Blackwell Unbound: 8/10Blackwell Convergence: 7.6/10Blackwell Deception: 8.2/10Blackwell Epiphany: 8.5/10Blackwell Series: 8.2/10Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!

												The fifth and final game in the Blackwell series is a beautifully crafted point & click adventure game which continues the story from the previous games. While I do heartily recommend this game I do so with the caveat that you should play all of them in order to fully appreciate the world Dave Gilbert & Co have created.It is a satisfying ending to the series and a wonderful game on its own. The voice acting is great as per usual and the game is glitch-free. the interface comes with a cellphone which doubles as a google machine. The locations are diverse and the ""spooks"" believable.Best adventure game series of the decade. None of the Blackwell games will disappoint you if you love the talkie point & click adventure games of the '90s.Encountered no bugs or broken achievements.No walkthrough required; story and puzzles make sense.10/10 "

												Here’s a point and click series that has been eight in years in the making. Fortunately, I did not spend eight years waiting to play them all as I started in early 2014, just in time for the last one to be released. The series aging poorly over a such a long time isn’t really an issue here as it’s done in the 90s style of point and click adventures. Pixel graphics, above-par voice acting, items to pick up and most of all, a compelling story.What do I think? Not bad, not bad at all. The characters draw you into well-written, appropriately voiced, engaging point-and-click adventure. It’s probably one of the most intuitive adventures I’ve played in a while (especially after playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max). It’s also the only point and click adventure I’ve played set in modern times, in the real world. It’s weird to have to think ‘modern’			"

												The whole serie of Blackwell is pretty much must have for adventure fans. Something about those games, just gets you from first screen of Legacy to a final conclusion of Epiphany... What else to say? Blackwell franchise tells a story about Rosa Blackwell and her ghost friend Joey, their work is to help spirits accept their death and help them to move on to the other side. Anyone can recall another game about medium job? That would actually includ just that, been a medium? As far as I know, Blackwell uniq in that matter. It kinda blurs in final installment, but nevertheless stays true to it's origins. Charecter development is amazing! Voice acting is cheesy at first and second games, but overwhelmengly great at later instalments. Gameplay is easy and relaxing, for adventure game it doesn't have too difficult puzzles or even pixel hunting, it based around dialogues mostly. Also all games are releatively short, but entertaining. Aw shucks. Dunno what else to say... Just that I guess: You love adventures? Get Blackwell!			"

												The Blackwell Epiphany is... pretty disappointing. It's the decent Blackwell formula most of the way through but the stories of the ghosts are never too interesting in this one, and then towards the end things get really dumb. If you're a fan of the series, which you should be, because Blackwells 1 through 4 are all amazing, its worth playing, but kind of a bummer to end on this lackluster note.			"

The story was just too awesome and the way how this game works was just too fun and attractive. I could really say blackwell has the best story and one of my favourite adventure game ive ever played(from someone played 400+ avg games in the past).it definitely worth the money. recommand, and recommand all blackwells.(some are relatively shorter tho, but you definitely dont want to miss!)

												The fifth and final entry of the Blackwell series is both thought-provoking, intense and emotionally devastating.Since this is the last part of the series, it's by far the longest - and it took me roughly ten hours to beat; which is about the length of two Blackwell games. I definitely recommend that fans who play this should do so with small breaks since there's a lot to take in. Literally all of the unanswered questions that have been bothering me - on top of Epiphany's plot, in addition - was crammed in and some bits may have flown over my head in the process. Thankfully, the mysteries surrounding Joey and the Blackwell family are finally revealed and I was happy to get that closure.Epiphany pulls out all the stops when it comes to drama, and I found myself feeling weary of what would happen to the majority of the characters - not just Joey and Rosa - which is great because that shows that the other characters are relatable and likable. The story itself does a complete turnaround and you won't be expecting the culprit behind it all and the resulting ending!I really enjoyed Epiphany, not quite as much as the others because of the depressing undertones and some of the events that unfold, but it's still a Blackwell game and it holds up to its predecessors. The only complaint I have is that the events could have been spaced out a bit more so that it wasn't just one thing immediately after another - it felt overwhelming at times. Also, the ending wasn't favorable in my opinion but I suppose it fits.Be sure to bring lots of tissues...Thank you Dave and Wadjet Eye for this amazing series and congratulations on its completion!

												(I recommend you start from the first Blackwell game if you want to try this out). This is a point-and-click game. The puzzles are well done. They complement the storyline i.e. it made sense and there's no ridiculous pixel hunting random time wasting reflex puzzles. Wadjet Eye has improved with experience since the first Blackwell. The voice acting is excellent. It has its flaws but....I didn't engage with Rosa until this game came along. I liked her more here. I went along for the ride, enjoying it for what it is. It ain't a book, it's an adventure! The personalities are distinct via dialogues and their reactions, that's quite an achievement! The music puts me in a certain era. I came away with mixed feelings. I actually felt for the characters. Even the non-major ones. I wasn't expecting that. And that's the most important thing for any story imho. The feels. Thanks for a great time, Wadjet Eye. Here's one for you, Joey. And I raise a glass to you, Blackwell.			"

I like stories, puzzles (sometimes it was ridiculous), musics and sound effects. In particular, jazz in rainy New York night will remain in my mind for long.

It wasn't my favorite in the series (for me that was the second game) but i enjoyed it about as much as episode four, which was a pretty solid point and click.

All I can state is that something happened at the end which felt too contrived and ""unrealistic"" for my sensibilities.My only technical issue was with audio ""static"" which would become distracting and require a quit-restart to temporarily resolve.

This game has the charm of a 90's point-and-click without all the hiccups. By now, the ones who have played the entire series are ready for one more hurrah with Joey and Roseangela. What a team they are. Their banter is hilarious and really keeps the game going. The puzzles really aren't difficult, since it feels like you are solving cases rather than puzzles. The atmosphere of a moody New York City in winter is perfect, along with the soundtrack. For those who haven't played the Blackwell series, you should give it a try. Its fun to see how the story builds and how the game mechanics improve with each release.			"

												I grew up on adventure games dating all the way back to the original King's Quest. I love the genre - faults and all. Some of my favourite games are adventure games.The Blackwell series completely surprised me. It had incredibly engaging characters, an intuitive investigation system, and puzzles that are challenging, but not impossible.All of this comes to a head in this fifth and final entry in the series. Its gameplay time is roughly twice or three times longer than previous games, with a lot room for character, mystery, and puzzle development. The series has improved with each game, whether it was in puzzle design or its interface. Ending the series on such a high note leaves you wishing there was more, but also feeling satisfied by its tear-jerking finale.Honestly, if you're reading this and thinking of getting it or the series as a whole, I say yes. Absolutely. I say this especially as a fan of adventure games. The Blackwell games are a gem in the sea of adventure games and you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing them.			"

												Blackwell Epiphany is the last game in the titular series where, once again, Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey will be dealing with supernatural occurrences in the city of New York.As the final episode Epiphany does an excellent job at giving the series the ending it deserved thanks to a great and engaging story.PROS:-excellent story encompasses quite a few event and characters from the series-great ending-puzzles are overall well-designed and provide a good challenge-the retro graphics are still nice-great soundtrack-full voice acting and, once more, the cast does a good joob-good lengthCONS:-having to go back to the police station to look into clues/names you've gathered ruins the pace a bit and can get dull-a few instances where interactable objects are a bit too small and can easily be overlooked-some plot points are presented a bit too suddendly-the game pace can drag down a bit at times when the main plot takes a backseat to new investigations-once more commentary mode litters the game screens with audio buttons you can't get rid of


Blackwell Epiphany 
A Screenshot of Blackwell Epiphany
By: stranger1982




When compared to the first game in the series Epiphany clearly shows how much everything has improved since then: as the final chapter it shows the series' strong points at their best with a great, and sometimes quite emotionally engaging, story and good investigative sequences backed up by puzzles that are quite finely designed. A few awkward gameplay sections and some slowdowns in the narrative as a whole are also general issues with the series but never detract from the enjoyment of the player.I'll miss playing as Rosangela and Joey and this is perhaps the best sign of how much I've loved the series and Epiphany: they were truly great characters in a very interesting and well-designed world.I fully recommend Blackwell Epiphany and the series it's part of, actually your best bet to enjoy them is playing all five episodes one after the other as if you were binging on a tv serie.

												Fantastic conclusion to the series on a character and emotional level. Some of the plot stuff is a bit out there for a series that started off relatively grounded. But still, it wraps up pretty much every dangling thread of the series, touching on various past antagonists and even giving closure the characters in the prequel game (the second one) and ends with a closed book for the most part, which is pretty rare for video games in their constant bid for sequels. Game is a bit meatier than the rest of series, lasting me about 5 hours when the rest lasted about 3, and continues the trend of the series refining as it went along when it came to its' mechanics. Most of the puzzles are pretty well done save for a couple pixel hunt moment. Snag it if you like adventure games, and if you haven't played the series at all, they're a great little run of games that know when to not overstay their welcome.			"

												Note: This review will be written with respect to the four prior Blackwell games. I've also decided to leave my Obligatory Header in those reviews as well. If you've been reading these in order, you already know my scoring philosophy and standards.Story: I don't normally do this first. The normal structure of these reviews is Gameplay, Story, Graphics, Audio. For this game, though... I've gotta bring the story top and center. Deception left me with a feeling of disappointment on the story front, especially after Convergence and its utter excellency. This game does have a few not so compelling spots, but I like to think that's for pacing's sake. The high points are well worth any wait, and they most definitely make up for any minor blemishes this game has. It does jump the shark a little bit at the end, but for drama's sake, it's top notch. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a little choked up at the end. What that one reviewer said was right, though. This really is an incredibly satisfying ending to a series which has always been about pretty great writing. 10/10.Gameplay: We've also gone back to the quality of puzzles in Convergence. They all make sense, don't require any incredible leaps of logic (despite a few instances where my solution would've worked just as well as the game's), and are often quite clever. 8/10.Graphics: The art in this game is quite frankly amazing. All the characters and backgrounds have a great amount of detail to them, the art is very clean yet stylized, and it all just looks great. 5/5.Sound: Voice acting: perfect. Music: Perfect. Fits the mood impeccably. 5/5.Overall scores are: 10/8/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. I will definitely be looking forward to more of Dave Gilbert's works.			"

Critics and naysayers alike claim that the addition of a player controlling the flow of the narrative makes this an impossibility. Those folks have clearly forgotten about one of the oldest genres in this industry’s young history – the point-and-click adventure. The Blackwell Epiphany, as well as the Blackwell series as a whole, is a modern reminder of what makes these games so great.Read more @ ReadRETRO.com, the online home of RETRO Magazine!http://readretro.com/reviews/blackwell-epiphany-review/ "

												I was actually a little leery going into this game because I had a memory of bad reviews from others. However, this game was wonderful and I think it's a good ending to an amazing series. I got hooked in on the series and it kept me intrigued through the end. Having just finished my first playthrough, I will say that I need to go back and dig deeper because there's a pretty important question about Joey that I didn't have answered in here.I found this to be a particularly emotional chapter of the Blackwell series, both in terms of the individual ghosts Rosa helps and in terms of Rosa and Joey's stories. There's a lot more delving into the wider mystical world (continuing from Deception) and some questions are finally answered. The UI is most similar to Deception, which is helpful in being able to look things up on the go. (I would have liked to get search results for things I input, though.) I'm trying to figure out if the puzzle level was easier in this game or if I've finally wised up... either way, I only had to look up help twice when I'm usually incredibly dense in these games.Overall I definitely recommend this game and the entire series. It does a nice job of wrapping things up.			"

												Great end to a fantastic series.It's honestly been a pleasure to follow this series along from the first game with some truly memorable moments.As the last game in the series this provides a fitting end and we get some answers to earlier questions and a satisfying story to tie up the whole thing.The game itself is strong, traditional adventure goodness that stays away from the mundane with a good variety of puzzles. The real strength though is in the writing and characters. Shy Rosa has developed to something much more and wisecracking Joey gets more depth of character too. The voice acting remains at the usual high standards for Wadjet Eye and Ben 304's artwork is beautiful as ever.If you have played the earlier games then this is a no brainer, but if you want to spend a little time in an absorbing adventure game world then you can't afford to miss the conclusion to the Blackwell series.

												This is the Finale of a 5 game set. You do need to play the other 4 games to understand this one. This was by far the best game in the set . The Story was great and the length of the game was pretty good. I highly recomend getting all five of these and playing them in order. I was leery buying this game by itself for 11 bucks because of the estimated length but it was very much worth it if you enjoy P&C games. Im not sure what the cost of the whole set is currently , I know the first 4 were bundled for like $2 during the summer sale 2014. But I would value all 5 games at around 30-35 dollars  (FYI I beat all 5 games in about 22 hours). If you can get all 5 for that I think you'll be happy.			"

												Overall, great ending to an amazing series. Excellent music, dialogue and voice acting. The characters are memorable and well designed. It's easy to become immersed in the game and not know how many hours have passed... There are still some plot holes at the end, and although I enjoyed it, I don't think this game really stood out in the series (I personally thought Deception was the most memorable). But it's definitely worth a try.Also, definitely play the other games in the series! If you were like me, and forgot basically everything that happened in the previous games, I recommend playing them again before you play this one (I didn't and I wish I had). This game builds off of the previous games and the whole experience becomes more meaningful if you get the references and remember what happened before.9/10			"

												Back during the Summer Sale, I picked up all of the other Blackwell games. The story is quite good and so I ran through them pretty quickly. Epiphany finally went on sale, so I snapped it up and I wasn't disappointed.This title ends the Blackwell series well, with a bitter-sweet twist. I was curious how this or that loose-end would be tied up, and I'm pleased to say that I wasn't left wondering.If you're debating whether to purchase this series, it has a fantastic story and is completely worth your dollars.

												Just amazing. It's so rare that you play a game series that doesn't take a dip in terms of story. This last instalment is so powerful, and the ending had me in tears. The ghosts that needed saving were all easy to empathise with and Rosangela and Joey were hilarious and touching by turns, as usual.There were a couple of plotlines I thought were left dangling a bit, but for the most part it was an incredibly satisfying game to play. If you like point and click games, dont pass up the Blackwell series. Another great game by Wadjet Eye Games.			"

												Not sure what the point of a review is - you'd only be interested in the game if you have been playing the series from the beginning, and if you enjoyed the first 4 then your mind is probably made up already.  Fortunately, it's an excellent ending to the series -- good thing if you have been following the series since Legacy was released in 2006 (or maybe since Bestowers was released in 2003?).  The only down side is that now I'm wishing there were more than 5 games.  Recommended for fans of point and click adventures, Wadjet Eye fans, anyone who played the first four games.  Not recommended if you haven't played through the series yet (duh).			"

												I'm a fan of the previous blackwell games, though they have some weird quirks that bug me. I really can't get behind Epiphany though. Part of my problem is I just find Joey as completely unlikeable as before and I don't care for the story behind his character. He's just a smarmy jerk. Rosa seems to less fleshed out in this version too. I can't quite put my finger on how but it just doesn't really feel very much like the character I was really liking in the other games. Without getting into spoilers, the plot is a mess. The creator claims he had the ending planned all along but it certainly doesn't feel that way. Plot holes pop up all over the place and certain characters just all but vanish in the second part of the game. Everything feels very contrived and coincidental. There's also a point where all of the work you've been doing in the beginning of the game is completely wiped out. As for gameplay. It drops a lot of the note taking and deduction stuff from the previous games for more nonsensical puzzles. Joey's blowing power either doesn't work on things you'd expect it to work on or does work on things that it shouldn't (Like blowing a surgical scalpel down a long hallway.) The voice acting and art direction are still top notch as would be expected from a Wadjet Eye game, but in the end it just didn't really interest me the way the previous games did.			"

												Just my views, don't hate me.The puzzles don't flow well in this game, it's a lot of backwards and forwards to find the answer. I found myself having to use a guide here and there, it broke from the immersion of the actual game. The graphics in this title are nice, I liked that “old school” feel, great soundtracks, but the two main characters didn't capture my interest at all. I love Point-Click adventures, but this didn't really do all that much for me. "

												The Blackwell series has finally had its Mass Effect 3 moment. Or I could also evoke Goodbye Deponia.The conclusion of Blackwell Epiphany is anticlimatic, lacks catharsis, and is somewhat depressing and discouraging. I'm not petitioning for a happier ending, but even for a deliberate ""bad end"", it's badly executed, and falls short of whatever you might be expecting or hoping after Blackwell Deception.Blackwell Deception spoilers ahead, and some hints at the ending of Epiphany...As you remember from Deception, Gavin was totally freaked out when we took him to the spirit world, saying that he's not supposed to be there, hinting at some kind of contract that forbids this... And true enough, he was torn apart there and then.Now, given the slight hints at things going on behind the scenes, I was expecting a spiritual conspiracy drama, some kind of detective mystery, with superhuman, and potentially divine powers moving the pieces from behind the scenes. I mean come on, if you like conspiracy stories, what better than a conspiracy God himself may be in on. I was really curious about the ""They"" mentioned by both Gavin, and the first victim we meet in Epiphany...Well, drop any expectation, because they are going to be betrayed. There IS no ""they"". The solution of the mystery is so incredibly inane and bad, that I could only liken it to a ""the butler did it"" moment. And in this mystery, it is not through investigation and clever handling of clues that the butler is uncovered by Sherlock Holmes or Poirot. Naaah. The butler just confesses without warning.And yeah, the conclusion that follows is pretty cliched and not thought through AT ALL. Not to mention being quite similar to bloody Mass Effect 3. Aaargh.The execution is awesome though. It's a huge shame. It could have been so cool			"

												How many Blackwells do you need to screw in the light bulb? One. She can just hold the bulb while The Whole Universe spin around her.No, seriously. Do you know the difference between fantasy and fairy tale? All previous Blackwell games were urban fantasy, based on mythos about ghosts. Epiphany is fairy tale. The Epighany's ending is an ending of a fairy tale (not happily ever after though). Like wham... and Rosa is in the center of all things, making the whole world spirits free. And whole Deception ending and expectatilons just go into trash can. Or rather loonybin. Just one guy, like nothing special.And mind you, noone will return me my money for the game.

												Well, they certainly saved the best for last.  I just finished Epiphany and absolutely loved it.  The Blackwell series has been an exceptionally memorable experience.  I'm sitting here trying to think of another game's story that I would put above this but I'm coming up blank.  Of all of the adventure games that I have played this one, (well, the whole series) comes as highly reccomended as I can express.  Each game in the series weaves in all of the different plot threads and mysteries and the finale actually manages to answer all of the questions and bring a clean and definite closure to this incredibly well-crafted and heartfelt story.  A satisfying and definite ending is a rare thing, but they have managed it here.  Epiphany's story takes some very dark turns, even moreso than previous entries, but is underpinned by the uplifting relationship between Rosangela and Joey.  The development of the main characters, and their friendship with eachother is done very well and you really care about them individually and as a team by the end.  The soundtrack is great.  The voice acting is great.  Puzzles are great.  Pixel art is great.  If you are or ever were a fan of classic adventure style games, or a fan of a great story, play this series from start to finish.  It is among the best I have ever played.			"

But I do not dare to say anything more.Like in past entries, you control both Rosangela, the ""medium"", and her ghost partner. Both have their own skills. The puzzles are well planned, with no out of place logic puzzles. Most puzzles are of the conversation type, so you only have a few items in your inventory at a time. Other puzzles involve fact checking, and that is what the in-game smartphone is for. It really feels like a Private Eye story at the end of the day. Conversation with the ghost is witty, and is part of the hint system. However, I have not used the hint system often, as it was clear what I had to do. The only point I was really stuck was when I have to pick up a key card I did not know it was there in all the filth.Dialogues are good, and voice acting was up to that quality too. However, I would have prefered to have a voice with accent for the asian man you meet. Rosangela's actions are believable, as she is still a human.As this is the fifth entry on the series, you probably know you want or not this game. This quick review is not going to change your opinion.			"

												I have played through each and every one of the Blackwell games, loved each and every one too. Blackwell Epiphany is no exception, the story is brilliant, the artwork is amazing. It is a brilliant conclusion to a brilliant series. Sad the series has come to an end but happy that it ended with such a great final installment, which is rare to see in games these days.			"

												Well! For once there's a finale that doesn't do the mawkish, cringeworthy route. A short, worthwhile adventure game, although it really has the prerequisite of playing the four earlier games in the series first.			"

												Well, they certainly saved the best for last.  I just finished Epiphany and absolutely loved it.  The Blackwell series has been an exceptionally memorable experience.  I'm sitting here trying to think of another game's story that I would put above this but I'm coming up blank.  Of all of the adventure games that I have played this one, (well, the whole series) comes as highly reccomended as I can express.  Each game in the series weaves in all of the different plot threads and mysteries and the finale actually manages to answer all of the questions and bring a clean and definite closure to this incredibly well-crafted and heartfelt story.  A satisfying and definite ending is a rare thing, but they have managed it here.  Epiphany's story takes some very dark turns, even moreso than previous entries, but is underpinned by the uplifting relationship between Rosangela and Joey.  The development of the main characters, and their friendship with eachother is done very well and you really care about them individually and as a team by the end.  The soundtrack is great.  The voice acting is great.  Puzzles are great.  Pixel art is great.  If you are or ever were a fan of classic adventure style games, or a fan of a great story, play this series from start to finish.  It is among the best I have ever played.			"

												I just got done beating the game and I really loved it. The first thing I can say is that you'd be best playing the previous Blackwell games first because this is the end of the series, and there are quite a few call backs to previous games of the series. I feel the complete journey to this game is where you would get the most out of it, that full emotional investment in these characters and their stories all the way to the end. This really was a great way to wrap it up and I didn't notice any loose ends. The game has some really devious puzzles to solve, a great story with some very unexpected twists, and it's the longest game of the series. I clocked in 7 hours, but that does also factor in being stuck on puzzles. I'd guess you could beat this in at least 6 hours if you know what you're doing. Like the previous games, there is commentary from the creator of the game which is a nice incentive to replay the game and learn quite about the making of an indie game, voice acting, and even some triva about New York City.

												It's a shame Epiphany demands you know about the rest of the Blackwell series. Not because those games are bad, by any stretch. The whole series is an enjoyable plate of oldschool adventure gaming goodness and paranormal detective work. But Epiphany is the most mechanically cohesive and intuitive of the series. It's the one you'd want to shove into the hands of someone hesitant to play point-and-click adventures, and then they'd just be lost for want of several episodes of back story. It's not perfect. Recording quality is always iffy on Wadjet Eye games and it's disappointing that the logic mechanic that lets you combine note entries is pretty much an abandoned afterthought. But Epiphany finishes up a good yarn with some satisfying conclusions. It's a fitting end to a great series.			"

The ghosts that needed saving were all easy to empathise with and Rosangela and Joey were hilarious and touching by turns, as usual.There were a couple of plotlines I thought were left dangling a bit, but for the most part it was an incredibly satisfying game to play.

												Great game. A very well-polished ending for the Blackwell series, the story is really great. The art, style and music are similar to previous games; this would be very hard to understand without playing the previous games before.If I had to present a weak point, it would be some puzzles that are really hard to figure out. Mostly they are easy to figure out, but there are some very obtuse ones. However, to game (series) features a very nice story, an absolute must play if you are interested in the genre.			"

												Overall a pretty good end to the series.  I think its best to take the series overall as awhole, in which case I say it starts out rough on the first game and gets better as it goes on.This last entry is quite good, and the quality of the presentation feels better too.  As far as puzzles there was only one which confused me enough that even reading a solution in a guide left me a little confused, but otherwise it works pretty well.  In story, some of the direction that it was headed from the end of the previous game doesn't really have any impact here more than a cameo which was a little dissapointing, but the whole of this episode's story was strong in its on right.  In terms of length, this final entry is like a double-length series finale episode in game form, so while the price is higher you can expect more meaningful content too.If you can get over the hump of the first game to get through the series, I'd suggest playing all of them.

It's the best adventure series we've got since the Lucas Arts vs. Sierra days.If you don't like adventure games, you still owe it to yourself to play the Blackwell series.I definitely recommend the Blackwell Epiphany.

												I could write a full pros and cons review which lacked cons. I could praise voiceacting. I could describe the gameplay and the story and what to expect. But Steam is full of those. So I will just warn you:It hurts. It HURTS. This game offers one of the best friendships you'd see between two game characters and you can see how they move from meeting and accepting each other (ep1), barely tolerating the fact that they have to be around each other (ep3, which strikes you with the different voice tone Joey uses toward Rosa than Lauren), warming up to and finding qualities they love in each other (ep4), and finally, being fully invested in friendship (but would forever pretend they are only barely standing to each other) in this episode. And the ending happens and you are sad.The story is so well conducted and ties up perfectly in this episode. I am saying only this about the story because I appreciate it so much that I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from giving spoilers. Of course, writing has its faults then and there, no story is 100% even if you like it enough to feel like it. And to be honest, I did think the vortex and ""universe superpowers"" in this episode were a bit excessive but it pays the price of breaking your heart so that it seems more realistic than if it didn't have consequences. All  I can say about the storyline without giving spoilers is that it's good and worth your time.But beware if you get attached to the characters, and if you are really into story-rich games and can see what meaning lies underneath things said and done - you WILL get attached to the characters if you like the game, you will be hurt.Still, 10/10 would let it break my heart again.

												Short Version: A confident, modern update of the mid-90s adventure game. An excellent conclusion to a series that started good and kept getting better. Story impact is far greater having played the previous four games and I'd recommend starting from the first game instead of jumping in at the end for this game to have fullest impact. A few puzzles with obscure or finicky methods to solve them, uneven voice acting among the supporting cast prevent this from being the perfect adventure game but those are minor quibbles regarding a game that is a minor masterpiece of the genre. Definitely recommend the game.Long Version: Before adventure games got cool again, with Telltale's increasing mastery of the genre and updates of older classics like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, the Blackwell series was keeping the point-and-click adventure genre alive. There are five games in the Blackwell series, and you can track the increasing competence of Wadjet Eye Games in terms of art direction, vocal direction and storytelling across each game in the series. There is a practiced confidence that enters the series - not arrogance, but confidence borne of learning the lesson taught by each game and applying it to the next game in the series.By Blackwell Epiphany, the series has reached its apex. But for it to have maximum impact, playing the previous games are crucial. Sure, I think you can come into the series with this game and get a lot out of it. But when you've been playing as Rosangela and Joey for four previous games, everything in this game resonates so much more. The final outcome of these two people (well, one person and one ghost) has so much more weight. And boy, does it have weight. The stakes in each game of the series have increased, and Blackwell Epiphany takes the stakes the highest they ever have gone. I won't spoil it for you - normally, spoilers aren't such a big deal but with a story heavy game I'll be safe instead of sorry - but it manages to be big, Hollywood movie big stakes, without feeling empty and cheap. It's a real credit to the world they've created.The game's not perfect. It's an adventure game so there's a few ""guide dang it"" moments where it's not entirely clear what the next thing to do is. However, like most of the series, Blackwell Epiphany avoids the pixel-hunt trap and the solutions are not obtuse to the point of ridiculousness. The voice acting can be slightly uneven, which has been a bane of the series (and Wadjet Eye Games in general, I've found) but Rosangela and Joey's voice actors are excellent and really understand their characters well, and they're the two you'll be hearing the most. As mentioned, it's probably the best voice acting in the series thus far. The art direction is good - it's achieving the standards set by the Lucasarts games of the 90s they lovingly emulate with crisper textures you'd expect from a modern game. That said, the series does not achieve the level of graphical polish that we've been seeing with modern adventure games like Telltale's games or Life is Strange. It's a retro experience, the heir to Lucasarts gaming instead of the characterization-heavy modern offshoot. Whether that's good, bad or simply different is up to you.In the end, I absolutely recommend this game if you like adventure games. I do say that it is worth it to go back and play the series front to end instead of playing this game without having played the others. You *can* do it, but you'll lose something wonderful - the sense of wrapping up a fulfilling story with a couple of old friends you've seen change and grow. You just can't get that playing this game alone.Nota bene: You'll notice I don't own the previous games in my library but talk about the entire series.

												Blackwell Epiphany in the fifth game in the Blackwell game series, and is an amazingly well done conclusion to a game series that I have grown to love. Epiphany takes the puzzle-solving, action, storytelling, and atmosphere of all the previous games and forms a suspenseful, wonderfully made game. The game continues to build, and build, and build until you finally reach the end. And the ending, oh my gosh..... so intense and.... All I remember is picking my jaw up off the ground, and rushing toward the exit ramp of the emotional rollercoaster.                   For the Blackwell series, this is my favorite game. I would highly recomend playing the other games in the series, as to get the full experience of the series, before playing Epiphany ( if this game even interests you, you won't regret it). So I give this game my highest recomendation.   :)			"

However, I'd still recommend playing through them all within fresh memory (they're all a few hours apiece).This game tries to answer questions left from the rest of the series and wrap things up. If I had just recently played the previous episodes I'm sure there would be minor things I'd question, but I think it's a good enough ending to wrap up the series.			"

												Well, they certainly saved the best for last.  I just finished Epiphany and absolutely loved it.  The Blackwell series has been an exceptionally memorable experience.  I'm sitting here trying to think of another game's story that I would put above this but I'm coming up blank.  Of all of the adventure games that I have played this one, (well, the whole series) comes as highly reccomended as I can express.  Each game in the series weaves in all of the different plot threads and mysteries and the finale actually manages to answer all of the questions and bring a clean and definite closure to this incredibly well-crafted and heartfelt story.  A satisfying and definite ending is a rare thing, but they have managed it here.  Epiphany's story takes some very dark turns, even moreso than previous entries, but is underpinned by the uplifting relationship between Rosangela and Joey.  The development of the main characters, and their friendship with eachother is done very well and you really care about them individually and as a team by the end.  The soundtrack is great.  The voice acting is great.  Puzzles are great.  Pixel art is great.  If you are or ever were a fan of classic adventure style games, or a fan of a great story, play this series from start to finish.  It is among the best I have ever played.			"

												I just got done beating the game and I really loved it. The first thing I can say is that you'd be best playing the previous Blackwell games first because this is the end of the series, and there are quite a few call backs to previous games of the series. I feel the complete journey to this game is where you would get the most out of it, that full emotional investment in these characters and their stories all the way to the end. This really was a great way to wrap it up and I didn't notice any loose ends. The game has some really devious puzzles to solve, a great story with some very unexpected twists, and it's the longest game of the series. I clocked in 7 hours, but that does also factor in being stuck on puzzles. I'd guess you could beat this in at least 6 hours if you know what you're doing. Like the previous games, there is commentary from the creator of the game which is a nice incentive to replay the game and learn quite about the making of an indie game, voice acting, and even some triva about New York City.

												A fitting ending and the best in the series. It has all the wonderful atmosphere, music, voice acting and art of the other games and ties everything nicely together.The final puzzle was maybe a bit abstract, I don't see myself having figured it out without the old try everything with everything, but otherwise it had the usual good balance of difficulty. The more investigative puzzles were as always my favourite; you get clues and then match your notes and question people. It would of course have been nice to see simply more of that kind of stuff, but such a small developer can produce only so much content. And in the end I feel it's better to be left feeling you want more than that you had too much. It does make me long for a new kind of Police Quest-ish game though =DI'm sad to see this series come to an end, but I really can't wait to see what Mr Gilbert will do next.			"

												The culmination of one of my favorite game series ever, Blackwell Epiphany is the beautiful, satisfying yet heart-breaking conclusion to the story of Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone. Gameplay proceeds along similar terms to previous installments, with puzzles requiring the use of Rosa's phone and the odd leap of logic to solve. Not going to lie, there was a point or two where the next step was simply not quite the natural conclusion in my mind, and I had to look for help (I'm not proud of admitting this, but it's the truth). For the most part, though, the puzzles were enjoyable, the story is poignant and emotional, and the voice acting is, as always, stellar. If you're a fan of the series, the final chapter will not disappoint!			"

												If Deception was serious and dark, Epiphany is heartwrenching and tearjerking. Not to mention darkER. As the last in the Blackwell series, the game pulls no punches. Right after the intro adventure, we begin getting shock after shock after shock as I was hit with one revelation after another. And there was multiple times during the game that I was holding back tears. I can't even think the name ""Cutethulu"" now without getting emotional. The game is also stuffed to the brim with references from the past games. In-jokes, characters, and one very cool reference if you can find the ""secret room""Gameplay wise, it's pretty similar to Deception, with a few updates. Rosa is much more ""active"" with her phone, using it to also recieve photos and files relating the cases she's working on. The puzzles are still clever enough to keep me engaged, while not frustrating me. And the side characters are awesome. Everyone has a well written and intriguing story. There was one problem I had in the story. I won't reveal it due to spoilers, but I will say that It didn't hurt my experience with the game.Honestly, if you haven't played any of the Blackwell Games, play them all. They are all great games and Epiphany is the final and the conclusion to the whole series. A series I can't wait to replay  and will wholeheartingly miss.Thanks for the trip Wadjet Eye Games. It's been a wild ride.Edit: just did a small edit to one of the sentences. Messed up an old saying, heh.			"

												Let me start this off by saying videogames don't make me cry. Ever. I'm not generally an emotional personI don't often review games, but this series seems like it flies under the radar of many people, as it did mine. I found the bundle during one of the Steam sales being a lover of the old point and click videogames (Kyrandia, King's Quest, Monkey Island) and this game certainly doesn't dissappoint. The graphics are pixellated, in a style which is very reminiscent of the first and second Kyrandia games. I quite like it, and if you're a fan of that sort of thing, I'm sure you will too. If you DISlike pixellated graphics, don't let that dissuade you from buying this game.However, don't you DARE buy this game standalone. The bundle is not that expensive, so buy every game. It deserves that. After playing all the games coming before Epiphany, I grew to love the main two characters, and actually cared about them. That's rare for me because I generally dislike female leads. I can't talk much about the story because I don't want to spoil any of this amazing game or series, but once you get attached to the characters as I do, this game will break you. I feel as though my soul has been ripped out and dragged through the snowy streets of New York.First game to bring tears to my eyes, and I'm genuinely impressed by that. I reccommend it to anyone who likes retro point-and-clicks, mystery/detective games, or who has some money to spend and some time on their hands.Buy this game, buy the others in the series. It is THAT good. You will not regret it			"

												A very fitting end to an incredibly strong modern Adventure series. I honestly think that the thing I liked most about the series was that some of the voice acting felt a bit stiff and 'un-professional'. I say that not as an insult, but as a compliment. Especially considering that Rosa went against the mold for a large number of reasons, I feel like it gave her a more natural feel. It carried a lot of the social-awkwardness, and really drove home that these were not heroes in a story; these were just people (and.... well, a few un-people) doing the best that they can in a world that despite their efforts continued to grow increasingly stranger and more dangerous. Most of the puzzles are simple, though considering the series is primarily story driven, that isn't a bad thing as it helps to keep the plot advancing. Admittedly, as all adventure games go there will be one or two puzzles in any of the games that can leave you scratching your head for a while. Definitely going on my list of Adventure classics, and definitely a series worth picking up.			"

												Ah. Blackwell.On one hand, this is a fantastic series and ends without wearing out its welcome, but at the same time, this is like two games crammed into one [which is sort of awesome but tedious if going for the ""leave under 300 footsteps"" achievement]. It has a very Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows feel in that it's really designed for the fans who've played through the first four--while I wouldn't recommend it, it IS possible to play Unbound, Convergence, and Deception without first playing Legacy. Epiphany really needs to be played last to be satisfying.Spelling this out: DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE OTHER BLACKWELL GAMES FIRST.Overall, I basically love everything about Epiphany... except... I've listened to the commentary, and I understand the reason for the ending, but... I really wanted it to end differently. It's such a Deus Ex Machina, besides being the least probable outcome [even being a series about ghosts and mediums], and... I dunno. I do get and like the imagery and respect how that's the only way it could happen--it's just kind of... aww.The commentary is particularly insightful at the third act twist [where the Epiphany is explained], and I highly recommend listening to it if you have the chance. Wonderful writing, though maybe I would've changed the one thing, definitely a good sign-off to the series.			"

												It's a shame Epiphany demands you know about the rest of the Blackwell series. Not because those games are bad, by any stretch. The whole series is an enjoyable plate of oldschool adventure gaming goodness and paranormal detective work. But Epiphany is the most mechanically cohesive and intuitive of the series. It's the one you'd want to shove into the hands of someone hesitant to play point-and-click adventures, and then they'd just be lost for want of several episodes of back story. It's not perfect. Recording quality is always iffy on Wadjet Eye games and it's disappointing that the logic mechanic that lets you combine note entries is pretty much an abandoned afterthought. But Epiphany finishes up a good yarn with some satisfying conclusions. It's a fitting end to a great series.			"

It's the best adventure series we've got since the Lucas Arts vs. Sierra days.If you don't like adventure games, you still owe it to yourself to play the Blackwell series.I definitely recommend the Blackwell Epiphany.

The background music especially gave me the chills; or rather, the lack of it. The more quieter parts the game were unnerving and effectively set the tone for the entire game. I can't recommend the entire Blackwell series enough for any fan of point-and-clicky adventure games. Great job here.			"

												Short Version: A confident, modern update of the mid-90s adventure game. An excellent conclusion to a series that started good and kept getting better. Story impact is far greater having played the previous four games and I'd recommend starting from the first game instead of jumping in at the end for this game to have fullest impact. A few puzzles with obscure or finicky methods to solve them, uneven voice acting among the supporting cast prevent this from being the perfect adventure game but those are minor quibbles regarding a game that is a minor masterpiece of the genre. Definitely recommend the game.Long Version: Before adventure games got cool again, with Telltale's increasing mastery of the genre and updates of older classics like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, the Blackwell series was keeping the point-and-click adventure genre alive. There are five games in the Blackwell series, and you can track the increasing competence of Wadjet Eye Games in terms of art direction, vocal direction and storytelling across each game in the series. There is a practiced confidence that enters the series - not arrogance, but confidence borne of learning the lesson taught by each game and applying it to the next game in the series.By Blackwell Epiphany, the series has reached its apex. But for it to have maximum impact, playing the previous games are crucial. Sure, I think you can come into the series with this game and get a lot out of it. But when you've been playing as Rosangela and Joey for four previous games, everything in this game resonates so much more. The final outcome of these two people (well, one person and one ghost) has so much more weight. And boy, does it have weight. The stakes in each game of the series have increased, and Blackwell Epiphany takes the stakes the highest they ever have gone. I won't spoil it for you - normally, spoilers aren't such a big deal but with a story heavy game I'll be safe instead of sorry - but it manages to be big, Hollywood movie big stakes, without feeling empty and cheap. It's a real credit to the world they've created.The game's not perfect. It's an adventure game so there's a few ""guide dang it"" moments where it's not entirely clear what the next thing to do is. However, like most of the series, Blackwell Epiphany avoids the pixel-hunt trap and the solutions are not obtuse to the point of ridiculousness. The voice acting can be slightly uneven, which has been a bane of the series (and Wadjet Eye Games in general, I've found) but Rosangela and Joey's voice actors are excellent and really understand their characters well, and they're the two you'll be hearing the most. As mentioned, it's probably the best voice acting in the series thus far. The art direction is good - it's achieving the standards set by the Lucasarts games of the 90s they lovingly emulate with crisper textures you'd expect from a modern game. That said, the series does not achieve the level of graphical polish that we've been seeing with modern adventure games like Telltale's games or Life is Strange. It's a retro experience, the heir to Lucasarts gaming instead of the characterization-heavy modern offshoot. Whether that's good, bad or simply different is up to you.In the end, I absolutely recommend this game if you like adventure games. I do say that it is worth it to go back and play the series front to end instead of playing this game without having played the others. You *can* do it, but you'll lose something wonderful - the sense of wrapping up a fulfilling story with a couple of old friends you've seen change and grow. You just can't get that playing this game alone.Nota bene: You'll notice I don't own the previous games in my library but talk about the entire series. The previous four games I purchased through GOG.com. This brings up a good point, too - there's nothing that transfers over from game to game. No ""big choice"" moments that carry over from previous games. Which makes it easy to jump into the series later and not ""miss"" anything, unlike say the Mass Effect series, but my recommendation to play the others first still stands.			"

												If you grew up in the 80's or early 90's playing videogames, then you will appreciate the overwhelming nostalgia this game tosses at you right from the start.  I may be writing a review for this game, however, it revolves around the entire series as a whole and should be played as such.  From the start, you realize this is just like any point and click adventure from old.  The minimalist approach to the interface is overshadowed by the thought and heart poured into a truely enticing story and wonderful characters.  I do recommend you start with the first entry, and enjoy the ride for the entirety.Does that sound too good?  Well, realize, this is actually a review, not just gushing compliments of a few aspects of the game.Once you take the plunge in the first game (the first in the series, not the precursor game which I did not know about till I completed the 5 Blackwell games), you will get a sense that the creators want you to learn, and the tutorial aspect is not necessary.  It takes a bit, but once you get into the swing of things, you will start combining notes, using the few items you collect in the game properly, and later in the series, you will get the hang of swapping between your main character and their  ghostly companion.The weaknesses of each series seems to be repeated.  I personally felt that some of the 'puzzles' were simply 'do in the right order no matter what information the player has seen', 'luckily you clicked the right notes in the right order' or even 'glad you visited this person now after you did one thing' to progress.  Later entries in the series seemed to try for less linearity, however, it really boils down to perfect order.  Maniac Mansion, this is not.The story, characters and a large portion of the quests, however, make up for the handful of blunders.  I won't spoil the series ending, but be prepared, it is a doozy.`Rogerztheurbanlegend			"

Strong, impressive, and it treats the characters we've learned to love with respect.The Blackwell Series is one of my favorite game series of all time - if you've played the other games, do not miss out on this one but if you've never played any of them, you should.

												This one is definitely my favourite in the series. They finally nailed down what I imagine it would be like to be a ghost assisted detective. It's a little more mechanical when the same modus operandi of repeatedly having Joey go through closed doors and find you clues on how to eventually get through it with the help of your trusty mobile phone but its part of the charm. The design at this point is really slick and you're less likely to get stuck while still feeling creative about how you approach the problems layed out in front of you.Sure, the conclusion of the story becomes a little convoluted towards the end but I was kind of expercting it. It's what happens when you construct a universe from scratch and whatever is traded in logic is regained in excitement. Strongly recommend)			"

												When I first started this series I was almost put off by the first scene, and although the first game strictly linear the story got me hooked. Holy hell am I glad I played on during that first sitting, because this finale was well worth every moment that came before it.Love the story that's told through these games, the character development is solid and overall production quality improves all the way through.

												Really superb adventure game. I played the other 4 games in the series in it's bundle last year and hadn't realised there was a 5th. This is the best of an already great series - solid characters, unique premise and engaging story with solid puzzles and detective work. It's also a satisfying length and is longer than the other games in the series.I'm really impressed at this Indie studio that makes games that are as good or better than some of the classics, and the retro pixel-art style is beautiful. If you like adventure games you will like this one.			"

												In my opinion, Blackwell Epiphany is unquestionably the high point of the entire Blackwell series. Great pacing, strong characters, and charm absolutely everywhere. Seeing the series' growth from game to game is quite an experience.I will say that some elements of the ending felt a bit rushed, and there was a plot thread from the previous game that never really got resolved. But considering that this is the conclusion of a five-part series, it's impressive that nearly everything went so right.If for whatever reason you haven't played this series yet, give it a go. Buy the whole thing, maybe in a Steam sale, then just play them. Go in as fresh as possible. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.			"

												An excellent end to the series.  I picked up the first four games as a bundle when it was on sale this summer.  I had never heard of the series, but liked the throwback, adventure game style of Gabriel Knight and Monkey Island.  It's a lucky thing that I came across them once all the games had been released as waiting years for the next installment would have driven me mad.  Overall, Blackwell's engaging story, dynamic characters, and rich story make for a worthwhile experience.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a try.			"

												What can I say? This is defintely the best one of Blackwell series. It conclues all with a very touching and sad ending. Now I hate to finish it before my bed time because I will have a sleepless night. I feel so overwhelmed and sensational. This is something I never experienced with classic Sierra titles before.And I felt kind of ashamed of buying this when it was 70% off. It is worth the full price after I can truely feel and see how much effort Dave Gilbert has put into it. Joey and Rosa, a.k.a Abe and Rebecca, I sure will miss you. "

												Short Version: A confident, modern update of the mid-90s adventure game. An excellent conclusion to a series that started good and kept getting better. Story impact is far greater having played the previous four games and I'd recommend starting from the first game instead of jumping in at the end for this game to have fullest impact. A few puzzles with obscure or finicky methods to solve them, uneven voice acting among the supporting cast prevent this from being the perfect adventure game but those are minor quibbles regarding a game that is a minor masterpiece of the genre. Definitely recommend the game.Long Version: Before adventure games got cool again, with Telltale's increasing mastery of the genre and updates of older classics like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, the Blackwell series was keeping the point-and-click adventure genre alive. There are five games in the Blackwell series, and you can track the increasing competence of Wadjet Eye Games in terms of art direction, vocal direction and storytelling across each game in the series. There is a practiced confidence that enters the series - not arrogance, but confidence borne of learning the lesson taught by each game and applying it to the next game in the series.By Blackwell Epiphany, the series has reached its apex. But for it to have maximum impact, playing the previous games are crucial. Sure, I think you can come into the series with this game and get a lot out of it. But when you've been playing as Rosangela and Joey for four previous games, everything in this game resonates so much more. The final outcome of these two people (well, one person and one ghost) has so much more weight. And boy, does it have weight. The stakes in each game of the series have increased, and Blackwell Epiphany takes the stakes the highest they ever have gone. I won't spoil it for you - normally, spoilers aren't such a big deal but with a story heavy game I'll be safe instead of sorry - but it manages to be big, Hollywood movie big stakes, without feeling empty and cheap. It's a real credit to the world they've created.The game's not perfect. It's an adventure game so there's a few ""guide dang it"" moments where it's not entirely clear what the next thing to do is. However, like most of the series, Blackwell Epiphany avoids the pixel-hunt trap and the solutions are not obtuse to the point of ridiculousness. The voice acting can be slightly uneven, which has been a bane of the series (and Wadjet Eye Games in general, I've found) but Rosangela and Joey's voice actors are excellent and really understand their characters well, and they're the two you'll be hearing the most. As mentioned, it's probably the best voice acting in the series thus far. The art direction is good - it's achieving the standards set by the Lucasarts games of the 90s they lovingly emulate with crisper textures you'd expect from a modern game. That said, the series does not achieve the level of graphical polish that we've been seeing with modern adventure games like Telltale's games or Life is Strange. It's a retro experience, the heir to Lucasarts gaming instead of the characterization-heavy modern offshoot. Whether that's good, bad or simply different is up to you.In the end, I absolutely recommend this game if you like adventure games. I do say that it is worth it to go back and play the series front to end instead of playing this game without having played the others. You *can* do it, but you'll lose something wonderful - the sense of wrapping up a fulfilling story with a couple of old friends you've seen change and grow. You just can't get that playing this game alone.Nota bene: You'll notice I don't own the previous games in my library but talk about the entire series. The previous four games I purchased through GOG.com. This brings up a good point, too - there's nothing that transfers over from game to game. No ""big choice"" moments that carry over from previous games. Which makes it easy to jump into the series later and not ""miss"" anything, unlike say the Mass Effect series, but my recommendation to play the others first still stands.			"

												The wonderful finale to one of my favorite series of games ever. The graphics are gorgeous, and the voice-acting and atmosphere are spot-on. You can really tell how far the series has grown and developed since the Blackwell Legacy, as Epiphany presents darker themes, more complex (yet still logical) puzzles, and more advanced graphics. All elements have become perfected in this installment. Of course, since Epiphany is the final installment in a 5-game series, it is best enjoyed only after playing the previous games since by then you'll have a greater understanding of the characters and backstory - and those games are definitely worth playing and come at good prices. All of the previous plot threads are tied together, and a lot of information is revealed in this game that wouldn't make sense without playing the previous games first. The story comes to a peak in this game in terms of emotion, and manages to tackle more serious themes skillfully. The characters are well-rounded and interesting as always, and the banter between Rosa and Joey is still present and brings great humor to lighten the mood. The final scenes of this game were very-well done and gave the series a proper grand finale that it deserved, but it can be a lot to handle at first after playing the previous games and becoming so attached to the characters. This is truly one of the few games that broke my heart. The entire series has made me greatly admire the skill and effort of Dave Gilbert and his team. I give this game a 10/10, and I strongly recommend the entire series to anyone who enjoys adventure games.			"

												The Blackwell series are really great adventure games, and the finale is no exception. You play as Roseangela Blackwell who, with the help of her spirit guide, helps lost souls to realize they are dead and move on.Besides having great adventure puzzles, the Blackwell series tell an excellent story that really progresses from game to game. It doesn’t feel like a series of episodes connected only by the characters, but like a true progression, with each game building up to this conclusion. Rosa’s character really develops through the series as her experience grows and she learns more about her abilities. I thought Epiphany was a very fitting, though sad, end to the series.			"

												I grew up playing two things: Nintendo Entertainment System and point and click adventure games on the PC. I still love point and click games to this day but some of the older ones don't hold up well because of poor design decisions. Of all of the newer point and click adventures I've played, I think I like the Blackwell series the best. They aren't difficult but they are charming and fun to play. Each game in the series is better than the last and this final game was really amazing. I highly recommend this game and this series to any fans of the genre.			"

												I haven't finished it yet, but I can already say this is a great conclusion to a great series. My partner and I have really enjoyed playing through this series together, and as we finish the final game I have really been struck by how well put-together Blackwell has been.  The story becomes strangely compelling, the characters feel right, the music is immersive, and the gameplay is top-notch for this genre.I have been legitimately haunted by certain parts of the story, and have had deeper feelings about the characters in this series than almost any game I've played.  I feel like the story walks a fine narrative line between cheesy and heavy handed that is quite difficult to achieve.As far as gameplay goes, Blackwell avoids many of the pitfalls of the point-and-click adventure.  There is little to no backtracking, and you don't have to watch your character walk through the same stale environments over and over again while you try to figure out what you missed.  When you are stuck, it is often a matter of figuring out how to connect information, rather than some obscure hidden object puzzle.  Everything in Blackwell has some connection, and you have to use real-life experience and some detective skills to solve problems in your environment.  I feel like this game has been a great example of what a detective/mystery game can be.Blackwell is a shining example of less-is-more.  It knows what it is and it executes it well.If you like ghost stories and adventure games, please give this series a try.			"

												Blackwell Epiphany in the fifth game in the Blackwell game series, and is an amazingly well done conclusion to a game series that I have grown to love. Epiphany takes the puzzle-solving, action, storytelling, and atmosphere of all the previous games and forms a suspenseful, wonderfully made game. The game continues to build, and build, and build until you finally reach the end. And the ending, oh my gosh..... so intense and.... All I remember is picking my jaw up off the ground, and rushing toward the exit ramp of the emotional rollercoaster.                   For the Blackwell series, this is my favorite game. I would highly recomend playing the other games in the series, as to get the full experience of the series, before playing Epiphany ( if this game even interests you, you won't regret it). So I give this game my highest recomendation.   :)			"

												The last and best installment of the Blackwell series. The games have been made with a freeware tool called AGS (Adventure Game Studio - other games made with the same engine include Yahtzee Croshaw's Chzo series). The games start off quite amateurish, but the quality improves with each installment, and Epiphany could nearly be held worthy of the adventure gaming classics. The mystery elements, noir atmosphere, magic realism and character-basedness of story remind me of the first Gabriel Knight in a good way. Characters are entertaining and well-written, although the quality of the voice acting does fluctuate, and towards the series' end quite touching, poignant drama involving the ghosts are often involved. Puzzles are logical enough that a walkthrough was never needed despite them not always being easy, although the same kind of puzzles are encountered a tad too often overall. All in all, a great indie point-and-click series.Playing order is by the way: Legacy, Unbound, Convergence, Deception, and finally Epiphany.			"

												Blackwell is the most memorable series of point and click adventures I've played in a while.The film noir style and mellow humour fits it's mature storyline of psychic and spirit guide investigative mystery solving.This is story-driven adventure not a large pockets inventory fest, and unlike say Daedelic's Deponia, here the puzzles are the story, rather than obstacles to it.  So while some might say the game is easier, equally the progression and story flows enjoyably rather than stumbling over so many puzzles you forget the plot.The plot thickens with each instalment so I'd definitely recommend playing the earlier games to enjoy the story and character progression.  I'd guess each game in the series takes around 3-5 hours to complete. Though Epiphany definitely seemed the longest game yet, gameplay is around 5 hours, and felt about right.			"

All I remember is picking my jaw up off the ground, and rushing toward the exit ramp of the emotional rollercoaster.                   For the Blackwell series, this is my favorite game. I would highly recomend playing the other games in the series, as to get the full experience of the series, before playing Epiphany ( if this game even interests you, you won't regret it). So I give this game my highest recomendation.   :)			"

												What a great ending to an extraordinary series.These games are a synthesis of good old point'n'click tradition and modern themes.I loved plaing it. It was logical, exciting, engaging.I just straight hate the ending. It is a good ending, it makes a lot of sense even if uses something we never heard about before. It made me feel a lot of things. It's a good ending.I just hate to let Blackwells go.			"

												I haven't finished it yet, but I can already say this is a great conclusion to a great series. My partner and I have really enjoyed playing through this series together, and as we finish the final game I have really been struck by how well put-together Blackwell has been.  The story becomes strangely compelling, the characters feel right, the music is immersive, and the gameplay is top-notch for this genre.I have been legitimately haunted by certain parts of the story, and have had deeper feelings about the characters in this series than almost any game I've played.  I feel like the story walks a fine narrative line between cheesy and heavy handed that is quite difficult to achieve.As far as gameplay goes, Blackwell avoids many of the pitfalls of the point-and-click adventure.  There is little to no backtracking, and you don't have to watch your character walk through the same stale environments over and over again while you try to figure out what you missed.  When you are stuck, it is often a matter of figuring out how to connect information, rather than some obscure hidden object puzzle.  Everything in Blackwell has some connection, and you have to use real-life experience and some detective skills to solve problems in your environment.  I feel like this game has been a great example of what a detective/mystery game can be.Blackwell is a shining example of less-is-more.  It knows what it is and it executes it well.If you like ghost stories and adventure games, please give this series a try.			"

												This is one of the best adventure games I ever played. Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.You play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.Rosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.Joey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.A very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.The Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:1. The Blackwell Legacy2. Blackwell Unbound3. Blackwell Convergence4. Blackwell Deception5. Blackwell EpiphanyBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.			"

												Blackwell Epiphany is a point-n-click adventure and a grand finale of Blackwell series. Those who expect a story arc which Deception somewhat started at the end will not find it there, instead it bring another, more Blackwell-ish, main story. It's one of the best adventure games recently too.This game still uses same engine as other ones used, though support widescreen too, it was released only one year ago after all. Shift+Tab will still do a weird thing to the game, while pressing Tab key again would fix it. It also had more glitched and small bug than usual, like Durkin the detective still talking in location which he leaved if you phone or even game crashing when calling partner in some case, happened one time. Do save.Blackwell Epiphany is a big finale of a series and ends it on a high note. It's the most polished and ambitious game in the series, in pretty much every aspect. It didn't introduce any big new features in the gameplay, but continues what Deception figured for the best. Well, aside from having ability for Rose and Joey, the spirit guide, to explore multi-screen areas serapately, with new button to call your partner to the scene. Helps.As modern adventure game, you can't die or get into dead end. Blackwell is fairly standart adventure game, somewhat. It uses inventory system much less, instead focusing on talking, getting notes, combining clues and searching Internet in your smartphone, with typing. As well as ability to switch character to Joey, though he still doesn't play as much part as Rose. Still does. Still teamwork.The setting, whole setting of a game is telling you that the game it's the finale. Where the tale ends. Having a never ending night with snow falling, urban background with green pallette to it, it creates unique and dark, deep atmosphere. Not to mentioning that the pixel-art is the best here, very professional and has a great work put into lighting. No complaints about sprites, animation or background aside from nitpicking, it's just plain amazing!Music delivers professional quality as well. It's dark and ambient, yet has moments of sadness and jazzyness, with electronica at intense moments. Even has some memoriable pieces.And plot is probably the biggest, best thing about this part. But immeditly I should warn you that it doesn't really follow what Deception set up to. Instead, Rose and Joey the spirit guide got even bigger problems to handle, as after solving the nice dark intro case they just had the most unlikely and logic shattering thing to happen right in front of their eyes, setting out to solve their final mystery. And well, plot is very emotional, especially to those who already got attached to pair of out heroes, it's just plain awesome and exciting. I wanted to clap at the final parts, especially at part where Joey and Rose had to act serapately, psychological thing. And an ending will not be just ""it's OK"" either, it will punch you into stomach. Whetever you like it or not, you still will not ignore it.And yes, the game mostly has a feel of mystery and ugency to it, slowing down in the middle only to deliver the traditional ""solve two ghost cases in same time"" thing, which is still welcome.And yes, the game still inclused commentary mode extra. In each area, you get to choose by yourself if you want to hear Voice Bloober, Artist Commentary or Game Designer Commentary. And yes, I feel it's more worth it this time, I got to enjoy hearing more about game design than just voice acting. It's great.Really, looking back, Blackwell is a great series and I got attached to it already. And it's one awesome finale. Will miss it. And maybe those loose plots will be delivered in another game, not related to Blackwell family itself...So yes, highly recommended adventure game, but promise to beat the previous parts first. Worth it.			"

												And I finally finished Blackwell Epiphany, the final entry in the Blackwell series. It's been an emotional rollercoaster and a fitting end to the series, though I admit I didn't like some story decisions:SPOILERShow Rosa went all Neo, the chosen oneEND SPOILERSBut I suppose I can understand how for the final game in the series Dave Gilbert decided to go out with a bang, instead of a whimper.At 11 hours, it is the longest Blackwell game in the series and every single hour is filled with great puzzles and even better writing.If you like adventure games, you owe it to yourself to play the Blackwell series. It's the best adventure series we've got since the Lucas Arts vs. Sierra days.If you don't like adventure games, you still owe it to yourself to play the Blackwell series.I definitely recommend the Blackwell Epiphany. Just make sure to play the previous games in the series first.			"

												I have played through the entire series within two weeks. Blackwell Epiphany is hands down one of the most well-made, fun, intriguing, and moving adventure games I've played. The background music especially gave me the chills; or rather, the lack of it. The more quieter parts the game were unnerving and effectively set the tone for the entire game. I can't recommend the entire Blackwell series enough for any fan of point-and-clicky adventure games. Great job here.			"

												This is the last and most poignant of the Blackwell game series. It nicely wraps up the questions that were left hanging, such as Joey's past, and what lies in the great beyond (well, sort of).  There are some 'feels', so have some tissues handy.The one issue I had, as with the other games, is my computer being finicky with the Adventure Game Studio engine. It took tweaking to get the GUI and controls to playable condition (there was some lag) but I suspect that is totally on my end, and I wanted to bring this up for anyone who might encounter some control lag. Do not give up - this game is worth trying different AGS settings to get it running.Warning: I did buy this game as a pre-order and played it right after, a long while ago, so I apologize for not having more specific detail. It was worth the pre-order though to finish the story up.			"

												9/10: A solid, bittersweet conclusion to a thoughtful point-and-click series about allowing ghosts to come to terms with their deaths. David Gilbert's series following the Blackwell family and their resident sassy spirit, Joey, reaches its conclusion in this fifth installment. Rosa Blackwell, having grown more accustomed to her abilities since the occurrences in Deception, is working discreetly with the police to help solve cases and make ends meet. Her former notepad and computer have now condensed down to a single smartphone, but Rosa and Joey need to figure out how to protect these spirits from annihlation before they run out of time. As the final and most refined title in the Blackwell series, the puzzles and storytelling have all been streamlined based on the lessons learned in past. Joey is still integral thanks to his abilities to blow things and phase through doors, while Rosa still handles all the corporeal tasks and ultimately leads lost souls to the hereafter. While the story is, as ever, a melancholic one of lives ended before their time, David Gilbert does an excellent job of rounding up the strands of the story he's created over the years into a satisfying, if sad, ending. I also appreciate the developer commentary he added into the game, which grants some insight into the ideas and processes that went into creating the Blackwell Epiphany. Especially the bloopers.			"

												I really enjoyed this series, though of the 5, this may have been my least favorite. Pros:We got some closure as to Lauren and Patricia, with an explanation of what happened to both of them. They attempted to fill in some of Joey's past, including how/why he became a spirit guideIt was a bit different from the usual ""find the ghost and save them"", as the investigation was more than each individual, but rather the connections between them. Rosa and Joey's banter is also always a plus, I have really enjoyed their dynamic through the series, and in particular I really liked those moments when Joey was worried that Rosa would suffer the same fate as Lauren and we get to see how much he genuinely cares about herThe characters, settings, voice, and music are as enjoyable as always. Cons: Some of the puzzles were pretty circuitous. You'd know exactly what you needed to do, but couldn't do it in a way that seemed the most logical. For example, you'd know you needed Connor Fielding's service number, but you couldn't turn up a web search, and you couldn't ask either Maggie or Peter about it at all (asking Peter could have produced a response like 'it's on my dad's photo' even, but it seemed odd that you couldn't even ask). The only way to get the number was to get into the gym to pick up the photo.While you think that you're investigating ties that are set up/established by Deception, you find that it's only tangentally connected, and that whole storyline set up by Gavin is just completely abandoned.The flashbacks (and therefore the past we get about Joey) felt a bit rushed and sloppily done. The story would have flowed better without them, because I don't feel that they achieved quite the impact they were supposed to. It told us nothing new about Madeline and the Countess, and only very little more about Joey.The end. While I didn't expect the 'everyone lived happily ever after' ending Rosa's sudden ability to save all the souls *except Joey* was a bit over the top, although I could have theoretically bought it with the whole sudden ""power of the universe"" thing. But Joey being brought back to life felt too fantastical even for a series that sets up mythos of ghosts and people sucking life energy to stay alive.I recommend this game if you've been really into the Blackwell series and want to see it brought to conclusion, but bear in mind that the last few steps in the game seem to fall out of step with the rest of the series.

												A good way to end the Blackwell trilogy and I thouroughly enjoyed it. If you really go through every detail in the game it's gonna last just a little over 10 hours - witch is a fair deal in my book for a game at this price range. The writting has only gotten better, the characters are still all memorable and (even tho I had long breaks between games) the story flows just perfectly. It has its good moments and also some great... who knows, if you followed all three games and you are a little sensitive it might get you to water up just a little bit.			"

												I think the best adventure games are the ones that you finish and think... ""that would make a pretty good movie"".  Blackwell Epiphany is one of those games. The story is good and the emotional hooks are there too. The puzzles aren't ""easy"" but they're not too difficult either.  I love the idea of controlling two characters, one of which is a ghost. At first I kept forgetting that the ghost could go through locked doors but once you get the ghost's main powers understood, it's a whole lot of fun. Blackwell Epiphany is like the best of the Sierra games, except that it doesn't lock up (one crash in the whole game and that was probably my fault) and you don't get killed.  I guess, in that respect, it's more like Lucasarts.			"

												Wow, what an ending... what a journey.It's already 5 titles when you look back.The Epiphany is better design & well-paced than the last 2 games. It's way longer (after all it's the last one), with more voice lines. There are many thoughtful tweaks as well. (finally Dave won't kick me out the game when I finished it)Overall, I like the story, and how it ends. When the idea of medium & saving ghost appeared in the first game, it was quite fascinating. But when you played along of the series, it became a little cliche sometimes. But Epiphany brought the feeling back successfully. I definitely recommand this game.My ranking of blackwell series: Unbound > Epiphany > Legacy > Convergence = DeceptionUnbound got the best mixture of music & narrative, and I love Laurence. ❤ "

												The Blackwell series are really great adventure games, and the finale is no exception. You play as Roseangela Blackwell who, with the help of her spirit guide, helps lost souls to realize they are dead and move on.Besides having great adventure puzzles, the Blackwell series tell an excellent story that really progresses from game to game. It doesn’t feel like a series of episodes connected only by the characters, but like a true progression, with each game building up to this conclusion. Rosa’s character really develops through the series as her experience grows and she learns more about her abilities. I thought Epiphany was a very fitting, though sad, end to the series.			"

												When the characters are convincing, I will get pretty involved and feel (at least part of) their emotions as my own. This is precisely what happens in playing the finale of the Blackwell series. When I played Lauren in an earlier game, I loved her character---her nature, her charm, her care for the family. And in epiphany, I really see how strong a woman Lauren's niece, Rosa Blackwell has become. She is much stronger than Lauren, thriving in her professional. This is a game that inspires me to be a professional woman as strong as her. In this end, it's not about anyone, but is also about everyone. In particular, it is about Joey, and everyone that continues to live.			"

												What did I think of when I started the Blackwell series?! I got so much sucked into it, I played through all the 5 games in just a few days. And now I probably need one or two days to get down from it, just like it is with any good story. Even though there are still many questions unanswered, this last game felt like a worthy finish.For my taste it got a little bit too fantasy-intense in a too short time in the last part of the game... but that didn't stop me from tearing over the end.Of all the Blackwell games, this one is my favorite when it comes to the emotional bond and the interaction between Rosa and Joey. You could really see the various facets of their relationship: the teasing, the team-work, the growing trust, the annoyance about each other and the dependency, the caring... If you liked the other games, you should play this one, too.			"
