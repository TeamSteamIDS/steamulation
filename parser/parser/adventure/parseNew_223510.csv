												Miasmata is an exclusive first-person survival adventure game, starts on the island of Eden.You play a plague infected scientist, who finds himself on an uninhabited island. Looking for a cure, hidden in the plants on the island which you’ll have to collect, study them and synthesise together to create tonics. The game combines elements from a number of genres mixing first person survival, adventure and puzzle elements.It is unlike anything else you’ll play. With an intense focus on survival, the game successfully nails the feeling of vulnerability and weakness. A fantastic open-world concept, and a wide variety of materials to collect and craft all together, makes it an extremely compelling game.

Sadly there are a few issues with character performance and visual effects. Some objects are quite unattractive on close examination and hard to make out at long range. The character movement alone is quite challenging and you should pay attention where you step in without rolling off the cliff or drown.

In overall:*Unique survival experience.*Interesting setting and game mechanic.*Focus on realism creates a great game atmosphere.The game delivers a great atmosphere and visuals with unique gameplay that is easy to get hooked on.I highly recommend that anyone with a similar passion for science, discovery, and adventure give Miasmata a try. It is very rough around the edges, but its dedication to its novel niche concept makes it worthwhile.9/10			"

												This game was rather attractive when I first spotted it some years ago. Everything felt good at first but after a while I left it. Why? This game, in my opinion, is quite limited. For you are not truly free in your actions. Yes, you got an illness and that's a valid handicap to make gaming more interesting. But that doesn't entirely explain why, for instance, I need to redo some actions which are not that interactive.I'll give you some examples:Discovery:In order to know where you are you need to triangulate your position, it is not difficult and neither bad, but it grows dull after a while and then you feel like gonna quit (luckily you can find some maps at times). The map automatically shows your position which you have triangulated (this is okay) adding some unknown areas (quite unrealistic and I did not like it very much). It would have been better giving you a map of the island, or pieces of it, and then had to triangulate. Some books are filled with a rather common plot but still quite interesting at times. Player movements are really odd: it is completely uncomfortable for the character finds very difficult to climb flat hills.Research:1) You find a flower2) You pick it up3) You take it back to one of the labs within the island4) You run a research over it and soon after process it (in a standardized way indeed for any item you find)5) You get an output: an aspirine or some sort of boost or whateverThis feels very annoying and repetitive after a while. One pro point is that it there's a huge variety of stuff to find and analyse. It would have been quite cool if your working lab had an interactive feature on it.Enemies:The only enemy you have is some sort of black lion-like creature which can kill you with a single blow (it can infect you with fever if you're lucky enough to survive the attack). It can be everywhere around the map, especially at night during which is almost invisible (this is a good feature indeed). Weapons like knives or rocks prove useless. This is another interesting point which makes gameplay less boring. But still devs had to put some sort of weapon with which you could stun it (for more than a handful of seconds) instead of running away with the thing right just behind you (both you and the creature are liable to some glitches like getting stuck between trees). In order to go ahead with the game you'll encounter it a lot. Same point as before: annoying and repetitive. There are some intangible enemies like fever and thirst but they are easily manageable if you get the hang of the game.You can say: ""The game implies you're desperate to survive"". But I think that if they added some sort of food & build (placing a small camp given the necessary tools and items) mechanics, or just giving more interactive features on the things you do as a habit, it would have been a really good game.In short:I do not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't like doing the same stuff all the time. This game had the potential to be a good game indeed. This is my review, now you are free to choose. I don't give Universal principles here and there so you do what you want.Thanks for reading. "

												Seriously one of the most profoundly underrated games I have ever played.Things Miasmata did that were totally amazing and have not been properly replicated before or since:*A completely original exploration based gameplay concept from the triangulation mapping*A sense of maintained suspense and horror thanks to the complete unpredictability of the monster that can show up at any time or not show up for hours as you explore.*A player character that feels legitimately weak and frail when injured. Your injuries and dehydration make the character more difficult to control and more prone to tripping and falling. Your characters momentum will frequently send you careening off cliffs in a panic unable to stop yourself in time, especially when running from the aforementioned monster.It is a good game.			"

												I STUMBLED AROUND IN THE BUSHES FOR 15 GODS DAMNED HOURS DOING DRUGS I MADE OUT OF THE LOCAL FLORA.alright, now that i got that out of the way:miasmata.  a game in which you have the plague, walk like a drunk on rollerskates, and make drugs to keep the plague at bay.  you also occasionally get stalked by what i have dubbed the ""cantalope.""cons:-you control like a drunk on rollerskates-you're bad at everything-lots of walking-the plague-some of the drugs/achievables are bugged-i apparently misread some of the cartography rules and had the world's worst map for the first bitpros:-you control like a drunk on rollerskates-you're bad at everything-atmospheric-really pretty-the cartography is pretty neat-stop being a child and learn to read a map-MAKE THE DRUGS-DO THE DRUGS-the cantalope is probably my favourite monster ever because it's exactly what it should be.  damn near wet myself the first time i ran into it.-the cantalope is pretty chill once you get to know him-seriously though, i've been in quite the state before and handled minor inclines better than richard here.

												This game is amazing. It's ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. There's almost nothing i would complain about in this game.To start off, the concept is amazing and the execution is spot on. You are on an island, probably alone (yet to complete). And you are plague stricken for which you have to find a cure. The entire island is yours to explore. There are survival concepts such as thirst and fever. There is crafting and such with which you can make medicines and some perma-upgrades.Now, the three things i loved the most about this game. First, the mapping system. You have to explore the entire map but it's not that simple. You have to use triangular cartography by using landmarks which is just awesome. And when you run, it actually takes time to stop because of your momentum which i think is a great idea for a realistic survival game. And the graphics are amazing as well. Beautiful when admired and scary at night.This game is amazing. I like it because of it's reality aspect. Perfectly created and delivered. 10/10.			"

												One of the richest exploration experiences I have gotten from a game. The triangulation cartography system is brilliant, and carelessness will get you lost (and probably killed). The main objective of the game -- find plants, synthesize medicines, cure the plague -- is entertaining, though sometimes I wished for a little more depth in the story and the mechanics.This game made me wish that the developers had more funding, because they could have made a great game instead of a good game with a few very cool concepts. I think that feeling is a mark of how well they succeeded.			"

												Miasmata is made with humble graphics and an eye (or four eyes) for technology. It executes mapping and movement shockingly well, both concepts working in unison with the fundamental idea of player disempowerment. The character trips, stumbles and gains momentum on an incline. Traversing the environment feels realistic within reason, and the quickest way to a point ahead is not always a straight line.Cartography is tedious and the nature compelling enough that the player is likely to wander off the beaten path and fall into two possible scenarios: inside, safe or outside, lost. Loss of direction evokes glimpses of freedom rarely experienced in a video game.The systems can be time-consuming to grasp and the solution to the mystery surrounding the player is scattered and abstruse. But why should things be easy to understand?			"

Posted: July 25, 2014
												This is the first survival game I've played that really makes use of nature as an Antagonist. In all my playtime I have yet to see ""The Beast"", although I know twice he's been near, which always adds a little tension.But on more than one occasion I have found myself doing a perfect Nathan Drake ""NO NO NO"" as I lose my footing on a cliff and careen down the side, losing my precious herbs and axe along the way. Landing at the bottom of an unknown section of map, with a major fever.This game has the most robust mapping system I have ever seen, relying on known waypoints and a compass to open your map, which you then use to triangulate your position, then adding the option to plot out unmarked waypoints, opening up more map. Make no mistake, if you don't like cartography or map-reading you will dislike this game. But, if you are into conquering nature while trying to map out a survival plan for yourself then this is the game for you. The mapping is the highlight of this game for me, it is fantastically implemented and should be the standard for any game going forward that uses a mechanic like building a map based on exploration.Focusing on exploration and narrative over scares and enemies, your wits are put to the test. Get stuck at night in the wilderness in a section that you have not mapped well and you'd better hope you run across a makeshift camp, or you're dead. yes, Nature is a formidable foe in this game.With a beautiful island (which seems HUGE in scope), and a backstory from the early 1900's that plays out through scattered notes, there is an elusive mystery to uncover whilst acheiving the main game end-goal, which is to find 3 suitable plants that make a cure for the plague (which you are suffering from). With dozens of plants to find on the island you will find your eyesight put to the test as you watch for plants and man made objects to triangulate your map with, all the while keeping note of your surroundings for footing and dangers. Add in research stations that let you analyze your plants and then make different medicines with them, leading to buffs for your character to keep his health, endurance and sanity up and you're adding in hours of careful playtime.The movement system is just as unique as the rest of this game. As a plague victim you are succumbing to the effects of the disease. Stay hydrated, stay feverless. The movement is based on a physics engine that reacts to the environment around you; climbing uphill dehydrated, you WILL know, you will feel the struggle. Going down a steep incline too fast? You will lose your footing, possibly sending you hundreds of feet downwards in a spiralling arc, hurting and disorienting you. Which could easily lead to a swift death. It's not perfect in it's execution, but it is something entirely different that really adds a unique aspect of challenge to the gameplay. Heavily wooded areas increase the chance of slipping on wet leaves. riverbeds are rocky, adding to the fall factor. Swamps get deep and there's always the chance of wading too deep, and if you're health isn't tended to, drowning becomes a real fear.I've hardly mentioned the Beast, as I have yet to encounter him. The Beast randomely patrols the island, the AI is based on sight, smell and sound. When he's stalking you, your heartbeat becomes your indicator. Hide or run, lose the Beast and you're alright...but if he continues to get closer you may have to fight him off, using weapons found around the Island, but I am told that fighting is for fools. Flee and stay hidden. I really don't mind that I have yet to come face-to-face with him. The Beast is almost as much about emotional fear than jump scares. But IMO, he is second to Nature as to the dangers around you.Saving relies on light. Fires, candles and lanterns populate the island, find one and light it and you have a saved game. A beautiful day/night cycle is active, with beds that allow you to sleep, save and skip a few hours ahead. Sticks can be used as torches at night to help in almost pitch-black wilderness, don't let The Beast see that light!I could go on and on about how much I enjoy this game, how great the community is; I could talk about the mods available that make it a more challenging and daunting survival sim. I could also tell you how much value I find in this game for only $15. But you should find out for yourself.If you want a real survival challenge, that fiinally makes nature the main antagonist (while keeping the game exciting and challenging) then Miasmata is the game for you. The laerning curve is in the medium range of difficulty, but the community is always ready to help out, and there are plenty of guides to help you get started.Highly enjoyable, highly recommended. :)			"

												-- this review is lengthy and i would advise you take a gander at it in full --A very fun and emotionally gripping experience.  Unlike other games that shoehorn survival elements in, or simply can't take the leap to make it pure survivalist, this indie game made by two brothers pulls it off.And how.If you read the store page description of the game, you'd know that you are a plague stricken scientist, reuniting with your colleagues on an island.. but, as in any video game, something has gone horribly wrong.  You find a blood soaked page, which details the cure's formula.  And off you go..As a pure survival game, there is no hunger mechanic, but there is thirst and fever.  Thirst naturally accumulates and you must rehydrate from clean water sources or canteens regularly.  Fever occurs from injury{falling from heights and getting scratched by a kittteh - more on Milo later} exertion (swimming, walking about), and ambiently, and you must take medicine that you craft from plants you find to offset it.  Or take a nap.You see, throughout the game, and exploring the island, you can pick up various plants and take them to camps where equipment is located to refine it and synthesize various medicaments and drugs that you take.  These range from simple aspirin to drugs that permanently increase your physical attributes - as well as the cure, which you learn about from the Bloody note that you find from the beginning - detailing three agents each made from two rare plants.Navigating the island is a challenge - you have no arbitrary minimap and you must fill in a map using triangulation.  Which basically means that you must take your map out and get line of sight with two ""known"" landmarks to fill in an area - simply going there does not suffice...  You can also triangulate distant landmarks by triangulating your position as normal, and then selecting said landmark as a third - you must do this from two different positions.  They even give you a compass.The actual mechanic of saving your game is quite interesting as well - you must sleep, select a candle, lantern, or put a log into a fire to save.Oh, and the graphics are pretty too.  The island is beatiful and has many different environments, from swamps to boreal forests to a mountainous japanese style bamboo forest.  They managed to put all hud elements from the game into immersive 3d meshes - the journal is actually a 3d object that you turn 3d pages in and read text right off the texture.  The map is the same deal.Now, onto my favorite part of the game.  The creature.  Well, that and the notes you find that add backstory - but more on that later.  The creature is nicknamed Milo by the community, because it is based on the brothers' pet cat, MIlo.  Milo is a strange leopard-lion-elk thing that stalks you through your adventure.  He is very unique looking and can kill you with two swipes of his paws.  You must fend him off with a torch, throw rocks at him(Which may or may not just♥♥♥♥♥♥him off), or break line of sight to get him to go away.  You cannot fight back, and I wouldn't suggest running, as he'll catch up to your plague-ridden♥♥♥♥♥♥in seconds and anjoy a pre cooked meal, courtesy of fever.  His eminent presence can be detected through upgrades to your stats and a heartbeat sound that grows more rapid as he gets near.  Beware the Milo, for you cannot fight back.The story is introduced through the notes you find in the camps throughout the game, ranging from journals, letters, and newspaper clippings, to your colleagues and your own's research notes.  I assure you, if you invest the time into collecting some of these you will not regret it.To top it all off, the satisfying and inspiring ending and final cutscenes, as well as the musical tracks and environments make for such a great indie experience that I cannot recommend this enough for those that have the patience - and if you don't well there are decent guides out there.  And even then there remains the experience of exploring and avoiding Milo.			"

												Great concept, poor execution. First off, I'll start with what I liked about the game. Mapping is pretty cool, the idea of using triangulation to uncover the map and mark yourself/landmarks is awesome and works fairly well. The island is large, there is tons to explore, and the game lets you do just that if you want. Night time is dark, and you can easily get lost if you don't have a light.The idea of finding, identifying, and mixing different flora of the island together to make different tonics/medicines is nice.The slightly bad.Map at night. If you're not holding anything, then you pull out your lighter at night to view the map. But if you're holding anything before pulling it out (including a torch) the map ends up being a useless black square in the dark. Requiring you to drop your torch and have it roll away every time you want to look at the map.Weapons. Why give me knives/axes if they're completely useless?The ""Creature"". I played this game for 5 hours and only saw the ""creature"" once. It found me when I was out in the open and had nowhere to hide, so I just kept watching it while walking backwards towards the closest hut. It never attacked me, just followed a few feet away the enire time. Once I reached the hut it wandered off, never to be seen again.The bad. Your character controls like a 400 pound blob wearing bowling shoes. Once you get the slightest bit of momentum going, it's really hard to stop. This had me constantly running off cliffs and falling down hills that I should've been able to stop infront of. Any slight incline and you will either start sliding or just start running down it. This makes exploring extremely frustrating at times. While I have stopped playing out of frustration, I may pick it up again at a later date to see if they've updated it at all. I really do love the idea of this game, and could probably have forgiven a majority of the flaws, but the controls ruined the experience for me. They drove me absolutely insane and were the sole reason I stopped playing the game. It's unfortunate, but I just can't reccomend this game because of the controls.			"

												Heavy on exploration. Light on gameplay. This is not a game for everyone. Miasmata is one of those modern indie games that, in my opinion, is striving to be an artsy like experience than what is traditionally considered a game by the average joe. And just like those games with similar aspirations, the gameplay is diminshed so the player can be wowed by the ""experience"". And that's why I was on the fence when deciding to recommend this because I couldn't help but feel that this game could've been grander if the developers spent more time on the gameplay aspect. However, it's hard to overlook what effort they did put in the environment/sound effects and I think it paid off. Miasmata is beautiful to explore. Realistic looking and massive in size along with its varied topography, it's almost like hiking in a national park.  But, it has a dark character and history to it as well that will become apparent if you decide to play it. I only recommend this game to those who love exploring natural, beautious environments (and finding flowers for a cure) because that's what 90 percent of this game is. On the other hand, if you're the type of person who needs something constantly happening in the game, then you'll probably be bored with this one.			"

												Im gonna begin this review with two definitions of horror: You got cheap/graphical horror, in wich its mostly based on jumpscares or things that are scary to look at. you dont need to be skilled to do so, since even little kids can hide behind a curtain and give you a jumpscare. And then you got psychological horror. The tension slowly builds up. you fear what you cannot see, because you know its there. and eventually it will come out.  Miasmata uses the last one briliantly. The feeling of being watched is constant. a must have for tense survival fans. The graphics are not that good, but its an indie game made by 2 dudes, so i guess you should judge that. comparing it with, lets say, Battlefield 3 is like comparing your uncle Doe´s lil shop with Wal-Mart.In overall, it requires some patience to deal with some unpolished controls, but its definitively worth it.

												Ice skating simulator 2012. I really want to like this game, but the gameplay is so agonizing, it's hard to keep going. I like the triangulation idea, and the premise seems intriguing, but the bread and butter of it all is very clunky. I understand it's survival, and the ""realism"" of the walking, slipping, climbing, etc. But in the end it really detaches me from the game. Slipping off cliffs, hours spent walking (sliding?) at a crawling pace, fetch this plant here, take it there, I just can't do it. It's certainly a test of patience, and I have quite a bit, but not for this. Everyone seems to like it though, which is good. It's just not for me. I need a better execution for a game that requires these things.			"

IntroMiasmata focuses on throwing you into a realistic open world experience, where surviving the wilderness to find a cure for yourself is the goal. What sets this game apart from other open world games is how important the mechanics are when it comes to navigation and shelter. You really have to learn how to map out areas by using landmarks to avoid being lost.  You want to be able to also make medicine in case you stumble and fall and end up with a fever. Physics Create ConsequenceThere is actual consequences for not watching your balance thanks to the physics in this game. It really feels like you are a vulnerable person on a island trying to find a cure and any misstep can lead to to plunge right off a cliff if you don’t slow down enough. AI is UnpredictableThe AI is also less predictable when making his presence known since he does not get scripted to certain triggers but rather roams around the island.  This actually adds more suspense when you compare it to games like Amensia because the confrontation with the beast is not obvious and can happen at any time. GatheringGathering plants allows you to craft various potions that reward you with stat increases or help reduce fever, resulting in a rewarding experience when exploring the island .The storage system for the plants makes it easier to go from one place to the next without worrying about how much room you have left.  Issues and ConclusionI have had some graphical issues that I am currently working on fixing but other than that I would say the game is very enjoyable.			"

												This game was vastly different from any other game I've ever played and I've played my fair share. You are defenseless, but there's nothing really to kill you except for your own mind. The concept behind this game is amazing and the AI for the monster is one of the best I've ever seen. I've read it was supposed to be based on the dev's cat and I can totally see that. It behaves just like a real life cat would, and if you treat it thusly you can generally escape it. This game was a very well rounded game in my opinion and once I started playing it I couldn't stop until I was finished. I completed the game in two days I think. Not only is it an incredibly unique and interesting idea, the execution was great as well. The visuals, and most importantly the flowers, were stunning and I could tell a lot of them were modelled after real flowers. The story line which you garner from notes left by people before was intriguing and chilling. The behavior of the monster just blew me away. The heartbeat noise alone was enough to get my own heart pounding. I could tell the dev put a TON of effort into thinking out the monster which I must applaud.At first I disliked the triangulating your position aspect of the map, but after a while I came to like and respect it as an idea. Also I liked that it wasn't as hard as just wandering through the jungle, aimlessly and that you were actually pointed in the right direction gently. The size of the map and the details within the terrain were very well done. I practically have nothing but praise for this game. I think one of my biggest... dislikes? Was that when you died you were merely sent back to your last save point. So there was really no threat. Anywho, I would definitely recommend this game.Probably one of the most memorable games I've ever played.			"

												Definitely an unique game experience if you are into area exploring and you failed your botanology real life dream.Wouldn't recommend this for everyone. As a stranded plague infected wanderer on a unknown island, your best friends will be a compass and your own made map. Soon you discover the island flora can be well helpful as for temporary or permanently boosting your abilities, possibly helping you overcoming a plague too. During your research you will need to watchout for all kinds of landmarks which you need to triangulate or mark to expand your map, without this you will get pretty much lost and hunted.7,5/10; As a game made just by 2 people this is kind of top notch result as for atmosphere or music which sadly plays only during specified events. PS: Watchout for a lot of bugged achievements.			"

												== Story ==Miasmata's storyline is not very complicated and easy to grasp, while at the same time being deep. With deep I mean there are a lot of notes scattered around the island that can give a greater depth to the story, if you care to read them.    You are a scientist, stricken by plague and on hunt for a cure. You are washed up on a mysterious island, Eden. Eden is home to the plants and fungi that are nevessary ingredients of the sought-after cure. On this island you find yourself alone, with empty camps and a few dead bodies around the island. Or are you really alone?== Gameplay ==Miasmata is a free roaming exploration-centered survival-game. It is free roaming and exploration-centered as you are dropped on a mysterious island with no clear objectives. You must find your own way around the island, and exploring it is very much a part of doing so.    It doesn't have a very heavy emphasis on the ""survival""-part, as the only things you must do in order to stay alive is drink water, stay out of deep water and not fall off cliffs or slip into the hands of a hungry creature.   Most of the gameplay boils down to five things:- Trying to triangulate your position and reveal new portions of the (fairly large) map.- Picking flowers- Drinking water- Trying to navigate up or down a steep hill- Running (as means of travel or trying to avoid a threat)That being said, it may sound very basic and boring. Well IT IS NOT. I found it very satisfying to explore the map, trying to find a new camp or new objects I can triangulate. Once I found a new camp I got a tickly feeling in my entire body. Finding a new flowers and bringing it back to the base while hoping that it is of some use to you gives you a feeling that other games rarely can give.== Graphics ==Miasmata is made by a two-man team and the engine that powers the game is made by just the two of them. With this in mind, Miasmata could be a worse-looking game. Sure, it doesn't look like an AAA-title like Battlefield, and the animations are a bit wonky. But what do you expect?   It does succeed in giving the game a very cozy and atmospheric feeling, which is core in a game like this. Never did I once during the game (except for maybe the first minutes) feel that ""This game could really use some better graphics"".== Summary ==Miasmata may have some weird movement from time to time, the graphics aren't the best, and you would hope that a scientist could carry more than three flowers at the same time.    But what it lacks in those parts, and some other parts aswell, it makes more than well up for in the other parts. Exploration is fun and extremly satisfying, especially when you find a new camp that has important notes or when you find a new fungi that is part of the cure. Triangulating your position in order to reveal parts of the map is hard but rewarding, something that many games are missing.   What made me buy this game at first I don't really know. What kept me playing was pretty much everything in the game. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do.			"

												Miasmata is a game with a great sense of adventure and exploration. Majority of the time is spent just exploring with no fear of danger leaving you to plot and map out the island as you go. The mechanics for taking notes on landmarks you see and using them to get your bearings around the island to fill out the map more is great fun and very rewarding. It is quite unique and I have never seen it in a game before. By using buildings, statues, and stone formations you can use triangulation to check your location and add your surroundings to the map you create.The creature that roams the island can be a positive or a negative for many people whether they are looking for some slight horror and suspense of hiding from it, or if they just don't want to be bothered by it. The creature isn't a constant threat and holds a good balance to appease either type of player. When the creature draws near your heart pounds and you do your best to stay hidden and hope it passes.The game works very well with exploration and filling out the log book and looking for specific plants to be used in antidotes and medicines help drive you to explore more. Though you will want to keep exploration to the days as much as possible making your way to camps to rest through the night. The night time is extremely dark and after losing track of time and getting stranded in the middle of the night you will never want to be left out again stumbling through the darkness hardly able to see what lies ahead.If you enjoy the slower pace and exploration which you most likely do if you care enough to look at reviews and recommendations about the game then you won't be disappointed. This game draws you into the world and makes you want to spend time in it seeing what lies just over the next crest.I highly recommend it, there isn't much like it.			"

												I only really bother to wrote a review when i'm throughly impressed with a game, maybe even a little surprised.I have played games for many years and never really played anything like this...Firstly, this is the only game where a person's momentum - whether running or walking  - is modelled realisticly. Secondly, Cartography - the art of map-making  - amazing amount of fun to traverse a lush diverse island having to chart every nook and cranny to find your war around.Shut the curtains, turn off the phone and get lost!Thumbs up!

												It is very hard to believe that only two people are responsible for the creation of this game. The result of a two-man team work looks astounding: vast forests and plains of the island are teeming with life, sun is shining through the leaves, day is slowly turning into night, dying in a wonderfully beautiful sunset. Our protagonist arrives to the island in hopes of getting cured of the plague. A small research group has been working here for quite some time, and it seems they’ve been successful in finding the cure. But as we soon find out, the scientists are all dead and the research outposts stand empty. It is now up to us to explore the island, find out what happened to its inhabitants and finally create the cure for the plague. And oddly enough, we are still not alone on the island…The game is very atmospheric – just let it pull you in and enjoy the challenges it presents. You are going to hunt for flowers and mushrooms, climb the hills and explore the ravines, map the island using a compass and landmarks and run away screaming when the mysterious Creature arrives. The main problem of Miasmata is at the same time its main attraction. It is a budget game. Miasmata lacks content, excitement and diversity – the Creature’s constant presence helps at first, but as the game progresses the constant stalking stops being as frightening and becomes somewhat tedious. And when you remove the Creature from the equation, Miasmata has surprisingly little to offer – the plot is straightforward and almost non-existant, there are no sub-quests, just pure plant hunting and island mapping. However, the game’s hardcore nature and the fresh approach to the genre is going to keep you interested long enough to be able to survive and find the damn cure.			"

												Miasmata is an ""exploration"" game, you wake up on an island and have to find plants to create an cure for the disease you're suffering from. You have to wander through the forests, spot and collect plants, then carry them back to somewhere you can identify them and their effects. You are also chased by ""something"" during all this, but I won't tell more about it here ;)What makes the essence of that game is the Cartography Mechanic. Basically, you'll have to build your map on your own, not to get lost. To reveal the map, you have to stand at a particular spot and aim with your compass to 2 known objects (houses / statues / ruins) that you know, so you'll be able to triangulate your position and reveal the map. Then, the ""how to get in the forest without being lost"" will make your brain cells works. The graphics are beautiful, every tree has been ""hand-placed"" by the two developpers (they have made the entire game, including the physics engine, on their own... that's incredible). [Pros] : + Awesome graphics, really (but don't hope playing with a low-end GC), better than some AAA Games+ The feeling of being ""lost"" on that Island ; this is the sole game where I really had the feeling that I was lost xD+ A real ""exploration game"", where you're thrown in and don't know what to do at first+ The Cartography mechanics, quite unique if you like it. It serves the ""I am lost"" feeling[Cons] : - English only, do not buy if you only speak your native language (other than English)- Your character has soap under its feet (not actually, it's realistic, but too realistic xD)~ The whole game relies on exploration, there is (almost) no ennemy (except the controls)~ If you don't like the cartogrpahy system, you won't like that game[Conclusion] : If you're ok with English, like exploration, wouldn't be bothered by a lack of ennemies, have a good GC and want to really feel ""lost"" in a game, give it a try ;) 8.5/10 "

												I'm absolutely loving this game.  I've uncovered just over half the map and it's been an amazing journey. This is the thinking mans - and womans - kind of game.  Plan your trips, watch your terrain, think about what you are doing, if you go wandering blind you're in for getting seriously lost.The cartography system is marvelously innovative and once it dawned on me how this actually works I've been searching out landmarks to uncover even the smallest piece of the map.Finding that one plant you've been looking for feels like a massive accomplishment - the map is large! And you did it by using your wits and your compass.If you're tired of zombies, cannibals and scary dog vampires in survival games - this is the game for you.  Your enemy is the terrain itself, since you are terminally ill, you will slip down steep slopes, slow down when running over rocks... The momentum and balance system in this game is probably the most realistic travesement of terrain I have ever experienced and once you learn that you HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF while running around sick it all clicks.The graphics are a bit dated by todays standards - but it's still a pretty enough game and the islands so interesting Ive forgotton all about the fact this isnt Crysis-pretty.Since I didnt buy this game for months due to the issues claimed on the negative reviews I feel I must clear some things up.It makes no sense buying a game where the developers CLEARLY states you are a very sick man, then complain you cant Rambo your way through it.  If you simply don't understand or care to find out how to use or compensate for momentum it does not make the game bad.  Use the momentum gained from downhill slides to run half way up the next slope.  If you're in a bad slide, drop to all fours.  But most importantly, the terrain is your enemy - treat it with respect.  If it's too steep, find another way.  Calling a game trash because they've given you a new mechanic to figure out, but it's not the mechanic YOU wanted and you can't be bothered to figure out how to move forward without breaking your neck is laughable.Running back and forth for plants to make meds??  Wait, what?  I've played an entire Saturday and most of Sunday and in all that time I've used 4 meds.  Simply because I was careless.  If you sleep every night and watch your footing you will NEVER HAVE TO TAKE A SINGLE MED.  If you're constantly searching for meds you're trying to Rambo again.You can carry 3 flowers in your hand.  The flowers are scarce and storage close enough that only once did I have to leave a less important flower behind.  I did not even bother to go pick it up as you have several different flowers you can use to make the same med and they normally grow right outside the lab huts.The game runs perfectly smooth on my computer.Understand that this game requires you to be careful and foremost take care of yourself and you will come to appreciate the innovation that was used while making Miasmata.  As a side note, once you've completed your secondary objectives and restored your stats to normal, you get to be a little more Rambo if you want while searching for the cure.About the creature, its appearance is few and far between - just hide from it you'll be ok.This game is fun, innovative, slow paced and interesting with zero combat and deeply enjoyable.  Understand what it is and what it isnt and you will find yourself out and about with your compass and map for hours, checking your watch because you sure do not want to be caught in the pitch dark tonight.8/10.  Loads of the more relaxed kind of fun!			"

												Such a fascinating experience!  Miasmata is a pretty unique adventure with an interesting little story. This game is all about cartography and exploration. The main goal's to find the plants that will help you elaborate medicines, tonics & the three necessary agents you'll need to cure yourself from the disease. A greater number of activites to perform on the island would have been appreciated but it's still fun and rewarding to discover new areas, different vegetation and plants. The graphics aren't that impressive but the art style is pretty engaging (I especially like the notes and drawings that you can find in your diary). The weather changes are very well done as well as the day/night cycle.Nevertheless, If you're mainly looking for combats and advanced crafting, it's very unlikely that Miasmata will fill your expectations.

												Freaking excellent survival / adventure / exploration game. If you enjoyed just exploring open world games like Skyrim of Far Cry 3 you have to play this game.This game has the best cartography / mapping system ever - forget automaps, you will be drawing lines on a map with a compass to figure out where you are, and if you get lost (say, by taking a wrong turn at night when you can only see about 1 meter in front of you), you WILL be lost.Also features one absolutely terrifying Kitty / Lion / Bull / Goat / Frog ... err, thing, but there is NO combat system (other than throwing rocks), so you'll eaither be hiding or running when you see it.The game also looks absolutely gorgeous - sure, many of the models have lowish polygon counts or could do with a higher res texture, but zomg look at that sunset! Oh... it's night now?Update: I recently wrote a story on the experience I had in this game that made me fall in love with it and why it became my #1 game of all time:http://steamcommunity.com/app/223510/discussions/0/540741131417338368/#c540741131521570753 "

												I've got a two-prong test on whether you'll like this game or not.a) Did you like Far Cry 2? If yes, get it. If no, see b)b) Are you intrigued by the idea of a world where you're a sickly researcher with a plague trying to discover what wiped out a quarantine colony/cure yourself? Because that's what you're getting here.It's fantastic but challenging, and my biggest gripe is this: the game's engine is a MESS (so, Far Cry 2 comparisons continue). It takes a good deal of time to load, and it's very... the first night especially I could not figure out what happened because I woke up in pitch blackness and I guess my character pulled out a journal or something? But I couldn't see ANYTHING and so didn't know why I couldn't move/interact with anything or light a lamp.It's strange and janky and explorationy and I love it. I give ""Suffering from a horrible disease and being stalked by an unknown beast"" 4 stars out of 5.			"

												A few years ago, Steam began an ambitious and promising new program called Steam Greenlight, a place where aspiring developers could, for a small fee and compliance with a few simple instructions, post information, screenshots, video, and updates about their game projects for Steam users to vote on. Those that reached a certain number of votes would, when development had finished, be released on the Steam platform. I remember I was looking at colleges when I saw the program for the first time. An important task, yes. But I realized how important the program was and how the landscape of independent development was changing. Greenlight would allow developers with the best ideas to be easily published by a major company, something relatively unheard of before even in my lifetime. I quickly stopped what I was doing and browsed through the first wave of hopefuls, casting my votes.Miasmata was one of the first games I voted for. The game oozed potential all over the Greenlight page. For a two-man development team, the environment looked great and a fun place to explore. Gameplay looked fun and different, and the idea of interacting with the mysterious creature intrigued me. I was happy when the game was Greenlit and it became the first Greenlight game I purchased. While I am pleased at having been a small part of this game’s release I, unfortunately, still stand by the conviction I had when I voted for this game years ago: it still oozes potential. But after a release, that no longer becomes a good thing to say about a game. As a beta, Miasmata would be a hit. As a game right now, it is more a missed opportunity. The only area in which Miasmata thoroughly succeeds is in the sky effects and day-night cycle. I have yet to see any other game, independent or AAA, match them. Watching the sun rise and set, and the sky change from day to night, is stunningly beautiful and mesmerizing. Watching storm clouds march towards you is both ominous and entrancing. In all of this, the light compliments, accentuates, and stages(and hides flaws in) the environment well. Shutterbugs, fair warning: you will be snapping screenshots like crazy. For a few years, my own screenshots from Miasmata were the desktop backgrounds on my rig. The music is also very well done and I enjoy listening to it while I work.Miasmata also does pretty well in the overall feeling of exploration. The idea of setting out on a journey through a completely unmapped environment, and uncovering the map yourself, is thrilling (though I found the process of triangulation, albeit realistic, quite a pain). Collecting/analyzing plants and synthesizing medicines is also strangely interesting, probably because it’s so different from anything else I’ve done in games before. Said journey is often so engrossing that it’s very easy to forget that you’re not alone on the island. The creature (inspired by one of the developer’s cats) does not make frequent appearances (about once every 3 days), so every encounter is memorable and sometimes fatal. One of my favorite memories of playing Miasmata involves one such unexpected appearance. During my first month of college, I was playing the game while listening to an (optional) recorded lecture when the creature suddenly appeared. Giving him the slip was such a terrifying experience I had to rewind the lecture 20 minutes. Though moments like these are fun and memorable, they are also jarring, especially in an experience clearly more concerned about exploration. It almost brings up a discussion of identity crises, as there is little explanation (that I was able to find anyway) about what the creature is supposed to be or represent, except a way to occasionally terrorize the player and make them forget about what plant they were looking for. Would it be better if there was more explanation or analyzing of the creature? For that matter, what about making the rest of the plot more meaningful (the madman supposedly on the island, and the civil unrest where the protagonist came from)? Could Miasmata still be a game without the creature? Would it have been better with more emphasis on survival (fighting the creature, hunting for food, not just finding water, permanently deteriorating health to stem a sense of urgency to synthesize the cure? Etc.) My answer would be a yes to all of those—if everything else worked well.Strip all that away, and the rest of Miasmata suffers from a myriad of technical and artistic problems. As an individual with a degree in computer animation, this is both extremely disturbing but also fascinating—It’s like seeing everything I’ve been taught to avoid brought to life. If you do decide to take on this journey, be prepared to see stretched/wonky textures, broken trees, awkward animations (the final scene of the game is hilariously bad, as are the drinking animations), a funny typo at the end of the game, glitched/broken achievements, being able to pick up more than one item in one hand, and odd framerate drops. For the more the more CAD inclined, there is faceting in the animal models, texture seams visible in the arms/wrists, aliasing on the larger water surfaces, and intersecting geometry. Also be prepared to take your own notes on what plants do what, as the notebook is hopelessly disorganized and, later in the game, as more plants are analyzed, is missing information. I know that, to date, this is one of my harshest reviews. I am aware that I sound demanding. I am also aware that I sound ungrateful to the hard work that the two brothers at IonFX put into making this project, and to the dedicated work of Steam member DarkStarSword in creating fixes for some of the above-mentioned problems when IonFX abandoned it. But my reason for being so critical is because Miasmata deserves to be great. It deserves to be fixed. It deserves the love that DarkStarSword has given it—seriously, hats off to you, sir; a job well done and one that I hope you continue. He has proven that not only does the game deserve to be fixed but that it can be. At the end of the day, there would be too much of that oozing potential wasted to just say “yeah, I recommend this game for certain people, it was ok.” No, I do not recommend this game. Not yet. Because this is not the greatest it can be. Not by a long shot. But with people like DarkStarSword, it will get as close as it can to that ideal. It’s only a matter of time.  "

												I absolutely HATE! Horror games, the acception being Damned, but I found it in my heart to but this game for £9.99 a year ago and ever since... I only have 5 hours on the game. Heres why, I HATE THE MONSTER!, when I was playing I realised that if you run he finds you easier in the first minute of the game I drowned... So sad. The game is challenging for wimps like me because its only about 2% of the time you see the monster but you spend 98% of the time cowering hoping to never see him. But he will find you... He will... Trust me. I did learn something cool about the monster and it's what made me buy the game. The monster doesn't just appear when you go to a certain place (Sometimes he does but thats only in places where theres something to do with the cure there (don't quote me on that)) he actually is always moving and when your in your lab making some science shizzles he's out there following your trail and looking for you... He's not just going to appear when you go somewhere, he appears whenever he has tracked you down! The starting area is safe but once you cross that line the beast will GET YOU!!!! Overall I like the game even though I hate horror games, but hey we all hate something right?, but this one will give you the creeps! 9/10 Good but losing that plant that you needed being chased by the monster is a bummer :(P.S. He appears more the more time into a save you do. Example, Day 1: You won't see him unless you run in circles the entire day, Day 2: You might encounter him briefly, Day 5: You will see him on multiple occasions by now, Day 10: You will see him everyday, Day 20: How are you still alive?

You need them for medsor you'll wind up deadwith a monster doing the happy dance.You use traingulation to find your way,Which is neat as you map out each day.But the trails are confusingYou just keep on losingyour place, and wind up astray.So it's great for looking around,wildlife and vistas abound,But when you can hear your heart,and the frantic bits start,You'll just wind up hurt on the ground.

												While the I think the game has a fresh concept and new gameplay mechanics, there's two main problems to this game that keep me from truly liking this game and reccomendin it. One, actually moving around is awful as it feels like you're controlling a drunk person and not a diseased plague patient. I had too many occasions where I went from calmly walking down a hill to the beach and quickly progressed to rolling headfirst down the hill into the water, killing the pc. Secondly, the game is just so freaking boring. Once the initial fifteen minutes are up and you really look at this game, there's not a whole lot to it. You go from one campsite to the next, getting lost while holding flowers, and keeping an eye out for The Beast. When you first spawn, you'll be a bit wary of the enemy until you realize that you'll rarely (if ever) encounter it and evading it isn't very difficult. Out of the many playthroughs I've had, I only ran into The Beast once and all I did was wave a handfull of burning sticks at it and it ran away. I am a bit dissapointed because there's definitely potential here, but the lack of a general story, present threat, and weird gameplay bog the whole thing down. It's unfortunate that these reasons are enough to make me uninstall this game from my computer and move on to other games worth my time.			"

Summary: Miasmata is not really a bad game, it has potential, but it is not one I would recommend anyone to play. It feels unfinished, like it is lacking some essential key aspects for making it a really good experience. The graphics, the story and the gameplay are all quite lacklustre. There are no puzzles, no character interactions and essentially no combat.Review: I finished the game, but I cannot say why, other than pure stubbornness.  The graphics are not too bad, but not exactly gorgeous (and view distance is pretty awful), which is a problem. The game consists almost exclusively of exploration, but there really isn't that much to explore. Sure, the island is big, but you don't really get those ""wow, what an awesome place"" experiences. You see an interesting looking ruin in the distance and you run there... and there is nothing to see. That's the experience you will have all the time, in between running through relatively bland vegetation. Similarly, the story is okay, with notes scattered around to give some idea of both who the people on the island were and the place they were coming from. But as you don't meet any people and the main character never speaks, there is a very empty feeling. I did not find all the notes, but the ones I did offered a pretty lacklustre story that evoked more ""Oh... okay then"" rather than ""Wow, I wanna find all the notes and figure out what is going on."". I found myself looking for the notes mostly to find maps of the area and directions to the cure ingredients. And its good that they are there, but it doesn't make them very interesting. Getting the ingredients also doesn't require any special ability or thought-process. It's all spelled out in the notes, you just have to walk to the right place. There are no puzzles in the game. So what about the gameplay? Well, there is very little. The game is actually very easy, I only died once... because the creature hit me through a wall. And it really is THE creature, because there is only one enemy type in the entire game. The only other enemy is the controls. You have to be careful of how you run as you are very likely to fall over, even at small inclinations. And you slide like you're wearing rollerskates. And falling will give you fever so you must make medicine. But that only serves to slow you down. If you don't run too fast and you avoid the creature (which is not very hard) you will be fine. And once you realise that, the tension kinda disappears. There is nothing to fear on this island but boredom. So overall, I did not hate my time with Miasmata, but the only really memorable part was the frustration from the controls. I would not play it again and I would not recommend it to anyone else.			"

												The biggest problem with video games nowadays is that the breathing noises are really unrealistic. Miasmata aimed to fix that, and I think in Hindi, Miasmata means ""HEAVY BREATHING SIMULATOR 2K9"" so it is a really fitting title. The basic premise is that you're washed up on an island and you have to find a cure for your fever and also your long term illness. The fever makes everything blurry and you're really weak as well and you can die from drowning and fatigue which is really exciting because I can empathise with the main character. The graphics are great and there's a load of suspense, it's also reaaaally easy to get lost on the island. Yesterday I ran out of breath climbing some stairs and I can see now why this game is so realistic and great.			"

												I don't see why some of the reviews bash on the walking mechanics. I understood it within minutes and intensely enjoyed how they made that work. It honestly feels like, to me, that your actually walking. If you ever actually gone out hiking when you're climbing giant mountains, you have to be careful you can't just Skyrim that crap and do miraculous things. Not that they were trying to make it all seem too real, just that their main focus is exploration, so they had to make exploration a challenge. I feel they succeeded perfectly in that manner.Within 20 minutes between hills and rocks and trails, you'll get the hang of the mechanics. If you like exploration you'd like this game. On a side note as well, the game is fun because its not a simple ""there's the destination marker on your map go towards it"". You actually have to read notes for certain locations and use your map and compass. *Game is stunning*Calm but eery*Challenging in exploration more so then any other game I've played*Gameplay long enough to be worth $3 damn dollars. Even the full price. "

												I've played for 4 hours and though the game has potential I find it lacking in anything that resembles entertainment. The point of the game appears to be nothing more then running around the island looking for flowers to create ever more potent medicines from. You don't eat, you don't build, you don't encounter but one beast type and you do nothing but sleep, drink water, collect plants, make meds and take them when necessary. This game takes place within a nicely done 3D world but the game play lacks any depth. I was bored within the first 30 min but continued, hoping there was more to this then I had already discovered - there wasn't.  I also find the physics very annoying i.e. the inertia. As your character approaches a steep incline, he can't seem to put on the brakes before he goes over the edge. It just feels clumsy. While the notebook is a neat idea for a GUI, I found it to be a tedious way to get to the info you are looking for. After watching the research and crafting animations a dozen times, you will be looking for a way to skip them - to no avail.  As I said the game has potential but is severely lacking in depth. If running around an island collecting flowers (while running from a singular beastie) sounds fun then perhaps you will enjoy this game. If you need a game with more then a singular goal you should look elsewhere.			"

												Miasmata is a great game with tons of play time!  It is absolutely gorgeous having been made by two people!  Knowing what to do after being directed around for the entire begining is hard.  But once you realize it is now up to you to explore the game become completely different, because then you have a massive island to explore and search for the cure!  I would love to see food and water added to this game to increase the challenge - or at least the option for food or water or both.  I recommend this game to anyone who loves to adventure and explore and has a bit of roleplay in them.  This Game is Epic!!			"

												Like a lot of recent reviews, I'm of a mixed mind on this. I'd like to give this a thumbs up because it's an interesting concept, but the overall execution is just not strong enough to merit it.For the first hour of playtime I was tense because I knew coming into the game that apparently there is a creature on the island that will hunt you down and kill you. I kept expecting to hear it skulking along behind me in the distance, and a few times spooked myself because I had stopped hitting W but still kept hearing footsteps crunching the leaves—which was just me, staggering along I guess. But eventually I gave up on ever actually encountering any real conflict (other than tripping and giving myself a fever or slipsliding into the bay to nearly drowned).Really, the control scheme's wonkiness is why I can't recommend the game, not the overall lack of conflict. The controls are this strange combination of stiff and mushy, incredibly accurate at times and utterly non-responsive at others. I'd find myself trying to turn my character only to move forward instead; I'd have to stop moving a good ten feet from the edge of a cliff because I wasn't exactly sure how far forward I might stumble after I released W. I get that the character is supposed to be weak from plague but if that's what they were going for with the ""can't climb a speedbump-sized hill but careful you're running full-tilt at that cliff and will take three seconds to stop!"" movement scheme, then it's just not going to work for a game.I think this is a solid alpha for a game, and since I got it on sale for 80% off ($3) it wasn't a horrible purchase, but it's definitely not worth the regular $15 price tag. Give it another 4-6 months' worth of updates and an overhaul of the control scheme, and then it might be fair to ask that much for it.			"

												I want you to try to picture a skill-based walking simulator. Stop before you get a nosebleed and pass out, just try to imagine how that would work. If that hurt your brain, then I'm happy to report that the fellows behind Miasmata came up with a pretty good approach to this conundrum. And while it certainly might not be for everyone, it's a pleasing and occasionally terrifying adventure for those it is.Miasmata is set in some kind of alternate 18th century where a plague is ravaging a society mistrustful of medicine. You've been infected and have traveled to a remote island where a cure is rumored to have been found. You soon find the island's inhabitants have all met strange and unfortunate ends, so it's up to you to concoct the cure yourself. This journey will take you to every corner of a sprawling and beautiful island, and pit you against something that doesn't want you to succeed.Because your avatar is deathly ill, there's not much more he can do than wander the island and collect plants to study. To create the cure you'll have to follow in the late researcher's footsteps, obtaining clues from their notes as to which plants must be combined in which ways. You can research the samples you find to make all sorts of medicines that heal or boost your strength or perception. Early on you can follow the paths between camps to make a lot of progress, but soon you'll be left to explore the island's open wilderness yourself to succeed.The big challenge in your way is finding your way around. You have a map and a compass but it does not update automatically or even show your location. Instead, the game has a whole orienteering system to master. To triangulate your location, you have to sight two of the landmarks that dot the island. This will fill in a chunk of the map around you, and add nearby landmarks as known. You can only use known landmarks to triangulate, but once you establish your location you can mark new landmarks as seen. Mark them from two different locations and they'll be added as known.It's a tricky system to get the hang of, and it drastically changes the approach to the game because getting lost in the wilderness is a very real concern. As a compromise towards survival, you only need to drink water to keep your illness at bay, but you can only get it from camps, fresh ponds, or your canteen which holds five draughts. Lose your way for too long and you can easily run out of water. The nights on the island are also exceptionally dark, which can make it nearly impossible to navigate home and add the very real threat of stumbling off a cliff.There are a lot of nods to realism in the mechanics, but none quite so dramatic as the movement physics. Of all the games I've ever played, Miasmata has probably the most realistic walking physics, and it can be just as awkward to wrangle as you're imagining. Your character slows down greatly when strafing or backing up, and can hardly climb inclines when doing so. Walking straight can get you up most hills, but make one misstep and you'll find yourself sliding or tumbling back down. You build momentum, too, so descending steep hills can easily become one of the most dangerous parts of the game. This might not sound very fun but considering how much walking there is in the game, it actually helps that it's something you have to learn to master.I mentioned a malevolent force on the island as well, but honestly it's a mixed bag. The creature is threatening and searches for you aggressively, requiring stealth or certain behavior to shake it from your scent. However, in the six hours I've put into the game so far, I've only encountered it three times. Twice I escaped by plunging off a cliff (falls don't kill you instantly, so you can medicate out of danger if you're prepared), and the third I heard it coming and simply turned around and backtracked until it disappeared. For most of the game it's bound to be a non-issue, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't panic a little every time I heard it about.In the end, Miasmata is really a hiking simulator first, a survival game second, and a horror game a very distant third. Most of your time with it will be spent deciding where to go, mapping out how to get there, and strolling along the beaches and forest paths. You can accomplish a lot just by sticking to the paths, as most of the critical camps are connected and give clear clues to what you should be looking for. The core design is solid, with some intelligent flow to the island and the discoveries, and it's backed up by some very competent indie graphics and genuinely good sound design. Not everyone is in the market for open-world hardcore walking sims, but if that sounds even a little interesting to you, I think Miasmata will be a pleasant surprise.			"

												5/5Without doubt one of the greatest gaming experiences I've had. Miasmata is an almost perfect masterpiece.  Miasmata is a first-person exploration game that caters strongly to the survival simulation player. It really is unlike just about any other game of its type that it's difficult to pinpoint just what genre it belongs to. Miasmata involves a variety of mechanics including cartography, botany, orienteering,  exploration of a very large island, and includes a dash of survival horror that will keep the player on edge. It's an incredible collation of components that creates an fantastic atmosphere. Players will be torn between feelings of isolation and solitude, followed by moments of achievement and accomplishment, and on many occasions dread and a sense of helplessness. One of my favorite aspects of Miasmata is the complete freedom the player is given to explore the island. You are truly free to go anywhere, at any time. You are given a journal with the most basic goals of the game, some guidelines to follow, and off you go. I truly love that type of design, it shows trust and respect the devlopers have for their player base. And, considering that the game was developed by two brothers, and has such an incredible attention to detail that it's obviou this was a passion project for the two of them. The day and night cycle, shifting weather conditions, along with the shading and textures create such a living and vivid atmosphere that you can practically feel the sun on your skin. There are animals playing in the underbrush, birds singing in the trees and flying around the player, a huge variance in biomes, and very realistically detailed light conditions; the island feels very real.The story is purposefully revealed slowly through letters, journals, and diary pages found in various shelters throughout the island. Even when collecting them the players are allowed to piece together their view and interpretation of what brought the player's character to this island, and what will happen if they eventually leave. The narrative is so tight and interesting that it seems that, even though I had complete freedom to explore at my leisure, it was as if the story was presented to me in a discernible order. I should also note that I appreciate a level of ambiguity in certain types of stories and Miasmata delivers on that front as well. What Miasmata is not is easy, or forgiving. The first time you experience night on the island, truly experience night, when the only light source you have is the inadequate lighter in your hand, with no visible landmarks, and no sense of which way you need to go, you will experience a feeling of helplessness that is just as real as actually being lost at night. As someone who has been in that terrible situation in real life this game gets very close to imitating that subtle creep of frustration, fear, and agony as you slowly realize your error. Very often the best solution is to bed down for the night and continue in the morning. Coming across a shelter after having trekked for an extended period of time, while running low on water, suffering weakness from the plague, and with the setting sun preparing to blanket the island in a curtain of night, is one of the greatest feelings and most rewarding senses of accomplishment I've had the privelege of experiencing in a game.In addition to the difficulty of navigating at night, negotiating the topography of the island is very often difficult in itself. This isn't the typical third-person physics engine in which the player can catapault themselves recklessly through forest, over hills, and atop mountains. If the player isn't careful or intelligent on how they navigate the terrain they can fall and injure themselves which will need to be addressed with medicine and/or rest. There is even an often frustrating sliding mechanic that, if ignored, can lead the player to some grossly terrible and very sudden falls. I both hate, and love this mechanic as it is equal parts frustrating and realistic. When it rains it even gets more dangerous to navigate steep areas, especially in the mud. I can understand people viewing this as a frustrating negative, I agree that it can be frustrating, but the character is suffering from a disease that weakens his body, when combined with the actual difficulty of navigating varied and difficult terrain, heightens the believability and realism of the game, elevating it to a very thoughtful experience that punishes recklessness, and rewards careful planning. To top off all this incredible programming for the island itself you have 'the creature' which looks like a cross between a wildebeest, a mountain lion, and a chameleon. The first time it showed up was one of the best scares I've experienced in a while. My character's heart started beating and I wasn't sure why. I assumed it had something to do with the beast so I knelt in the grass and frantically looked around for it. Frustratingly I couldn't locate but could hear rustling in the underbrush as it crept closer, and closer. I made a sudden turn to my left before running and found myself staring directly into the eyes of the stalking panther-like beast. Luckily I was close to a shelter though I managed to slip and fall down a hillside, injuring myself, as I ran away like one of the Three Stooges. The beast stalks the island, and you're never safe if you're outside shelter, even at night. Especially at night. The creature adds just the perfect level of tension, weirdness, and horror to the game to make it a truly memorable and unique experience. The only areas of frustration with the game are the fact that there are bugs and parts that don't seem quite finished. When using the map at night, specifically when you are holding a lit torch, you can see nothing but a completely black screen which makes night time navigation practically impossible though, when you are only using a lighter you can see the map just fine. Carrying objects can be frustrating as you can only ever carry one of each type of item at a time, which makes collecting plants for basic medicine a bit repetitive. There's also the frustration of sliding around on the hills. While it can be a tremendous source of frustration I enjoy it's realism and enjoy the challenge though I recognize that it would be a major source of difficulty for some players. Highest commendations to a steam user by the name of DarkStarSword who has practically taken the game under his wing and has patched up several issues, eliminated many bugs, and improved the achievement progress. You can find his unofficial patch here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/223510/discussions/0/648812916771880184/My experience with Miasmata was superb. I've taken more screenshots of this game than any other in my library. I enjoyed every morning waking up in a new and unexplored section of the island, planning the day around what areas I needed to map and navigate, finding previously unknown shelters in all corners of the island, reading the notes and journal entries to discover the lore of this world, being caught in afternoon rain storms while triangulating my position, watching the sun set slowly in the distance as the calls of loons surround me, hearing my character's heartbeat hasten as I pushed deeper inland looking for new plants knowing the creature was close, and stumbling across a new shelter as night was falling, have encompassed a solid gaming experience that will be hard to duplicate.I give Miasmata my highest recommendations, especially for those that love a good survival, and exploration gaming experience.

												This is a great scavenger hunt game. The point of this game is to find 6 plants, make a cure and get off the island while avoiding ""The Creature"". Now this island is HUGE and you'll need to use the unique mapping system to find your way around or you'll be stupid lost. Once I got a hang of how you unlock the map it was alot of fun and felt very realistic. Character movement was something I also give a high score for. Running down a steep hill will most like end up as you sommersaulting down it instead and whatever you where carring to go flying. I also enjoyed all the different biomes. There are quite a few and each one is very impressive due to the wildlife sounds, critters running about and the huge sizes for tress and plants. Did i mention there are ants moving on the ground? My point is A LOT of little details went into making this game and for that i give this game a thumbs up!A bit of a downside for this game for me would have to be the story and threat from ""The Creature"". There are notes around the island that give some story but I felt they were a bit lacking. At the start of the game you get alot of story hints about whats going on around the island then they just dry up around half way through the game. It took me 12 hours to finish this game and for the first 8 hours I never once saw the creature. So it was just me wandering through the woods picking flowers and making my map. Yep slow and boring for most I think. Then near the end ""The Creature"" must have sensed I almost had my cure and was stalking me every 5 mins! This added 4 more hours to my gameplay trying to hide from it and if that wasn't working, running for my life, only to not see a cliff in front of me and I go flying, lose my plant, frantically try to look for it on the ground, oh snap here comes the cat! To say the least those last 4 hours where the best and it should have been that way most of the time.overall GREAT GAME!			"

												Although I generally don't prefer this type of games, I was interested in Miasmata first of all because of its title and then after seeing a few impressive screenshots from it. Miasmata is made by two guys, with an engine that they created themselves, thus everything about, around and in this game is 100% original. This for itself would be enough to praise this game, however in the essence of things (ie, gameplay, settings etc) there is so much more to admire. Despite the lack of action, there are a lots of things to keep you on your toes as your character is sick and needs to regularly seek plants and mix them up to make medicine. This is far more fascinating in-game than it may sound theoretically; looking for the plants means wandering around the beautiful and immersive environments, exploring the island, which is the setting of the game, from one corner to another; and we are not talking about a tiny island! There are endless coastlines, deep forests, steep cliffs, ravines, huge trees, dense vegetation, mystic ruins and swamps, all setting up a peaceful but at times bizzarrely hostile environment that, personally I found extremely captivating and charming. I mentioned lack of action a few lines above; however there is no lack of challenge. There is one enemy you have to avoid, and this enemy may or may not appear; once it does appear however it won't leave you easily in peace and it's far more fierce and lethal than it may look. The wonderful music adds a lot to the atmosphere and so do the realistic graphics and ambient sounds. There are a few things that I found a bit discouraging at certain times - like the character being unable to control his speed while going down a hill and ending up seriously wounded, feverish and having lost valuable stuff that he was carrying, or having to walk miles and miles to locate one plant that couldn't be found anywhere else while having no actual hint about where to look - but as it turned out they were not enough to make me lose hope about moving on. I loved this game and I have to say I felt sad when my mission was over and I had to end it.			"

												Miasmata is a game that will test your perseverance and patience. Initially, this came across as a tedious and boring - I wasn't crazy about the game after spending thirty minutes in it, so I put it down and played other games.Eventually, I came back to give it another try.After 9.1 hours of play, I can safely say that this game surprised me, and I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Exploring the island in search of remedies for Robert Hughes' ailments was astonishingly fun and rewarding; although, this game remains one that had room for improvement.Pros:- Fantastic exploration- Learning curve that makes succeeding that much more rewarding- Beautiful environment (most of the time)- Unexpectedly strong sense of isolation and survival- Very realistic- Beautiful music (during the few instances that you are able to hear it)- Touching plot- Being stalked by the creature was actually terrifyingCons:- Very awkward animations- Bizarre physics when falling down hills (falling down hills is not advised)- Lack of sound effects during synthesis- Pretty buggy (the two devs acknowledged that after five years developing Miasmata, they were exhausted and stopped fixing bugs)- Some mechanics may only be learned the hard way (either never explained or poorly explained)All in all, I will reiterate that I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Miasmata. I needed some time to warm up to it, but once I gave it that luxury, I became immersed in the world and my surroundings. The astonishing sense of isolation and survival kept me on my toes and kept me efficient throughout my in-game experience. It was a rewarding endeavor, and I would recommend this game as long as you are willing to give it the time it deserves.We just had to keep up, and we became the story.			"

												The amazing forest with a crippled runner and funny cat (Grade: 8.4/10)Personally, it's a game I wanted to play my entire life, a survival where the danger is nature itself (In my opinion it would be best without the funny looking tiger/puma/lince thingie). A nature the actually feels real and full of details. Animals react to the best and flee from it, enviroments have many details towards their construction, the cartography mechanic acctually makes a lot of sense and adds a nice challenge to the game (it's not easy to find your path in many cases), the walking mechanic makes dangerous exploring the enviroment without paying any attention to where your going, you may easily trip and fall (sometimes off a cliff).If your a fan of survivor games and, like me, dreamt about playing in a natural enviroment that acctually looks natural, it's a great buy. But it also have some downsides, for what I have experienced, the running machanics is a little buggy (or I'm just too clumsy to use it), mainly on cliffs. Many times I have been walking down or around a hill or cliff, suddenly the character speeds forward and ends up falling to the ground, and this have some severe consequences towards your avarage health, in general, whenever the guy get enough speed, you will fall and get hurt.In conclusion, a wonderfull game and you should be buying it, unless you're some action fan and likes things to happen oftenly, in this case, the game may not be to your liking, since it's all about patience and observation.

Its an escapists wet dream as well as a thinking mans game involving finding a cure for yourself and surviving agains the beast of the Island that you are trapped on. This is a really unique and nice game with some challenges such as having to create your own map by cartographing landmarks. all things considered I would give it a 9.3/10 if you are interested in expansive surreal getaways.

												I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this game before. This is one of my absolute favorite games. It totally surprised me how much I enjoyed this game.The key point to this game is exploration.You are sick. Your goal, is to find the cure to your illness. You'll travel to different waypoints, learn about the history of the island, and formulate the antidote.You are on your own to learn how to navigate the map. The only way you know where you are is by triangulating your location based off of various landmarks that you've discovered. Otherwise, the map is blank, and there is no ""you are here"" marker. Just you, your compass, and making note of landmarks. And that is one of the most genius aspects of the game. I love this game, and I definitely recommend this to anyone.			"

												Play Misamata if you like exploration and figuring things out for yourself.I applaud the creators for crafting an immersive experience that many faster-paced mainstream games lack.The focus here is on exploration, with elements of botany, map making and evading a prescence stalking you from the trees...If you can forgive some poor textures (especially close up and at long draw distances) you'll find a simple but satisfying experience, best played in a quiet room, late at night.

												You can tell in the first few minutes playing this game that the developers had a great time making it.  This game has an incredible amount of detail, and not just in graphics.  Movement mechanics, game menus, inventory system, researching, all done very well.  When I was a kid I loved running out into a forest by my house and getting lost, finding my way home.  This game brings that feeling back completely, except with added risks of being caught out at night or stumbling across the creature.  Also, the creature is the perfect touch to this game.  It's AI is really well built.  Lastly, the horror aspect of this game wasn't like jump scare horror, but rather more like worrisome horror, which I tolerate a lot better.  I will definately keep my eyes open for any other games created by Joe and Bob Johnson.  ~Jack			"

												A pretty interesting exploration/adventure/open world-like game. I will not be giving this a 10 point scale rating yet.Pros:1. Survival aspects are well done2. Environment is well made3. The idea behind the game is simple yet effective4. The monster is a nice touch and added a creepy aspectCons:1. Running momentum was a little obnoxious. (Can be tuned with a mod which can be found in the Miasmata discussions)2. The falling animation is annoying. (First time I fell from a small ledge down maybe 3 feet it played the tumbling animation. I thought I was glitching because I just kept turning. In the end, I found it a little unnecessary, especially from that short of height.)3. Cartography was also kind of annoying4. The slow paced exploration isnt really my style.This game is pretty cool overall. I personally like the game but not enough to merit lots of hours of gameplay from me. I recommend it because, despite the annoyances, I didn't feel it fair to give it the old ""thumbs down."" This is a really good survival/exploration game that, albeit slow-paced, is realistic and well thought out.P.S. I also recommend downloading the community patch!

												Amazing game.Even though you are alone the entire time, the island you are stranded on really feels alive.  This game has the best simulation of a natural environment that I have ever felt.  You have no HUD, instead having to rely on paying attention to visual and audio cues from your character and your journal.I spent 23 hours on my first playthrough just living in the world, trying to map out the island, and trying to collect all the plants on the island.  In those 23 hours, I was never bored and was frequently on the edge of my seat.  Speaking of mapping, that is one of my favourite things about the game.  Once you understand how it works, it becomes a game in itself.  If you are the obsessive compulsive type, you will love travelling all over the island to get every spot mapped out.Your goal in the game is to discover a cure for a plague that you and the outside world are stricken with.  You do this by researching plants and finding clues scattered over the island.  But really, I just had fun being on the island, it is an incredible simulation.  Even the clouds are amazing, you could just sit there watching them go by and trying to see pictures in them.I should probably mention the controls.  Some have said that your character moves like he's on ice skates and slides around everywhere.  I didn't have a problem with this, your character is sick and not some olympic athlete like in every other game out there.  Falling down a hill can be one of the most dangerous things in this game and I think that is a good thing.  You really are a normal person suffering from a sickness and you are always vulnerable in this game.This is a fairly slow paced game that requires you to pay attention to your character and surroundings in a different way than any other and I think that makes it well worth playing.Oh, and make sure you download the community patch, I didn't play without it but it sounds like it makes a huge difference.  I experienced a couple of crashes even with the community patch but they weren't a big deal.			"

												This game opens with a very interesting premise, you have a disease and you must cure yourself.  The landmass you find yourself on has lots of materials to turn into possible cures, but you need to discover it all yourself.Gameplay: 7 / 10The crafting mechanic is slightly obtuse, but is somewhat novel in combining plants and other found ingredients together to create healing and other potions.  The map for this game is very unique, you don't get an auto-map like most games, you have to discover and then plot your points using 3 waypoints, so that you can use cartography to map where precisely something is on the map.  It does this for you of course, but it is an interesting and new take on in-game maps.  The fighting mechanic is sorely lacking though.  When you finally come upon your first fight, you will most likely die, and then wonder how you are supposed to prevent yourself from dying.  The game gives you no help here, and largely I guess you are supposed to just run and hide, although rocks and other refuse can help you avoid animals.Graphics: 5 / 10Nothing fancy here, the environment is much like many other games, there is a lot of detail in the chemical lab and the grass looks neat.  But nothing here wowed me beyond the panoramic views you can see from vantage points.Sound: 5 / 10Nothing fancy here, the music doesn't take away from the experience and largely gives you a nice time.Overall: 6 / 10I enjoyed playing the game until animals started going after me, at that point I lost interest because I didn't know the game even had combat, was woefully unprepared and just died.  Overall though it was a positive experience until I died.			"

												Strangely, I never wrote a review during or after my time playing. I played this game a long time ago. I was absoloutely immersed in it.When I think back to playing this game I cant remember anything beyond the bezels of my monitor. I was just in the game and It acheives this incredible level of immersion if you as the player play with it. Its extremely hard to find your barings on the island. And thats what the game is all about. If you let it, Miasmata will make a more experienced orienteer in real life situations because so much of your spatial memory has to be engaged while you play. Very unlike anything I have ever come across since or before. Absoloutely loved it.			"

												I had a fantastic time playing this game.  Something new that hasn't really been done before.  While this is not action packed or radically profound, this game is peaceful (for the most part) and definately makes you thinkand work with your mind.  I loved the cartography and the movement mechanics as well as medicines etc.  Everything seemed to work and function very well a true testament to great game design and good goal setting.			"

												Its an interesting game but definitely not without some concerns that let the game down.The ideas is good and at the start its quite entertaining, but after a few hours of wandering around trying to figure out what your meant to be doing it get a little tedious.Our lead character stumbles around lost, so weak he can't carry more than three flowers and any hill or bump greater than 10degrees will sent him into a tail spin.He can only carry one item like a knife or axe, at a time and half the time he'll randomly drop it or throw it away anyway.  No big deal really because they don't seem to be of any use bsides waving around when the bunyip monkey monster comes around. You can't actually attack anthing.The biggest let downs IMO is the issues with the day night cycles and the so called mapping.  Both these things in particular turn a slow paced novel game into a boring frustrating slow paced game.It seems to be night for a far greater time than day, and in the dark you are literally in total blackness. Even using torches etc are near useless so the only thing you can do is wait. And wait and wait and wait, until daylight slowly comes.  Even during the day, it can all of a sudden become near total darkness because its getting cloudy, or its an eclipse or whatever reason.At night you occasionaly run into the bunyip monkey monster that come at you, sends your heart rate faster and faster and most of the time you just run and hope! I get the feeling this ""monster"" was put in as a last minute item to try and add some sense of fear. You can't seem to kill it or anything and seems out of place, especially considering theres no other living creatures besides some bugs and birds in the distance. The mapping system is the second let down.  its a good idea where you need to triangulate points from known landmarks etc but is a long, tedious and frustrating affair. 90 percent of the game is simply trying to work out where you are and where your going. Trying to make a map, 1 small section at a time. The game isn't all bad as such, but is definitely not suited for everybody. I quite enjoyed it at the start and the collection of plants etc to make medicine etc is a neat idea. Unfortunately that is all it has. Besides drinking, and taking medicine, then thats it for gneral survival. You don't have to eat, or hunt, or build shelters.  Even sleep is just a way to speed through the night if your lucky enough to be near a bed when night falls, and to save your game.Its the sort of game where every now and then I'll probably have a bit of a tinker with it, but its definately not the sort of game I'd recomend to anyone looking for thrills, excitement and adventure etc.			"

												Tried to get up to a high hill to observe my surroundings but I couldn't control my character as he charged forward and went barrelling down it, a blur of foliage and rocks went by as I eventually crashed into the ocean and almost drowned, dragged myself back to land and caught a fever before coming head on with The Creature, tried to outmaneveur it but it's persistent as hell and so in a last ditch attempt I turned tail and ran for the nearest hut while it ran around the hut at breakneck pace waiting for me to step one foot out. 10/10			"

												I rate the game Miasmata 3.5/5. Pretty good..if you have a lot of patience and enjoy games which feature fairly quiet, peaceful natural surroundings.This, being the second game in which I've played as a person who is ill (The first being Far Cry 2) is a slow-paced, generally peaceful, first person perspective survival game wherein you must maneuver your weakened, occasionally feverish character around a rugged series of tropical and subtropical islands to find various fungi and flowers and then bring them back to various scattered laboratories to find out what properties they have in an ongoing attempt to get yourself cured. If you walk too fast or (unlike in Skyrim) walk down a hill which is too steep you may end up running and then falling which will decrease your health, may cause your fever to worsen (because you have over-exerted yourself I guess) and you will drop everything you are carrying and may not be able to easily find it again. Also, in this game your character can get exhausted, dehydrated and, if you make him swim for too long, may even drown. Going for a long time without sleep will also weaken your health. Standing around in the beautifully rendered tropical rain however has no effect on your health whatsoever. You never seem to have to eat anything though if you did have to, the game probably would have taken forever to finish.This game is fairly long and requires great patience as simply making your character walk down a hill without falling down can be a challenge in itself. To put it another way, trying to get around in this game is probably a lot like being really old (except you can move more quickly than the elderly). If that wasn't enough of a challenge already, there are carnivorous creatures (they aren't creepy though as they look a lot like panthers with horns glued onto their heads and odd, hand-like feet) on the island which occasionally show up to hunt you. I don't think the creature was actually one but maybe several solitary creatures which live on the island (like mountain lions or something). But take heart, as you find cures for yourself your condition improves and with it, your ability to more easily move around the islands.The game's plot does have some loose threads. You can find old journal entries which suggest that one of the island's inhabitants went crazy and, given the way the corpses around the island apparently died (with a knife stuck into each them). However this murderer never materializes. I guess he ran off into the jungle and killed himself...or maybe he somehow was transformed one of the cat-creatures which occasionally stalks you to the loud sound of your beating heartbeat. There are also two distinct types of ruins in the island setting of this game but nothing can be found out about either group who built the ruins. Indeed, the ruins exist primarily to serve as mere landmarks to help mapping the islands easier. This game often hints at a more complex and detailed plot the sum-total explanation of which is frustratingly not to be found anywhere in this game. Still this game in all its interest and unusual gameplay and beauty is amazing for when we consider it appears to have been put together by just two people (brothers I think) over the course of what I heard was four years.Now that you know the gist of what Miasmata is, it's time to break down what the pros and cons of this game are.Good things about this game:+This game is often remarkably beautiful, particularly if you enjoy the natural beauties which this world has to offer. The tropical and sub-tropical island setting has lots of wonderful sunsets, trees and nifty rays of light filtering through the trees. The colors are vibrant and the reflections off of water are pretty also. The rain effect was particularly well done and better by far than the awful rain effect in the 2010 version of Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit. The rain in Miasmata was wonderful and other game developers should take a look at how the rain was done here. That said, the overall graphical detail of this game is rather mediocre.+This game relies heavily on the natural sounds of the world with sparse and almost entirely instrumental music playing only very rarely. The sounds are done very well except in one situation.+Overall this game was rewarding and interesting through to the end. A true and beautiful work of art. While not the most moving or emotional game ever it was definitely fun and the sense of mystery never went away (because unfortunately, many things were never fully explained). By the time I was done with the game I was ready for it to be over and so it lasted just the right length of time for me to feel fulfilled and refreshed by this game's unusual first person perspective survival concept. This game was a true adventure.Mediocre things about this game:+/-The graphics do tend to be simple. Your limbs are fairly blocky. Indeed, most objects tend to be fairly blocky when viewed up-close. The clouds are often curiously tinged with brown and when combined with the intermittent atmospheric haze and the fact that the fog in this game looks a lot more like smoke it accidentally feels as though the islands are supposed to be on fire somehow. The islands you are wandering around in are not supposed to be on fire but it often sure does look as though they must be.+/-The carnivorous creatures can, from some angles, almost look cute due to their cat-like appearance. You are clearly supposed to find them terrifying but they aren't. They just seem more like some sort of weirdly mutated, previously unknown species of jungle cat which sees you as potential prey. At the same time though, this lends an added air of realism to the environment.+/- Finding the plants you need to concoct a cure is very difficult and made even more difficult by the presence of the creature hunting you whenever you are near a plant that you absolutely need to grab.+/-You can only save your game at certain geographic locations but these locations are so numerous that saving my game was never much of a problem.Bad things about this game:-The controls are definitely difficult. It often feels, especially early on that your character must be just learning how to use roller skates which have somehow become permanently attached to his feet. This roller skate feeling never really left either but as I progressed through the game I found myself learning how to handle the character better, even putting him into controlled slides occasionally to get down slopes more quickly. Some of the other controls (picking stuff up with your right hand without dropping stuff in your left hand for example) were also a bit clunky.-The one time when the sound is not good is when a carnivorous creature is hunting you and your heartbeat sounds WAY TOO LOUDLY in your ears. This sound didn't increase my sense of tension. It merely increased my sense of irritation. I often wanted to avoid the creatures not so much because they were scary but because i didn't want the loud heartbeat sound to intrude on the quiet ambience of the game more than it had to.-Once you have a carnivorous cat creature's attention it is VERY HARD to hide and get it to go elsewhere. Sometimes I would hide and it would just wait forever for me to come out even though it couldn't see me.-I wish this game had more scary moments or had capitalized more on the numerous scary moments it was sort of trying to have. I wonder what this game would have been had it been somehow done with the far more beautiful game engine used in Far Cry 3 somehow. The graphics often seemed a bit dated. Still, Far Cry 3 was made by a team of people which formed a list longer than my arms and Miasmata is an amazing achievement for what seems to have been just 2 people.			"

												Just.... ♥♥♥♥.Miasmata is one of the games that I wanted to play ever since release but I just kept on waiting and waiting for a sale, and when it was on sale, I still didn't pick it up since I was skeptical and bought other games instead... But when I finally did buy it... It completely blew my mind. Miasmata is one of my favorite indie games of all time and shows that you can make a different game with a low budget without vomiting some ""philosophical"" nonsense on it to make it seem legit. The game is ridiculously atmospheric and immersive and it completely sucks you in. The only ""downside"" is that it's a one time experience. Once you finish the game, even if you're into achievements hunting, there isn't much to return to. The appeal of the game is exploration and once the island is explored, well, yeah. But still, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes immersive games based on exploration.9/10. Unforgettable experience.			"

												I'm not recommending this game because it has problems that would make your experience with it bad. But otherwise the concept is what drew me into getting it.It's an interesting idea for a game about discovering a cure to your survival by finding plants on an island, but was not executed very well with questionable game design with it's movement and terrain system which either controls like a fudging starship or a fatty mcfat fat midget coming out of cryo sleep, lack of a real inventory to store plants, and of course causing motion sickness for those who are suseceptible to it like me. There are other problems but the former are the ones that come to mind. Also it feels very unoptimized since I have trouble streaming it because obs had trouble locating it.If you get motion sickness then I highly urge you to avoid this game.I only got it on sale and that really should be the only time you should buy to try the game out, full price and I would have wanted a refund.also your character irritates me whenever you discover something and the dumbass has to point it out for you. Like 'I know I just made something/found something'			"

												Miasmata provides a unique survival and exploration experience. You play as an ill man so you can hardly run or swim, but that only adds to the experience.What is awesome:-survival depends largely on preparation-using triangulation to create map-you can get lost (and feel it too)-night is dark-beautiful locations-sounds of nature increase immersionWhat could have been better:-laboratory has only one slot for synthesized drugs (be careful not to ""overwrite"" it)I recommend this game to people who can appreciate exploration.

It is difficult to describe how it makes you feel so powerless at the beginning and how that changes so much as you get lay of the land and become stronger. An interesting but hidden story keeps it interesting throughout also. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

Maismata - a game reviewExperienceThis, I feel, is the most important part and the best reason for playing this game. The looks, your movements, the sounds, the story and the mechanics all work together to make this an interesting and immersive experience. You feel that the character, you, isn't doing well, that you're often exhausted and have to fight both the exotic environment as well as your illness. You huff and puff at any exertion, thirst and untreated fevers impair your vision and coordination, falls will often disorient you and even finding out just where you are is something of a chore. Day-to-day survival is work here, giving you a sense of vulnerability, compounded by the fear of the Creature.I'll give each of these a closer look below. LooksThis is a very good-looking game, most of the time. There are a few graphic oddnesses, like the arms and hands that, while important and immersive can't help looking a little awkward at times. Texture pop-in and the sometimes very 'grainy' water are easily forgivable sins, seeing that most everything else works very well. Special mention should be made of the day and night cycle. Not only do dawns and sunsets look fantastic, as do the rays of sunlight filtered through the trees, they also actually work. Looking toward a brighter light, like the sun or a torch, will make dark areas even darker and more difficult to navigate. Nights are very dark indeed, there being nothing more than the moon and stars to light your way. Your lighter is a decent emergency light and burning twigs or a torch will properly light up your immediate area, helping you find your way to some sort of shelter.MovementI suspect that many will find moving around in this game to be an awkward business, much unlike the fluid movements in other First Person games. Moving forwards is generally fine but try any looking-left-while-strafing-right to look around while moving or a very quick turn and you're in for a surprise. It would seem that Robert can't run sideways as fast as he can run forwards. This shouldn't be the shock it is, since most people can't. You also have momentum to contend with - running downhill can be a very bad idea and may easily run you right over a ledge into a nasty fall. Climbing hills is a slow to laborious process which is further influenced by your current state. Thirst and fever will make you weaker and slower, making progress more difficult.If all this sounds awkward and off-putting, you can rest assured that there are good and design-conscious reasons behind every seeming impediment.SoundThe soundscape of Miasmata is fairly minimal but well implemented. There are near-constant ambient noises, such as wind, rustles, trickling or rushing water, bird-calls, crashing waves or rain, but next to no score. There's music in the game, to be sure, but it's held back to mark certain locations or the odd special moment.  Your footfalls have their own sounds, in keeping with whatever surface you're on, which is a nice touch. Loose rocks and crackling twigs could have a few more samples though, being a bit repetetive.MechanicsA brief look at some of the different ways things are done in the game.Medicines are ""synthesized"" in the labs around the Island, using one or two plants for each new type. Each plant first has to be found and examined. How to do this is clearly explained in the first few notes you find and works well. The process does get repetetive but the animations can be interrupted. A few more different animations would be nice to have. Notes scattered around the island will tell you where to look for crucial elements and thus give you a good incentive to travel all over the place.Cartography is a large and important feature in the game. You have precious little idea of where you are, most of the time, since you have to 'draw' the map on your own. This is accomplished by triangulating your current position, using your compass and known landmarks. Distant and unknown landmarks can be triangulated by moving between two known positions and marking them on the map. Much like in real life. Well implemented, with a chance of a minor 'exploit' as a handy shortcut.Time does flow here, as shown by your watch and the well made day/night-cycle. This gives you a sense of urgency, since being caught out after dark has the very real consequense of easily losing your way to that shelter and bed. Unfortunately, the sense of urgency is diminished by the fact that you don't see a definite progression of your illness, that you can stay alive on water and medicine indefinitely.The Creature is a somewhat mysterious and certainly threatening presence on the island. It can turn up at nearly any time and will likely send chills down your spine as you hear the sudden thump of your own heartbeat, reminding you of your precarious situation. There are techniques and medicinal boosts that can help you avoid being found, which is a good thing, seeing as you're in no shape to fight this beast. Well done, overall, but it does occasionally get stuck in a loop, which can be annoying.StoryI intentionally left this for last, since it's in the manual and of litte importance. When starting the game, you're placed in the shoes of Robert Hughes, a plague-stricken scientist, stranded on an unknown island, in search of a cure. Precisely why a name is mentioned is something of a mystery, since the who of you is of utter insignificance to anything that happens in the game. (Here the developers missed a chance to involve female players a little more.) The more imortant words are 'stranded', made evident by your bloody hands and the wrecked boat beside you and 'plague-stricken', as you'll notice shortly.Fever, thirst, brutally murdered scientists, mysterious messages, baffling notes, helpful discoveries, rain, darkness, swamps, glorious sunsets, coluorful fungi and more plants than you can shake a burning twig at will help and hinder and baffle you on your journey. Your goal, ultimately, is to find the cure and escape this island. The cure is to be found among the rich flora of the island, which you will research, annotate and cook up various medicines from. Some will just be a temporary stay of your recurring fevers and some will give you more lasting effects. To help your progress, you'll find the notes of the expedition scattered around in their huts and tents.Escaping the island, alive, will not be easy.There are some missed opportunities for exposition and deepening the story, such as conspiracies or cover-ups that are just hinted at, the obvious mystery of the murders which could be better developed and the odd and disconcerting Creature.RecommendationAll in all, I found this to be a very rewarding exerience. I thoroughly enjoyed the lush environments of the island, the often beautiful vistas opening up in front of me as I clear the crest of a hill, the deep dark of the nights and the heart-pounding fear of being found by the Creature. I even liked the work of mapping my progress around the island, since it added both realism and a feeling of accomplishment set against the helplessness of being lost.Kudos and a hearty 'Well done!' to the brothers of IonFX.

												I got a good 12 hours of exploration and adventure!Pros :-A truly beautiful game. Worth it just to get lost in it.-Once you get used to movement, it actually becomes an extra challenge just to move up and down slopes. Its quite fun!-I would get giddy with excitement whenever I'd discover a new plant and would hurry back to the lab to check it out!-Tons of different drugs to craft and use-The creature won't appear often, but when the character's heart starts pumping, yours will too!-The creature acts in a believable way! There are several different ways to deal with it... some ending with your death.-After trekking in the wilderness, you truly get a feeling of satisfaction when you discover an outpost.-You are completely free to explore at your leasure in any direction. The island is also massive!-The cartography system is awesome. Later in the game I had a lot of fun mapping out the entire island.-When night falls it gets very dark... which is very scary. Add to it the monster on the prowl and you have a bit of horror.Cons-Character is a bit too prone to falling and tripping down slight hills. It gets annoying/frustrating.-Some areas won't be of much use later on -  more quantity over quality (vast areas with just trees, useless ruins, etc)-Ruins are a bit of a dissapointment : there are no secrets nor lore to it. Who built them? You won't know.-There is a bit of a tease with ''Psychotic episodes'' and ''hallucinations'' being mentioned in a paper, but it doesn't happen. If you let the fever worsen you just die.-Survival is unrealistically easy - no need to hunt nor eat, and resting in a shoddy cot in a tent will cure you of heavy fever. Taking pills also instantly makes you better. I kinda wish it worked like that IRL.-The ending is pretty sad and disappointing. Didn't feel like my efforts payed off. All in all, I'd say the pro far outweigh the cons. It is very impressive that two guys made this game from scratch!If you like exploration, discovery, ambiance, science with only a little bit of scare, then you will really enjoy this one.Wholeheartedly recommend.

												An awesome little indie gem, parrticularly when you consider the whole thing was done by a team of two...brothers, in fact.  Pushed me to keep exploring and see what was behind that next hill.  And the approaching night gave me a real sense of anxiety as I searched for some safe place to spend the night. Although Miasamta is considered a ""walking simulator"",  I found it to be a solid stealth and exploration game.  Get it on sale during one of the many Steam sales events and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Miasmata is a great idea with a somewhat flawed execution. You're a scientist on an island looking for a cure. To find this cure you have to find plants and create potions, while triangulating landmarks to create your own map of the island. The island is huge and you're free to go wherever you want, as long as you can keep yourself alive. You have to be careful that you don't dehydrate, drown, get killed by a creature (I haven't encountered it myself yet) or that you take your medicine in time. The game is played from a first person perspective, which actually works quite alright, but walking and running (and especially stopping/slowing down) can be awkward and clumsy. It tries to be realistic by slowing down your character when climbing up the hills or speeding up when you're heading downwards. Most of the times it seems random and I've lost count of how many times I've fallen.You're also allowed to carry a maximum of 3 different plants at the same time, and you can't carry more than one of the same plant. So most of the times you have to make multiple trips. However, there are cabins scattered across the island. These cabins allow you to transfer your plants between any of them, which helps, but limiting the amount of plants you can carry is still a bit frustrating. On the other hand, it does create a certain tension so I guess there's something to be said for it. Especially traveling when it's dark is not recommended, because it can get pitchblack without any torches. And then there's this creature I keep hearing about...So, I'm having some mixed emotions here. I guess I shall be taking my journal and compass, and enter the world once more to see if my opinion changes for the better... or for the worse.[Rating: 73/100]			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Miasmata is an absolute gem of an indie game. I have been following this game for quite a while, and now I can finally say I own it. Created by just two people from IonFX, the game does deliver on what it is set out to be. It is not a horror game, it is a survival exploration game where you explore an island, known only to you as EdenYou play Robert Hughes, a man who was exiled and is stricken with plague. You have to find three agents; Agent X, Agent Y and Agent Z to form the cure to cure your strickened fever. You have to travel across the huge map of Eden and find specific plants and fungi to form the basic components to make the cure. However, you are not alone. There is a creature that is watching you and hunting you down in the deep dense forests of the dangerous island of EdenOverall, the game is fantastic. The game does not hold you're hand at all. No checkpoints, no objectives, nothing. It just throws you in and you have to discover what the island holds yourself. Although the game's graphics aren't the best, they do deliver and you can play this game on any piece of modern hardware Although frequent pop ups of the environment do ruin a bit the feel for the game, the game's graphics deliver. The music, what little there is, is very good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. However, the game heavily relies on sound effects and yes, the game does deliver this perfectly. If you want a true experience, play the game with headphonesAs said before, the game does not hold your hand. You have to discover the island for yourself, hence, the game can get boring and sometimes too difficult as the map system, which uses cartography, is a bit annoying and frustrating, especially when it comes to unknown locations. If you hadn't updated your map or found letters and documents that update you're map, then you will be a sitting duck and lost completely. Although the game does offer a compass to help, which in some cases, it does. Sometimes, you will just be lost for hours. For me personally to find the closest campsite without the use of the map, it took me roughly an hour. The map is huge for this gameThe gameplay, although simple, all you have to do is explore the island and collect plants and fungi which then get added to your journal. Once you've found a campsite which has an experimentation table, you can experiment with the collected items to form basic or advanced medicine or agents for the cureAs mentioned previously, the main protagonist, Robert is stricken with plague and fever. Hence, he isn't that strong, and though I appreciate the people at IonFX for making it realistic, it does get quite annoying. When you run too much, he breathes too heavily which in turn can get annoying and can be a lure for the creature. You can't climb that high, hence he falls back when its too high, again, annoying and can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when trying to run away from the creature and he falls too suddenly making you go into a fall animation which spins the camera like nobody's business making you lose the items you had, which in turn is annoying and a pain when trying to run away from the blasted creature. Also, you can only swim a certain amount, otherwise, thanks to his plague infested body, he will start to drown and die. Very annoyingThe creature, what a wonderful yet terrifying creature. The creature roams the island in search for you and will hunt you down. The only way you can avoid the creature is either by hiding or by distracting it. You cannot outrun it, its quicker than you and with the annoyance of your bloody plague, you can't get too far. The creature is scary and makes your heart pump a few times when you encounter it. But, the more and more you encounter it, especially when you have the last few ingredients of the cure, the more and more, the creature becomes annoying and a chore to find a place and hide. Don't get me wrong, the creature was a brilliant addition to the game, but good god can it get boring and frustrating. At first, before you find a specific drug, the only way you will only be notified if the creature is nearby is by the beating sound of Robert's heart. The stronger it gets, the closer the creature isOnce you have found a specific drug, the game will provide you with an indicator whilst crouched which will show a HUD system in which when white, the creature can't see you and red when it can see you. The stealth mechanic is okay, but not the best. Sometimes, when you're hiding and the HUD system says you're okay, the creaure can still see you and sometimes when the creature is really close to you and you can tell that it's seeing you, it ignores you completely. Also sometimes, the HUD system and sound effect did not work which made it even more frustratingIf you die by, fever, dehydration, drowning or killed by the creature. If you haven't recently saved, you're stuck. There is no quick save functionality and no checkpoints, the only way you can save is either by lighting a candle or lamp, or by sleeping which saves the game and these can only be found in campsitesThe game does offer a day and night cycle as well as a weather system, great additions to the game. However, at night, if you do not have a source of light, good luck looking where you are going as the night becomes pitch black and very scary. Robert only seems to drink water, no food, which does lose a bit of the realismThe game is fantastic, but is plagued with bugs, glitches and crashes. The amount of times the game crashed on me, I just wanted to give up. Sometimes during the menu, sometimes while playing. The game would just simply crash. Bugs and glitches too are annoying, sometimes Robert would get stuck on the environment as well as other minor bugsI wish the game would have fixed these issues. Also, the game does encounter some stuttering when trying to load some music or a piece of the environment, even sometimes crashing the game in the process...Miasmata is a fantastic game and a true indie gem, if only IonFX would have fixed some of the problems that the game had and gave some help to its player base, then this game would of been ten times better than what it is. But as it stands, the story is interesting, the graphics are good, music and sound effects well produced. Miasmata is one of those games you should pick, even if it is just for a couple of hours! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												By far, one of the best and most intriguing survival games out there. It does not hold your hand at any time, so do not expect a stroll in the park.In fact, it is one of the very few survival games I played till the end.On the down side, graphics are not good (not that I mind it) and the control is... slippery.But I recommend for those who want a harsh survival game and compelling world/storyline,			"

												The idea of exploring a mysterious island sounded very appealing on paper, but in practice it makes for a very boring game. If the world was beautifully detailed like Skyrim and had more interaction with the enviroment then Miasmata might have held my attention for longer but I really struggled to give this a go.Felt like a big empty world. When you get to an early point where your vision goes blurry for a long time till you figure out how to heal yourself I felt nauseated and realised that the even 2 hours in I could only see more of the same ahead.Graphics engine is fairly basic along with the sound and the clues are not straight forward (atleast not for me) making the whole experience very forgettable.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												As my first Greenlight purchase, Miasmata left me speechless, really.Miasmata brings a new dimension to Adventure/Exploration games. It gathers true exploration, with bits of survival, and a unique way to draw your map progressively as you explore the massive island (seriously, it takes hours just to go round it) while randomly harassed by a mysterious monster.The sensation to be lost becomes a true reality. The feeling that everything around you looks the same, and that you can't distinguish the North from the South. Or the stressful moment when you see the sky getting darker, meaning you desperately need to find a tent or a cabin.The graphics are splendid, but make sure you have a decent computer, for the game is being pretty demanding. And what about those unforgettable light effects? They are astounding. Like, when you can't see any single thing at night, or when you're dazzled by the morning sun.If you want to live a real survival experience and explore beautiful forsaken places, just buy it!			"

												Took me a little while to understand the mapping part of the game. You basically have to identify at least two man made structures (Building, statue, beacon) to pinpoint where you are on the map then find other unknown structures that are also in view and they then become known. You can now use those identified structures as map elements. Don't wander too far, try to keep these map markers in view and keep checking the map to add more pieces to it.The concoctions you can make are temporary ones or permanent ones. You can carry only one of each temporary type so don't bother making two basic medicines, just make one basic and one enhanced. The weapons seem practically useless so far, there is a beast that stalks you, attacking with knife or axe doesn't seem to bother it at all. Ducking into cover doesn't seem to help much but getting behind hard cover like a tree does.You have to drink quite often but fresh water is plentiful, yet in seven game days I haven't eaten anything so the finds of bananas and apples lying around don't seem to matter.Climbing even the gentlest of slopes can be difficult and it is super easy to go tumbling off and falling. Try hitting reverse when sliding down a hill to slow your descent, that helps. Save by lighting anything (beacon, candle, fire, lantern) or by sleeping and keep an eye on the time, right mouse button brings up a compass and wrist watch, when it gets dark...it gets REALLY dark! You can get lost very quickly at night or go falling off a cliff, we forget living as we do in towns and cities that street lighting however dim is still there, in this game there's you holding a piddling little lighter unless you find brush to use as a torch until it fizzles out a minute later.I am enjoying it immensely, yes it feels a little clumsy at times and low budget but the night time without a torch and no where near a camp confusion is very real, and then there's the beast tracking you, when you see it coming for you and you run, panic just sets in, fighting it doesn't do anything, just have to run or hide.

												If you love filling in blank spaces on a map, scavenger-hunting map icons, humping the spacebar to climb hills... this is your game.It won't dazzle you with a lot of different mechanics, but what it does provide is unique. As far as I (suburban dude) can tell, it's an eye-opening wilderness hiking simulator, where you experientially learn how it's a seriously bad idea to set off on a trip without lots of daylight, a clear goal, a good map, and plenty of water.To be clear: the game doesn't lecture you about survival and navigation. Instead you get certain reflexes drilled into you after you stay out too late, run out of daylight, get lost and dehydrated, fall down a hill, stumble into a lake and drown. Since you can only save your game at certain locations, well, drowning after a day-long expedition is bad.The orienteering and cartography mechanics are just plain neat (and well-described elsewhere). The game provides a layer of goals and some mysterious opposition to deal with, but those aspects just add context to the exploration. It's nicely atmospheric and very zen at times. And occasionally scary.Keep in mind that this is an ""indie game by 2 guys"", but more often than not it's a better-designed package than you might expect from that. It's still a niche-audience thing, but outstanding if you're in that audience.			"

												Paranoia: The Game. Very spooky.Let me describe my experience to you fellows:I hear rumours that The Creature begins stalking after 1 hour of gameplay has passed.1 hours passes, I'm extremely jumpy now. Every noise freaks me out. 2 more hours pass. No sign of The Creature. I decide that hey, maybe I should stop worrying about The Creature.I head inland, climb a hill, all is good. Then I hear footsteps out of sync with my own. I think: ""Oh, must be the game bugging out again, haha""Then I hear a roar. I scream at the top of my lungs and book it to the nearest outpost.The Creature catches up almost immediately and swats me around like a ragdoll, killing me.Overall a wonderful experience so far, and definitely not what I expected from this game. Is it worth the money?Absolutely. A 10/10 game in my book.(Also, unless absolute darkness is your thing, don't stay outside at night...)			"

												Miasmata is, in essence, a game of exploration; moreover, an exploration simulator. The devs went to great lengths to rethink gaming fundamentals such as mapping, stealth, even basic movement. These changes may spook a lot of players, but those that let go of traditional gaming conventions will discover a rich new genre of gaming.At the core of this game is the mapping system. Left to map out the environment yourself with a compass and triangulation, I often tell people interested in this game that it is a cartography simulator. While some find this method of mapping tedious, it brought about something both rare in games, and exciting: getting lost. I was often faced with decisions regarding how far to explore because getting lost sucked. The flip side was that finding your way back to someplace familiar provided an awesome feeling of accomplishment! Stealth comes into play when faced with an undefeatible predator. This mechanic was a rush. You have no indicator of where the predator is except that when it is near, your heart beats. Many hide now/ search later moments. Running like hell works often for a rush of adrenaline. Rushing towards a shack lit in candlelight while the beast is at your heels, then crouching in a corner hoping not to be noticed as you peek your head up to see if it's gone was a common thrill for me in this game.The movement has been criticized by a few (at least), but I really enjoyed the dev's take on it. Think: momentum.Your character starts off relatively weak, so often times you are left to risk walking down a steep looking hill or trying to rush up one. Walking down presents you with having to press the back button as a way to balance/ control your descent. Ascending requires taking a bit of a run to push your way up. Misjudging either causes a tumble which drops your items in hand and a big chance at getting a fever. Both a bit of a hassle. Mostly, this doesn't pose much of a problem, however when chased by the predator I found it exciting as hell. Split moment decisions risking death or losing that plant that took a bit to find provided a truly unique gaming experience.Wrap up: 14 y.o. into COD and hoping to play an indie FarCry? Pass. Enjoy discovery and exploration of both the gaming enviroment and new conventions? BUY NOW.CYA			"

												Miasmata is one of the more unique and engaging survival games I've encountered. The game pits you as a plague-striken botanist, exiled to a remote island where other unfortunate scientists have also been sent to discover a cure. You must continue their research in hope to escape the island alive.The gameplay pits you exploring the island to search for and study the local plant life in hopes of synthesizing an antidote. The island is lush with plants, wildlife, and significant landmarks. Research stations and outposts are scattered throughout the island, some containing clues, notes, and other pieces of information to aid your quest.Cautious travel throughout the land is imperative as darkness unfolds. The rolling hills can be unforgiving in your weakened state causing momentum to send you over the edge. Mapping is essential to your travel and the use of triangulation to pinpoint your location not only proves innovative, but really makes the overall gameplay feel like a genuine survival game. But don't linger around too long out in the darkness as a creature lurks in the distance watching your every move, thwarting your efforts to gather the necessary ingredients to improve your health.The graphics are pretty impressive; the different and distinct landscapes are breathtaking, and the shadowing as day transitions to night and back to day is amazing. The games includes fabulous musical scores as well. Overall, the game is really a unique experience. I'm still in awe that it was developed by only two individuals.			"

												Please do not let the technical flaws of this game (of which there are plenty) turn you away from it. If you're the kind of person who can allow yourself to get completely immersed into a virtual world, look past those flaws and give this world a try.Yes, there are issues. The uphill/downhill momentum can at times feel a bit... overzealous. Graphical fidelity is all over the place - while the general environment and landscape looks beautiful from afar, certain ugly details are exposed given a close-up. Several Steam Achievements are broken. You should probably avoid Alt+Tabbing the game due to the dreaded ""One Moment Please..."" problem. Performance issues can bring the entire world to a complete standstill for several seconds at a time, and you'll eventually realize that the only thing that ""no loading screens"" really means is that loading can get you killed. As the game was made from scratch by a pair of brothers, this sort of stuff is to be expected. There is an unofficial community patch out there (along with other helpful game utilities), and I'd recommend that you check that out before taking things too far.But to be perfectly honest, since I decided to give this game another try after a near-year-long hiatus taken shortly after the intro, I'm thankful that I didn't pass it up. As one of those aforementioned people who can immerse themselves in games quite easily, I found a tension in this game that few other games have ever made me feel. That moment when I'm standing on the porch of my safehouse, barren map in-hand, building up the courage to take my first step into the unknown. That moment when I've got my headphones cranked up, and I'm crouch-walking through the forest, eyes peeled, my heart stopping at the crunch of every twig. That moment when all hell has broken loose and I've gone into a full-on panic-sprint, knowing that my only chance at survival is to put myself at the complete mercy of the terrain and just run. Those moments are gaming gold.Miasmata has a bit of a learning curve; anybody who has played it can attest to that. For all of the things that this game can give to you, there are just as many things that it will leave you to take for yourself. You'll struggle with movement. You'll struggle with cartography. You'll leave the house a bit too late one night and find yourself completely lost, hopeless, and staring death in the face. But give this game your time and your effort, and it will give you a completely unreplicated experience in return.Save early, save often. Stay alert, stay alive. You've been warned!			"

												I love to have the freedom to explore in games and that's where Miasmata delivers. It's actually the entire game. You wake up on a beach and have to roam the landscape, searching for botanical ingredients to a plague cure and piecing together the story of a group of researchers who recently occupied the area.The really great bit to the game is how a handful of minor obstacles shape the experience. Your character starts the game sick, so he's not able to run for long without getting winded, climb steep slopes, or swim more the a few feet in deep water. If you try to push him harder, he'll just get sicker. When he starts to run a fever, he needs medicine or bedrest or it gets slowly worse until he collapses. When you're not as sick, it's still very easy to get lost. There's a map, but you have to update it by triangulating your location from known landmarks. On top of all that, there's a mysterious creature on the island that occasionally harrasses you. All the obstacles are pretty easy to overcome or avoid, but when you make one mistake, it usually snowballs, culminating in a frenzied attempt to get to safety.The story is very minimal and based mostly on found notes, but it's just enough to add to the mood while letting the experience be your own. Miasmata has a very lonely beauty to it and few limits that seem artificial.  Almost the entire experience is just you stumbling through the woods, but it still manages to be compelling.			"

You really want to explore the island just to see how far you can go.

												This is definitely a game I'd recommend for people who enjoy solitary survival game experiences. As a man with the plague, you find yourself stranded on the island of Eden and must find your way in first person to concoct treatments and, eventually, the cure for your ailment. But there's more than the plague and the hazards of the island to deal with... A massive feline that is constantly on the move, and when it sniffs you out, you become its new plaything.For two men (brothers I believe) working on this game alone from scratch (even the engine is in-house), the results of their labor is astonishing. The quality of the visuals show the lack of manpower, but are still so brilliant and beautiful. The depth of mechanics present in the game is great, from map triangulation and navigation to day/night and weather cycles to swimming and sleeping to just how many ways the plague affects your character.Some of these mechanics, as one might imagine, are more cumbersome than others. It's surprisingly easy to find your character sliding downhill and then tumbling head over heels, dropping everything you held in your hands for the way back. While weapons are present (rock, knife, etc.) and can be thrown, there's ironically no way to injure or kill other creatures (eating is not a mechanic in this game, so it's somewhat forgivable). However, your character is so fragile early on in the game that this alone often determines whether you live or die should you encounter the cat in a place where you can't find shelter or hide.It's truly a shame that the cat had so much work put into it (seriously, it's the ONLY actual enemy in the game, and several blog posts from the devs talk about how much work was put into the AI for it), and yet for so many, myself included, it feels as though the game would be better off without it. The design of the creature is pretty neat, and all that goes into how it acts around you, how its presence affects your character, is amazing to me - but it feels entirely unnecessary and oftentimes serves more as a frustrating barrier to meeting your goals than an actual threat, especially when you figure out how to manipulate it. Yep, even with all of the enemy AI compiled into one creature, this beast is still easily manipulated. At least he attacks you now - which wasn't the case shortly before I bought this game. The poor thing was bugged and would just follow you around until it decided to bugger off.Still, this game is a great experience, and the storytelling is slow and delicious with the exploration for survival. It's a long one too, especially if you have no idea where to go or become forgetful like me. I have several more hours in this game than listed (a fair amount of time spent offline) and I don't think I got much more than a third of the way through the game, mostly because I got lost. Which is easy to do.Give it a try if you're into survival. It will definitely scratch that itch.			"

												This game was a fun game. With plenty of beauty & eye candy for scenery. It is also a massive game with a lot going for it. If you like free-form games go get this one you won't be disappointed. Cartography was an awesome feeling to triangulate your position on the map. The surprise of ""He is always watching you."" is a ton of fun & adds a bit of fear into the game. I hope everyone does give this game a try because it was made only by two brothers form what I know & for a game like this that is a high praise. The only gripe if you can call it that & this is really minor is the game-play with the walking and everything can be a bit slippery, but if you can overcome that flaw you'll really love this game.I would give the graphics score: 92/100I would give the sound plus music score: 91/100I would give the game-play score: 88/100I would give triangulation plus cartography score: 100/100			"

												This game is not for everyone. It was made by two people, and it is therefore a little rough around the edges. The graphics are by no means bad, but they are certainly not AAA-quality. The two brothers who made the game designed the engine as well (which is kind of impressive), but they clearly were not able to optimize it to run as well as some better-known game engines, so you may not get quite the frame rate you expect, and you will see lab equipment pop-in when you approach a campsite. There are a few other things that are imperfect as well. All that said, THIS GAME IS AMAZING! The strange thing about this game is that I had imagined a game remarkably similar to Miasmata, but never expected it to actually exist. When I saw it on Greenlight, I was surprised that such a game finally existed. When I played it, I was quite satisfied. This is a true survival game: stand still long enough, and you will die from lack of water/fever/creature attack. Exploring the island, making your own map by triangulation, finding plants to make medicine, finding notes and journal entries that help you figure out what's going on, and hiding from that creature add up to a great survival experience. The movement system of the game is also great. It more effectively simulates illness than any other game I have seen. If you go down too steep a slope, or go down too fast, you'll slip, eventually going head over heels. You have to carefully manage your momentum by holding back while going down a slope, or examining the terrain to find a safe path down or around. This both avoids the usual video game problem of being able to run around everything in a way that would not work in real life, and the problem of walking becoming boring; your illness makes walking a game challenge. As a final note, I love the UI, more accurately, the lack of UI, in this game. Your character carries an actual journal and map that you use in real time.			"

												Quite an exciting and fun exploration game. Pretty much the entire game just consists of exploring an island and collecting herbs, super comfy. The game itself is bit rough on the edges, needs a couple finishing touches, but is still great.However, be warned, if you want to play, you better ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ remember where you are going or you might get lost and screw up completely.

												I'm not a big fan of survival games but I am utterly fascinated by Miasmata. The main draw for me is that you never have a persistent map that shows your location, instead you have find your location by triangulating with known landmarks, which encourages caution in exploration and always checking your bearings. If you think you can just go running into the woods haphazardly think again because the game will punish you with one or a combination of three mechanics:The first mechanic is realistic terrain traversal and falling mechanics. Your character builds momentum as they go down gradients and you can't just stop on a dime, which is particularly dangerous if you're right next to a cliff. Falling is also realistic, as your character will take damage, drop items, and get stunned from heights that one would expect to get hurt from in real life.The second is the creature, the single enemy in the game that persistently follows you, the idea of which always keeps you on edge, I actually found it quite frightening.You can't kill it, the game purposely leaves weapons lying around to prove this point, and you can't flat out outrun it. It makes you think twice about going out at night, and you'll always keep in mind where is the nearest body of water.The third is simply getting lost. As I've mentioned before since there is no persistent map it is very easy to lose track of where you are and to just start going around in circles aimlessly in the woods. The game purposesly gives you a limited amount of inventory slots, and you'll die out quick if you don't know where you're going.Given the love the developers have put into this three game and the unique mechanics, it is well worth the $15 they're asking for.

												A fun experience, worth the money, and I'd like to see more from the Johnsons put out.A fun sandbox puzzler/hide-and-seek mechanic with a botanist survivalist twist. The in-game instructions could have used some more clarity for the cartography, but honestly I felt foolish for not realizing how easy a system it was; simply making it more obvious that you have to tag an unknown landmark AFTER establishing your position with two known ones should have been obvious but for some reason wasn't. Didn't ruin the experience, and I found the cartography system to compliment the feeling of exploration encouragement/hide-and-seek aspects pretty well.Try it if you've seen this on here for awhile and been tempted: It's worth it.

												Nice game! This is a survival/horror game. Not THAT scary though. Unless you have a phobia for green-black tigers with horns. The goal of the game is to run around on a (HUGE) island, and find all the plants, required to cure a disease, (you have it). You also have to make sure not to be eaten by the ""fearsome feline"" I told you about. The game is very nice, especially if you enjoy adventure, discovering, and a little bit o' scare. The game could be pretty hard, But this is not a skill game. Beatiful environment! Great graphics, and tons of deatails! Also to note that the place is as big as GTA IV (maybe even bigger!) And the fact that two brothers made the game, entirely on their own, is very stunishing. This just adds up to the rating of the game, and all and all, this is a very nice game.			"

												At first, I thought this game was awful. The graphics kinda made me seasick. I quickly tired of the novelty of the walking physics, and sliding around just became irritating. I made disparaging remarks about its clunkiness. I didn't understand really what to do, and I just kept getting hopelessly lost. But I was still playing. Over time, I realized I was thinking about this game at work and in the shower. I couldn't wait to get home and find plants and whip out my compass. I was so immersed, and I loved every second of it. By the end, I was deftly popping up to high spots to make some quick marks on my map, chugging water, doing my science, and creeping to my goal with tingling excitement. I came back around on the idea of the walking physics. I was telling friends and family about my progress in the game, even though they didn't care. I ended up gifting it to two people. For a game that I initially thought I hated, it turned out to be probably one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time. It's definitely worth giving this one a fair chance and overlooking some of the rough edges. My only complaint is that now I just want *more* so I have an excuse to go back to the woods.			"

												Miasmata is an awesome game. I saw it in the winter sale of 2012 and didn't know anything about it. I passed on buying it but it never left my mind. I found a good Let's Play of this game and watching the first few episodes made me have to buy this. The graphics look amazing, the concept is something neat. I loved Chemistry in school and took a plant class as well so my inner nerd was happy at the fact you can find and make health related items from plants. It's not as scary as I'd like but you are always looking over your shoulder after you find something written on the first chalk board.This game is just great on all counts, a bit of it can be confusing if you don't read the notes you're given properly. It's open and you're not really walled into any place to follow a path. You can go from A to X if you want or you can follow the natural paths in the game. Just beware, you and the harmless wildlife are not alone on this deserted island.			"

												Its overall an interesting game in which you look for plants to create medicines and eventually cure a deadly plague you have contracted. At first you will make basic medicines to temporarily treat the fever, then later you will make stat boosting medicines that will enhance your Strength, Endurance, or Perception permanently.You could also make temporary stat boosting medicines, then eventually you will find the more rare and important plants, synthesize the cure, then leave the island and sail home.It's a shame it has technical issues up the♥♥♥♥♥for me, such as blue screening sometimes if I read a document in fullscreen mode, so I have to play in windowed mode to avoid that. And worst of all, the random framerate drop that takes my framerate to around 5-10 FPS and won't go away unless I restart the game.In the end, its a game with a cool concept but actually beating the game is a little too damn complicated because the 6 plants you need to synthesize the cure is spread so far across the island I could beat 5 other games betime I find them.

												The interface is a bit clunky, but I got into this game.  There's some innovative ideas here, especially how mapping works and turning that into a realistic and believable challenge (having to use sightings to triangulate position and such). It can be frustrating with the slow movement and weakness of your character.  The map is also quite large.  But, the story--which you get mostly via notes you find--is done well and the ending is pretty cool.  I got this game for like 3 bucks on sale and at that price it's a good deal for sure.			"

												In Miasmata, the player explores an island in search of plants, to craft a cure for a disease. The game is almost entirely non combat, which may put off some gamers. You will be attacked by a creature at various times, but its best to just run away and hide. You can also be injured by falling down hills, and will die if you don't heal fast enough. Other threats include thirst, sleep deprivation and drowning. Crafting plants can restore health and provide buffs. I loved how much freedom the player is given. Miasmata is a lesson for AAA developers about how to create an open world without waypoint markers, and still guide the player to quest locations in an intelligent way. There are lots of clues to find such as maps and journal fragments, which point you in the right direction. If you're willing to overlook some minor flaws such as graphical glitches and menu presentation, this is a really nice, intelligent game, and easily worth the indie game purchase price.			"

												Miasmata is an open world, survival, adventure game where you must craft medicines to cure a disease that is slowing killing you.  There are other medicines that you can create to help you on your journey but beware, for the interior of the island lurks a creature that is hell bent on killing you before the plaque does.  Unfortunately, that's where many of the plants grow that can aid your condition.Pros:- Highly detailed world- Passage of time- The island is very diverse in it's topography- Mapping the island is fun (at lease for me it was)- Various plants, many with medicinal properties- Many notes and pictures to find that will give you clues to plant locations- You get to play scientist- There is no place on the island where you can't go- Numerous unique buildings, ruins, tents, dot the landscape, several with notes so you want to visit them allCons:- The game is not well optimized- It is very VERY easy to get lost if you leave the path and you will leave the path... many times- The creature seems to show up at the most inconvenient times (but then again, it's more of a pet peeve then a con)Besides fashioning medicines, one of the most entertaining activities for me was mapping the island.  I've always had a interest in cartography.  If you want to map the entire island, you have to be clever on where you stand and find two known points of reference, especially when it comes to mapping the interior.  At the time of this review, Miasmata was selling for $14.99.  Well worth it in my opinion.			"

Since there are no zombies or machine guns, you find yourself wandering the woods or just watching the sunset on the beach with a huge stone-faced statue in the distance. Although the focus is on retreiving items, after you start piecing the map together your main motivation is to simply see what's over the next hill.Miasmata is a fun, believable survival experience well worth the minimal price.

Even though it says that you are sick and you need to develop a cure, you will never die as long you keep drinking and sleeping, and out of the creatures way, which is (mildly) stalking you.

												An excellent game of exploration and survival. The visuals and ambiance of the island are really good in helping set the mood as you find and research various medicinal qualities of the local flora to find a cure for your plague ridden character, all the constructing a map using triangulation off of landmarks, uncovering clues about the what has been going on both on island and off, and running and hiding in terror of the creature that stalks you.Rough edges are a plenty, but still a very worthwhile experience.

												A very pleasant surprise - a game developed by two brothers is more interesting than some AAA titles. Unique cartography system where you need to triangulate your location using map and compass.  Very captivating survival and adventure experience, 5 out of 5 for me!			"

												Simple but very well implemented and a joy to play. As others have said the running away from the monster element is feeble and more of a nuisance than an excitement though the first couple of times it is frightening. The main part of the game is running round the island and trying not to get lost. It sounds simple but it really is excellent fun.There is also some gathering of plants and making medicines which is so-so, and a bit of piecing together of history by reading scraps of papers you find. It seems that more and more games use this technique and it is nearly always feeble. Fortunately it doesn't detract from the game.I think it was made by a two person team. If so, congratulations to them.			"

												In Miasmata, the player explores an island in search of plants, to craft a cure for a disease. The game is almost entirely non combat, which may put off some gamers. You will be attacked by a creature at various times, but its best to just run away and hide. You can also be injured by falling down hills, and will die if you don't heal fast enough. Other threats include thirst, sleep deprivation and drowning. Crafting plants can restore health and provide buffs. I loved how much freedom the player is given. Miasmata is a lesson for AAA developers about how to create an open world without waypoint markers, and still guide the player to quest locations in an intelligent way. There are lots of clues to find such as maps and journal fragments, which point you in the right direction. If you're willing to overlook some minor flaws such as graphical glitches and menu presentation, this is a really nice, intelligent game, and easily worth the indie game purchase price.			"

												I don't know if it's the fun of exploring the island and collecting plants or the constant fear that the monster might be behind you but this game has me hooked! Trying to map your location using landmarks is something I've never had to do in a game before but I thought it was such an interesting concept. Made me think twice about going off the beaten track. I would definitely recommend this game, it has a lot of challenges and a great atmosphere on offer for players.			"

												Miasmata is an open world, survival, adventure game where you must craft medicines to cure a disease that is slowing killing you.  There are other medicines that you can create to help you on your journey but beware, for the interior of the island lurks a creature that is hell bent on killing you before the plaque does.  Unfortunately, that's where many of the plants grow that can aid your condition.Pros:- Highly detailed world- Passage of time- The island is very diverse in it's topography- Mapping the island is fun (at lease for me it was)- Various plants, many with medicinal properties- Many notes and pictures to find that will give you clues to plant locations- You get to play scientist- There is no place on the island where you can't go- Numerous unique buildings, ruins, tents, dot the landscape, several with notes so you want to visit them allCons:- The game is not well optimized- It is very VERY easy to get lost if you leave the path and you will leave the path... many times- The creature seems to show up at the most inconvenient times (but then again, it's more of a pet peeve then a con)Besides fashioning medicines, one of the most entertaining activities for me was mapping the island.  I've always had a interest in cartography.  If you want to map the entire island, you have to be clever on where you stand and find two known points of reference, especially when it comes to mapping the interior.  At the time of this review, Miasmata was selling for $14.99.  Well worth it in my opinion.			"

												This game was amazing; it was everything I expected it to be. It's a pretty mellow slow paced exploration game that requires patience. The island is beautiful and the weather was fantastic. The story and concept are great especially the cartography. The creature was a little scary, a little annoying, but played its part very well. I didn’t even mind the bumbling controls once I got used to them, in fact they added to the experience.I managed to play for 32 hours across 1 full playthrough, 1 speed run (achievements), and 1 playthrough for remaining achievements.I'm a little disappointed the devs abandoned the game leaving behind some achievement bugs. Nothing game breaking unless you consider getting all the achievements important like I do.Huge shout out to DarkStarSword  for his excellent work on the Unofficial Community Patch  and Miaschiev bug fixer. I couldn't have completed the game without his work.Once the game is done, there is no replay value which saddens me a lot. I want to play again but the game is exactly the same every time. I wish there was a ""random"" playthrough where the important flowers changed requiring you to analyze them each time to figure out their use. The flowers could also randomize locations and the maps and notes would not be present since you already know the story.10/10 Would play again if I could.			"

												A really nice, relaxing game. You explore and chart an island, find ingredients, craft potions with them and try not to get eaten by a mysterious creature that lives on the island. Your ultimate goal is to find the correct ingredients to create a cure for a plague that has infected humanity, including you.At first this may sound like a typical survival horror game, but it is not. You will hardly ever see the creature and if you do it's relatively easy to escape or hide. The potions you craft aren't really needed either as the creature is the only enemy in the game and all you need to stay alive is water (which you can find almost everywhere) and a bed (which is also easy to find since there are huts and tents from a previous expedition scattered across the island). So why is it fun you may ask. Simply because the island looks beautiful and is fun to explore, the cartography game mechanic is wonderfully implemented and moving your character around is fun and different as well - since he's infected with a disease he is quite hard to control (in a positive way) and if you don't pay attention he'll fall down a ledge or pass out.If you're looking for an action game or a (survival) horror game look elsewhere. If you like a relaxing game where you slowly explore an island and discover what happened to the scientific expedition that arrived there before you then Miasmata is definitely worth playing.			"

												While you can win this game within 5 minutes, it will probably take you about 24 hours to play.  It is cheeky like that.  If you like orienteering around an island trying to find useful stuff to help you survive and mixing drugs and going for the occasional sliding tumble to yuor death through foliage while being chased by Cat-thulhu (or was it Tabbythogua?) this game might be for you.  It is not a typical game, in that you lack the tools necessary to kill the critter, but you are on the island to save your civilization from a terrible plague, and if you are clever, you will.  I loved scurrying through the underbrush trying to find the proper vantage points to triangulate distances and map the world, it was an odd and enjoyable mechanic that I became kinda OCD about doing over and over again.  Finishing this game was strangely satisfying and I liked it, but I just know it will not be everyone's ""cup of tea"".			"

												This is a wonderfully designed game. I love the work they've put in it and the whole exploration aspect of it of trying to find a cure and being exiled on an island.The feeling of helplessness is really present. However, they are still a few bugs that needs to be addressed/fixed before they role this out into the public. I don't know why steam only logged me for 0.2 hours on this game when I clearly spent 2 hours or more exploring everything, but here's my take on some of the negative thinks I found in the game.1.) Often times, my character would clip through rocky surfaces, house walls, trees and even fall under the map. This needs to be fixed.2.) Sometimes when you die, the character's voice would get stuck in a loop until you restart, load or exit the game.3.) Often times I would die for no reason, such as walking knee-high on water or clipping houses and structures.Apart from that, this game has been very wonderful. While I do believe and feel that this game still feels like it's in early access and should be polished up more, I will not deny that this game offers replayability and numerous content for players to enjoy. I hope the developers take the time to address these issues with an update in the future.8/10 - My honest review.			"

												Get this game! A totally unique style of gameplay where the common goal of survival is given an uncommon element where survival is not achieved through constant violence. Miasmata really takes the player down a notch. After playing games where you just run around exploding people with ease, you are suddenly thrown into a world where if you run into some form of predator, you're powerless! Hide! Run! If you're lucky, wave that torch! The controlls were a good attempt on how one would move in real life, but have their flaws and are a little clunky. Walking is not really an option unless you're sneaking, and I perfer not to be sprinting blind through brush (p.s. there was a cliff). So get out there! Run, hide, forage, cultivate, and above all, stay thirsty my friend.			"

												Miasmata is, hands down, the best exploration game I have played, and one that I consider to be among my best purchases.I have so much to comment on, but I'll try to focus on just the most pertinent points.The game world feels extremely vibrant, with beautiful scenery and memorable features. Exploration is *the* thing to do and forms the main gameplay loop - you don't have an ""automap"" that tells you where you are, you have to make the map by finding your location from known landmarks, then triangulate from there to pinpoint the location of unknown landmarks. You also find much flora on the island that must be returned to a lab, analyzed, and hopefully synthesized into something useful - and much of this flora is indigenous to specific biomes and cannot be found outside of them. These twin processes make every new area, every unrecognized landmark, and every new strange-looking plant an exciting new challenge to be conquered.The game is *difficult*, and exactly to the degree it should be - it's not a grind, but it's very far from a cakewalk to achieve any objective. Saving is rationed to camps, which are liberally littered throughout the terrain but are still not trivial to find if you're lost. Getting lost is, itself, extremely easy; you'll find yourself trying to find recognizable landmarks just to know where the heck you are. Walking around isn't simple, either. The game is first-person, but unlike RPGs like Elder Scrolls, you are not some mighty warrior who can leap tall cliffs. You play a deathly-ill scientist whose physical abilities are greatly diminished. Realistic falling damage poses a challenge: Tumbling off the side of a hill will disorient you, cause you to drop items you were carrying, and may bring on the symptoms of the disease, requiring medicine to be synthesized and administered before you lose the last of your strength. Swimming is likewise an arduous and perilous pursuit. These are not problems without solutions - but throughout thegame trekking across terrain is never reduced to mindless strolling. Night-time exploration is a challenging experience that should be avoided where possible.And the creature that prowls the island is truly terrifying... Fighting is not an option, running only works for so long against something that is faster than a sick person, and so hiding is the only solution - and since you need to avoid being seen, it means it's very hard to take a good look at the beast. That makes it all the more scary. The fact that running away aimlessly is a sure way of getting lost and disoriented definitely adds to the difficulty and the tension. On the bad side of things, I found the plot to be a bit detached and not very satisfying, with the murder mystery feeling a bit out of place (even though it did add tension); and I wish the interesting ruins on the island had more backstory and interesting things to find or do in them. I did find the ending satisfying, but mostly because of the challenge overcome and less due to any story resolution, which was a bit lacking.The game is not very buggy, but I did experience an occasional crash, and its lighting at night and landmark recognition were a bit quirky at times. Replayability is probably diminishing if you get to the point where you are very well familiarized with the entire island, but that should take a very long playtime; plus it's possible to try a speed-run for the achievements, which adds another degree of challenge to veteran players.I played for a very long time before I felt that I had truly conquered the island, and it was incredibly satisfying. The credits say the game was made by only two people, which I find amazing in itself. To those two I say, incredible work - I'd love to see your future endeavors.			"

												I've enjoyed Miasmata. It took me a long time to play it, as I had the game for several years before I finished it. It was one of my ""I have nothing to play... oh, wait, let's do something in this for a bit"" games.Miasmata utilizes a rather interesting mechanic: a triangulation process for mapping out the island and finding your location, which makes this game stand out a lot as I have not seen anything like it elsewhere. The AI for the monster is wonderful, as it seems to show up with enough frequency and has some great pathing and bahaviors, much like a real cat. The fact that it could show up at any time, especially when you are covering lots of ground quickly, adds to the tension and creates a great atmosphere. The snippets of story through notes create a chilling mystery set on a suprisingly beautiful island. This game, if comparrisons are made, somewhat feels ""slender-esque"" as you are a plague victim scouring the island for plants to synthesize a cure, and medicines to keep you alive along the way. I feel like the monster shows up more as you get closer to completion of the cure and it seems to show up more in critical areas, such as places where X plant for the cure is guarenteed. My only issue with the game revolved around the controls. The movement of the character can be wonky sometimes. I feel like it does a great job of simulating the rigors of climbing with sliding and exhaustion; however, there are many times I'd want to move a foot or so forward, maybe down a 2% grade, and the guy would either overstep or just take off running. Many a cliff have I fallen from due to this ""over/undersensitivity."" I've found that alternating between forward and backward as you walk down any slope can greatly reduce the threat of ""tripping.""There are also times where you'd trip from one-foot drops, get stuck on stairs or small logs (which is terrible when you are being pursued), bump a tree the wrong way and bounce off sideways, be following a curved ledge and start sliding to the right. I just felt I, as a human being, would be able to have better control of my footing; the game makes me feel like a baby who has just learned how to walk, yet lacks basic control. Other than movement mechanics, I have greatly enjoyed the game so far. I enjoy exploration games and find that the ability to triagulate on the map adds more to the exploration reward. Miasmata has just enough tension and ""horror"" to attract fans of those genres and manages to stay fresh, as the map is fairly well-sized, allowing for many hours of play.			"

												This indie survival-adventure game, in a genre that has spiked in popularity in recent times, significantly stands out.  The plot is straightforward and an example of the power of simplicity. Your boat washes up on an island shrouded in mystery, where you hope to find a cure to the disease you suffer from. You must utilize the islands vegetation to ultimately find a cure. While you are immersed in this journey playing survivalist/botanist/mycologist, you must also utilize other skills, such as cartography, especially the process of triangulation, to navigate around. Overall, If you enjoy fun adventure games that are ""open world"", thrilling, and suspenseful, then this is a game worth taking a look at.8.0/10 (Let's be realistic here, there are some flaws in the game....It is not perfect, by any means)			"

												+ Great worldbuilding that invites exploration.+ Unique triangulation system for filling in your map. Yes, this is largely about exploring unknown areas and filling in the map. It's fun to get lost and try to find the way back.+ Foraging is pretty fun. You get hints for where to find certain plants, and then hunt them down and brew different drugs from the plants.+ Pretty funny physics where you stumble and roll (and sometimes die) if you go too fast down a hill.- The game crashes every time you alt-tab, at least on my system. Because of this, I just stopped playing halfway. Who wants to restart the game every time they have to do something outside the game?- You can only carry 2 plants at once. This is really stupid considering half the game is about foraging plants.- Uninspired survival elements. Drink water and find a bed regularly. Whoop-de-doo.- The ""scary"" monster is just corny and annoying and feels really out of place.I'm conflicted about recommending this game but chose to make it negative because of the price. It's worth some money, but really not 14.99e. I would recommend buying it at 2e or something now that I've tried it.			"

												Very good game, but it's certainly not for everyone. Don't expect Michael Bay explosions and action.The game itself is just walking around the island, making the map yourself with triangulation, picking various plants and turning them into potions/medicine and making sure you will not die from dehydration and going too fast (yes, that is a thing). All of this while you are chased by a wierd cat/lion/panther/demon/whatever hybrid.It kind of feels like Robinson's Reqiem, but without everything trying to kill you.			"

												Although i perhaps exaggerate now a little bit, but my personal opinion is, that Miasmata is a really astonishing masterpiece. The graphic quality almost reaches the standards of extremely expensive engines made by big companies, but is in fact made by just 2 guys. Surely it has some flaws, like the grainy looking water in the distance and no waves along the shores. The fog sometimes act a little bit strange and there are proplems like torches/sticks dont illuminate the logbook or map. But all of that is compensated by the incredible atmosphere. Starting extremely weak and as easy pray, you have to find water, plants and safe spots to survive. Creating medicine to keep you alive and to find the cure for the plague. Running around the island can be tricky sometimes, because the terrain affects your speed. It requires a lot of strenght to climb up a hill and you may stumble while running down, which causes a headache and in the worst case deadly high fever. Another great feature is, how you can create the map of the island. The easy method is to find pieces of the map around the camps. The other method is to draw a small piece of it by marking 2 known landmarks which are in sight. While exploring the island, you are watched by a creature lurking in the shadows of the Jungle, which will soon start to hunt you down. You dont have weapons and all you can do is to hide, distract the creature or run for you life. But there is one power you have, which will scare the beast away.			"

The beginning was a little weird and dull, but once you travel more into the island, you will begin to understand how you're supposed to play and think in this game. Such moment is when you realize this is a one-of-a-kind game.The game tries to simulate realism, and although it may seem to go overboard on some parts, it does everything very well (except for nights, which are strangely pitch black even if moonlight should give a little help, so I reccommend you avoid being outside at night, but that's quite the only bad thing I see about this game).The controls might as well be weird, but that's because it tries to simulate real life even more. You're not supposed to be able to turn around 180 degrees and run straight away just like that in real life, right? Well, you can't just do that in this game either. It's not something too bad though, and it's easy to get used to it.I was surprised when I reached one of the primary objectives in a certain place of the island, where the scenery was just great, and the search for a specific rare plant, was an interesting experience like in no other game.When I encountered the ""Creature"" (which I like to refer to as Miasmata, even if that's a bit cheesy and the creature has no official name), that's when the game turned much more into a survival game. I was always checking my surroundings carefully and hiding from a practically invincible beast, until the moment I'd notice the creature is nearby, and that always made my heart race, even if this game isn't a horror or anything scary based game. You have to manage to not only survive your sickness, but you also have to survive being hunted down by such predator.Overral, this game is one of the greatest survival/adventure games out there in my opinion, as I really love this game and it got me addicted very soon after I began playing. Rating: 9.5/10, would have been a full 10 if it wasn't for the unfortunately frustrating pitch black nights.			"

												I wanted this game because of the atmosphere I thought (hoped) it would create and it actually does a pretty good job in creating a lonely, lost vibe on a mysterious island. I liked that part. They also did a great job with the plant life and landscape of the island. I never felt like I was walking through the same repeated textures and wilderness. It really felt like the woods. I grew up in the woods so I have a pretty good idea of what wandering around in them feels like and they pulled this off.Here's why I ultimately didn't like this game. It just got boring. Once the scenic beauty wore off and the a lot of the statues and plants were found and a few run ins with the monster that is stalking me. I would just kind of wander around looking for something to do and the only thing to do was to look for more plants which couldn't keep my interest. They were almost there with this game but it didn't quite get it done for me in the end.			"

												The first thing I should say is I do not know a single person who completed this, or wanted to.Before you purchase this game, it isn't Myst. It is not Doom. It's not even ""Dear Esther"". Here is what I think it is:Picture yourself on an island where everything is made of ice. Hills you climb are so slippery, you slid to the bottom no matter what you do. Falling gives you a fever. Always. Fevers mean stopping gameplay to make a medicine. You don't eat, but you sure drink a lot of water. The object of the game is to mark all of the island giant heads  (well, you are supposed to be finding plants to cure a plague, but that's a lost cause). That's about it - no real game play, no challenges, just don't trip, don't walk through ankle deep water or you will drown.Sound fun? You are correct. It's not. I played for over 20 hours and the last 15 was just to try to complete it, hoping there was some massive reveal. There isn't. Pass on this one. It's a 3/10 at best. "

												8/10. Miasmata writes the book on empathy with in-game characters. As a survivor you are alone. The outside is dangerous. The shelters are far apart and minimal. Darkness absorbs you suddenly. The night is always something to fear.Definitely, this game has its issues. There are texture bugs and clipping problems, but the navigation and map-making cartography is unique and gives an interesting take on how to get to your ""point B"". The creature/monster is very unique, being cat-like and behaving much as a predator would. She is colored by her surroundings and can stalk the poor survivor for miles. She becomes the thing you fear more than falling down the hills (which is quite annoying in some locations). Personally, I have taken to calling her Maxine, and navigating around the island would get me saying, ""Not right now Maxine, I don't have time for this"" to my monitor as soon as the heartbeat quickened. I really like this game. It took me 30 hours to complete, and I still have more achievements to do.			"

Many good elements including night and day sessions, having a inventory that actually keeps stuff ""realistically"" inside of it, and wonderful visuals.Only things I didn't care for was how hard it was to learn how to triangulate stuff, feeling totally helpless if you happen to be caught outside at night without a torch, and that weird, scary *YOU'LLFINDOUTWHAT* that they threw in there to keep it really interesting.

												Very sluggish controls--you sidestep at roughly 1/5 of your forward speed.Frustrating lack of traction--you will slip off of cliffs that should have been easy to stay on, leading to a long walk back up if you don't die. Even worse, if you find a rare plant and then slip, even if you only fall a few feet, you will drop the plant, and have to go back to where it grows to get another one.Also, falling off cliffs gives you a fever for some reason, which necessetates finding medicinal plants to treat it, or a bed to sleep in, else your vision is screwed up.The map requires you to sight two known landmarks before it marks your position. Move 2 inches and reopen the map? Sorry, need to site two landmarks again, I forgot where you were standing.Interesting premise, but great number of frustrating factors lead to an unfun experience. Do not buy. "

												I loved the experience of exploring this landscape! They really captured the feeling of running down a hill, on the edge of control, and that's what makes exploring this world, especially when running, so fun. What keeps it fun is the scale of the environment: the ecology of the island is quite varied, depending on where you are. You're really rewarded for striking out in your own direction and exploring, and the fact that you have to manually fill in your map adds to this, making you feel like you really know the land. And getting to know the land is, of course, really helpful when you're trying to get about, especially at speed. This game may not be for the impatient, or those who need their hand held and told where to go and what to do all the time, or who like to feel in control over everything, but if it was, it wouldn't be so rewarding for the rest of us.

The atmosphere was great and the fact that this was made by two brothers only is amazing.  I'll probably load this up from time to time just to run around the island - it's a blast - and the cartography system is also something to be applauded.

												I really enjoyed the game. It is truly a unique experience and unlike anything I have encountered so far.The character handling is different than in the usual FPS shooters - it feels like you're really moving a body around.It reminded me of Arma2 - with the addition that if you start sliding on cliff it's hard to stop. Watch your step!The start of the game is nicely paced and teaches you what to do without making it feel like you're confined to a particular path. It's just natural to do the start the way it's intended to and if you really want to be unreasonable you could run into the other direction as well.And then you're alone, all on a big island, free to explore!

												Pros:1. Looks very goodCons:1. The monster is completely inept.  I've encountered it several times, and usually it'll just lurk nearby and disapear.  Even when I can get it to attack me, it doesn't actually do any damage.  2. Lots of tedious walking.3. The physics is frustrating.  If you hit even a mild slope, you either go sliding thirty feet if you go downhill, or it you slowly trudge uphill.  4. Mundane things hurt you.  You can drown in two feet of water, or go sliding down an aforementioned slope, go flying into the air, and come down hard.  5. The only time I've died is when I deliberately swam out into the ocean trying to drown myself.  6. For a survival game, there isn't any surviving.  You get thirsty, but there's always an abundance of fresh water to drink.  You never have to eat or build a shelter, and the only ill effect you can suffer is a fever, which is easily taken care of by sleeping for a few hours.			"

												Miasmata is a tough game to recommend.  It's not that the game is particularly bad or anything (I think it's a great experience honestly), but it's one of those games that is so unique that it will most likely polarize people.Miasmata is a game of survival and exploration.  You wake up on the shores of an uncharted island stricken with a plague.  Your primary goal is to cure it, and you do this by collecting plants, researching them, and discovering their properties.  This is what you'll spend most of the game doing, aside from dealing with the occasional run in with the creature that roams the isle.  The game is highly immersive.  It pulls you in with a strong sense of place.The only major issues with this game comes from the technical side.  There are lots of graphical glitches here and there (the pop in is particularly bad at some points), and the framerate occasionally dips (at least on my laptop it did).  Considering the game was designed entirely by two brothers, I can actually look past most of these issues.If you want a gaming experience like nothing you've played before, I would highly recommend this game.  If you are not the patient type, I would caution you on this one.  This is definitely a game that rewards patient exploration, and if that's your thing, then you are in for a treat.			"

												""It was time to get out of Eden. I took off at full sprint across the length of my dominion. Joy and remorse swashed around my mind like two components of one of my synthesizing drugs. Despite all the pain this island represented,  it also represented hope and resilience. But ultimately, I felt joy that I would soon be freed from this prison.As I ran past my familiar haunts, I was confronted with the sins of my scientist brethren: their bodies litter the island and rot in one accord. I felt complicit in the same cold-transgressions of power-pursuit and going to any length possible to survive, but I can’t help but feel like a changed man.At the end of my final run through the island, I saw my escape. And I swam for it. But as I swam, I didn’t mind looking back. Almost afraid I’d be turned to stone like Lot’s wife, I couldn’t help but miss this terrible place.Do I miss the fight for survival, the desperate quest for a cure, and the haunting notion that everybody else on the island is dead? I really do. Now, I sit here. I’ve made my final triangulation. But I don’t need to. I already know where I am.

												A decently fun game, the only real problem here is the walking mechanic and it's a really big problem.You walk like everything is made of ice and if you accidentally slip onto a slight incline you'll slip and slide all the way down right onto your head. Even the smallest vertical drop will cause you to tumble and fall down which drops everything in your hands, puts out your torch, and sometimes injures you. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if the floors weren't all ice which makes it nearly impossible to stop this from happening. Even still I won't discredit the game entirely, only buy this if it's on sale for $9 or less.			"

												The creature adds a very small horror element of the game, but this is not a ""survival horror"" game. The emphasis is almost exclusively on survival and the sense of adventure (traveling to a new place and discovering new things). As someone who cares deeply about science and discovery, this game was very refreshing and engaging for me, despite its nagging technical and design issues.I highly recommend that anyone with a similar passion for science, discovery, and adventure give Miasmata a try. It is very rough around the edges, but its dedication to its novel niche concept makes it worthwhile. It's a game that is geared towards a specific audience, and that audience will likely love the game. For anyone else, it could be a passable diversion, but you might find it too dull and boring to play to completion.Full review on my personal blog: http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2015/01/03/Miasmata-game-review.aspx "

												A real gem that gives you a true sense of exploration. You spend most of the time exploring the island, looking for medical plants and creating a map using the cartography mechanics. Survival aspect is minimal. You constantly need fresh water, but it never was a problem for me. Can be very scary at times thanks to the Creature. If you just want a relaxing experience, there is a no-creature save file somewhere on the forums, but it would make the game far less challenging. Verdict: if you like the idea of gameplay based mostly on exploring a huge island, definitely buy Miasmata.			"

												Pro:The map system is great, in fact it is the only thing worthwhile in the game.  While it could utilize a lot of work (including creating your own marker points) it is the first semi-realistic mapping system I have seen.  Cons:Bad Physics with a fair try.  they tried to make the system quasi physics based (but took physics 101 and stupped), the speeds and slowdowns are unrealistic and remind me of mario on ice or something that way.  Your like some old weak freak that can't climb worth crap or fall more than 3 inches, gets tired after a short (very short) sprint, and falls like a drunk on saturday night.  Moving is frustrating and pathetic.You can only carry one object, 3 flowers, and apparently a book with you.  While many games let you carry more than is realistic, this game thinks the only place to hold things is your hand apparently.  Oh and don't go for a swim, you will drop everything (and likely never find it again), even a tiny pond can mess you up.Graphics Suck:  There is no brightness control, so at night on my screen is pitch black, a cloud makes it as dark as night would be.  Due to the poor graphics (I maxed them out and still the detail is crap) you can see things very far away with in detail, as the game's mapping system requires you notice things far away, this is a pain.Boring:  Outside of mapping and needing to drink 5 galons of water a day, the only thing you do is gather plants in an attempt to find the right mixes.  There is a beast on the island to chase you around, though I am not exactly sure why.  You can only carry three flowers on you, so to do any real experimenting requires you do a lot of back and forth.  No need to protect yourself from weather or even eat food, so it does not even qualify as a survival game.Suggestions:Take the mapping system, get rid of the monsters, and be the first true survival game.  So many games out there come close on a lot of areas, but mess it up by either adding unbeatable uber monsters or have crappy world interactions.  This game does both. The idea of a quest/story line is great, but it's so tedious and slow to get flowers, the I feel it falls very short of it's potential benefit. "

To do that you have to create a cure which needs three substances but to create it you'll have to drink A LOT of water (its vital, otherwise you'll die) and pick up different materials and from them you have to make all kinds of medicine and stuff plus theres a monster which wants to rip you apart and feast on your flesh. You can even make aspirin! xD I really recommend this game. Its really fun and is a big time killer. Rated 10/10!			"

												It's an indie game, dont be so picky. The map is really big, it did surprise me since it's an indie game.The gameplay is good, it offers lots of adventure and intense moments, also knowledge about plants.The rigging for character are awful, the hand is kinda twisted lol. But it didnt affect the gameplay, after all it's juz an indie game developed by 2 devs. Since the game is about plants, so most of the graphics are focus on those plants.The mechanisms are very weird in this game, the gravitation is kinda realistic, it took times to get along with it, but it does increase the intensity of the game (there are ways to die/injure in this game)Overall, since the game's price is really fair with such a big map, so it's a game worth to try if u r a fan of surviving/adventure game "

												Hmm I found this game uninteresting but boring. Perhaps it gets better but I can't see myself putting in another 5 hours to find out. There may be an interesting story here somewhere but to get to it is not worth the time. How many times must I go through the cutscene of examining a flower or making an elixer? You can pick up objects but can't do anything with them (other than the flowers and mushrooms etc.). Visually the game is lackluster and the sound of your progress through the environment is unrealistic and intrusive enough to be irritating. A pretentios piese of tripe. If you're lookinjg for something different and deeper than your typical fighting game try Talus Principle or Ethan Carter. By the way you can download it for free.			"

												This game is not for just anybody.. If you want to use weapons and fight off canibals or zombies, then forget about it, this is an exploratory game with the only threats are basically nature, diesease, and The Creature. You must create the cure for the diesease you have contracted by some unexplained way, then find a undamaged boat to leave the island. Pros:Graphics and very beautiful atmosphere.The Creatures hunting technique, you'll think your in the clear and oops no your not.Overall game concept is pretty goodCons:Cursed slipping and sliding all the time kills a lot of the fun of exploring.The Creature is a bit too unrealistic looking compaired to the rest of the worldControls are very clumsy and not to preciseMissing a good story, The current version seems rushed. Just here you are on an island, now go survive, That's about the jest of it.The journal is big mess and impossible to remeber which plant does what unless you write your own journal on paper as you go.Over-allOn a ascale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 6. Mostly due to the cursed sliding and falling over your own 2 feet. And the bad journal design. I do still recommend playing this if you enjoy casual survival based games. But if your expecting something like ""The Forest"" or ""Rust"" or ""Dayz"". The you will want to steer clear of this game.			"

												I love exploration survival games. that you have to forage for food, water, resources and survive. this one's pretty neat for that. though it wore off on me a little bit after a while of running around the forests and trying to find different herbs were to gather.. the ambiance and the unknown creature roaming just adds that edge of ""urgancy"" to trying to find a cure and get out. Not a bad game :)			"

												dont waste your time on this one.  interesting idea, but poorly done.  lots of items to interact with but basically just to throw, no practical use.  no inventory to store things, so you'll be running back to a base all the time.  the whole plague ridin thing is a good idea, but the constant frustration of getting a fever and then falling down as you getting sicker and sicker just begs the question of ""why did i buy this again?""

												A great horror-survival-exploration game that's worthy of attention.You begin the game stranded on a beach, exiled because of a contagious disease...That's it, then it's basically up to you to explore, find clues and try to stay alive in hope of finding a cure.Quick Summary:This game is a great example of an exploration game where you need to make sure you have enough waterto stay alive and where, at night, losing your source of light is the worst thing ever,while avoiding an unknown creature and trying to find a cure for your condition bysearching the local plantlife for ingredients.It is an immersive, tense and beautiful experience that I highly recomment to everyone interested.+    Atmosphere:        Man does this game nail everything I like about atmosphere and ambiance.        It is stunning and mysterious at day and yet absolutley terrifying and pitch-black at night,        and the ambient sounds really makes the environment come alive.    Sound:        While the game has almost no music, it more than makes up for it by the afromented ambient sounds        which range from flowing water to tweeting birds.+-    Graphics:        Alright, let's face it: the character model looks kinda bad, as does a few other things;        the water from the pitcher comes to mind...        The fauna however looks absolutley stunning, and you could (and probably will) get lost in the islands locales        whether merely trying to get a better view or to find new plants to experiment on.    Gameplay:        Gameplay isn't exactly what you would call exiting and is a matter of taste.        Do you like picking up random plant life, checking them for new components, combining medicine,        triangulating your position trying to explore the island while keeping yourself from dehydrating or getting        sick-er as well as being scared because darkness is falling then getting lost for days on end?        Also, there is a creature on the island that is far from friendly...        Personally, I love it, it is a tense experience, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but on the other        hand, if any or all of these sound appealing to you I highly recommend this game.

I modded the game to remove the horror elements, and I'm enjoying it a lot more, now.  I enjoy the immersive survival elements, as they make me actually think like a human being(Can I slide down this hill without breaking my ankle?).  The cartography mechanics are amazing, and a great way to expand on exploration.			"

												The concepts around mapping were interesting, and I think the game has promise, but the character's running physics is a combination of ice skating and oil tanker piloting.  And his stalker-phone-call heavy breathing every time he gets above a leisurely stroll is kind of annoying after a while.  All in all, with the plodding movement, the first hour I played just felt laborious and tedious, when it should've been an exciting exploration adventure.I'd love to see this game polished up a bit.  It really does seem like a good game with a few fatal flaws.			"

												A quite good indie game about survival. It's you vs the elements. This survival game takes the idea to a new level, turning survival out of a tag-on to other genres (survival-horror, survival-action, etc.) and fully into a genre in its own right - the survival genre.Further, you will learn from this game. Given a few hours of gameplay, you'll understand deeper how to use maps, compasses, and landmarks to find your way (including how to make your own), to make you that much better at survival in real life.

												The world of Miasmata is so wonderful, especially the day and night simulation. The main goal in this game is to stay alive and to find unique plants...yes that's it! That's a big factor which drives many players away! But there are some unique features in this game like cartography and the realistic walking system. Even being hunted by a strange creature I got really bored afterwards from walking around and not to able to find the last plant! There is so much potential in this game, if they added more content and features, the game would be a big hit. Unfortunately they stopped supporting this game :( If you really like to explore and feel being hunted, give this game a try! Thx for reading!			"

												It's pretty boring. It took a handful of months to finish it, because I only played it for a little bit at a time per month, and I wasn't even the one who finished it. My brother did. He played it more often than I did. He and I tortured our eyes by having to look at the terrible hand animations, bored to death by the monotonous and simple gameplay, frustrated to insanity by f***ing awful mapping system, not scared at all by the beast, and eventually giving up on trying to explore every crevice of the repetitive island (very VERY slowly advancing because of the mapping system) and pulling up a walkthrough to find the necessary plants just to see the ending. Turns out, the ending sucked balls as well! After creating the cure and swimming to that island that's out of your reach, you find a row boat, get inside, row away, and fall asleep on the boat...the end. All around, a huge wast of time and what little money I payed to play this game.Really, I thought this game was unfinished. It felt like I was playing an extremely early alpha of a game. I thought this game had potential, until I found out that it was finished.			"

												BUY THIS GAME!!!  this game is what game development should be all about - these guys literally built their own game engine themselves, and they continue to make improvements and will continue to do so until the product is as close to perfect as practically possible.  The gameplay is awesome, if you love exploring, beautiful landscapes, mystery, and crafting (you will learn some botany to boot) with a bit of danger. Dont expect fps style action.  There are a very few rough edges, and optimization needs to get better, but it will, these guys answer almost every post on the forums and are just freaking rock stars.So put down that cuntastic EA / Activision / Ubisoft game and do something Good with your money!

												In light of recent epiphanies I have had regarding my dislike of this game I have come up with a new, conciser review, but will keep the old one for... posterity or whatever.New Version:This game is a pioneer of the genre of early-access survival games, from before early-access even existed. Games like these feature a few neat gimmicks, a loosely established goal, and a veneer of realism, but are plagued by bugs and shoddy mechanics that are doomed to never be fixed. Today these games sit in the early-access section getting trivial updates every month or so until suddenly the developers get bored or realize that nobody is buying their game anymore and they give up. The game is left unfinished and forgotten.Miasmata gives the impression of being one of these forgotten end-products, except someone accidentally gave it a full release.Old Version:I was mildly enjoying this game until I accidentally strayed from the exact path the game wanted me to follow and I became hopelessly lost, unable to chart anything on my map, because obviously you can't map anything without a reference that is already on your map! You can't like start a new map and combine it with your old one later or something! That would be silly!Other assorted problems:The flame of the lighter has a faint green square around it where transparency is supposed to be.Trees produce an unnatural aura of darkness.Night is pitch black and if you aren't near a bed you basically have to stand around for 15 minutes until the sun rises.Falling over gives you a debilitating illness. (SO REALISTIC)Your character seems to think slopes are about twice as steep as they actually are.The monster is really dumb and it's hard to tell if you can even interact with it because its behavior makes no sense.I think there's some other glitchy stuff but I don't remember. I last played this game like over a year ago.Good things:The interface with the journal and the water bottle and medicine and stuff is pretty cool.Collecting flowers and mushrooms and making stuff is pretty cool I guess.The concept of the map making is pretty cool.That's about it.

												While it may sound like a back-handed comment, the only praise I have for this game is ""Nice try"" with ""try"" being the key word. It mostly feels like an illness simulator, with the core gameplay/goals centered around curing yourself. When I was told I was thirsty, it said to drink from a body water or a pitcher. So I immediatly went to the nearest body of water, only to find my knife missing due to swimming and unable to drink the water; no indication as to what is or isn't drinkable. More narrative seems to be what's missing from this game, and while I understand the concept of ""figuring things out"" as a desireable way of pacing a game, it falls short. I find it almost unplayable, which is a shame. It's core concept is fantastic.			"

												With the first trailer i was hooked for a survival sim, but while i played the game it become fast a big disappointment.The game has 3 main game mechanics: discovering ( with a unique trainqulation/map system and a bit story telling), creating medicine ( thought finding, anaylsing and mixing the ingredients) and surviving (care the fever with medicine and water, avoiding monsters, sleeping at night and use fire/light to enlight or defense)I like the idea to discover new plants and research the right medicine for your fever/plague and the variety is big, but it´s getting fast boring.My biggest problem is the broken and clumys player momvent. It take so long to climb a flat hill and you rush so fast down hill. Turning around and move left/right/back is slowly and is disproportionate sluggish by contrast with straight foreward. This sounds like a no big deal, but it´s so fundamental to this kind of game and it´s broken and frustrated me fast :( I wish they  take more time to the balancing and make some testing. It´s seems pretty unpolished.It feels so un-sastisfaying to discover or travel around the map with this problems. Also there are many other bugs like sound cliping errors, menu glitches, texture rendering bug and many more.Even on the hightes graphic settings it looks like and feels like a game from 2005.I know it´s hard to make a good game with two persons with such big world (ambition), but its even leaking the basics of game design, so I can´t recommend this game :(All the best for the next project!

												This is one of those unpolished ""games"" that takes minimalism - and itself - too seriously. Ultimately, it's the little things that make this game unenjoyable.1. ""What the heck am I seeing?""When you shave off so much of the UI as to be non-existant, you defeat the purpose. There is almost no in-game text to help discern what you are looking at. I am not a botanist, so don't expect me to instantly categorize and identify each plant the game presents. Since textures are recycled so much, it is impossible to discern or orient yourself (see gripe #3).2. ""What the heck am I hearing?""Put simply, the sound is atrocious. It lacks true ambience, and the music only comes up in the menu. Most annoying is the fact that the same bass effect is used for being preyed upon by predators AND the sound of your heart when you strain yourself, so after one too many encounters you cannot tell if your character is just paranoid or stupid.3. ""Where the heck am I?""Getting lost sucks. It isn't fun to try to figure out where you are. Coming back to the game later means having almost no idea where anything is anymore. You get a map, but you have to fill it in manually by way of triangulation... except that the surroundings are so thick that you cannot view almost any landmark - and no, you cannot look through the foliage. The fact that you are under pressure of a disease means meandering about aimlessly is not an option... which takes us to gripe number 4.4. You can only carry one of anything.I spent hours of game time harvesting ingredients and making multiple doses of key medicines, only to find later that I only had one dose in my inventory. The game never tells you that your giant pillbox can hold only a single dose of anything. I get easily fifty mints in an Altoid tin, so don't tell me this is even close to the realism they otherwise try to evoke.5. Immersion is great, until it becomes boring.Walking simulators have to strike a fine balance between distance and speed, and this game strikes out on this concept. After the third time getting exhausted for having to sprint, it gets annoying. The environments aren't so spectacular that I can enjoy these woods. Firewatch got it much better. Look, I get that the character is supposed to be some weakling geek, but asthma sucks enough in real life without needing to bring it into a game. What next, ""chemo sim 1995, where you get to watch your body rot!"" - no thanks.6. Slopes and momentum are not your friend.More to the point, you have all the control of a drunkard. Walking along a slight bank, only to have the angle shift juuuust enough so that the game decides you get to take a tumble downhill is just aggravating. 7. Tools get lost with a sneeze, but plant samples? Deathgrip!The game tries so hard to be realistic but the fact that if you swim or fall then you are forced to drop weapons, yet your samples remain grasped firmly in hand is contradictory. Annoying design choices are blatant for being sophomorish. 8. Food is unnecessary, apparently!Exertion, exhaustion, strain, thirst, carrying capacity... all of these are carefully tracked in the game. Survival should incorporate food/hunger. Maybe I never got that far in the game, but after 4 days in the game world, you would expect some grumblies in the tumblies. Rabbit is tasty!9. Critters. Critters everywhere, and more silent than ninjas!Add them to the ambience, or let us kill them for food. The fuzzy animals should make fine eats, but the varmints and vermin are purely atmospheric. 10. Useless samples are uselessLiterally, why bother at all? I get it, some of them don't make medicines. However the fact that this botanist can't turn them into deterrents for predators is ludicrous. Since the UI is so minimal, there is literally no way to drop the useless stuff. Worst of all, using them in crafting wastes the useful materials - you have to figure that out, however, the hard way.11. You cannot escape the menuThis seems like a minor gripe, but it is like I said at the start that the little things add up. Having to click out of the menu that you can only access by way of the ESC key is just another example of how the developer fails to understand basic concepts of UX.TL;DR: This game is just bad. Play it if you enjoy role-playing a suffering, dying, asthmatic dweeb with zero survival skills and no preservation instinct.			"

												All around decent, Its fun and challenging. On the other hand its graphics are not all that impressive, mechanics could use a little polishing, gets boring after so much time playing and despite the clear objective most of the time is spent wandering aimlessly in hopes that maybe you will find some sort of clue that will send you in a very general direction. It is fun but if you are going to buy it wait til it goes on sale.			"

												As the only person in my friends list to have purchased this game, I feel its only fair to leave a review,Miasmata is essentially a realistic survival horror (minus the need for food)Your goal is to find various plants and combine them to make a medicine that will cure you of your disease, its sort of like a more complex form of slenderTo my knowledge, there are no monsters, no people, no ghosts or anything supernatural, just wild animals and one in particular that wants to kill you. Miasmata does not go out of its way to scare you, but I feel this works more in its favor then against it. The fear comes from concepts that are very real and very obvious, you can die in the wilderness, or get lost.there are scraps of a map scattered throughout the game, but there is no pointer that shows where on the map you are, so i suggest relying on bodies of water and your compass to tell you where you are and which way you need to go.TL;DRmore of an amnesia style of horror, except with no monsters and its in the wild, is it worth 15 dollars? Probably not, but they do seem like they put a lot of work and originality behind it, so i'd suggest either wait for a sale or pay them the full 15 to show your support.			"

												   This game was definitely not what I expected. It sounded like such a good game but I knew 5 minutes into the game that it wasn't going to be very good. The controls are very clunky and the graphics are a bit lacking. I understand that this is a pretty low-budget game but this game promised more than it could deliver. It is just plain and boring. No fun at all.To sum it up:-Bad Graphics-Clunky Gameplay-Doesn't Deliver-Nothing to do/Boring			"

												Greetings, comrades! I bought this game quite a while ago, and I really wanted to love this game. However I found it impossible to do so, which is a shame. Alright, let's go!Pros:Beautiful environment, simply brilliant graphics, with the weather patterns, day/night cycle, and the flora and fauna all fully realized and vibrant. Honestly, this game would be worth sale price simply for the graphics if you appreciate games like that.The mapping system is unique and realistic, but not TOO real as to render it not fun. In other words, it's as real as a game can make it while still being a game. I really enjoyed walking around just mapping the island. Definitely this is the game's strongest point.Cons:While the environment is well done, the detail on the hands and arms of the player are absolutely ATROCIOUS! Bad enough that, to this day, I use the term ""Miasmata hands"" to reflect a poorly designed first-person model. They could have at least used the standard cop-out of putting a watch or bracelet on the player's wrist to at least ease the pain of having to look at 2 ham shanks on the end of bologna rolls.The plot. Spoiler alert, your character is ill, and you must find a cure. I believe this to be an unnecessary handicap in the early game, and I personally found it insurmountable due to the rather boring nature of the quest. Also, you can't do too much in the way of travelling or running around until you found the cure.The ""creature"" is just a joke. I will say no more, just take my word for it.The controls are some of the worst I've ever seen. When you move the mouse, there's a delay in the motion, and when you stop, the camera ""shakes"" and your hands lapse over where you stopped the movement. It's really hard to describe, almost like it takes time to gain and lose momentum when looking. The same thing happens when you walk or run, which can be the death of you if you're near an edge you didn't see. Also, this same delay is present in everything you do, which is really annoying.I wish this game were better, as the concept could have been great. I just can't give this game a positive review due to all its faults.Thanks for reading, and have an awesome day! "

												This is a bad game, don't buy it.Your character controls like a drunk, stumbling all over the place and incapable of ascending a gentle slope at faster than crawling pace.  The game crashes when leaving the ESC menu.  There are a ton of cases where the wrong models are used during plant analysis.  The achievements are glitched to hell.You are in more danger of dying from tumbling down perfectly climbable inclines than you are of getting killed by the 'creature'.  Speaking of the creature, I met it once after playing for a couple hours.  You get a warning that it's nearby via a loud heartbeat.  There's no indication of what direction it's in, and if you see it out of cover it will see you.  However it doesn't really move very fast so if you just run away you're fine.  Despite what the store page says, it doesn't really track you- it just randomly spawns near you.  So, just run in practically any direction and you're fine until it randomly spawns near you again.  Pointless.  Oh and if it hits you, you die instantly.The landmark system sounds clever except for the fact that trees and inclines seem to be placed specifically so that you can't see landmarks most of the time.  Also there seem to be no sanity checks involved.  You can walk like 10 feet for a second triangulation to verify where distant landmarks are, and can use landmarks that are in line with you to verify your own position.  There's no minimum angle between landmarks or minimum distance between triangulations.Health is represented solely by how sick you are.  So, falling down a cliff gives you a fever, rather than bruises.  There's food on the island but you can't eat any of it because it's all half-rotten fruit.  You can supposedly drink from any non-saltwater source, but I already found a river that I couldn't drink from.This game is a MESS.			"

A Paladin’s Updated Review: Miasmata. Don’t Bother Stalking This Ugly Beast.Genre: First Person Survival/Adventure Open Worldish Title.Developed & Published by: IonFXPlatform: Windows only.Business Model: Single PurchaseCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsYou play as Robert Hughes, a scientist who has come to an island named Eden (subtle) to cure an unnamed plague that he’s been stricken by. He hopes to meet up with a group of scientists to to work on figuring out the cure but upon arrival, he finds one of them dead and clearly something has gone wrong. What suggests to be a murder though quickly fades into the background. If there was a murderer(s) on the island, the game almost seems to forget about it after the opening ten minutes of the game. Instead, it decides to focus its attention on the crafting system and surviving the creature prowling the island to eventually fixing the cure. What little story that’s there isn’t really enough to capture my attention. Not when we’re talking about unknown persons on an unknown island trying to cure an unknown plague for themselves and an unknown number of people. If there is more lore to this game, it takes far too long to get there. What you’re left with is “surviving” the island.Gameplay ExaminationThe game features a creature that they claim will stalk you for miles, lurking behind grasses, vegetation and overall trying to hunt you down. It’s supposed to be a smart AI but it isn’t. The AI doesn’t do a very good job of hunting the player down and can easily lose sight of the player behind a thin tree. Simply outrunning it is also a viable option which really dampens the threat it has. One particular event in the game really showed me how poorly designed the AI had been. I had been heading towards a new part of the island to find more ingredients for the cure. I was walking along, seeing birds fly about when I started hearing my character’s heartbeat. So, I found some grass to hide in and crouched down. The game’s UI will warn you when the creature has spotted you. Which is interesting considering how much the devs tried to go out of their way to avoid using traditional UI before this point. There is only a limited amount of UI used, instead the game relies on in-game items like a paper map and journal to display information. It carries all of your notes, information you research and current status. It’s a pretty neat, if clunky, and in need of further polish.So, I waited for the creature to pass me by. After it did, I moved further into the island towards another outpost. Along the way there, I found a pond and I heard my character’s heartbeat going faster. The creature had found me. So, I move down the ledge, hid behind a thin tree and crouch to find out where it was. It was up on the ledge, looking for me. It then came down the ledge, awkward animations and all, going right past me. It should have spotted me at that point but apparently this super hunter is incredibly bad at hunting. It goes down to the water and circles about, unaware of where I am so I decide to test how good its “vision” is. It finally does spot me, when I had gotten far closer than I should have been able to, so I try to back off. It wasn’t having any of that so I stood my ground and decided to fight. The creature swipes a paw at me and…..nothing happens. I’m moving around a little bit but I should have been easily hit. It swipes a couple more times and still nothing happens. I decide to run away. Despite the creature following me, I suffer no damage and am able to run away. Then it gets stuck on a wall that I went around and stood there impotently growling at me. I stood there, sorely disappointed.PC Settings and Audio/VideoThe performance of Miasmata is pretty poor and older hardware will have a tough time running it. As stated before, the visuals for this game are ugly, poorly defined and lacking color. Miasmata has aged very badly in the years since I first played it. The graphics and overall style just feels ugly. I’m not even sure why it got or continues to get praise for its graphical fidelity when games that came out a year prior look far and away better than it does. Nothing is really appealing, with a world darkened by grey hues and lack of color outside of grass and the occasional flower. It’s a game that’s just draining on the eyes, if the mechanics aren’t draining on the player. There are very rare moments when the game might look good but these are outweighed by a world that needed a lot more development time. To at least make an island that would be genuinely more interesting to explore. As it stands, there’s just a lot of grass, trees, streams, beaches some flowers and small hills to run around. Nothing really peaks my curiosity about the place. Audio design is in bad need of an overhaul. While the soundtrack is reasonable, the audio atmosphere is lacking most of the time and there are plenty of sound effects missing.Final ThoughtsIt’s a very two dimensional exploration and survival game. There’s no real incentive for exploring the island. The only items that can be found are barely usable weapons, torches and flowers. That’s it. There’s no reason to explore the island for its graphics, that’s for certain.Few games have ever shattered my immersion so completely like Miasmata has done in this genre. Upon seeing the creature’s easily gameable flaws and generally being worn down by the uninteresting mechanics, I had enough. This game is just ugly, both mechanically and visually. The crafting system is a bore, the triangulation navigation system is repetitive and unrewarding and just traveling around the island can be the biggest threat to your survival, not the creature. The visual style has a sense of being constantly dirty and faded out that it drains me to even look at it. This is a game that had such promise but ultimately falls short. A custom engine that didn’t do anything that unique at the time, a premise that in the right hands could be a lot of fun but was clearly not in those hands. It didn’t help that it got very little post-release support but I guess that’s unsurprising in this case. IonFX has been very quiet since Miasmata was released to the point that I think the company may have failed. Simply put, a lot better games have come out since Miasmata and are worth your attention more than this one. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												Physics felt very clunky, like I was a massive bowling ball trying to survive on an island.  I struggled to figure out the controls.  Wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing besides picking flowers, nothing apparently, so it got boirng.  I only played a little but I didn't see the ""creature.""  I would like this a bit more if I felt comfterable looking through this characters eyes and controlling it, but I wasn't.  I also don't like being lost in the woods at night feeling drunk and falling off cliffs.  Once you start moving you slide all over the place.  I will give it this, its beautiful, bravo, keep up the good work!  But whats with that Goldeneye 64 breathing sound effect?  Seriously, I'm sure its great if you like this sort of thing but I couldn't handle feeling like a giant bowling ball trying to walk and fit places.			"

												A fascinating survival/exploration game made by only 2 ppl. Very beautiful graphics with a lot of love put into it.You are playing a scientist (first person view) who suffers from the plague and is looking for a cure on an empty island. Well empty except of some sort of beast that hunts you.Most of the time you are exploring the island, search for the right formula for your medicine, collect flowers and do some research on the,Every now and then you will encounter the beast, you can't fight it you can only run or hide which makes a great atmosphere.

												This game is a must buy. It is so complex yet when you get the basics down you're an expert navigator. Getting lost at night is horrifying, hell, getting lost in general in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing hell.♥♥♥♥♥♥like this happens though, you just need find a general direction and head off. When your heart beats, don't run, calmly walk into a bush until it passes. The creature is a damn nightmare so be careful. It's a bit buggy but the overall game is more than playable. It's insanely immersive almost to the point where I felt depressed swimming to the final island and setting sail after finding the cure. I miss exploring this new land...I miss that beating heart warning you to hide or ♥♥♥♥ing book it... I miss failing at triangulating my position when I got lost... I miss the creature... I miss him so much... I wish there was more information on him... Insanely great game, 8/10 (due to it being a bit buggy)			"

Meh.Poor balancing on how quickly you get tired; an inconvenient at best, tiresome and erratic at worst, system for discovering your map, and a myriad of mediocre survival indie tropes - an unimpressively simple-yet-time-consuming-to-get-ingredients crafting system.But none of those things compare to the physics engine. Oh god the physics engine. It's like you get a zany supervillan with overly elaborate gravity ray that randomly shoots the player, sending them into a mild tumble. This is your main obstacle. It makes sense if this were to trigger for you deciding to randomly jump off a cliff, but it does it a lot on the tiniest of mounds and steps.The bottom line is, it's just not fun. At all. I'm embarrassed how many hours I've racked up on it, but I guess I thought I would try get my money's worth or something. Don't try that. Your time is worth more than that.I have reasonable small-time studio expectations on what graphics are capable of being produced. But... visually everything is just a little too clunky, obtuse and unrefined to keep the atmosphere going. It's just short of bridging the gap. A strong point however is how diverse the island is, a respectable effort into the island's design is definitely there.  tl;dr: There are so many other games that do every feature you find here much better, and aren't necessarily expensive. The Forest is one that comes to mind. Maybe give it a shot if you're a die hard. There are worse games out there. "

												This is an excellent game. Miasmata has one of the most detailed 3D worlds I have ever seen in a game, including birds, beetles, bugs, frogs... all the things you would expect to see wandering around on an island in a lush tropical forest. The map is huge. The story in the game is a great excuse to explore this emmersive world! 10/10			"

												I really liked this game.I didn't at first, I wanted to as soon as I saw it but when I started playing there were things that I really didn't like about it. The controls felt clunky and it bugged the hell out of me that you could only carry a couple of things at once.But then the uniqueness of the whole experience starts to rub off on you, it's got this mapping system that makes you triangulate yourself based on landmarks you've seen when you knew where you were already.. if that makes any sense. It's good, it's not like anything I've seen in another game.I honestly spent a large amount of time in this game quite lost in random places. Because your characters sick and it's also a survival horror game, being completely lost is stressful but it adds to the experience.I'd very much recommend this game if the idea of playing an exploration based game appeals to you, the survival horror aspects aren't jump scares but more this constant feeling of paranoia / stress that accompanies exploring anywhere you've not been before.

												It looks and functions like it was made in Alice.  Yeah, its that bad.Let me tell you, even on maximum the game doesn't actually look like the screenshots they provided you there.  It looks like... well it looks like a late 90s PC game.  Not to mention it has this wierd flickering affect with all the textures, which gave me a headache.  The controls are clunky, and you move at a snail pace, even if you try to run.  Given that most of the game is covering lots of ground to discover things and explore, this is pretty frustrating.  Also it has some of the most boring, unexplained gameplay I've ever discovered in a LONG time.  The lab... is very tedious and unnecessary way to get temporary buffs.			"

												Do you enjoy running around doing nothing for hours on end with the coordination of a 3 year old? Then this game may be just right for you!  Simply put, this game is incredibly boring.  It's a neat idea, but the execution and sheer lack of anything to do just makes it mind numbling awful to play.  You play as a scientist trying to find a cure for a disease you have by experimenting with various plants throughout the island you're trapped on.  So literally the entire game is running around a giant island looking for plants, coming back to a lab to test then, rinse and repeat until you get your cure.  Honestly it wouldn't be too bad if the game mechanics worked ok, but as said in my opening line you have about as much coordination as a mentally handicapped racoon.  Combine that with such other wonders as drowning in 3 inches of water, and you get a game who's soul aspect is exploration with incredibly aggravating controls to perform said exploration.			"

tl;drNeat ideas very poorly executed.  2/10Ps & Cs+ Neat concept -- become a scientist and make your own cure+ Neat use of map -- use the environment to triangulate your location- Looks downright terrible- Stopping is like wearing skates- Always sick, always tired, always thirsty- You may carry one  item -- ""hmmm, this banana or this knife...""Nitty GrittyI wanted to like this game and it seems like a cool idea just terribly executed.  In the 30 minutes I played inventory became an issue 30 times.  You may carry exactly 1 item, and if you're going to swim, you'll just drop the item at the bottom of the lake.  A torch!  Better chuck my knife on the ground to use it!  A banana!  Better chuck that torch on the ground to use it!  You have to cure your fever every day, that means you have to make medicine, which is fine.  However as you can only carry one flower, you have to pick it, create the pills, take them, and then run back to the bush to get a single flower for tomorrow and make more pills.  I think with some kind of an inventory system this game could have been decent, as it is now it is 0% fun.  I picked it up on sale for $2.99 and quite frankly would have been furious had I paid full price.  2/10			"

												Okay, I haven't played much of the game yet, but this is what I think and why I won't finish the game.Story aside the game seems to aim to be realistic. You can pick up rocks and throw them, you can pick up wood and make a torch, you have to drink regularly, you need to triangulate your location on a map instead of having a pointer that shows you exactly where you are at anytime etc. Yet this makes the game feel even weirder in other parts. The character moves is pretty unrealistic, you cannot swim (maybe you can train it), the triangulation works perfectly (if you figured out how) without any kind of equipment to measure distances or calculate or anything. The research is ridiculous, you grab a flower go to a shack with a microscope (and they are miraculously all over the island) cut it up, put it under the microscope and suddenly you know exactly that this thing is very effective in curing fever...if only real life science would be that easy.To top things off the inventory is amazing, not that you could carry infinite amounty of stuff, no...you can carry everything that fits in your hand...and only one hand at a time.It is cruel to the devs, but this game is for me nothing more than a redoing of the Slender Man game with more stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥in it.Edit:After playing it some more I stand with my previous review.

												Looking for an exciting game?Look somewhere else.What I was looking for I was looking for a survival based game, you know, hunt for food. Build shelter, try survive against the elements while your batteling this terrible disease. Try fight off creatures in the woods like Wolves, Bears, whatever... However, what I got was something much more boring and plain.What I gotHere is the jist of the game. You start out, dying, you have to go find plants and fungai to research to make medicine to cure your disease. Thats it!You wander around, finding plants. Your guy has to drink water to stay hydrated, also the controls are very clunky and blocky. Like walking on ice. Your guys slips and falls down small inclines all the time for no apparent reasons and there isn't much of stopping him. I see what they were attempting to do with the game. I like the idea, But it just feels very, unfinished and leaves the player wondering what there is to come. Your waiting for excitement and it never shows up. To put it plain, there is nothing about this game that will keep players coming back to it. It's not even a one hit wonder. It falls into a category that has stiff competition right now and there really is no apparent reason to play this game cause they got so many competitors that sell this genre to you and do it 100x better.Apparently there is also a creature that can attack you as well... Well. I have not seen him yet. The only thing to make you worried is this disease, but it's okay. There are plenty of plants to pick and thankfully many other games as well.			"

												While the concept might be interesting, this game is utterly ruined by it's awful controls. Why the developers felt that making the main character handle like train car was a good choice is beyond me. Also, the introduction cutscene is unskippable and there a obvious bugs that haven't (and probably won't ever) been fixed, like mouse controls locking out aftere closing the in-game map, lag issues when enabling v-sync etc.- Installed- played for ten minutes- got fed up with the controls- uninstalledMeh.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did, but I couldn't handle a lot of the issues in it. For one, when you strafe left and then start to strafe to the right you move forward a bit, that shouldn't happen... Then when you open the map you have the compus in your right hand, even though your body isn't moving if you turn your head the compuses direction changes, I'm 100% sure that that isn't supposed to happen. Then comes the rocks, you pick one up and when you press lmb the rock swings in a really awkward manner, I couldn't handle it. The jump height could also be increased a bit, that'd be nice. Until these issues are fixed avoid the game like the plague (hehe, get what I did there?) if you can't stand such a blatant disregard for realism!			"

The advertising screenshots paint a picture of a beautiful game, however, the picturesque environment is marred by an extremely clunky control system that makes you feel as if you're playing a First Person Perspective version of QWOP and gameplay that is so shallow and uninspired as to barely warrant the term gameplay at all.

												A suberbly beautiful game with some amazing visuals and a true survival horror. The first time I heard the heart beat signifying the creature was rather terrifying. Undercut slightly by some minor bugs and a rather awkward control scheme (make sure to install the patch from the community).			"

												I really enjoyed this game, which is saying alot, cause i really don't like horror games. The first long while is survival and exploration, and the closer you get to finding the cure, the monster appears more and more often, transitioning into a constant, look-over-your-shoulder horror. The monster itself isn't very scary...but when you can't defend yourself against it at all and you're so close to finding a new drug, that's scary on its own.Every new plant I found and researched was like a small achievement deserving a jump for joy, whether it was a simple antibiotic, a temporary boost to my stats, a part of a permanent change to my stats, or one of the key plants needed for the ultimate cure. NEVER have I been more excited about flora!What's bad about it is that there are alot of slippery slopes...literally. Due to the fact that you're traversing this seemingly empty island by foot with a increasingly degrading disease, a small slip could send you tumbling down a small hill, making your sickness worse and on top of dropping all flora you were currently holding. Though they can be found around the area of the fall, if night is quickly approaching, the creature is on the hunt, or whatever reason, chances are you'll have to trek back and pick more up, you clutz. Also, the view of the island is breathtaking, but the characters graphics, which consist of two arms, are glitchy and underdeveloped. You'll see what i mean when you see it.Start the game and you quickly realized that you are undeniably SCREWED. Finish the game, and feel like a champion for rising above such an imposing challenge.Worth buying? Yes.			"

												Think Amnesia mixed with Robinson Crusoe. The gem is a very unique indie survival horror game. Find a cure for your disease and get off the island. Most importantly, though, is to survive. The game is absolutely gorgeous, the island is incredibly huge and crawling with mystery, and the beast stalking you through the jungle will keep you on your toes at all times. Honestly one of the most unique and entertaining games I've played in a while.			"

												Miasmata has received some nice accolades but also some dissing about its graphics quality, performance and playing style. All criticisms are soft in the head and wide of the mark. There is no other game in existence that has such a complete, intuitive, rich and diverse simulation of nature in the wild. Immense care has gone into creating an edenic island with enchanting wildlife, from beetles, butterflies and frogs through squirrels to fluctuating weather conditions, wild storms and captivating sunsets. It is awesome and perfect by comparison with any other game on the market as of 4th Jan 2014. Some people have found the unrestricted wilderness exploration and cartography irritating or the beast too hard to handle. They collect a couple of plants and seem to get frustrated or bored. Others complain the sea which looks sumptuous as of Dec 2013 is lousy and unprofessional. This leaves me shaking my head in wonder. It's as if these people have become so used to a synthetic gamer's world where conflict is handed to you on a platter in spoon-fed form that when you come upon a game presenting a real life situation with actual bush crashing and navigation skills, even provided with countless prominent features such as the fire pillars and Easter Island heads on every high hill, you can't handle it. Wake up you pathetic dudes you are selling yourselves down the river, not the eden of Miasmata!			"

												For a game by just two developers Miasmata is really impressive. It's quite atmospheric, with the lighting and water effects in particular setting the tone, and the sound effects and music are solid.  It feels good to have no HUD and to be flicking through your journals for info instead of menus and holding up your compass instead of following a quest marker. What really sets this game apart is your character's fragility; you can't edge around and up steep hills like in Elder Scrolls games and such, and charging downhill will just cause you to trip and fall. It's a slow-paced game that mostly involves running from place to place, gathering ingredients and charting the island.However, it's all very rough around the edges. The graphics, particularly the textures, are very dated in places. The inventory system (your left hand) is slow, limited and frustrating. Don't expect combat- you can swing a knife around but it won't achieve anything other than looking bad. Ultimately, Miasmata still feels like a demo for a real game, or a sample project, but it's a very promising one. I'd love to see more from these guys- maybe not a polished Miasmata, but a similar adventure game with much higher production values.			"

												This is an interesting survival/adventure game.  Exploring the island was kind of neat.  Trying to find all the landmarks and get the entire map to show up is a bit of a challenge on its own.  There's a few buildings scattered around that you'll run into here and there that also have notes in them to give you an idea of what happened since you're all alone and don't have any idea what you're doing there.  I also liked collecting the various plants to craft painkillers and other drugs.  It almost made me wish there were more things to collect and craft than there are.My biggest complaint is a possible small spoiler, so I'll hide that next.  I found it kind of tedious once the creature starts showing up.  I was initially kind of excited the first time I saw it.  I tried to hide, but that didn't work out so well since it seemed to home in straight on me.  Pretty much when it first appears, it's not so bad since it only shows up once in a great while, but when you start progressing on your ""main quest"" it shows up more often.  By the time you're nearly finished with the quest, it's virtually impossible to avoid the thing.  I also had what I'd call worse than 50/50 success in hiding from it too even when I was in a spot that I was completely hidden from it at all times and not making any noise.  I even had a few times that I jammed myself between a tree and the side of a cliff that was completely hidden by leaves and grass and it still kept trying to walk straight at me even though we couldn't see each other (I know where it was walking since I had the skill that tracks the creature when you don't move).  The next small thing is when night falls and you don't have a light source, you're pretty much screwed.  It's completely black and you mostly end up literally rolling down hills on your face and/or falling into the water where you're likely to drown.  You learn real quick not to try going out at night without a torch in hand and another one nearby to take its place.Overall I found this to be an enjoyable game in spite of the complaints I have above.  It's worth a play through if you like exploring the unknown.			"

You can get lost if you fail to map properly . Your character can become sick/ thirsty if you don't look after them. And the beast that seeks you out (like the zombies in day Z) and hunts you while you are trying to find a cure for your plague. Highly recommend .			"

												Miasmata is a game that redefines what you might picture as a game. It's almost not a game, in some ways; the punishing sicknesses you can get wandering around the island, the analysis of different flora to cure the aforementioned afflictions, and the use of your surroundings and triangulation to determine your position on the map...all of these things are something a person would do in the given circumstances. As a huge fan of first person games, I really enjoy the fact that the arms and hands are put to realistic use as well, and how immersive and well thought out the environment is. It surprises me still to imagine two people working on something of this scope. It has its little quirks, and some of the kinks in the fabric haven't quite been worked out just yet, but if you're looking for something that isn't your run of the mill first person shooter or puzzler, this game is definitely worth checking out.

												Stunnningly good, if you like true exploration/survival type games.  The cartography system is awesome, and the crafting system is fun.  If anything it is too easy, there should be more challenge in finding the right plants, and maybe make the ones needed for the final cure be harder to get (e.g., difficult to get to, require certain time of day, etc.).  But overall, I enjoyed every second of it.  If you are interested in finding everything and getting those achievements, look out for the community patch and the miaschiev achievement tracker, it gives you information that is lacking in-game.

												Great game!  The more I played it - the more I enjoyed it.  It was uniformly challenging and rewarding on many levels - the story is engaging, and the environment absolutely beautiful to explore - the sights and sounds put you right there, struggling to survive and develop the cure.  I know that some took exception to the ""beast"" that occasionally stalks you, but early on, you are so weak that you are more likely to die from slipping and falling into deep water.  The beast is merely one more obstacle you need to plan for and deal with.  Know where to save, and plan your excusions carefully, and you will make steady progress as you reveal more and more of the island, gain medicines, and find your options and capabilities grow.

Huge diversity by ways of finishing the story and the graphics are nothing less than stunning. Every frame is stunning!

												Miasmata excels in creating a haunting atmosphere that is at once peaceful and tense.  I enjoyed exploring the island and learning the unique cartography system while keeping one ear out for the quickening heartbeat that signalled the creature's presence.  The paranoia of the creature's sudden and inevitable appearance kept me moving from save point to save point obsessively for fear I'd lose any progress I'd made in acquiring plant samples or additions to my map.  Overall Miasmata is an interesting mystery to solve with unforgiving physics (don't try to slide down the side of a cliff for a shortcut!) set against a beautiful yet dangerous backdrop.			"

												I havn't made any progress at all and I've never played a better exploration game. Miasmata gives some of the most intense immersive gameplay. It requires a really good amount of patience, you can't just jump in and want to kill everything you see, even at the start it puts you in somewhat of a dire situation, a good way to tell you the mechanics at the start instead of having you look for everything waiting to die as soon as you press play. This is the only game I've ever played that makes going down a hill the most intense experience ever. The map system doesnt give you your exact location and really forces you to look around, observe your surroundings, and makes for a real survival experience. The momentum takes a bit to get used to, but other than that, this is a very well made game, and I'm nowhere close to being done with it			"

												The unique real-world pacing of the game may be a tough pill to swallow, but if you can open your mind to feel the reality of isolation and being completely vulnerable while also being dependent of your environment, then be ready for a fullfilling and engaging experience. Being marooned and sick with the plague you will go through periods of frustration feeling helpless navigativing the island just trying to survive to the next day.  Though discovering new areas, clues to the mystery of the island, and finding new species of flora that will help you maintain your health are all satisfying moments that keep you moving forward.  Your worst enemy is most likely the danger of clumsily navigating steep cliffs or potentially drowing when caught in deep water, yet the silent presence of a single creature stalking you is never to far behind; adding a great sense of tension to the experience.  Also not keeping up your health with rest, medicines, and water, is a sure way to a quick demise.The feeling of helplessness being caught lost in the dead of night, waiting for morning to come.  Running and hiding from the island's lone predator while avoiding tumbling off a cliff and not dropping the much needed plant you just found, all wilst keeping your bearings on the nearest safe-haven.  These are some of the intense moments this unique survival game will deliver to you.The lack of way-points, weapons, and a traditional HUD, having to brutaly survey your map manually , and ""realisic"" way the character reacts and moves through movement may drive some gamers away.  But the sum of these parts, I feel, make for a completely unique and refreshing experience.Not without its flaws, but def one of my personal favorites of the year.  No guns-a-blazing, no special super-human abilities, no fellow travelers to help you here; just your wits and knowledge of the land will get you through this non-linear, challenging game of survival.

												The unique real-world pacing of the game may be a tough pill to swallow, but if you can open your mind to feel the reality of isolation and being completely vulnerable while also being dependent of your environment, then be ready for a fullfilling and engaging experience. Being marooned and sick with the plague you will go through periods of frustration feeling helpless navigativing the island just trying to survive to the next day.  Though discovering new areas, clues to the mystery of the island, and finding new species of flora that will help you maintain your health are all satisfying moments that keep you moving forward.  Your worst enemy is most likely the danger of clumsily navigating steep cliffs or potentially drowing when caught in deep water, yet the silent presence of a single creature stalking you is never to far behind; adding a great sense of tension to the experience.  Also not keeping up your health with rest, medicines, and water, is a sure way to a quick demise.The feeling of helplessness being caught lost in the dead of night, waiting for morning to come.  Running and hiding from the island's lone predator while avoiding tumbling off a cliff and not dropping the much needed plant you just found, all wilst keeping your bearings on the nearest safe-haven.  These are some of the intense moments this unique survival game will deliver to you.The lack of way-points, weapons, and a traditional HUD, having to brutaly survey your map manually , and ""realisic"" way the character reacts and moves through movement may drive some gamers away.  But the sum of these parts, I feel, make for a completely unique and refreshing experience.Not without its flaws, but def one of my personal favorites of the year.  No guns-a-blazing, no special super-human abilities, no fellow travelers to help you here; just your wits and knowledge of the land will get you through this non-linear, challenging game of survival.

												Miasmata excels in creating a haunting atmosphere that is at once peaceful and tense.  I enjoyed exploring the island and learning the unique cartography system while keeping one ear out for the quickening heartbeat that signalled the creature's presence.  The paranoia of the creature's sudden and inevitable appearance kept me moving from save point to save point obsessively for fear I'd lose any progress I'd made in acquiring plant samples or additions to my map.  Overall Miasmata is an interesting mystery to solve with unforgiving physics (don't try to slide down the side of a cliff for a shortcut!) set against a beautiful yet dangerous backdrop.			"

												I havn't made any progress at all and I've never played a better exploration game. Miasmata gives some of the most intense immersive gameplay. It requires a really good amount of patience, you can't just jump in and want to kill everything you see, even at the start it puts you in somewhat of a dire situation, a good way to tell you the mechanics at the start instead of having you look for everything waiting to die as soon as you press play. This is the only game I've ever played that makes going down a hill the most intense experience ever. The map system doesnt give you your exact location and really forces you to look around, observe your surroundings, and makes for a real survival experience. The momentum takes a bit to get used to, but other than that, this is a very well made game, and I'm nowhere close to being done with it			"

												Superb Storyline! This is one of those rare open world games that you can really get into for a couple different reasons: Firstly, for the story and secondly for the immersion factor. It also still gives you that raised hair on your neck feeling during heightened moments of excitment despite not being a true orthodox action-packed thriller game. Huge diversity by ways of finishing the story and the graphics are nothing less than stunning. Every frame is stunning!

												When I first  tried this game for a few hours, I didn't like it. I thought the graphics were poor, the repetition of tasks irksome,   the fact that  my characters hands remained bloody however many times I  drank from water pools was ( and still is) annoying,  and the tension of trying to find somewhere to rest before dark or before the beast got me was  ever-present on  each new journey. Well... I have  restarted the game several times and, you could say, got used to it now, so my view point has amended. For one thing, I have discovered that the beast can be hidden from, if you are in the right terrain. He is not very bright, or maybe just short-sighted, as just hiding behind a rock near the waters edge works, so I feel there is more of a chance of survival once I hear that heart-beat. The limitation on how many  plant-species you can hold, and how many can be stored is another area of challenge, and I am getting desperate to find a successful match of two plants. All I have is 'one of each' in respect of mental acuity, strength,  agent y possibility, etc and all my six parking bays are full - and I need to  create some more  health boosters as well, so life is not easy! That is the point of the game, I suspect. If it were a breeze we would have lost interest and gone elsewhere before the map was half covered - and I haven't even covered a third of it yet. So, now I recommend it. Look past the minor irritants, try and keep one step ahead of dragon-creature ( why do some call it Milo I wonder?) keep looking for the right plants, and surviving WILL get easier sooner  or later... I hope..			"

												Miasmata is a fun and interesting game, but not without its flaws.Pros:-Disease survival aspect is done fairly well-World is beautiful and huge-Day/night cycles are realistic-Variety of interesting plants to find-Walking/gravity effect is also very realistic and makes the game more immersive (there's a real fear of momentum throwing you off a cliff instead of being able to magically stop at the last second.)Cons:-The ""Creature"" is a huge pain, and not in a good way. It feels broken most of the time and out of place.-No food is necessary, which takes away from the survival aspect a bit-A lot of the achievements are glitchy (search on the forums for the 3rd party fix before you start playing)In summary:If you're willing to put up with the annoyance of the Creature, it's worth picking up for people who like adventure/exploration and survival games.

												As pretty as it looks, Miasmata is literally un-playable because the walking mechanics are non-existent. The developers clearly tried to go for a realistic feel - your movement changes based on incline grades, your status, etc. - but unfortunately they forgot to sacrifice enough realism to play the game. Half the time your character walks like a penguin with polio, and as nice as it would be to take a slow waddle through the woods there's no place for that in the beginning of a survival game. While a bit of back-tracking is expected in this genre I found it too awkward to waddle from my home base to wherever I was headed again and again...not to mention only being able to hold one thing at a time, ignoring the pretty, well-designed map they gave you because everything's so close together...I could go on. If nothing else this teaches us to go back to basics and make things work before you make them pretty. (Like girlfriends. Or lawnmowers. Or ♥♥♥♥ing videogames.)			"

												Truely innovative game mechanics:- Triangulating to map island (mapping doesn't do itself as in other games)- climbing and character momentum/sliding (adds a lot of immersion and easier to lose yourself while exploring)- complex animal behaviorI find that momentum and sliding wasn't tweaked right and you'll find yourself falling down a cliff rather often but it can be modded to fix this issue. Main problem of this game: LAG. Game made by indie devellopers making there own game engine so poorly optimized. You have to have a strong rig and even with that, you won't play the game on best graphic options.In the end, this game is really innovative and other games should take exemple of it. It feels like with more funding, it could have brought even more to the table. Devellopers are working on a new game and i'm excited to see what innovative gameplay they come up with.			"

The cartography system really confused me until I got the hang of it. Now I enjoy discovering new parts of the island with the map. The story is not really strong during the game, but there is enough of it to make me question why my character is on the island and why all the other people are dead. This game is really unique and will draw you in as long as you have the patience for it.			"

												Miasmata is a fantastic game that is wonderfully differentiated from rest of the survival genre. Everything about this game is presented simply, yet contains a hidden amount of depth.  Note that this is an exploration game first, and the ""survival"" aspects are kept to a minimum so you can focus on discovering new terrain. That's not to say you won't have tense moments as you try to stay alive, just that you likely won't be bored by metagamey tasks that slow down the pace.The obscenely simple controls make this an easy game for anyone to enjoy, while the mesh of mechanics and environment provide unexpected nuance. Setting off on your mission, the fugly looking graphics quickly become less bothersome and the task at hand becomes paramount and enjoyable. As a spoiler-free tip, movement in this game has a strong sense of momentum, much more than most fps games. Keep this in mind and get used to holding down the back/reverse key to slow yourself, lest your sprint down a trail turn into a tumble.The well-told story isn't bogged down with gobs of dialogue, and is instead presented in a subtle manner via the environment. Much like Dark Souls/Bloodborne, this gives great weight to in-game accomplishments and creates a strong sense of emotional connection.Lastly, anyone who struggles with reading maps or has a poor sense of direction should DEFINITELY check out this game. It'll up your real-world confidence and skill in short order.That a game of this quality was created by two people is a heckuva feat, and I eagerly look forward to their next creation.			"

												There is something really beautiful about a game like this.  There aren't detailed textures, there's no combat, there's chunks of gameplay that seem almost pointless (like the hatchets and apples), yet even with these quirks, it has captured my attention.  You are thrown into this island with no map and you must explore the island to find plants to make an anti-toxin.  You conduct research on plants and use cartography skills to learn more about your environment.  There are notes scattered around the island that give you information about the last people to explore this island.  It's a world that you must discover for yourself.You must walk along the paths that are carved or you'll probably fall down a cliff.  The map that you draw has actual topographical lines that indicate the elevation, so you can look for areas that are easy to navigate versus the cliffs that you need to avoid.  You must take care to avoid wandering at night unless you are prepared.  Unlike other games, there is almost zero visibility at night.  You can easily be carefully walking just to accidentally slip off a cliff to your death.Watch your map and compass, they are your best tools for survival.  If you just walk around picking up a bunch of plants, you'll undoubtedly get lost and you'll probably die.  The world is beautiful so take time to see everything.  Read the notes, look at the maps, piece everything together.  If you want a patient, calming, gorgeous gaming experience, get this game right now.  I wish more games were like this.  I love exploration and it's nice to be able to explore the island without distractions.  Except for that one thing, but it's not a huge deal.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/07/13/miasmata/Miasmata is a minimalistic survival game where you play the researcher Robert Hughes. You're cast away on an island, suffering from some kind of plague, and your aim is to find a cure as soon as possible. Luckily, there has already been some kind of a research team on the island but something has happened to them...I will start by saying that Miasmata is terribly beautiful. The graphics isn't always perfect but all in all the environments are amazing. I am incredibly impressed by the two brothers who made this game and the game engine on which it runs. Miasmata is immersive; My first night playing I couldn't stop until four in the morning, when I reluctantly realized it was getting light outside.To find a cure for your plague you have to find and research the plants and fungi on the island. It sounds trivial, but in Miasmata there is noone to hold your hand. You have to make progress using the notebooks you find from the earlier research team and on your own findings. The game is completely open world and you have no checkpoints or route to follow.There is also no automatic map. Instead, you draw your map using triangulation. Two known landmarks give you your position on the map and is what you use to update your map. Other than that you have to use your compass and your memory. (Orienteerers probably have an advantage!)You have no classic menus or inventory, instead you check your log book where all your notes and research is saved. You can also check on how you are feeling and take drugs for fever or other conditions.These three elements: Open world, the map system, and the log book creates a massively immersive feeling. Every menu, note or inventory has a ""real"" representation in the game.Other than that Miasmata is a creepy game which gave me some big adrenaline rushes. Instead of jumpscares, Miasmata provides the unnerving feeling of always being followed (and the panic of being discovered). Nature is also an enemy: Climbing mountains isn't easy and if you run too fast down a slope you will fall. Hopefully you know where you are when you are back in control, but in worst case you are lost and have to start looking for known landmarks again.On the negative side: I have to admit I was on several occations frustrated and annoyed when my assiduous exploration was interrupted. (By what, I will not mention...) I actually even rage quitted several times (but only to start it again after a minutes). At the same time, this is part of what is charming with the game and what creates intensity.There are also some small bugs, but nothing that can't be easily solved.A final warning to those who want to be able to close down a game quickly: You can save only at given save points. They are many and spread widely, but it can be good to know if you are the kind of gamer that have to be able to close down with just some seconds notice.7/10 petals "

												I loved this game.  It's a first-person exploration / adventure game.  But instead of puzzles, there is a nifty mapping mechanic based on triangulation and finding landmarks and a search for plants that you can study and use to synthesize the medicines you need to survive.This game doesn't hold your hand and lead you through the plot.  There are no cut-scenes and no lousy voice-acting.  You have to piece the story together for yourself and decide where to go and what to do based on what you find as you explore the island.  And you can explore in pretty much any direction and any order you like.This is not your typical video-game power fantasy.  You start out as a character who is sick, can't swim, has trouble even walking around, and is in danger of tumbling down a steep incline and triggering a debilitating fever.  But the progression from sickness to health felt more empowering than the typical game that takes you from warrior to demigod.The graphics are not state-of-the-art.  This was made by a two-man team.  But the island is still a beautiful and interesting place to explore and the weather and time of day make a real difference in what you see and what you can do.  It feels like a real place that remains vivid in my mind months later.			"

The game runs well, but the character itself is very hard to manuever, and handling objects is equally hard.

												I'd been thinking about getting this game for some time, after seeing it on Steam and being intrigued by the concept of survival, exploaration and tension. There are so many elements to this game: exploration (including cartography), research (plants and fungi can be examined and synthesised to create medicines, enhancements and a cure) and survival (against the island itself and the creature that inhabits it. It's hard to believe that two brothers created a game so interesting and well-executed. I'm enjoying it very much. On a personal note: Thank you to the Johnson brothers for allowing me to choose my own key bindings. Something that many larger developers ignore (H1Z1 and Miscreated being good examples). Highly recommended.			"

												I really wanted this to be a great survival game that gets away from the meticulous crafting or cheap scares category that's been overdone in so many other games. This fell short, sadly. I felt like I was nothing more than a pill pusher, with the survival bit consisting entirely of not dying slowly from what we hope is some non-communicable disease.I had no problems with the environment in this game or especially how it was presented. The atmosphere itself was outstanding, beautiful during the day and eerie at night. Sound and ambiance both were fantastic as well. Mapping and discovery on the island was actually pretty smart.The problems start when you first starting moving around.....(jello-ing around?). Your character walks quite realistically, tripping and not immediately changing direction. It's neat for about 5 whole minutes, funny for the first few rolls down a hill/cliff, and then you just want it to stop. Then you survive. Pick some flowers and moss then run back to a shed to science it up, you got some pills...repeat. Lastly the demon creature that's on the island failed to meet the hype for me. I ran across it, actually chased after it for whatever reason, and nothing happened....sigh.			"

												I would recommend this game but with some reservations. I am enjoying the problem solving aspect of the game very much. I am close to finishing and can't stop playing. The game is pretty monotonous, though. You do the same thing over and over, but I don't really mind that. I like to alternate between high action games and more low-key discovery/problem solving games. So, in that sense it's a winner. If you like high action, this is not your game. There is a bad glitch I keep encountering more and more. Ocassionally the character freezes up and won't turn right or left. If you haven't saved for a while (which you can only do at certain locations), then you are screwed - you have to restart the game and you lose all of your progress.			"

												I just finished playing over 30 leisurely hours of gameplay on Miasmata. I LOVE this kind of game and got completely lost in this world. The only help I needed was on orienteering and some ways to get rid of the creature.  The graphics were beautiful , especially on my new Alienware computer :) The ending was awesome and I miss the islands already. Thank you and more, more, more!!!!			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/07/13/miasmata/Miasmata is a minimalistic survival game where you play the researcher Robert Hughes. You're cast away on an island, suffering from some kind of plague, and your aim is to find a cure as soon as possible. Luckily, there has already been some kind of a research team on the island but something has happened to them...I will start by saying that Miasmata is terribly beautiful. The graphics isn't always perfect but all in all the environments are amazing. I am incredibly impressed by the two brothers who made this game and the game engine on which it runs. Miasmata is immersive; My first night playing I couldn't stop until four in the morning, when I reluctantly realized it was getting light outside.To find a cure for your plague you have to find and research the plants and fungi on the island. It sounds trivial, but in Miasmata there is noone to hold your hand. You have to make progress using the notebooks you find from the earlier research team and on your own findings. The game is completely open world and you have no checkpoints or route to follow.There is also no automatic map. Instead, you draw your map using triangulation. Two known landmarks give you your position on the map and is what you use to update your map. Other than that you have to use your compass and your memory. (Orienteerers probably have an advantage!)You have no classic menus or inventory, instead you check your log book where all your notes and research is saved. You can also check on how you are feeling and take drugs for fever or other conditions.These three elements: Open world, the map system, and the log book creates a massively immersive feeling. Every menu, note or inventory has a ""real"" representation in the game.Other than that Miasmata is a creepy game which gave me some big adrenaline rushes. Instead of jumpscares, Miasmata provides the unnerving feeling of always being followed (and the panic of being discovered). Nature is also an enemy: Climbing mountains isn't easy and if you run too fast down a slope you will fall. Hopefully you know where you are when you are back in control, but in worst case you are lost and have to start looking for known landmarks again.On the negative side: I have to admit I was on several occations frustrated and annoyed when my assiduous exploration was interrupted. (By what, I will not mention...) I actually even rage quitted several times (but only to start it again after a minutes). At the same time, this is part of what is charming with the game and what creates intensity.There are also some small bugs, but nothing that can't be easily solved.A final warning to those who want to be able to close down a game quickly: You can save only at given save points. They are many and spread widely, but it can be good to know if you are the kind of gamer that have to be able to close down with just some seconds notice.7/10 petals "

												I loved this game.  It's a first-person exploration / adventure game.  But instead of puzzles, there is a nifty mapping mechanic based on triangulation and finding landmarks and a search for plants that you can study and use to synthesize the medicines you need to survive.This game doesn't hold your hand and lead you through the plot.  There are no cut-scenes and no lousy voice-acting.  You have to piece the story together for yourself and decide where to go and what to do based on what you find as you explore the island.  And you can explore in pretty much any direction and any order you like.This is not your typical video-game power fantasy.  You start out as a character who is sick, can't swim, has trouble even walking around, and is in danger of tumbling down a steep incline and triggering a debilitating fever.  But the progression from sickness to health felt more empowering than the typical game that takes you from warrior to demigod.The graphics are not state-of-the-art.  This was made by a two-man team.  But the island is still a beautiful and interesting place to explore and the weather and time of day make a real difference in what you see and what you can do.  It feels like a real place that remains vivid in my mind months later.			"

												I havn't made any progress at all and I've never played a better exploration game. Miasmata gives some of the most intense immersive gameplay. It requires a really good amount of patience, you can't just jump in and want to kill everything you see, even at the start it puts you in somewhat of a dire situation, a good way to tell you the mechanics at the start instead of having you look for everything waiting to die as soon as you press play. This is the only game I've ever played that makes going down a hill the most intense experience ever. The map system doesnt give you your exact location and really forces you to look around, observe your surroundings, and makes for a real survival experience. The momentum takes a bit to get used to, but other than that, this is a very well made game, and I'm nowhere close to being done with it			"

												This game is awesome. It really feels like you are wandering around - and getting lost! - on a smallish isnland. It's a survival horror game where you are seeking a cure for your disease - while something is hunting you. A group of scientists found the cure here, but they are a little bit dead now and the formula has to be re-discovered. Can you find a cure for the Plague before you become Purina Monster Chow?I also suggest that you read General Rye's negative review. His reasons for hating it are reasons why I like it. Yes, it seems like you are a 300 pound clod stumbling around an island - just like a real person, and not some uber-marine from your local FPS. You know what happens at night? It gets dark! Why the heck would you be wandering around in the dark when there's some freaky monster wandering around? Also, the game penalizes you for being awake all day (a neat  thing that few games do), with moments of exhaustion, which can be remedied by (strangely enough) sleeping!I'd like to see a sequel.			"

												This game is one of the most intriguing and interesting games I have ever played. The entire storyline opens how you choose, as the entire island is yours to explore. The triangulation system the game uses is absolutely genius and is a great addition to the game. Overall, the game looks nice, but there are a few things that look out of place, like blood and some shadows. Also, there are a few technical glitches here and there that can detract from the immersiveness of the game. I like to think I have a decent computer, as it runs both most games very smoothly, yet this game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes. The game feels a bit rushed as well, as you have a knife that doesn't kill anything and animals that run around that you can't eat. Despite the technical issues and some missing features, I really like this game.Also, the giant panthers are very friendly and love to play fetch.			"

												Miasmata is a curious game I completed over the course of a week or so, having watched a fair number of the playthrough videos by Mesh of Mack & Mesh fame on youtube.  It seemed like the perfect game for my mood at the time, nothing too heavy or intense, no fiddly controls to figure out or the wonderful task of re-binding keys due to being left-handed!  And what a game it turned out to be.For the most part an island exploration simulator, where you wander through valleys, over mountaintops and into dense jungle, Miasmata can be a theraputic, calming experience.  Aside from the task of having to locate and synthesize a number of plants into drugs to cure your character of an unknown plague (admittedly not a relaxing expeience for the guy you're playing), there are no constant swarms of enemies charging towards you or restrictive timeframe placed upon your actions, besides the passing of day into night. Of course this changes to a degree a certain number of days into the game, when another 'element' is added to the experience, which certainly got my blood pumping on a few occasions!  Having a beast roaming the island with you adds an air of menace to proceedings, as you learn to be stealthier, sneakier or downright panicky in order to esacape its clutches when you cross paths.In truth, the beast is only a small part of the joy of Miasmata, as I gained the most pleasure from simply roaming over the terrain, triangulating my way across the map in search of the next hut, piece of vital information, or important plant for examination.  If you have a powerful enough system, the island is a wonder to behold, if somewhat sparse if you are used to running into streams of characters to interact with.I couldn't recommend this game highly enough, for the time I invested into it.  Buy it when it's on a Steam sale like I did and enjoy :)			"

												This is an interesting survival/adventure game.  Exploring the island was kind of neat.  Trying to find all the landmarks and get the entire map to show up is a bit of a challenge on its own.  There's a few buildings scattered around that you'll run into here and there that also have notes in them to give you an idea of what happened since you're all alone and don't have any idea what you're doing there.  I also liked collecting the various plants to craft painkillers and other drugs.  It almost made me wish there were more things to collect and craft than there are.My biggest complaint is a possible small spoiler, so I'll hide that next.  I found it kind of tedious once the creature starts showing up.  I was initially kind of excited the first time I saw it.  I tried to hide, but that didn't work out so well since it seemed to home in straight on me.  Pretty much when it first appears, it's not so bad since it only shows up once in a great while, but when you start progressing on your ""main quest"" it shows up more often.  By the time you're nearly finished with the quest, it's virtually impossible to avoid the thing.  I also had what I'd call worse than 50/50 success in hiding from it too even when I was in a spot that I was completely hidden from it at all times and not making any noise.  I even had a few times that I jammed myself between a tree and the side of a cliff that was completely hidden by leaves and grass and it still kept trying to walk straight at me even though we couldn't see each other (I know where it was walking since I had the skill that tracks the creature when you don't move).  The next small thing is when night falls and you don't have a light source, you're pretty much screwed.  It's completely black and you mostly end up literally rolling down hills on your face and/or falling into the water where you're likely to drown.  You learn real quick not to try going out at night without a torch in hand and another one nearby to take its place.Overall I found this to be an enjoyable game in spite of the complaints I have above.  It's worth a play through if you like exploring the unknown.			"

												This was one of the most immersive games I have played in a long time.You are dropped on a very large island with very little to use for direction. Most of the game is silent except for your own footsteppes and atmosphere, but depending on where you go, soothing songs will play. It gave me a strong sense of being alone, except for the terrifying creature that could find you at any moment.Rather than give my full straight oppinion of the game, let me give my view of the ""issues"" that others have had with Miasmata.First, is the creature. I've heard many say they looks stupid and isn't scary. It's certainly an odd looking thing, but when you're just walking through the woods, and hear some twigs breaking in the distance, and search to find a heavily camoufaged thing stalking up on you, it's scary as hell. And it really chases you too, and can kill you in seconds if you aren't careful.Second is the movement. I applauded this game for it's realistic simulation of movement. It takes getting used to, because it is very different from other games out there, but it makes you feel much more vulnerable, and only added to the immersion for me. In real life, if you tried going down a 45 degree incline at any speed other than tiny steps, you could easily slip and fall. People are mad because they can't sprint full speed downhill without natual consequences. It's called momentum, and even a small incline will speed you up if you run down it. People who complained about this clearly don't get out often.There are a couple real minor downsides to the game that I have seen mentioned, such as not being able to look at your map at night if you are holding something. Some animations are a bit stiff or mechanical, and I would love to see those polished to improve immersion.As a conclusion, Miasmata is a very different experience from most games. It was a wonderful break from shooters and heavy storylined games. When playing I felt a great sense of freedom, isolation, loneliness. Most of the game is quite relaxing, and anyone looking for a fun, different experience should try this.			"

												Miasmata was made by two brothers. This game is about an island which you are stuck on...due to the fact that your people banished you. Your boat crashes on this island and you find out that a people once lived here. They are all dead now, and recently. You are sick...sick to the point of death within hours. Using plants all across the island, you must make medicines to keep you alive, make body enhancers, and most importantly, make the cure for your sickness. Using notes of the previous people, you have to learn what medicine a plant can make. Watch out for hazards, such as falling to your death, drowning, dehydration, fever, and the Monster, which will kill you on sight. The monster isn't really scary at all, but that doesn't mean it isn't dangerous.			"

												If you are a patient person that enjoys cartography, this is your game.I have only seen this game's cartography elements in old (DOS era) PC games.  The graphics look a bit rough, but that isn't why you should play this game.  The game does a good job of isolating the player and (at times) scaring them as they desperately search for a cure.The controls do a good job of reminding the player that they are not a super being; the controls replicate a person that is deep in the throws of a debilitating illness, adding to the overall sense of dread.  Running too fast down a hill will see the character tumble head over heals (literally), dropping whatever they were carrying.There are enough quick plays on the internet to gauge the flavor of this game, definately worth a look.

												I really wanted this to be a great survival game that gets away from the meticulous crafting or cheap scares category that's been overdone in so many other games. This fell short, sadly. I felt like I was nothing more than a pill pusher, with the survival bit consisting entirely of not dying slowly from what we hope is some non-communicable disease.I had no problems with the environment in this game or especially how it was presented. The atmosphere itself was outstanding, beautiful during the day and eerie at night. Sound and ambiance both were fantastic as well. Mapping and discovery on the island was actually pretty smart.The problems start when you first starting moving around.....(jello-ing around?). Your character walks quite realistically, tripping and not immediately changing direction. It's neat for about 5 whole minutes, funny for the first few rolls down a hill/cliff, and then you just want it to stop. Then you survive. Pick some flowers and moss then run back to a shed to science it up, you got some pills...repeat. Lastly the demon creature that's on the island failed to meet the hype for me. I ran across it, actually chased after it for whatever reason, and nothing happened....sigh.			"

												This game was pretty imposing. Apart from being lost all the time due to my lack of triangulation skills, it was really exciting to run aimlessly around this quite massive island. I found some plants and produced some good stuff out of them. I never managed to produce the cure though.It can suddenly get dark and the weather conditions vary so you have to consider many different factors if you are willing to survive.The ambiance in this game is very thrilling. There is always that feeling something dangerous is about to happen. To conclude, I highly recommend this game for anyone seeking for an decent survival experience. "

												It took me well over a year to finish this game, but I'm glad I finally did because it was phenomenal. This is hands down the most unique game I've ever played. A true indie at heart, both in its feel, design and execution. Instead of blatantly placing you on an island full of monstrocities with gun in hand, you are unarmed, with only one menace stalking you. That's the initial picture at least. It soon becomes clear that much more to fear. One of the greatest things about this game is how it is actually possibly to become utterly lost. This sounds weird, but in almost every other game there some way of tracking that gives you the secure feeling that you know where you are. Most games have a minimap of some kind, a map with a marker, or something else. Miasmata has a blank sheet of paper. And no matter how much you explore, this piece of paper will stay blank until you actively start drawing a map on it. Doing so is not easy: you need to triangulate your location by use of landmarks. You might be in a new zone without a clue what to do: none of the landmarks are familiar to you, and the area isn't charted. One of the creepiest things in the game was leaving your outpost and explore this uncharted land, knowing that you would become lost within a minute, struggling to find your way back, and possibly at the mercy of this beast. For me that's the true power of this game.A second greatest thing about this game is the fact that you're doing something you'll never do in any other game: harvest and research plants to make a cure for an illness (some RPGs may do this in a quest but this is an entire game based around it). It sounds horribly boring, but combined with the tension this game gives you, it is an absolutely interesting task. Those who've played this game might recall the luminous algae you had to find: I was utterly terrified during that section. Third, the walking and climbing mechanics are amazing. This is the only game where it really felt as if you had momentum when you ran. Running at full speed really felt like running, the risk of tripping adding to the feeling. It actually feels as if you struggle to climb up a mountain. It actually feels as if you put your weight against the slope of a mountain when you are descending. A fourth aspect is how the story is much more than meets the eye. Admittedly I didn't care much for it while playing because I lost track over the months (partly based on the one negative thing, the repetitiveness), but reading back some of the ideas and interpretations on the forum here really opened a much more complex picture than what I would've thought while playing. TL;DR I can rant on and on about this for about the length of a small essay but I'll leave it at this: if you enjoy a good indie title, try this game.			"

												Miasmata is a First-Person Survival Game with a strong focus on discovery and exploration. You are a criminal (forgot the name, sorry about that), who gets banished on an island. You also are sick and have to find different plants and fungi to create a cure and then escape the island. But you are not alone. A creature follows you across the island and tries to kill you. Will you survive to find a cure ?Miasmata has the same combat mechanics as popular horror-games like Amnesia and Outlast. There are none. The only thing you can do during creature encounters is run and hide, which creates a tension and you sometimes almost go mental, because the creature is pretty deadly and hard to escape from. But honestly, I am a bit disappointed by the creatures AI and the spawning points. Sometimes you run away from the beast, just to encounter it a couple hundred meters further again, this time infront of you. Or one time it spawned on a small island at the beach and was unable to swim, so it could just look at it without any danger. I would not call such cases bugs, but they brake the illusion of a superior enemy and quickly show the mechanics behind it. Still, the fact, that creature encounters are quite rare at times and your hearth starts to beat, when the creature is near, builds tention and you got a good chance to escape.But 98 % there is gameplay without fleeing from the creature. In this time you have to find plants with which you can create different kinds of medicines. With those, you can cure injuries (which can kill you after some time), can boost your stamina, strench, perception and ultimately cure your illness, which makes you a pretty weak human being. Without any boosts of medicine, your swimming and sprintingrange are very limited and noticing your worst enemy is up to you. But collecting and finding plants to create medicine is necessary and ultimately the goal of the game.Finding very specific plants for specific cures can be very difficulte. The main problem besides surviving is orientation. You have to draw your own map through triangulation. You do this with markpoint, represented through statues, buildings, ruins, and pillars, which you find scattered over the map. Whenever you can see two such points, you draw your surroundings. This can be pretty difficulte and forgetting to draw your map can get you lost pretty quickly. The fact, that you do not see your position on the map without boosting your perception, makes it even more difficulte.From time to time, you find mappieces in huts, which sometimes show you the location on your map, sometimes just hint at it. Finding specific plants can be really annoying, but also rewarding, when you finally get your piece of the cure or another boost to run faster or longer.Graphicaly, the game is mediocre at best, aiming at a realistic graphic style. But honestly, it never bothered me, the landscape looks nice, little bunnies run away from you, butterflies and birds fly around, you hear the wind blowing. Everything is very athmospheric and the graphics fit. There are games out there with way better graphics, but look also way ugglier.Verdict: Miasmata is a very athmospheric survival game. It builds a feeling of loneliness, in a cheerfull world, while being hunted by a fearsome creature. The survival aspects could be done better and finding plants can be ridiculous and getting lost is daily business. But despite these flaws, Miasmata is a solid game, which deserves your playtime.

												Great game. The game is very absorbing and the atmosphere has been made well enought that it feels like you're really there. Very beautiful and immersive. Gameplay is good. Nice fresh idea. The movement takes a bit of getting used to. Sometimes you'll slide if you stop suddenly. Really well put together overall.			"

												Miasmata is one of the best games to come out of the new Indy gaming scene. While it's not flawless, it's a truely incredible effort considring that it comes from a two-person team. This isn't even your typical Source/Unreal/Unity knock-together either, they actually built their own engine to manage the visuals, this work really pays off in your exploration of the Island. It feels like a living, breathing, world.Interesting game mechanics, a real sense of forboding, an interesting plot, a satisfying conclusion... and it's short without feeling rushed. What more could you ask for?			"

												Miasmata is a fun and interesting game, but not without its flaws.Pros:-Disease survival aspect is done fairly well-World is beautiful and huge-Day/night cycles are realistic-Variety of interesting plants to find-Walking/gravity effect is also very realistic and makes the game more immersive (there's a real fear of momentum throwing you off a cliff instead of being able to magically stop at the last second.)Cons:-The ""Creature"" is a huge pain, and not in a good way. It feels broken most of the time and out of place.-No food is necessary, which takes away from the survival aspect a bit-A lot of the achievements are glitchy (search on the forums for the 3rd party fix before you start playing)In summary:If you're willing to put up with the annoyance of the Creature, it's worth picking up for people who like adventure/exploration and survival games.

												If you are a patient person that enjoys cartography, this is your game.I have only seen this game's cartography elements in old (DOS era) PC games.  The graphics look a bit rough, but that isn't why you should play this game.  The game does a good job of isolating the player and (at times) scaring them as they desperately search for a cure.The controls do a good job of reminding the player that they are not a super being; the controls replicate a person that is deep in the throws of a debilitating illness, adding to the overall sense of dread.

												Stunnningly good, if you like true exploration/survival type games.  The cartography system is awesome, and the crafting system is fun.  If anything it is too easy, there should be more challenge in finding the right plants, and maybe make the ones needed for the final cure be harder to get (e.g., difficult to get to, require certain time of day, etc.).  But overall, I enjoyed every second of it.  If you are interested in finding everything and getting those achievements, look out for the community patch and the miaschiev achievement tracker, it gives you information that is lacking in-game.

												Buy? Likely-=TL;DR=-Miasmata is a unique, first-person survival exploration game where the player must stave off symptoms of a deadly fever that accelerates thirst, weakens the body and somehow either through hallucination or some sort of attraction affect, spawns a deadly, nearly indescribable horror simply referred to the creature. This beast is basically invincible, faster than you and can kill you in two claw swipes. The player must use a combination of cartography and chemistry to find and use plant life across the island of Eden to mitigate and eventually cure his ailment. Miasmata enforces the fact that you are a frail person, collecting herbs while managing thirst and fatigue, and gave me a sense of dread and fear that no horror game has ever given me.-=Presentation=-This is both arguably the best and worse part of the game. Upon getting off the canoe at the start, you're present a beautifully lit island with loads of flora, ambience and world design that immediately immerses you in the world. Yet, the minute you turn around to look at your boat or bother to look at your hands are the ground below you, the models and textures are only barely better than a PS2 era game. It's extremely jarring to see a world that looks much like Skyrim with ENB and flora mods, but with textures only moderately better than Morrowind. Standing water around the island looks great, but beyond that, there is no volumetric water: The water you drink from ponds is invisible and the water poured from pitchers are literally solid beads that would only look like water from a far distance. Also, the draw distance and level of detail is kind of atrocious for a game that looks like this - world  details (rocks, plants) within 8-12 feet in front of you update model quality or pop-in out of nowhere like some sort of hologram effect from a sci-fi movie. It severely ruins the immersive experience the developers were trying to create, and it's strange why there is no included options to manage level of detail for stronger PCs.In spite of all the visual presentation issues, you can often find many screenshot worthy moments as the sun light, god rays, water reflection, cloud and tree shadows have an effect on the medium-low quality environment, proving that lighting effects can drastically improve the look of a game.The audio presentation is pretty good. There are appropriate sound effects for any action in the game from walking on dirt, wood, or rocks, to swimming, drinking water to swinging a weapon and opening up the map or journal. There are occasional sound cues when turning on lights. The majority of you sound will be in the form of blowing wind, rushing waters, lively critters, and of course, the roars of the godforsaken beast and the heartbeat the PC has the moment it gets near you.  The occasional music that plays as you discover camps and various settlements is of a light, symphonic, ambient mood.-=Gameplay=-I can't believe I said so much about the presentation - the gameplay and mechanics are always the most important factors of a game to me. You are Robert Hughes, and you must cure your plague. You will gradually find notes and clues about harvesting ingredients, discovering locations, and using cartography to map your position. Yes, Cartography. There are no waypoints or Skyrim-esque ""quest objective is right here!"" map markers here, though campsites, statues and other landmarks are marked on your paper map as you properly locate them via triangulation or partial maps across the island. It is easy to get lost among the trees and mountains and it is generally best to use landmarks, trails, coastlines, and various ""world formations"" in tandem with collected partial maps and your compass to get an idea of where you are and where you are going.You can pick up and throw items like fruit, rocks, axes, knives, and household objects, though it's all there to remind you that you are a frail person - none of these except from fire made from torches are even remotely useful in dealing with the creature. Combat only exists for the creature. This means you must hide or bore the creature enough to get away from it. You can run, but it's not always suggested as it can catch up to you almost immediately. It stalks you slowly when you walk and it's best to look around and find a good path to move, before finally running to a building to hide in or a object to hide behind. The problem with running in this game is not only the creature faster than you, but you are easily fatigued unless you prepared yourself with endurance medicine you made from plant life. Plus, Robert has a bit of a ""Sonic syndrome"" where he has a hard time running up hills and sprints madly down hills. You have to manage this inertia by carefully finding proper pathways around and avoiding steep falls, since he is a clumsy idiot who can barely control his movement apparently, and will contract a fever that will blur your vision and slow your movement if you fall. It's a bit of a nuisance to control the character and it will definitely make many gamers dislike Miasmata. Though, if the game had a normal first person movement system, much of the tension would be lost since you're no longer accidentally running into the creature and not struggling to get up hills. Because of that, I cautiously welcome it - after all I would probably use slopes to increase my speed if I needed too.The bulk of the game is finding herbs and fungi to research for medicines, drinkable temporary buffs, injectable permanent buffs and eventually the cure. You get clues on what to use from notes around the island and personal examinations on plants. Just be careful with your limited storage bin, 3 holdable plants and ease of dropping them if you trip and fall.-=Summary=-Miasmata is a tense survival game that definitely helped scratch my itch for exploration. It offered an non-combat experience I've never had before and made me legitimately scared of the creature until I knew how to exploit it (unfortunately, he more annoying than scary in the near end game). I'm definitely glad I played it, though I wish there was an improved, modded, or sequel version. Though, it's movement mechanics and map system will turn off many gamers. Definitely play this if you're looking for exploration, survival and tension.			"

												I can recommend this title because is a beautiful and relaxing game, however there are some serious problems going on with it. Some logical elements are missing; it's such a shame because exploration and picking up plants is a joy, but this game lacks hunting (which I loved in Far Cry 3) or even eating anything. The guy basicly lives on medicine and water, and apparently has no pockets to put many items in it.I also liked the science factor in the game; you pick up plants, examine them and produce medicine. Most of the time, you are given subtle hints and instructions, you discover the rest and it is a pleasant experience.BUT, map design is both creative and sh*tty at the same time, gives a lot of frustration. Along with that, the character feels like he's on slippery ice; I understand that the developers wanted to deliver a feeling of running out of control down the hill, but it sucks when it happens even on a level surface.HDR is so extreme, looking at sun makes the whole vision so dark that you feel like you are looking at moon in the night. But the game is graphically inspiring and impressive at times.Anyway, I could forgive all of the problems, if the game did not ended up crashing and made me waste an hour. I simply don't have the luxury time to play that again. Then I said ""Okay, that's it.""I liked the game, I even tried to love it, but couldn't and maybe it's my bad luck. Still, it's a nice game and not recommending it would be shame so my thumb is up.			"

												Miasmata is one of those rare gems - a somber, deliberately slow paced and thoughtful game that somehow still manages to make your heart race with both excitement and fear. While it is somewhat janky and buggy at times, the thrill of exploring the island and unraveling its mysteries is a delight. The lack of gameiness is one of the greames greatest strengths - it totally adheres to its first person perspective and does away with UI marks, HUD clutter and arbitrary collectables. Being alone on the island trying to survive means the game won't hold your hand the whole way; see something interesting on your travels? Write it down. Find interesting flora somewhere? Memorize how to get there. The game immerses you completely in its world thanks to its gameplay systems.			"

												Honestly, this game wasn't worth the $15. The idea is cool, the direction system is realistic, and the atmosphere definitely amplifies the setting. But the main problem I had: the physics. You may want to run for 5 seconds and if you try to stop, good luck. Save points are a rarity, and not in a challenging/good way. If you buy this game, do keep in mind that is is difficult, has some fun aspects, and frustration will occur. I'd give is a 6/10 in the end.			"

												Do you want to be a botanist? In Miasmata you walk among forests earnestly designed to resemble real forests. You get to roam a range of different kinds of these true-to-life woods.  A perfect day goes something like this: You experience hiking along trails, laboring up slopes, struggling to cross ravines, and traverse many foothills. Along your way, you drink from freshwater streams and sketch in your map. When you cross into a forest you’ve never entered before, you collect some unfamiliar vegetation, make some basic notes of its appearance in your notebook, and plan to examine it in detail later.  You witness that landscape gradually sink from dusk into the deep blackness of night – the kind of pitch blackness that prevents you from seeing your hand in front of your face.  After a struggle back to camp, you collapse into a cot, to fall asleep immediately. Before long, you wake up to greet the dawn with a refreshed desire to head out once more. You get to be a cartographer, a botanist, and a hiker in this game. Funnily enough, it’s actually impossible and dangerous to try and walk straight up a mountain. Taking the hiking trail is infinitely faster, easier, and less likely to send you plummeting. This isn’t forced. If you want, you can still try to scale vertically, and you’ll make it 70% of the time. But the mechanics and the way your pace preserves momentum, make it quite a bit more beneficial to take any apparent path. (Again, not by invisible walls or magic “fall down” timers if you wander off the rails. This is based on slipperiness and momentum. They are your movement system to learn and to master. It isn’t glorious, fun, or easy. It is a skill to manipulate it to your advantage.) There aren’t always paths, but you learn to glance at the forest in front of you and judge instantly just what is a bad idea and what is a good way to navigate the direction you desire. You will be going “just around this one ridge” a lot. And that makes the landscape something you actually interact with, rather than punch through.  It also makes keeping track of where you are a non-trivial objective.Being a cartographer is relatively simple. It’s as straightforward as pointing at a landmark, then pointing at another, and using their angles to determine (triangulate) where you must be in relation to them. Then your map will color in automatically. It’s recorded realistically, showing the angles you are taking on your map to measure your position or the direction of another object. Your map is also blissfully magnifiable whenever you want to peer at it. Keep in mind, I said this is simple, but I did not say it is effortless. Cartography requires knowing where other objects are, before you can fill in your own location. This requires methodically stopping at every new viewing position, and continuously recording each landmark you spot. Trees are constantly blocking your view to landmarks. If you walk a few feet down a ridge, good luck having a clear sight line. Contrast to being a botanist: simple, easy, and enjoyable. Snip a stem. Examine it at a lab bench. Learn its properties. Instantly use it to help treat yourself at another work bench. You’ll automatically take some proper notes about its plant anatomy, and highlight how it can be used in a notebook full of nicely illustrated pages devoted to this task. I can’t think of another game that addresses my very potent desire to be a botanist like this.I don’t think this game will work well for many people, but I (really really really) like where it is going. I just wish there were more games trying what Miasmata is trying.  "

The momentum-driven player physics and plague effects make survival a real challenge and force you to learn from your mistakes and move carefully around steep slopes. The creature is genuinely frightening and had me running for my life many times.

The backstory to why this happened is absolutely stupid, but the game does a fantastic job of making you feel like a sick, invalid sack of meat stumbling around a map looking for anything to make you feel better.As you progress, the player discovers he's not alone on the island, but is being stalked by some ugly♥♥♥♥♥creature who tracks the player around the map and shows up randomly to make everything difficult.It's some cross between exploration, and survival horror. There's beauty in it, but also frustration and fear. It's one of the only games I know of where there is a real sense of being 'lost' and having to find your bearings. There's also a fantastic sense of accomplishment when you escape that monster and find a safe place to spend the night. At the end of the game I gave a big middle finger to the island. but had some great memories.			"

												Haven't had a chance to sink much time into this one but what little i have played has me convinced. This is an excellent and unusal game in every way. It isn't the best looking game but for the price it shouldn't be ignored. The only thing i found annoying was the ""sick"" protagonist element which is the main driving factor behind the game. If only they could have made this in cryengine 3 (clearly they couldn't) and with plain survival as a core mechanic it would have been perfect!			"

												First, this game will not be for everyone.  It's a horror/suspense game with FPS type controls.  The main driver throughout the game is that you suffer from fevers.  To combat these fevers, you must craft medicine from plants you collect on the island.  Your in game character is no superman.  He has liminted stamina and too much strenuous activity will bring on a fever which could result in death.Added to that you have the constant threat of the island monster.  Plus, you start out with no map.  You must create it using topography and triangulation.  It's a really neat system that I've haven't seen used in any other game.  As you play, you gradually map out the entire island.Overally, I loved this game.  The pace, the constant threat of fevers and monsters, and the general weakness of the in-game character made the whole experience suspenseful and tense.			"

												I really enjoyed this game, so much in fact, that I nominated this game for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award"" award :)The game is beautiful, and it had something in it that I had not seen before, the mapping experience, where the as the player you need to chart the are based on previously known icons in your line of sight. I got lost in the game multiple times, where I had lost my location on the map completely, and there when playing this game I had my heart racing and my fingers pressing heavily on the keyboard, in order to move my character faster away from the threat in-game.I recommend this game.

												This game was recommended to by a forum friend, and at first I was very sceptical. Wow did this game surprise: This game has got to be the most incredible non-violent game I have ever played. To survive you must find the right plants to make pills and tonics for various purposes, from keeping the symptoms of the Plague away, to an extra boost to your system to sprint or swim for longer. All the while in fear of being found by a mysterious creature. There is something about quietly hunting for glowing algae at night one minute, and sprinting full pace down a narrow jungle path with only your burning bunch of twigs as your light the next!....

												Do you want to be a botanist? In Miasmata you walk among forests earnestly designed to resemble real forests. You get to roam a range of different kinds of these true-to-life woods.  A perfect day goes something like this: You experience hiking along trails, laboring up slopes, struggling to cross ravines, and traverse many foothills. Along your way, you drink from freshwater streams and sketch in your map. When you cross into a forest you’ve never entered before, you collect some unfamiliar vegetation, make some basic notes of its appearance in your notebook, and plan to examine it in detail later.  You witness that landscape gradually sink from dusk into the deep blackness of night – the kind of pitch blackness that prevents you from seeing your hand in front of your face.  After a struggle back to camp, you collapse into a cot, to fall asleep immediately. Before long, you wake up to greet the dawn with a refreshed desire to head out once more. You get to be a cartographer, a botanist, and a hiker in this game. Funnily enough, it’s actually impossible and dangerous to try and walk straight up a mountain. Taking the hiking trail is infinitely faster, easier, and less likely to send you plummeting. This isn’t forced. If you want, you can still try to scale vertically, and you’ll make it 70% of the time. But the mechanics and the way your pace preserves momentum, make it quite a bit more beneficial to take any apparent path. (Again, not by invisible walls or magic “fall down” timers if you wander off the rails. This is based on slipperiness and momentum. They are your movement system to learn and to master. It isn’t glorious, fun, or easy. It is a skill to manipulate it to your advantage.) There aren’t always paths, but you learn to glance at the forest in front of you and judge instantly just what is a bad idea and what is a good way to navigate the direction you desire. You will be going “just around this one ridge” a lot. And that makes the landscape something you actually interact with, rather than punch through.  It also makes keeping track of where you are a non-trivial objective.Being a cartographer is relatively simple. It’s as straightforward as pointing at a landmark, then pointing at another, and using their angles to determine (triangulate) where you must be in relation to them. Then your map will color in automatically. It’s recorded realistically, showing the angles you are taking on your map to measure your position or the direction of another object. Your map is also blissfully magnifiable whenever you want to peer at it. Keep in mind, I said this is simple, but I did not say it is effortless. Cartography requires knowing where other objects are, before you can fill in your own location. This requires methodically stopping at every new viewing position, and continuously recording each landmark you spot. Trees are constantly blocking your view to landmarks. If you walk a few feet down a ridge, good luck having a clear sight line. Contrast to being a botanist: simple, easy, and enjoyable. Snip a stem. Examine it at a lab bench. Learn its properties. Instantly use it to help treat yourself at another work bench. You’ll automatically take some proper notes about its plant anatomy, and highlight how it can be used in a notebook full of nicely illustrated pages devoted to this task. I can’t think of another game that addresses my very potent desire to be a botanist like this.I don’t think this game will work well for many people, but I (really really really) like where it is going. I just wish there were more games trying what Miasmata is trying.  "

												One of the most memorable PC experiences I've had. It's not tightly polished, it's fairly simplistic, and it's slow - but it's immersive, challenging, and different than anything I've played.GAMEPLAY: Using a standard FPS control scheme, you explore an island searching for the cure to a disease which afflicts you. Symptoms manifest themselves in the form of fatigue (you will drown faster while swimming and lose your footing easier when climbing), suffer from blurry vision, and eventually die. You must stave off these effects by crafting medicines out of plants found on the island, of which there are many types, and you have to collect and research each one to see what it does. You also have to drink water, which you can find in ponds, pitchers in cabins, or in your canteen. Dehydration causes onset of the symptoms above. Strangely, and somewhat jarringly, you don't have to eat at all.Perhaps the most unique aspect of this game is the navigational aspect. You will find small snippets of maps, but most of the mapping will have to be done manually in the form of triangulation - pinpointing your location in relation to two landmarks (statues, cabins, and tents). It's the largest factor in determining your route, as you will be forced to stay within sight of landmarks. It creates a feeling of helplessness and empowerment simultaneously - you will be walking blind with little clue where to go, until you add a little bit more to your map, which is a great feeling every time. Your compass is a vital suplement to the map, as it's easy to become lost. The game doesn't handhold, and when you lose your path, there's little recourse except to take your best guess as to where to go. This is most dangerous when falling, as the screen blurs, you become turned around, and drop whatever items you were carrying. It has the potential to be fatal, especially when in uncharted territory. Another useful tool is your watch, which you must use to ensure you aren't caught in the jungle at night - visibility is extremely limited, to the point where it is almost entirely pointless to travel at night. This is another large factor in determining your travel schedule, as you will want to be in a safe place before nightfall.Of course, there's another danger on the island in the form of a monster that stalks the island, against which you are defenceless. It has the potential to throw off your plans, as getting away from it will be paramount - sometimes necessitating flight into unmarked territory.VISUALS: The game looks very nice. It goes for a realistic style, which looks great for the environment elements - rocks, water, etc. Living creatures look a little stinted, but by no means bad, and certainly not immersion breaking. Reaching the coastline and looking out onto the water is one of the most beautiful parts of this game. While most of the game takes place in nature, there are a few man-made elements that stand out visually - ruins in the jungle, for instance.AUDIO: Serves the game extremely well. There's a soft ambient soundtrack that underlines the experience, making exploring the island strangely calming, despite the need for survival. Sound effects are great too - perhaps the most memorable being the pulsing and ringing that occurs when taking a fall. A sound you will quickly identify is the pounding of the character's heart when the monster approaches, its intensity indicating the creature's proximity. It's a very quiet game, but each sound serves to add a little something to the experience. STORY: The focus is on survival and escaping the island, but there's a tale to be uncovered about the protagonist's past, as well as that of the island - who had been exploring the island and why, and how they came to disappear. It comes off mostly as context for the gameplay, which isn't a bad thing, especially considering the story is satisfying to uncover in all of its little bits and pieces, conveyed almost entirely by optional notes.This game is a slow burn, and has challenges unlike those I've seen in other games. Which is why I enjoyed it so thoroughly - it's a chance to explore a beautiful island on your own, and craft strategies for survival. It's hard to say, exactly, what type of demographic I'd recommend this game to - perhaps horror fans looking for a new angle, or those who like exploration games - but I know that I would for sure, as I had a great time with this game.

												This is not an action game: there is no combat although there is an animal on the island which will kill you if you fail to hide from it.This is a game of exploration: you are stranded on an island, suffering from a plague.  The cure is on this Island although those that made it are all dead.  You explore the island, mapping it as you go, searching for the plants required to create the cure (as well as the scientists notes with regards as to which plants you actually require).  In your diseased state you are weak.  A slight fall, dehydration or lack of sleep will lead to a fever...left untreated the fever will kill you.  You can use various plants around the island to synthesise drugs to combat the fever or to increase your strenght, endurance and awareness.In this game it is the environment which is your enemy: the island is a mountainous, jungle environment full of steap slopes: in Miasmata your body has momentum and navigating all of those hills becomes a matter of life or death.  You will slide, trip and fall but it all feels very natural.I loved this game: the island setting is well realised...the sounds of the environment are very well done, while the lighting is fantastic.The game was made by two people, with an engine they built specifically for the purpose.  There are rough patches to the graphics but I can honestly say that I never noticed them unless I went looking for them.I highly recommend it, but it may not be to everyone's taste.			"

												I bought this game when it first was announced. I want to make my position very clear on it. I like it. I don't think I would tell a friend to buy it, but I like the game enough to play it from time to time. The graphics were fantastic when I first bought it, but by today's standards, not so much. I'm not one to value graphics over gameplay, though. So, what's the gameplay like? I think a curator put it best. ""Guerilla Botany"" was what they called it. You use flowers which you can pick up around you to synthesize medications, and use them to better your health, all while avoiding a monster. The monster was a huge selling point for the game, but he's not all that big or scary, or even that big of a threat. Bottom line, if you don't mind that this game hasn't been updated in forever, and you like games that make you feel lonely and immersed, this might be the game for you.			"

												Miasmata is survival geocaching. You're a plague-stricken scientist who must create a cure by finding specific plants on a remote island, via the use of exploration, maps, clues and cartography.The central gameplay mechanic is unique and very appealing to me. I've always wanted a game that did this and I'm happy to say that it does this part extremely well.The terrain is nicely detailed and there's plenty of little animals on the island, which really bring it to life. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the island, discovering the plants and uncovering the story.Consequently I am recommending this game, but it is important to say that there are a lot of problems. This is far from a polished game. Notable things are:* The game crashed twice and then crashed again during the end. Somewhat anti-climatic, but at least it worked after restarting the game.* After closing the map/journal the game would very frequently ignore my mouse movements. Meaning I would have to open and close the map/journal again. This got extremely frustrating. The map and journal are well designed, but the bug put me off using them as much as I wanted to.* The character can somehow climb up very steep terrain, but will also fall on easily navigable terrain. It doesn't make a lot of sense.* Many floating trees.* Can't pick up two of the same plant.* During animations the colour of objects can change, which is a bit immersion breaking.* Creating a duplicate of an item you already own will just overwrite that item, with no warning or explanation.* Terrain was constantly popping in and redrawing, even just a couple of metres in front of me.* The terrain diversity is quite limited, which is further worsened by the colour draining. The unique terrain features that do exist are memorable and make the island seem more alive, but the amount of them is very small. It would have been nice to have a waterfall, clearing, cave, tunnel, proper cliff, massive tree, etc.My final issue with the game is subjective, so I'm not including it in the list. I didn't care for the creature at all. I felt that it was an unnecessary feature that added very little to the game and became an annoyance very quickly. It appears very early in the game and will happily stand there in the middle of the path, so there's no suspense or mystery. The game's description says the creature will stalk you for miles, which sounds amazing, but I didn't see any proof of that happening. If someone said it randomly appeared in a random location near you, I'd have no evidence against that.			"

												This game was a real surprise for me. This is an exploration, experimentation, adventure-like thriller, with interesting story and gameplay mechanics I've never seen before. After you've played this game, you'll be a cartographer, a hiker, a botanist and a mycologist in one go. You'll see beautiful places and landscapes, but you'll feel the horror at night, lost in the endless forests too. There is no guidance and big arrows what are pointing you in the right direction, just some fading pieces of papers, each with a part of the story.

												I'd been thinking about getting this game for some time, after seeing it on Steam and being intrigued by the concept of survival, exploaration and tension. There are so many elements to this game: exploration (including cartography), research (plants and fungi can be examined and synthesised to create medicines, enhancements and a cure) and survival (against the island itself and the creature that inhabits it. It's hard to believe that two brothers created a game so interesting and well-executed. I'm enjoying it very much. On a personal note: Thank you to the Johnson brothers for allowing me to choose my own key bindings. Something that many larger developers ignore (H1Z1 and Miscreated being good examples). Highly recommended.			"

I remember my last swim and the way I did not want the game to end cause I knew I would never play something like that ever again. I don't understand what's so special about this game.

												Back when Myst first came out, there was a Fox Trot cartoon in which Jason hacked up a version of Myst that was exactly the same as the original, except that velociraptors were chasing the player. That's a pretty good description of Miasmata.Exploration is the driving mechanic of the game, and in this respect, the island of Eden is a paradise. Every part of the island is unique, with hills, rivers, swamps, ancient ruins, and dense foliage of many kinds. The lighting and water effects are very impressive. At the same time, Eden's beauty is tempered by its dangers. Fatigue, sickness, and the terror of being stalked are conveyed in an organic and immersive fashion, which makes them all the scarier.Miasmata is a beautiful sandbox experience. I also found it very frightening, at times. Perhaps not everyone will find it as scary as I did, but anyone who loves exploring will find it very engaging.			"

												I'd recommend Miasmata especially to players who like exploration, don't need a constant objective solving and like something new.You start off stranded on an island, infected with the plaque and in search of the cure for the plaque. Luckily you are on an island on which the cure for the plaque was researched. As sick as you are your bodies’ condition isn't good at all. You can't run very far without getting out of breath, swimming is beyond question and falling down a hill becomes a regular thing. After a while (or after falling down) your condition gets even worse and you start having fever. But fortunately there is plenty of plants and herbs that can be manufactured to a temporary medicament against the fever.Besides the fever medicament you may also make temporary as well as permanent body enhancement medicaments, which allow you to run faster, to run a greater distance and even to swim.Recipes for the different meds just as parts of the story behind the research team are found all over the island on certain campsites.As you progress through the island searching for the cure you can't miss the beast, a creature which sole purpose it is to obstruct you. As soon as it hits you your fever worsens and after the second hit you lose you consciousness. There are several possibilities to escape from the beast and you have to escape from it not being able to harm or even killing it.Another major part of the game is to triangulate your position and map the island. Without triangulating it is very hard to find your way to different parts of the island so triangulate as often as possible. If you can't find any known landmark and need to know where you are, you can drink a tonic you are able to mix to get temporary the ability to know where you are on the map.By finishing the game you might get behind the story of the island, the research team and yourself.Regarding the graphics:It isn't the best looking game BUT the weather and the different times of day are excellent conveyed. You always get really the feeling that it is as late as it is. (For example 10 pm is very different to 10 am and sunny weather is very different to a storm).			"

												Also known as Map Making Simulator 2015. Does this game get fun eventually? All I seem to be doing is walking (ice skating?) for miles into the wilderness, getting lost in said wilderness because I can't seem to get the mapping system to work at all, falling off of some cliffs that I was nowhere near in the first place, tripping over on flat ground, finding a plant, and repeating the process over the several mile trek back to the campsite. I don't even need to hunt to hunt or anything that adds any vague interest to the trips, just lots and lots of walking, and lots and lots of falling over. I paid £12 for this.			"

Holding only two items at a time is rather ridiculous and dropping said items when swimming is also ridiculous. I couldn't have just stuck the knife in the waistband of my pants or something as I swam around?

												This game is worth the regular price.  If you like grinding it out and searching some random places, without many chances of messing up the game without a restart this might be the game for you.

												Survival type game with no combat where the goal is to survive long enough to figure out a way to get off the island you were stranded on. Graphics is definitely a mixed bag and some mechanics are questionable at best, but it's unique and interesting enough, seeing the price, to be worth playing at least once.			"

												This game started out amazing.  There were obscure hints to a dangerous beast (TV series ""Lost"" obsuce).  One of which were weapons, and multiple ways to attack.  Another was danger sense.  There were others too, which I won't spoil.  But what I will spoil is that the beast mechanic is horrible.  There's an ""at bay"" attack with a specific weapon.  It kinda works, but really janky.  Other attacks do nothing to it.  I've tried a variety of weapons, including blades, thrown and swung, and they do nothing.  The beast moves like one of the worst AI's I've seen, getting stuck easily around obsticles.  It moves slowly whenever I am facing it (seems to move quickly if I turn and run, but I've never seen this).  It's just really scarry until you fight it once, then it's not scarry.  The hide mechanic is horrible, because, while it's usually not hard to hide, it takes agonizingly long for it to patrol away.  If it patrols away at all.  I've stayed ducked in the brush for entirely too long with it just doing the same lap seemingly perpetually.  I've not stayed a day cycle, but multiple in game hours and seen this.  TO MAKE THIS CLEAR: I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE BEAST IS TOO HARD!  I'm complaning that the mechanics of the beast make me really not even want to play any more.  I like the idea of a threat like this, just not how it was executed.  It shoudl require more skill to avoid it, and less patience (patience should be a big part of the experience, but at times infinite patience holding CTRL is too much).  Honestly, the beast got my adrenaline up before I ever encountered it, and now when I encounter it I get a feeling similar to a game bug.  Knowing the experience will completely remove emersion from me, and that if I die, it will feel more like having to restart because of a game glitch than because I played poorly.  The beast needs massively revamped.The other problem is with the map.  The way you draw lines while doing cartography, and then how the camera auto zooms for you is frustrating given the number of times you are encouraged to do it.   And I could get past that, but it's an annoying time sync.  What sucks is that 40% of the time I look at the map, it locks mouse movement, which is completely vital to the game.  I can get it back by opening and closing inventory.  But it's buggy, removes immersion, and can lead to problems for your character if you start moving and sliding down something when you expected to mouse turn before the drop, or if you are frantically wayfinding while trying to beat a timer (like potion, night, or stalking beast).  This is flat out buggy.  It shoudl be fixed, but it's the creature that makes me not want to play.  I was still playing a lot in one sitting even with this glitch.The terrain and movement.  There are a lot of complaints about the realistic troubles the engine gives you with moving on terrain.  Having done a bunch of hiking myself (not that I'm a pro outdoorsman by any means), a lot of what they simulate is pretty realistic.  But people aren't complaining as much about realism as what's fun for real life isn't necessarily fun for a game.  I agree with that philosophy, but, I do think the realistic terrain dangers are a positive for the game.  Sometimes it's a little jankey feeling, but only a little, and not often.  It's really good and serves the game in my opinion.  Now it would be a horrible feature for your average 1st person shooter, but for this game it'e completely engaging, and I quite enjoy that.The premice and story thus far are pretty cool.  I do want to reccomend the game, but for what I said in the first paragraph, I cannot (the second paragraph is stikes against the game, but it's the first paragraph alone that makes me not recommend it).EDIT:I did play the game to completion, and messed around with it a bit more after that.  I forgot to mention numerous rendering issues (vector points stretched in front of the camera constantly, odd strobing that seemed unintentional), but your experience may be different.  Anyways, this game created an experience very unique to itself.  I still don't recommend it mostly because of the beast feels so glitch-y.  But it was a memorable experience, and offered good qualities no other game has.  I will be very interested to see their new game, and will most likely get it.  I certainly think the company is worth keeping an eye on, and I commend them for creating their own experience.  If you are still reading, I hope you have a good idea about if this game is for you.

												Also known as Map Making Simulator 2015. Does this game get fun eventually? All I seem to be doing is walking (ice skating?) for miles into the wilderness, getting lost in said wilderness because I can't seem to get the mapping system to work at all, falling off of some cliffs that I was nowhere near in the first place, tripping over on flat ground, finding a plant, and repeating the process over the several mile trek back to the campsite. I don't even need to hunt to hunt or anything that adds any vague interest to the trips, just lots and lots of walking, and lots and lots of falling over. I paid £12 for this.			"

												It's really buggy, I had specimens going through the tables and I would try to stop running to look around and would keep going. I even checked to make sure it wasn't just my keyboard messing up too. The controls need to be reworked. Holding only two items at a time is rather ridiculous and dropping said items when swimming is also ridiculous. I couldn't have just stuck the knife in the waistband of my pants or something as I swam around? I did like the fact that when you picked up a note, it pointed out which note you just received in the journal. And the sounds were pretty decent as well. Overall, would not recommend at all. "

												This game was recommended to by a forum friend, and at first I was very sceptical. Wow did this game surprise: This game has got to be the most incredible non-violent game I have ever played. To survive you must find the right plants to make pills and tonics for various purposes, from keeping the symptoms of the Plague away, to an extra boost to your system to sprint or swim for longer. All the while in fear of being found by a mysterious creature. There is something about quietly hunting for glowing algae at night one minute, and sprinting full pace down a narrow jungle path with only your burning bunch of twigs as your light the next!....

												This is not an action game: there is no combat although there is an animal on the island which will kill you if you fail to hide from it.This is a game of exploration: you are stranded on an island, suffering from a plague.  The cure is on this Island although those that made it are all dead.  You explore the island, mapping it as you go, searching for the plants required to create the cure (as well as the scientists notes with regards as to which plants you actually require).  In your diseased state you are weak.  A slight fall, dehydration or lack of sleep will lead to a fever...left untreated the fever will kill you.  You can use various plants around the island to synthesise drugs to combat the fever or to increase your strenght, endurance and awareness.In this game it is the environment which is your enemy: the island is a mountainous, jungle environment full of steap slopes: in Miasmata your body has momentum and navigating all of those hills becomes a matter of life or death.  You will slide, trip and fall but it all feels very natural.I loved this game: the island setting is well realised...the sounds of the environment are very well done, while the lighting is fantastic.The game was made by two people, with an engine they built specifically for the purpose.  There are rough patches to the graphics but I can honestly say that I never noticed them unless I went looking for them.I highly recommend it, but it may not be to everyone's taste.			"

												Think Amnesia mixed with Robinson Crusoe. The gem is a very unique indie survival horror game. Find a cure for your disease and get off the island. Most importantly, though, is to survive. The game is absolutely gorgeous, the island is incredibly huge and crawling with mystery, and the beast stalking you through the jungle will keep you on your toes at all times. Honestly one of the most unique and entertaining games I've played in a while.			"

												This game felt like reading a good novel. It is well written, the story is compelling and it drags you within. You feel sick when the character does.At the same time, it is better than the best thriller movie I ever watched. More thrilling than playing resident evil. There have been times when I ""heard the heart beats"" and just exited the game and said ""enough!"".In most games with a thriller theme, there is blood and gore and you typically are holding a gun in your hand. You already have an adrenaline rush and are up to the task ahead. This game, however, is about calmly and peacefully collecting flowers, and when it escalates, you are sick, weak, totally defenseless and vulnerable. You have way too much to lose in your hand and there is no such a thing as being ready for the challenge.This is an addictive thriller novel that I would recommend to everyone.			"

												One of the most memorable PC experiences I've had. It's not tightly polished, it's fairly simplistic, and it's slow - but it's immersive, challenging, and different than anything I've played.GAMEPLAY: Using a standard FPS control scheme, you explore an island searching for the cure to a disease which afflicts you. Symptoms manifest themselves in the form of fatigue (you will drown faster while swimming and lose your footing easier when climbing), suffer from blurry vision, and eventually die. You must stave off these effects by crafting medicines out of plants found on the island, of which there are many types, and you have to collect and research each one to see what it does. You also have to drink water, which you can find in ponds, pitchers in cabins, or in your canteen. Dehydration causes onset of the symptoms above. Strangely, and somewhat jarringly, you don't have to eat at all.Perhaps the most unique aspect of this game is the navigational aspect. You will find small snippets of maps, but most of the mapping will have to be done manually in the form of triangulation - pinpointing your location in relation to two landmarks (statues, cabins, and tents). It's the largest factor in determining your route, as you will be forced to stay within sight of landmarks. It creates a feeling of helplessness and empowerment simultaneously - you will be walking blind with little clue where to go, until you add a little bit more to your map, which is a great feeling every time. Your compass is a vital suplement to the map, as it's easy to become lost. The game doesn't handhold, and when you lose your path, there's little recourse except to take your best guess as to where to go. This is most dangerous when falling, as the screen blurs, you become turned around, and drop whatever items you were carrying. It has the potential to be fatal, especially when in uncharted territory. Another useful tool is your watch, which you must use to ensure you aren't caught in the jungle at night - visibility is extremely limited, to the point where it is almost entirely pointless to travel at night. This is another large factor in determining your travel schedule, as you will want to be in a safe place before nightfall.Of course, there's another danger on the island in the form of a monster that stalks the island, against which you are defenceless. It has the potential to throw off your plans, as getting away from it will be paramount - sometimes necessitating flight into unmarked territory.VISUALS: The game looks very nice. It goes for a realistic style, which looks great for the environment elements - rocks, water, etc. Living creatures look a little stinted, but by no means bad, and certainly not immersion breaking. Reaching the coastline and looking out onto the water is one of the most beautiful parts of this game. While most of the game takes place in nature, there are a few man-made elements that stand out visually - ruins in the jungle, for instance.AUDIO: Serves the game extremely well. There's a soft ambient soundtrack that underlines the experience, making exploring the island strangely calming, despite the need for survival. Sound effects are great too - perhaps the most memorable being the pulsing and ringing that occurs when taking a fall. A sound you will quickly identify is the pounding of the character's heart when the monster approaches, its intensity indicating the creature's proximity. It's a very quiet game, but each sound serves to add a little something to the experience. STORY: The focus is on survival and escaping the island, but there's a tale to be uncovered about the protagonist's past, as well as that of the island - who had been exploring the island and why, and how they came to disappear. It comes off mostly as context for the gameplay, which isn't a bad thing, especially considering the story is satisfying to uncover in all of its little bits and pieces, conveyed almost entirely by optional notes.This game is a slow burn, and has challenges unlike those I've seen in other games. Which is why I enjoyed it so thoroughly - it's a chance to explore a beautiful island on your own, and craft strategies for survival. It's hard to say, exactly, what type of demographic I'd recommend this game to - perhaps horror fans looking for a new angle, or those who like exploration games - but I know that I would for sure, as I had a great time with this game.

												One of the most innovative games outhere. Some people may consider it boring, cause practically everything you do is roaming around and looking for flowers, mushrooms. At the same time you do not have any map and you have to travel very carefully and have to use triangulation technique just to know where you are. Without triangulation usage you will be lost really fast and... eaten. Yes. There's a creature roaming around too. What is more interesting is that this creature is unscripted. It means you can meet it right at the first day. Vice versa you can meet your enemy on day 10 for example. Nevertheless you will meet it eventually, because most of times it's roaming around the most important rare ingridients (flowers-mushrooms). Another one enemy is your own sickness, physical not mental. You're sick, so you have to make hand-made pills regularly. There's also a dehydration, but no starvation for some unknown reasons. Anyway dehydration is not a problem at all, nothing would change without this lively but useless detail. And that's almost everything I can say about game mechanics. The way you can get lost and be frightened is the only one outstanding feature; really big open world created believable and full of points of interest for explorers.As for the story it's all hidden in notes and some photographs. No voices, no scenes, no characters alive. You are all alone (if not to mention the creature). Story is nice, mysterious and a bit detectivish. And by the way it's crucial to collect story notes, otherwise looking for ingridiends will become a pain in the a$$. You do can collect plants blindly, but that's really hard.I would recommend that game to anyone who is not afraid to try something new and unique. It's not expensive, so I really recommend to give it a try.			"
