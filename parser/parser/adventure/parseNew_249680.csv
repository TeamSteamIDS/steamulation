												Every once and a while there comes a game so revolutionary, so full of ambition and creativity and with such flawless execution that they forever change the medium and shape it for years to come. They are the games that we remember decades after their release, and that continue to be cited as inspiration for new games long since we first revered at their brilliance. And then we have Marlow Briggs.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is not a revolutionary game; it does little if anything unique borrowing heavily from games of yore without ever outdoing them in its own right. It's not the most polish, it's production values are noticeably low, and has some truly aggravating design decisions. But none of this matters because despite being formulaic and shallow Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play. If ever there was such a thing as a B-game this is it, and what ridiculous amounts of fun it is.As the curtain rises we find Marlow Briggs, aka ""the man with large hands"", arriving to visit his archaeologist girlfriend on a digsite she has been working at lately. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, the operation is in fact being run by a maniacal psychopath possessing godlike magic powers and an army of mercenaries to back him up. Marlow doesn't like this, but before he can take three step towards the door he's sent on a one way trip to Xibalba and his girlfriend kidnapped. Cue flashing lightning and a talking mask and Marlow is reborn as the sacred warrior, hero of prophecy destined to save the sacred land that has been disturbed by the militias presence. It should be noted that all of this plays out in the span of about 60 seconds, at which point you are tossed straight into the action. This isn't a game that takes itself seriously; not remotely. The plot is absolutely absurd and the dialog cheesy beyond compare, but Marlow succeeds because it knows it's silly and revels in being as self-aware and goofy as possible as it jumps from setpiece to setpiece with little regard to exposition or the mounting continuity errors. This is a game that wants you to laugh with it not at it, with excellent (for what it is) writing and spot on delivery that made it impossible for me not to enjoy myself, grinning the whole way through.When Marlow and the Mask aren't cracking jokes they're smashing in skulls. It's impossible to ignore so to put it bluntly: this is a God of War clone. Right down to the distinctive way you open chests- er, collect skulls, it plays identically to Sony Santa Monica's lovechild but that really isn't a bad thing. While it isn't as refined as that series, this is a comparable action game with some highly satisfying combat and impressive bossfights. It's nothing new, but it works well for the game and more than solid, with my only complaint being a large amount of overpowered enemies and occasionally getting locked into an animation.Mixed together with the melee arena combat are a plethora of action movie moments such as shooting down helicopters with a mounted turret, and some light platforming and puzzle elements. The variety is great and helped alleviate much of the monotony that otherwise would have occurred from a strictly combat focus through the 6-7 hour campaign. While it won't win any graphics awards, this is actually a rather decent looking title. The environments in particular have a lot of detail put into them, and when the camera pans out for a vista it's a gorgeous site. For a budget title it's pretty impressive, but what I thought was most clever was how instead of using costly animation for the cutscenes, the majority are instead done as freeze frame 3D stills that the camera then slowly sifts through, using dynamic angles and purposely placed obstructions to allow for the scene without you actually seeing them do it. It's a neat idea and I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity, even if it's a little jarring at times.I'm not sure how many more ways I can say it at this point; Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is plain uncomplicated fun. In the same way a dumb summer blockbuster is enjoyable, Marlow doesn't need to be original or perfectly polished to be entertaining. It's a nonsensical adventure that I think almost anyone could enjoy if they can give it a chance, and quite frankly is some of the most fun I've had with any video game in a long time.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fast-paced third person hack'n'slash game by Slovenian developer ZootFly which didn't catch a lot of attention among PC gamers at its release. Making use of pretty much all of the popular clichés, the game is filled with mindless over-the-top action, tons of explosions and hilarious puns without ever taking itself seriously at any point.The story proves this instantly: Your girlfriend translates ancient scripts for a rich company mogul somewhere in Central America. You visit her and she explains to you how her boss is up to no good because he wants to perform a ritual that would make him a powerful god and ruler of the world. So you try to take here with you back home, which her boss obviously doesn't like, so he gets you killed with an ancient scythe, not knowing that it is imbued with power that resurrects you and summons the Mask of Death, your new companion on your path to rescue your girlfriend and stop the bad boss.The game is based on ZootFly's own proprietary, multi-platform engine called ZEN, which doesn't really provide any PC graphics options other than resolution, fullscreen and brightness. That's a shame because the game could've definitely used some AA, which would make the colorful and detailed enviroments look even better than they already do.While the level design as such is pretty linear, which tends to get boring after a while in a lot of games, ZootFly actually managed to add quite a lot of variety to it. Throughout the game you will encounter combat arenas, puzzles, deadly death traps, quick-reaction minigames, turret sequences and even some top-down shoot-em-up action. This sounds like a weird mix of gameplay elements but is incorporated extremely well into the game, so you never have the feeling that it is out of place.Combat and controls are exactly like what you would expect from a game like this. Throughout the story, you get access to 4 different and upgradable weapons, each of them with a variety of combos to deliver maximum damage. Additionally, by defeating the ancient gods of fire, earth, water and wind, you unlock their devastating ground attacks, which can help you out of tricky situations or simply cause widespread carnage when facing many of the varying enemies at once.The puzzle elements in the game mostly consist of moving blocks on trigger platforms or flipping switches to open doors and while they never are overly challenging they actually provide a welcome change to the otherwise extremely fast-paced gameplay, so you can take a short break from all the action.Usually, with a low-budget title like this, the soundtrack and voice acting are two of the things where the developer tries to save money. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack is actually pretty decent and, paired with the level design, builds up a really good atmosphere. While the dialogues are a bit cheesy at times, the voice acting itself is good and fits perfectly to the game characters, especially to Marlow and the Mask, who are constantly teasing each other verbally. That makes for some hilarious puns even in the weirdest situations. For example, while you are climbing a stone wall that is about to collapse and kill you, you are arguing with the Mask about who is whose sidekick in this game.With around 8 hours of playtime for the story, the game provides an extremely decent bang for the buck and if you want to test your skills further, you can give the Challenge mode a shot where you replay the minigames from the story to achieve better scores and times to rank up in the online leaderboards.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is cheesy. It's mindless. It's over-the-top action. But that is exactly what makes the game so enjoyable and so much fun and it's great to see some developers going bonkers with their games without trying to be serious, dramatic or mature. If something like this is right up your alley, make sure to check the game out!Oh, did I mention that you can ride giant scorpions in the game?Because you can!FRIGGIN' GIANT SCORPIONS!			"

												When Marlow Briggs paid a visit to his girlfriend during excavation work in the Central American jungle he, well let's say 'had an accident' and was impaled on an ancient weapon. Fortunately an old Mayan mask of death turns Marlow into a reborn sacred warrior, ready for revenge and on his way to free his abducted girlfriend. This extremely trashy start of the game turns into a very enjoyable action adventure brawler, that does not take itself too seriously and offers beautiful levels and explosive fights. 'Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death' is not a revolutionary game. It does nothing specifically unique and borrows heavily from other games without ever outdoing them. It's not the most polished game and has a few questionable design decisions. But none of this matters because Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play. Pros: - deliberately trashy, it's all about the fun- great conversations between the mask and Marlow- fluid movements- good voice acting- nice, average graphics- explosive, wild fights- enjoyable boss fights- top-down shooter in-game mini-games- credits is a mini-game too- hilarious end of the story- feels like a B-movie- many automatic save points- option to save manually- ride and fight with a giant scorpion- learn, upgrade and use magic attacks- find and upgrade different weaponsNeutral:- except for the final boss fight the game is a little too simple on normal difficulty- choosing the best combo is not important on normal difficultyCons:- sometimes somewhat annoying camera perspective- the game crashed four times in my 10 hour play-through			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a third person hack and slash, action adventure that is probably the closest thing to God of War on the PC. It is fantastic game in general, let alone the budget price. It has over the top action, which means plenty of explosions and crazy moments like Marlow hanging from a helicopter and he needs to dodge left or right. The game plays great, the graphics are amazing. The camera will zoom out for you to see beautiful vistas, foreboding caverns and giant industrial complexes. There is a scope and scale to this game. You can be so tiny in a grand complex and you feel it. The game really shines with its gameplay diversity. You won't just be hacking and slashing. There are fun turret sections, plenty of not too difficult platform traversal, climbing, swinging, running from boulders, pushing objects, sliding down areas, working turnstile levers and even playing a top down vertical scrolling shooter. These other elements bring a lot of diversity to break up the brawling.The story is simple and so bad its good. You're Marlow, visiting his girlfriend in a remote jungle, so she can quit her job working for an evil madman bent on immortality. To show her he means business, he kills you right then and there to kick off the game. Marlow gets killed with a magical artifact and the mask of Death resurrects him. So now with crazy magical powers, Marlow must save his girlfriend. The mask will guide Marlow along the way. There is a lot of humor between Marlow and the mask. Its not a comedy game, but has dabs of humor here and there. Marlow Briggs knows how implausible the situation is and doesn't always take things seriously. The mask is there to aide and taunt Marlow when he dies. To show the game's humor, the antagonist is named Heng Low. He makes some great announcements throughout the game, such as, ""all personnel, go grab a gun. There's a nice reward for killing Marlow Briggs. You can use that reward to pay for the weapon rental."" Oh and ""All employees are fired, please avoid flaming death traps and bottomless pits on your way out.""The core game play is simple. You can move, double jump, weak attack, strong attack, grapple, block, roll in any direction with the right analog stick, use magic by pressing two buttons and change weapons with the D-pad. Marlow will get four weapons throughout the game. Each weapon has a different speed, range and damage, but for the most part they are pretty much the same. When he attacks he'll swirl around, causing beautiful death. Its visually appealing. There are four spells to earn. A fiery meteor shower in a circle, earth spikes in a straight line, frost to freeze a radius of enemies and a storm. Every enemy gives you experience to upgrade your weapon and magic levels. It seems like every spell depletes all your mana. Luckily each dead enemy brings you health and mana. There is plenty of mana, health and experience around each level. You just need to hold a button to absorb it, so if an enemy is around, they can keep you from getting them. Enemies can be grappled and thrown, but more interesting, they can be converted, making them fight for you! Your block can reflect projectiles if you time it right and you have magical projectiles of your own.It is all a nice system, made even more enjoyable by a wide cast of enemies. The standard soldiers don't use guns, just machetes since this is a hack and slash. Rocket launchers that need you to reflect. Riot troops that need to have their shields knocked away with specific attack combos. Bugs that can be easily squashed. There are plenty of mini bosses that show up in the game. First they get their own fight, but then they appear later as common enemies. When most of the mini bosses get weak, you can hop on and control them. Not like the conversion, but rode. You can ride a giant scorpion and control it to kill enemies. You can ride giants the same way. The visual is better than the actual fun. I could kill the enemies a lot quicker without being on top of slow lumbering giants.Speaking of giants, then there are the game's big bosses. The bosses so big that you're as tall as a single eye. Each big boss has many parts and they're quite memorable. Its all simple pattern recognition though so its easy enough once you figure out the pattern. The only problem is that you don't do much damage. At the end there is even a quick time event or mash the grapple button.You have NO control over the camera. It is always carefully placed and follows you well enough. I only had a problem with that once or twice in the whole game. The load times are hid. I didn't notice one at all unless I came back to a save. Dying has a really quick reload time to the point its just a quote, then you respawn from the last frequent checkpoint. Its so nice to be back in the action.To keep things interesting, there are challenges in the game. Things like you're sliding down a hill and need to move left and right. The challenge is collecting all the experience orbs! Don't collect them all? You can restart or just keep playing. You can kill all the helicopters in the turret section or the town down shooter section. It adds an extra level of challenge to what would be an easy game on normal (medium) difficulty. Even though the game stays the same level of difficulty, the later areas just take longer. Bigger enemies take more damage. Puzzles take longer.Other elements in the game have players jumping between three mine carts to avoid obstacles. Floating with angels wings between platforms. Swimming through a swinging guillotine river. Climbing wall vines, killing worms. Inching with Marlow's back to the wall to avoid either falling or gears. Clinging to cliff sides. Dodging flaming wrecking balls. Turret shooting the pistons on a giant lava scooper as you ride around a cart. Getting chased by helicopters. Seeing giant scorpions get crushed by huge boulders completely unscripted. Escaping under a door by rolling just before spikes crushed the enemies in the room. Fighting enemies on a helipad as it flipped and flew through the air.  Seeing the giant facility Marlow is in was really mobile with treads. It all feels like a high budget game in a lot of ways, but lacking in a few, especially the cut scenes. There aren't many animated cut scenes, but the majority of the scenes are fly around of scenes. Its like bullet time. You'll see a still frame circling around Marlow as he's hacked through a flame throwing soldier. As the camera swings around, it will reveal a helicopter. Then Marlow leaping from the copter, only to swing around and show Marlow slashing through an insect.  I'm happy that the cut scenes are the worst part of the game, especially since they're skipable. They spent the time in the animation, character models and gameplay.The game is well worth the $5 price tag it currently has. I am shocked this game doesn't have a cult following or more popularity. Even with a 7 hour run time and not too much frills for any replay value, I think this could stand shoulder to shoulder with God of War. The diversity really kept me engaged. Nothing overstayed its welcome. 7 hours was the right time. Its best to leave players wanting more. Odd now Steam says that I only played 5 hours. Oh steam.			"

												Ok lets start by saying this is no ""GOD OF WAR"",has the same sort of gameplay and even the same style of weapons and abilities,BUT and i say BUT thats where it stops (dont think that KRATOS swears as much as MARLOW).To be honest the idea of the mask bringing MARLOW back to life reminds me of the same thing that happened in the latest incarnation of the SPLATTER HOUSE franchise.So why would you play this game if you have played those,well simple really even though the game hase'nt had as much money thrown at it-it is still a really solid game and deserves your time if you like this sort of game.The graphics look nice,the voice overs are good (sure the main bad guy is voiced by LO PAN from big trouble in little china) and the music in game also does its job perfectly.The game plays out like a B movie classic and thats a good thing,many a time you will hear a one liner come out of MARLOWS mouth and plenty of times you will laugh at the in game jokes.The mask is the best character in game and between it and MARLOW they form a good partnership and come the end of the game its like you were watching a sort of twilight zone twisted version of LETHAL WEAPON.I will say that this is another game with not much replay value,do everything in game and power up completely and you wont feel short changed (bar a few mistakes and tough challenges the whole amount of time i have garnered on this game was actually playing time).I would reccomend this game and just hope that the ""ITS NOT GOD OF WAR IS IT"" doesnt put of to many people,as that ending just needs an explanation and a continuation,so come on KRATOS move over as MARLOW BRIGGS WANTS YOUR HEAD MAN.

												This game is the true cinematic experience that so called 'AAA' games claim to offer. While having a typical God of War-like combat system (not like these AAA games try to be original with their gameplay/combat), i offsets it by having some cool looking weapons and attacks. To top it off Marlow is a lovable hero unlike that moronic man-child Kratos, and to top it off he's the kind of diverse ethincy video character that AAA games sadly shy away from.In addition, despite being a low budget game, the developers did an EXCELLENT job with some of the scenery and set pieces (check my online album of the game on Steam for some examples).The game's plot is simple:Lo Pan kidnaps Marlow's woman and leaves him for dead by having an ancient scythe weapon lodged onto Marlow's chest. Unbeknownst to Lo Pan, the scythe then resurrects Marlow with the help of an ancient Incan (or Mayan, I forget) King, shown in this game as being a disembodied skull voiced by Steve Blum.As Marlow travels to save his love, he gains more weapons and abilities to waste Lo Pan's army and the nightmarish oversized insects and phantoms that get in his way.I'd recommend playing on Easy, because enemies tend to take a lot of hits before they die on Normal.

Pros Surprisingly good graphics for a budget game, including some beautiful enviroments. Doesn't take itself too seriously. There's some funny dialogue there and there, and during the first third of the game it's hard to find a minute without at least a couple of explosions. Pretty competent hack'n'slash game, although the combo system doesn't have too much depth. It's just mindless fun. Decent amount of different enemies. Really cheap during a Steam Sale.Cons During the last third, the game just throws miniboss after miniboss at you, which gets tiring Levels are not that well designed. For example, there are losts of safe points where you can attack your enemies but they can't hit you, and sometimes if you're lucky freezing some of them close to a ledge will make them fall even if they aren't supposed to.VeredictProbably the best paid game you can get on Steam for a dollar or less (during a Sale). Might get a bit repetitive towards the end and you can pretty much beat every fight using just two or three different combos and dodging, but if you're just looking for a fun, cheap God of War-like that doesn't overstay it's welcome, buy this game.

												Marlow Briggs is a rather unknown game but become recently popular due to its low price and word of mouth advertising. And, I have to admit, it's actually damn fun to play. Marlow plays like some sort of Devil May Cry or God Of War, but where these other games usually take a little break inbetween the action packed moments Marlow moves full speed ahead. There's hardly ever a dull moment in this game. You move from one crazy action packed scene to the next, with usually just a few seconds of breathing room before hacking away at the next group of enemies.This game isn't extremely long, about 5-6 hours, which is more than enough. After finishing it you're probably done with it anyway. It's fun for a first playthrough, then you'll just delete if off your PC most likely. It doesn't have any replay value. Which might actually be the reason why it's just non-stop action.The graphics look good, the voice acting is decent and the gameplay solid. Marlow Briggs is something you just have to play if you love action games. Especially considering the price these days.[Rating: 78/100]			"

 Game Info Name: Marlow Briggs and The Mask of DeathDeveloper: ZootflyGenre: Hack and slash, action platformer, action adventurePersonal: Awesome, simply amazing, that was 7 hours of movies that ended climatically. Marlow Briggs And The Mask of Death A simply amazing action platformer game with the titular Marlow Briggs taking helm as a badass guy on a mission to save the girl, kick the bad guys♥♥♥♥♥and all the while slaughtering hundreds of faceless mook that dares to even stand between him and his objective. I suppose you could compare this game to legends like God of War although it doesn't have the brutality associate with God of War so you won't be tearing your hair in frustration but instead can enjoy this game in peace.Along the way witness the dynamic duo of Marlow and the titular Mask of Death as they trade banter while killing enemies, facing monstrous creatures and wielding terrible weapons. Graphics You probably won't believe how beautiful this game is despite the fact that it merely clocks at 2gb something in terms of size, fauna has a beautiful sheen to it, enemies and environment has beautiful and varied art to them and you will visit many location each [barring the temples] has their own art style and colour. Music It's awesome, its  beaty track that fits well with the game and doesn't sound out of place, especially when you face some of the bosses. It's great. Gameplay And here is where MBATMOD shines the most, you will wield many different [actually just four but they are all different in how they play.] weapons, traverse many different locale and best of all, fight tons of enemies all with satisfying combo.Granted I don't actually know why its more important to string longer combos since  I don't actually notice any increase in reward but damn I would say its not that hard to pull off 100-200 combos by late game as your skill greatly outclass that of the enemies.Enemies aren't dull dullard either, they will put up a stiff fight and unless you actually use those combos you will find yourself always running out of health and mana. Fun thing is killing enemies restore the meters albeit very very little. It's a fine system of risk of reward which is greatly enhanced by the fact that healing takes time and you can't just do that in the middle of a brawl with 10+ dudes so caution must be taken. One fun ability they give you in game is the ability to convert humanoid size enemies to your side by grabbing them and spamming the E button. Granted they do die quickly and are usually relegated to meatshield duty but I'll be damn if they didn't save my hide once when I got trapped in an arena with two hulking dudes and 2 never ending spawning enemies, which I proceed to convert naturally.Did i mention boss fights are aplenty? Yes they are, and they are awesome, you will fight mythical creature, twisted monster and the demons of the underworld itself! Of course cleverly they disguise the mini boss fight as a tutorial segment to deal with the enemy type later. So about controls, its very good and responsive. So far none of my button has mispressed. Although one issue with the game is the camera can be a backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ occasionally, It might swing behind you, in front of you or even block your off-screen view. I guess there has to be a con no?+Awesome gameplay+Killer Graphic+Responsive combat and control+Great enemies+Actually smart AI+/-Occasional Copypasted levels+/-Repetitive levels before the next carrot stick appears-Terrible Camera-The camera, its awful Conclusion So MBATMoD, lets tick the checklist shall we? Great cheesy story, awesome gameplay and enemies and a game that actually understands the meaning of action adventure by shooting you across the world at breakneck speed. I'll give this little bugger a medal and for you I will presribe a  dose of this awesome game. PRICE THE GAME IS SUPER CHEAP DAMMIT! BUY IT ALREADY! YOU WON'T REGRET IT.Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorBy special Request: A musical The game hits a high not as I enters the arena of death with the angel himself clads in black staring down upon me! Oh why lord, why has thou given upon me camera issues and terrible looking bridges ?! For what have i done to deserve it?! Down down the rabbit hole i go, i watch madness itself plays a tone that is deaf to all but he bird from which upon hiroari shoots! But aye the fair maiden awaits, with a song and companion by my side i could take on the mountain itself! Come come mountains of death! Stare upon me and rend upon my flesh as we take upon the skies.Verdict: A-Rank. Check out the Original Network Groups. Win free games, make new friends on Steam, & more!

												Marlow Briggs may be one of the most underestimated and underpriced game on Steam.I won't say its perfect or comparable to popularly admitted great titles (yes, Kratos, I'm looking at you), but it is well designed and very polished in almost every aspect, including graphics, sounds, handling, story, character building system. The only significant shortcoming for this game is the length. If you are good at action games, you could possibly finish it in one sitting.I highly recommend this game to everyone interested in action games. I hope this one get a succession soon.			"

												A solid hack n slash tinged with elements of Tomb Raider and God of War.  A few glitches but nothing to detract from the entertaining game-play.  The game stays fresh throughout thoughtfully mixing platforming, melee, magic summoning and mini games.   A comedic thread is established early and is maintained as the shirtless black male muscular protagonist frequently converses humorously with a witty spirit of another realm.   The neoteric presentation characterized by an application controlled camera could of been an abject failure but instead provides for some alluring game-play perspectives.  A surprisingly well produced title.			"

Short version: 88%Marlow Briggs is the kind of game that knows it is bad and enjoys every last second of it. The corny acting, the even cornier lines, the dumbed down hack & slash mechanics, and the hilariously stupid plot all serve one thing: to let you have a great time.Long version:Steam is full of bad games. And while Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is undoubtedly a bad game, what makes it stand out in the sea of Greenlight schlock is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great status.Let me explain.When you play a bad game, you often get frustrated because of bad level design or game mechanics, or bad controls. Or even worse, the game is downright boring. With Marlow Briggs, you will hardly ever get bored: it is a platformer, a hack & slash, a rail shooter, and a shoot ‘em up– all packed into one explosive pack of joy. Sure, some of the platforming levels are repetitive and the camera tends to kill you more than the bosses, but there are so many minigames and shooter sections that you will never, ever get bored.The game mechanics are simple as a brick: you have a jump button, normal and a power attack, and a few spells. They form dozens of combos, but they cannot hide the fact that Marlow Briggs is played by mashing two buttons as fast as you can. Combat is strangely satisfying though with good enemy design and one of the most balanced difficulty sliders I saw in a long time.The cherry on top of this rather delicious action cake is the story. You cannot name a single 90s action movie cliché or one-liner that isn’t here in some form, and there are more explosions than in Michael Bay’s entire filmography. All completed with a voice acting hammier than a pig farm; it is hilariously terrible and you will probably find yourself unable to not laugh at it, just like how the developers intended.			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Dearth. Sound like a Indiana Jones title hehe. This game doesn't bring anything new to the table but what it does it does right. This is the first time I play a God of War clone that actually is fun. This game is packed with over the top action and cliches.I love it. The sets are really great too .Plays great with keaboard or pad. If you like God of War , DmC with a little mix of Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider and are not offended that the game borrows heavily from all the above I would recommend it.I still have to finish it to rate it, but its still alot of fun			"

												It's pretty much impossible to hate on a game like Marlow Briggs And The Mask Of Death. It is self-aware as can be, knowing it's a lot of nonsense. Marlow is armed with its crazy, ridiculous, and off-the-wall story: Marlow dies and is brought back to life to avenge his death, to save his girlfriend Eva, and stop a corrupt man from trying to rule the world. If that isn't enough - Marlow is constantly making a barrage of in-jokes aimed at video-games in general, action movies + games, and other things of that sort; and tons of non-stop action + explosions. And for most of this action/platforming game - what nonsense it is! Marlow is just tons of fun and will make you grin + smile, most of the time. Most of the time, constanly running at 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) - Marlow runs extremely well. Very rarely did it even drop below 60! Not only that - but the art-direction + technical graphics are surprisingly actually good here, as well. Marlow's non-stop barrage of action feels fantastic in the controls department with an XBox 360 Controller, playing and feeling very similar to the Darksiders series - which is fantastic! Combat feels + looks smooth, fast, and always is on point! If you're into action-games like the Darksiders (which many feel is similar to God Of War series, which I don't have and haven't played b/c I am a PC gamer) - you'll probably feel right at home with Marlow.Just when you think you've had your fill of using a certain weapon or skill, expect more to suddenly come your way. Expect a suddeny upgrade to a skill or new game-mechanic introduced. And if this isn't enough - Marlow has mini-games of collecting objects in a race-like manner (which can be compared to on the Leaderboards); and even a mini-heliocopter game that feel like a throwback to Capcom's 1942 + Taito's Sky Shark. Marlow will constantly surprise the player with things like this, from in-jokes to game-references.If this sounds up your alley, Marlow is sure to put a lot of cheesy smiles on the face of gamers. That is, until the last few levels come around, when the game decides to severely spike up in difficulty. Regardless, since most of your time spent for the 6-10 hours this campaign should last you (took me a bit longer than 10 hours b/c some areas were a bit frustrating to get though), Marlow is going to deliver a riotous, ridiculous, hilarious, and very fun action-packed roller-coaster ride of a game! Final Grade = C+.			"

												A cheesy B movie like video game both humourous and frustrating at times but overall very enjoyable. Pros:- It doesn't take itself too seriously and that's a good thing. - Beautiful envrions and vistas.- Humourous banter between the mask and Marlow.- Fun and competent fighting engine\combo system albeit with limited depth.- Doesn't crash and is fkn cheap. (IMO it's worth more than $5)Cons:- Level design. Some strange placement of invisible walls got me killed a few times.- Too many HP\MP refills, maybe it's needed for Hard but on Normal there're too many in close proximity of each other.- Too much cool stuff occurs during the cutscenes and I wished that we were the ones creating the shown mayhem.Limitations:- Limited options menu, like not much there...AT ALL- Weapon upgrades, by the end of the game I had so much experience points and nothing to upgradeVerdict:- Fun and enjoyable GoW clone that doesn't take itself too seriously and is ridiculously cheap. Also that ending credits though, I was almost at the top dammit			"

												'Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death' is a shakespearian tragedy told through the medium of a button bashing beat'em up / platformer, where you stab lots of people and monsters in the face.After Marlow's girlfriend gets a job on a digsite, things take a turn for the worse when its revealed her boss is a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after some kind of ""blah blah supernatural gizmo mc'thingymajig"" that will turn him into an even bigger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. After he gets a bit annoyed with you, he has Marlow run through with a sacred Aztec weapon (or something like that - it might be Incan...) and thats when things get interesting. Resurrected by a spirit in the blade Marlow can now wield various supernatural weapons, and can't die (obviously in terms of gameplay he can, but you are resurrected at a checkpoint...)To rescue his girlfriend, and stop some real bad end of times stuff happening, he must stab lots of things and climb up lots of platforms. Luckily he is quite handy at doing both.This is a surprisingly fun, slick game along the lines of Devil May Cry / Dante's Inferno / Wolverine: Origins / Enslaved / Conan, and, er.....are there are any others on PC? It controls well, and is responsive. It's not quite the skill based style of DMC, but a fairly hefty challenge encourages using his various weapons and requires some dexterity.For a game that isn't AAA it has some nifty setpieces, decent production values, and is amusingly stupid about a very stupid story. To compare it to God Of War (which is the most spectacular of this kind of game in my eyes) would be daft, but it would be fair to say that 'Marlow Briggs etc' makes a pretty darn good go at the genre.And its certainly better than Dante's Inferno or Wolverine Origins. I doubt many people remember them, yet I can't think of anything more recent that was this kind of gameplay. The DMC reboot is certainly more polished, but as long as skill and scoring isn't your main interest, then this game will do nicely for your bloodthirsty urges.Looking at my Steam time though - it is a smidge short, though I might have played  some of it offline.

												Marlow Briggs brings a short funny game experience that may remind those movies you watch on a lazy Sunday. You have everything you can expect from an action movie/game so you just need to sit back and relax while having to face many dangerous creatures and soldiers in order to save the one you love. Marlow never wanted to be a hero, he just want to end all this madness and get his girlfriend back.You will have a small variety of weapons and magic tricks that you will learn or get as you progress the game. With simple combos reminding the God of Wars series (without the gory aspect or the budget) you can expect a couples of puzzles as well but they may not represent a challenge if you are a fan of such things. The goal in this game is nothing new or refreshing. Marlow Briggs never taking things too seriously and the plot is really obvious about this. From explosive red barrels that are very well placed to being made fun when you fail a single jump, everything feels like a lot of things you have seen before and there’s nothing wrong with that.The game played great without no issues and the visuals are actually quite nice. The colors are bright and vibrant and there’s a decent balance between those levels around the forest and the industrial area. I finished the game in around 6 hours and I had a decent amount of fun. It was a game that made right from the start that did not wanted to being taken seriously and they achieved that goal without flinching. If you like to play more than one game at the time and you are playing something horror related or very story heavy, Marlow Briggs is just the right thing to play between such titles. Silliness is guaranteed as well mindless fun. "

												IT'S GRILLING TIME!Finished this right now and just want to say it's GREAT.It's the awesome kind of B-movie script and game, an action brawler to entertain you at every turn, with easy to string together moves, a nice variety of over-the-top combos, some fire magic to BBQ your enemies, and more. You can button mash if you're not that good with moves, or you can put together more challenging combos - everyone can have fun with it.You're also joined by your guide, an ancient sarcastic mask that will give you a few chuckles here and there. Also: Did I mention that the good ol' LO PAN actor from Big Trouble in Little China is the antagonist? And makes one hell of a job voicing him?Trust me, play this if you just want to HAVE FUN and not think too much. I got it in a bundle a long time ago, but this is absolutely worth the full price for how much fun it is. Most definitely recommended.			"

												Marlow Briggs and the mask of death scorpion is a very good action game. It's not trying to be too serious or too complicated. Be prepared to fight hundreds od enemies, solve puzzles, listen to funny conversations, decent voice acting and impressive music evoking your combat spirit! :)The story is not special in any way and there can be found some bugs time to time. I don't think I've ever fallen out of the map as often as in Marlow Briggs ;) But there is something.. some force which protects you from frustration and make you enjoy this very silly game.I wish it was a bit longer. It's just too addictive ;) And it's cheap! It's worth more than it costs!			"

												I bought this for $0.99 during a Steam sale, not expecting much. And to be clear, the graphics are a little sloppy, the game-play is straight out of God of War, the ""plot"" is B-movie fluff, and there are no Steam trading cards for this title. On the other hand...Marlow Briggs is AMAZING! It completely embraces the cheesiness of its premise, and delivers absurdly over-the-top action on a scale unheard of in most video games. Through it all the protagonist delivers a ton of action movie one-liners and amusing meta-commentary on the number of puzzles involving spikes, swinging blades, and fire. Instead of long, boring cut-scenes, we get cool ""freeze frame"" moments, with the camera swooping and panning around the frozen tableau as Marlow Briggs defeats an army of giant bugs, or cuts a helicopter in half, or survives the explosion of a cruise-ship-sized mining vehicle. It's also nice to see a black guy as the protagonist, with no one else in the game making a big deal out of it.There is nothing new or original in this package, so don't expect it to change the definition of gaming. What you DO get is a fun, amusing, and action-packed game at a criminally low price. I HIGHLY recommend Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: ZootflyPublishers: 505 Games Initial release: Sept 2013Genre: Action, Humor#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationGod of War and Uncharted met and made a totally predictable but polished summer blockbuster equivalency. Reminded me of something Nick Cage might do.This is an over the top character action game with all the tropes and mechanics you've come to expect. X and Y weak/strong attacks strung into combos. 4 different weapons types. Standard med speed/med damage/med range(sword type), fast/short range/med damage(dagger type), fast/long range/low damage(chain type) and Slow/low range/high damage(hammer type). As well as elemental magic attacks. Though these do more or less the same thing except the ice one. Powerful AOE attack.Its got block puzzles, its got platforming, ledge grabbing, timed based swings and jumps. It also has a really weird and out of place vertically scrolling shooter that happens more than once. The banter between the main character and the mask that gives the character powers is actually funny at times and very self aware. It never really gets in the way or become annoying. It's paced pretty well, at the end it drags a little (but only a little). Maybe it over stays its welcome by a small unit of measurement. If it were maybe 4-5 hours long it'd be perfect. 6 or more if you're a completionist seems just enough to make me mention the length might be an issue. It's more inspired by God of War mechanically but the aesthetics are pretty much Uncharted with some industrial zones. Even down to the Health Orbs being red, magic orbs being blue and XP orbs being gold/yellowish. Not to mention the right analog ""push in direction to roll that way dodge)Decent romp and palate cleanser, especially for $5.Follow my curation for more "

This game is worth way more than what it is priced. Think of God of War, but more responsive and much smoother, without a psychopath main character, a fun combo system and did I say much smoother? The 60 frames is beautiful here. This is another shining example as to why 30 FPS action games just don't cut it. Buy this game, it's 99 cents.			"

												As somebody who is very much a fan of B-movies, I couldn't help but smile at the title of this game. It invokes feelings of just sitting down with good friends, and riffing on some random off-brand movie that we found at a local video store. And, much like those movies, you will get a lot of the same thrills from Marlow Briggs. The game itself is so over-the-top at some points that it's just comical, and I easily found myself smiling through my entire playthrough of it. Like most good B-movies, it takes what people want, in this case a God of War style combat system, and it just pushes it over the top while being aware that it's so rediclous. The writing on some of the lines is just absolutely amazing, and the voice acting is suprisingly good, given how cheap this game is. If there was ever a game that brings the B-move experience, this is the one.			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is the equivalent of a B-movie from the 1980s and 1990s. It is so bad it is good. It is clearly a low budget game that is not a breakthrough for the game industry or the game’s genre. However, this game provides plenty of fun from the beginning. The gameplay feels varied enough as you traverse different settings in the same country and the action never lets up.Marlow Briggs is a smokejumper who goes on vacation outside the U.S. to a Spanish speaking country. I initially thought it was Mexico, but it could have been Central or South America based on the jungles and the rich history of the indigenous people. He is with his girlfriend, an archeologist who is kidnapped by an Asian madman, Heng Long, with godlike magical powers who seems bent on taking over the world. This madman kills Marlow Briggs with a mythical weapon, but he is reborn by a Mayan mask proclaiming him to be the sacred warrior who must save the sacred land. Long is backed up by an army of mercenaries of varying levels of difficulty. Marlow goes to fight to save the land for the Mayan mask and to save his girlfriend. It becomes apparent that this plot is formulaic and unoriginal but this game can get away with it because of its X factor: entertainment value.Once Marlow goes to work the plot takes a backseat and the real fun begins. Marlow begins with the same weapon used to kill him. It has short range, but it cuts good. The gameplay seems to borrow elements from the Tomb Raider series and God of War. The mercenaries may seem repetitive at times, but it does not detract from the fun that combat provides. The Mayan mask becomes Marlow’s sidekick, cracking cheesy jokes along the way. While the combat is mainly melee Marlow is introduced to magic spells that require full or near full levels of mana. There are red masks for health regeneration and blue masks for mana regeneration. The red and blue masks are generously placed in areas of intense combat. Therefore, it is easy to regenerate health and mana after the combat is over. There are also new weapons to use that slice better and have more range than the first weapon of the game. Sometimes Marlow sounds like an action hero from a cheesy action film when fighting saying things like “Aw yeah, class is in session.” His acrobatics are well animated, whether in combat or jumping from one section to another.There are many bosses that Marlow Briggs must face. I think they are quite impressive and require you to figure out their moves so that you can best fight them without taking damage in return. The boss fights seem to ensure that you put as much importance in your defensive moves as you do in your offensive moves. It becomes important to damage your toughest foes without taking so much damage in return. The battles with the ordinary mercenaries are the ones that feel a little repetitive as you advance through the game. The animations of all the mercenaries are impressive and look realistic.There are platforming aspects to this game, much like the Tomb Raider games. There are plenty of puzzles, some timed whereas others are not timed. Some puzzles require you to jump around a lot to reach the next destination. Other puzzles require you to move boxes to open doors or gain access to boxes that can lead to higher levels. The puzzles are really none too complicated to solve. There sceneries are not the best in terms of graphics, but they are respectable with enough detail to look realistic, especially for a low budget game. Eventually, Marlow will be able to glide (fly) from one platform to another since double jumps will not always be good enough. There is also a break in the melee action when Marlow is required to shoot stationary guns to shoot down choppers. There are also challenges that require you to shoot down aircraft in top-down style.The one gripe I have about this game is the fixed camera angles. The camera angles are inflexible and awkward as they do not allow for much viewing freedom. This can lead to some frustrations such as jumping and falling to your death. Eventually, I got over the problem with these camera angles. It feels like an unrefined aspect of this game, but it is not so bad that it would ruin the game. The developers at ZootFly can sure use tips from Crystal Dynamics, the developers of Tomb Raider, on how to best apply camera angles in a game that features platform jumping and puzzle solving. Also, there are times when the camera obstructs your view when fighting two very large Juggernauts of Chabtan. One comes after me while I can’t see what the other one is doing.I think Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death deserved more popularity than it got. It is a solid action game with plenty of fun gameplay that never reaches boredom. I recommend this game to anyone. At a price of $4.99 you cannot go wrong with this game.My Score: 7/10 "

												Bought it on sale for only 99 cents and have had way more fun playing it than i did with other supposedly better games which were much more expensive.Loved the ability to manually save whenever you like.Excellent game that flows easily and doesn't require a lot of thinking.Great time filler when you have a few spare minutes.Highly recommended.

												Marlow Briggs is the coolest video game hero, well, probably ever. This game is so awesome on so many levels it cannot be explained, it has to be EXPERIENCED. It has everything you want in a game and MORE, much more: evil mercenaries, flame throwers, giant scorpions, sorcerers, helicopters, explosions (A LOT of explosions) and a blade on a chain. It is an 80s fantasy action movie incarnate, a cross between Golden Axe, God of War and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, where the main hero is a combination of The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson (and has a snarky sidekick). If that is not recommendation enough, I don't now what else could be.Play it right now or right after next steam sale.			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a third person, hack and slash fest. It is perfect for the player who wants to experience a game that brings to life the feel of a classic action blockbuster film, over-the-top action and cinematic gameplay with a focus on relentless high-octane combat and danger filled exotic environments. As combo-driven adventure brawlers go, there's no earthly reason this should have gone under the charts like it did. I have no idea, but this game absolutely deserves a place with its AAA genre-cousins.Marlow Briggs is also played the most known actor from the hilarious series Saints Row. I'm sure many of you know him from there as pierce washington, Dex and so on. But enough of me talking lets get down to the pro and cons.Pro:-Pretty much nonstop action with very little noticeable loading-Great voice acting-Looks nicely polished-Great Combos-Tons o' Explosions-Interesting Soundtrack that doesnt get dull- The mask calls you chu-chu and insults you if you die and while playing xD.  Cons:-Very little graphic customization so if you can't run it there's really nothing you can do to make it happen (Top tier pcs)-Lack of enemy diversity-Lot o' Insects "

												What happens when a former b-ball player that admired Space Jam, becomes a super human maya freak movie star in a bloodbath of the Uncharted world? It turns out to be amazing with amusing special effects, explosions and humour i guess. Join Aku Aku in this God of War styled gameplay, unleash your b-ball combos, find the truth behind Jax Briggs and Barkley's mysterious dunk and of course, kill that asian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that he's cliché as hell. (Leave the girl).Buy it while it's on sale, you can easily play on a keyboard as well since you have like 2 attack key.Remember that Marlow is love, Marlow is life.			"

												Long story short, if you like the God of war games on playstation you should enjoy this game, it plays pretty much the same. This is like the b movie equivalent of triple a games but it's an absolute gem, so much fun, over the top action and looks and plays really well. It's not a very long game but for the price it's fantastic value and well worth a playthrough.			"

Voice acting is on point and well performed.  From the very start the game will grab you, and keep you wanting more!  At $4.99 (Without sale), you can't lose with this one if you're looking for a fun hack and slash action game!  Highly recommended!			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a flawed, but enjoyable, action adventure with some over the top action sequences, cheesy dialogue and story line. Think God of War clone meets B action movie thrills, and you wouldn't be too far off the mark. This game has been a guilty pleasure for me for a week now, and I can only hope for a sequel that will follow this. The game does have some technical glitches (mostly minor, but on one occasion, I had a camera issue where it didn't follow me correctly, and I couldn't continue the game, restarting from an earlier checkpoint fixed this issue), but it should not get in the way of you enjoying one of the best surprises of this year.7.5 / 10			"

												Finaly... A good ""God of War"" clone for Steam. Thats all this game is. If you arent a fan of ""God of War"" maybe this game isnt for you. Just replace ancient greece with a jungle, gods with asian gangsters and Kratos is a Deadguy who has been  brought back to life with voodoo, and now has to save his girlfriend from the asian gangsters. I know, the plot is thin. But trust me the action is solid. This screams ""B-Flick"" all day, but thats half the fun of this game.			"

The boss fights are few and far between (and they're all kinda garbage, anyway), but everything outside of that is fantastic. Highly recommended.			"

												Cheap and cheerful jump and smash game with good cinematics and a decent hokey storyline. Pretty funny and pretty FUN as well. Its only real downpoints are the sometimes wierd camera angles and the odd infuriating ""you will die over and over here"" sections. Like all games in this genre you will likely find yourself not bothering too much to make specific combos and just randomly mashing right or left mouse until everything around you is dead. The upgrade path for your weapons is basic and fairly linear as is the game as a whole. Despite its lack of intricacy MB&MD is a fun way to spend the odd hour when you fancy something with zero cerebral challenge. At its laughable pricepoint you'd be silly not to.			"

												Have you ever heard of LJN ? Yeah, LJ-F***ing-N. LJN published games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It published one of the worst games ever made. Yeah, LJN is/was infamous for publishing crap. If you saw the LJN logo on a cartridge, you knew the game was going to suck.However LJN finally pulled through and actually released a good game. That game was ""Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage"". It was like sun shining through a pile♥♥♥♥♥♥covered dog♥♥♥♥♥♥bursting out of a cows diarrhea...but the game was good.Why am i telling you all this ?Well...Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is 505 Games (the publisher) Maximum Carnage. Yeah, if you know 505 Games then you also know that they are also infamous for releasing bad games. Very bad games. Marlow Briggs is a good game. It's not the only good game they have published but it's one of the few. They also published such titles as Payday 2 but make no mistake, 90% of their published games are real bad.So usually when i see 505 Games published a game i usually try to avoid that game but Marlow Briggs is good. Over the top action - Check!Silly but good humour - Check!Great gameplay - Check!Nice visuals and sounds - Check!The story and characters may suck and maybe the graphics aren't that great but the gameplay is actually f***ing awesome! I'm surprised to say that i'm enjoying this game. I f***ing enjoy it! Beware tho, the action and story...well, they are really over-the-top. It's uber silly but at the same time it's also soooo enjoyable.All in all it's a great game. If you have some spare money then get it.			"

												This game is the epitome of the hardships and trials the average black man has to go through in his search for whiteness, to the extent of having his dear one stolen from his side.It clearly shows how disregarded the black minority is by putting asian men on a higher strata of society. As the description of the game says: ""Fight the asian menace!"", which obviously refers to the gigantic ""Anime"" monopoly the asians lavish in, whose market they're trying to push into the virgin and lush lands of South America, and use the vast riches found there to produce radioactive enriched anime tapes and manga books to attack the innocent citizens of America. Thus the main character has to stop their plans and make them fall back into their foxholes in Iwo Jima by showing them how a third nuke would've been.The gameplay is an excellent example of how western companies should battle eastern developers with combat mechanics that not only rival, but are hundreds of times better than the so overrated eastern rpgs like Dark Souls. The players has to fight back deadly banzai charges performed by over-zeaoulous japanese samurai guerrillas and mutated beasts product of the secret nuclear experiments in Fukushima.			"

												*Heads Up- I am not done with my first playthrough* If you don't feel like reading- Do yourself a favor and buy the gameOn Monday of this week, I was looking through the Under $5 section of the Steam Summer Sale. I clicked on Marlow Briggs just for the heck of it, expecting to see tons of negative reviews...... but they were pretty much all positive, and said the game was like God of War, but for (during Summer Sale right now) 99 cents. I bought it immediately. It's a fantastic game. It has amusing characters like Marlow and the Mexican god who guides him. There's Long, the villain, and  Marlow Brigg's assassin who teams up with him during his afterlife. The plot is average, but doesn't matter much in this type of game. You can tell production budget was somewhat low, but they still managed to get moments that are far more epic than $60 shooters. The graphics are fair and some of the views (such as of ancient temples and towns, plus the factory) are beautiful. It is like God of War in every way, and that is a good thing. You get new weapons as you go along, and you can upgrade these weapons. With new weapons comes new moves and more options during combat. You also get new mega-powers, such as summoning a hailstorm of lava or creating a blizzard that freeze enemies. Along with weapons and powers, you also get to fight new enemies with harder and harder difficulty. In addition, there are many different environments and fun mini games to play. Did I mention you can save whenever you want? This game is 99 cents during sale, and it is worth every penny. Buy Marlow Briggs and prepare to have fun.			"

												First off let me say that I am only just under an hour into this.  That being said, I highly recommend it.  Games like this are what terms like ""Over the top"", ""Full Throttle"", ""High Octane"" and ""Action Packed"" should be reserved for.You are given just enough of a story to get you going and then you're thrown right in and kicking more♥♥♥♥♥than an angry donkey herder before you even have time to settle into your seat.The gameplay utilizes real-time cinematography style effects directly into the action and cuts in with very unique and almost comic book style animation sequences that let you breathe for a moment without the♥♥♥♥♥kicking ever skipping a beat.  The games controls feel intuitive and will be very familiar to those accustomed to other 3rd person action games.  The game does give some controller advice but not in an annoying way.The lack of camera controls can be a little bothersome at first but you quickly get over it and the game doesn't often leave you in an area with a lot of breathing time anyway.I love this game so far and will be getting back to kicking♥♥♥♥♥(and even saving the world?) as soon as I get some rest :B1:.

												What good things can I say about this game that haven't already been said in other reviews?First things first. This is a great hack and slash in the same style as God of War, but in an action movie motif that screams 'Big Trouble in Little China' homage. Much like the 80s film, the hero (who may be the sidekick depending on opinion) is thrust into saving his girlfriend from the villain, voiced by James Hong who is once again typecast as the asian man who's trying to use a girl for a crazy ritual.There's four weapons and four magic spells you can use. All of which level up quite quickly in the somewhat basic upgrade menu. What's a game without a tacked on upgrade system, mirite? It's not bad, but it has no fancy skill trees or anything.The writing isn't the best, but it is entertaining. Especially the dialogue between Marlow and the floating Mayan mask he talks to. The voices are good in the sense that they're over the top and fit the style that the game is going for. The pacing is great. A nice mix of platforming, combat, puzzles, wall climbing, sliding, and on rail shooting. They're spread out to keep things interesing as you progress. The combat itself is also pretty good. It doesn't feel sloppy or cheap. Good PC hack and slash titles are few and far between and this is one that I'm glad I got to play.It's totally worth a purchase and playthrough.			"

												I picked up this game for a $1 thinking it was just going to give me a few hours of enjoyment and at least be worth its price and little did I know that it was going to be so much more, The combat and game mechanics work great with a mouse and keyboard even though I believe a controller may work better. The game play elements are lots of fun, like shooting down helicopters with Artillery guns and destroying large machine with artillery mounted guns, etc.. It has some RPG elements for enhancing skills, plus there are some on screen driven scenes that require quick key punching to complete a special kill or end a scene. I did have some issues with resolution but they seem to pan out. I can't run the game at 2560x1080 without getting some bleed over and stretch effect, but when running the game at a true 1920x1080 on my ultrwaide monitor it looks great, fitsm y screen with no stretch and no black bars.Overall its been great fun and I am kind of depressed that there was never a second one made...Worth the full price asking and definitely a must have at a $1.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Marlow Briggs and The Mask of Death 

			Views: 93		

			Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a 3rd person hack/slasher platformer turret game. Available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/249680/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is...		

	Marlow Brggs and the Mask of Death is hack and slash-esque platformer, with minimal options for attack, and repetitive attacks.  There are also limited puzzles, and a few turret sections.  The music, while respectable, was not used appropriatelyto emphasize action or atmosphere as you progress through the game.  There are leaderboards for those that enjoy them, and challenge areas that require a differentstyle of combat both to change up the standard hack and slash feel, and to offera harder level of difficulty for those looking to increase their leaderboard rankings.	The graphics look good, and the story is decent,with eclectic comedic aspects that come off as more corny than the game was trying for.  The game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, but it has clung to certainstereotypes such as ""rescue the princess"" that are overdone in many adventure games.	The level design is vast and impressive, but there is a certain suspension ofdisbelief required in the physics.   Some may find no fault in a full on battle whileflying through the air, but most would probably question how the characters aren'tthrown to their deaths.  The platforming is where this game excels in content. They are designed very well, and you will spend more time platforming through the world than doing anything else. There is a major problem with the camera angle, however, making itdifficult to see distances when platforming, and seeing enemies due to the angle.  ittakes away from the immersion into the game, and requiring memorization of challengesrather than going with the flow of the adventure.  I go more in depth into thisproblem in the video for those that would like a visual example.	The combat in the game falls short of what it could be;  the weapons allessentially do the same thing, with differences in range or speed.  As you progressthrough the game, the enemies require more button smashing to defeat rather than any tactics or response to their abilities.  There are spells in the game, but they allcost an excessive amount of mana, couldn't be used often, and have little effect ordamage to the enemy, taking away from the fluidity of the game.  	The game has good graphics, but has a lot of issues.  The story doesn't propelyou forward, and doesn't encourage an emotional connection.  The battles lack fluidityand the camera view makes it more repetitive than immersive.  I never felt the game was wasting my time, but I felt it was more boring than challenging.  You spend moretime platforming through the world than in combat.  If you expect more from games, thengood chance you will not enjoy this game, but if you are easily amused then this shouldbe good enough for you to enjoy. For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a shining example of story and emotional conveyance within a video game's narrative, and you're missing out if you haven't already experienced it.In this gripping tale, Marlow Briggs is abducted from a 3v3 basketball pickup match by gray aliens from the planet Xernov. With their language comprised mainly of ""ayy""s and obscene laughter, Marlow manages to understand that the aliens wish for nothing more than peace with mankind, and require Marlow to be their middle man.In one of the most masterful combinations of interactive cutscenes and interactions with dialogue trees, Marlow suddenly and quickly is fallen by an ancient evil awakening. This Summer, Marlow Briggs must team up with the Xernovians in order to defeat these elder gods once and for all. With some of the most fast-paced and intense rhythm sequences since Beatmania XVIII and iDOLM@STER, Marlow must jam and slam his way up the corporate ladder in order to become CEO of Time Warner Cable and provide a stable internet service that reaches across America that doesn't tug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in its spare time.Myst? Forget about it. Dear Esther? You'd be DEARly mistaken. The Last of Us? That takes last place. Gone Home? Check this, not your privilege. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death provides one of the most cinematic and moving moments in the  entire history of video games that I won't dare spoil. Here's a hint, though: Marlow is forced to choose between his love of futbol and the security of the Patriots project. Which will he choose?Citizen Kane? More like Citizen Lame. Buy Marlow Briggs.

												Feels like a modern version of God of War. Sure it is not that good. But they copied well and it is not that you have any God of War on Steam. And hey! This game is 99 cents at the moment. This really is a steal for some fun action adventure game. I even liked the weird intro and was wondering that the graphics are quite nice. It has action, decent graphics, good controller support and some God of War fighting system. Nothing to dislike.Recommended.			"

No.So why play this?It's fun as hell, the voice acting is fantastic, and the game does a lot of little things right. It's a classic action movie that you play, provides a good challenge, and doesn't overstay its welcome.I'd say $15 isn't a bad price, but it often goes on sale for $5 (and once went as low as $2.25) so pick it up and have a blast.

The Game itself instantly remembers me of Splatterhouse which i bought for PS3.Crazy Mask to Maincharacter chatter and bloody action with monstreous weapons and tons of red colored enemies. Also simple but nice story. This Game for just 0,99 € (as i bought it) is a killer and even 4,99 € would be definitively worth it. I had pretty much fun playing it and lots of smile on my face.The grafics are solid, lots of different enemies with very nice Semi and Endbosses and several types of play, e.g. driving a truck, flying a plane/helicopter, riding scorpions etc. So buy it and get some bad♥♥♥♥♥kicked.

												Quick Summary: Marlow Briggs is a mix of Darksiders style combat with Shadow Warrior 2013 style storytelling. They also throw in various diversions as well such as manning a turret and shooting down attack helicopters, top down airplane shooting, or puzzle platforming. Overall the game is a lot of fun and since it’s an indie game, it’s also cheap (though not on sale very often).*Spoilers below*You play the title character Marlow Briggs, trying to rescue your girlfriend after being “killed” with a magical weapon. Sadly (for the bad guys) the magical weapon turns you into a mythical warrior with a new friend, the Mask of Death. The Mask is a lot like the demon companion in Shadow Warrior, who only you can see, and kind of guides you along while making snide remarks at you. Your mission, aside from revenge and rescuing your girlfriend, is to stop the big bad guy from gathering enough magical power to become some kind of ancient Mexican god (even though I think the guy is Chinese).The game is played in third person perspective and it’s one of those platformers where you can swing a big weapon and knock around a dozen enemies at once, comparable to Darksiders/DMC Devil May Cry. The combat isn’t that sophisticated, just hit the enemies and dodge when they attack. You also have access to some magical spells, but “mana” in the game is kind of limited and you can’t spam the spells (your mana bar won’t even let you cast 2 spells in a row without picking up more energy). The spells are quite powerful though, and really splash up the screen. Combat is about 66% of the game, where the rest is platforming such as climbing, dodging boulders, double jumping (and later gliding on magical wings). There are a few puzzles to solve, but they’re not too hard. The biggest pain comes from some of the enemies having extraordinary amounts of life.You should try this game if:+You are looking for a relatively easy hack/slash platforming game with a decent story. Only a few areas in the game had me replaying over and over (challenge areas with risk of instant death). The game only takes about 6-7 hours to beat.You should NOT try this game if:-You’re expecting some kind of grand RPG, or a game with a lot of replay value. This game cost me $2 and after playing through, I deleted it. Had a good time, now I move on to something else.  "

												Do you remember those old, cheesy action movies that you used to love, regardless of how bad the actually movie was..?  As the trailer and store description implies, ""Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death"" is like *playing* one of those.  The fact you're basically in an over-the-top action film is frequently lampshaded throughout the game by characters comments such as ""Now if only there was a convenietly placed gun turrent so I could take out all these helicopters..."" and ""Stop making everything explode!"" XD The Gameplay tends to be in the same tract as ""God Of War"" or ""Prince of Persia,"" in that it mixes heavy combat with platforming and puzzles.  Unlike such classics, however, none of the different elements aren't messed together very, with there being clear breaks between different parts of the game.  The camera is also locked in an isometric view, which is rather limiting despite the good graphics.  Despite these faults, gameplay is fun and challenging, with a decent plot and large amounts of genre savvy humor thrown in.In short, ""Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death"" won't be winning awards for game-of-the-year anytime soon, but if you're looking for fast paced action, mindless violence, puzzles, humor, and enough pyrotechnics to make ten Michael Bay movies, you've found the right game.  Full price might be a bit much, but picking this one up on sale is certainly a good idea. :)			"

												Despite looking like a Playstation 2 game, plus the added fact that there a lot more games out there that does everything Marlow Briggs does, but better . (The platforming is good, not great. The fighting is good, not great. The shooting parts are good, not great) it does have one giant thing going for it.It is a hell of a lot of fun to play.The game is not too hard, it definetely does not take itself seriously, and it is (as I said) a blast to play. About 8 hours long and the game varies itself just enough to keep things from getting too stale (you fight, but then you will platform for a bit, before doing more fighting and then maybe a little shooting) you could do a lot worse than to give Marlow Briggs a whirl.

												If you are looking for a fast paced hack and slash game, not challenging your skill too much but still requires basic control, try this one. Fight isthe center of gam,e and it feels good. You have 3 weapons to choice, blade is fast, whip makes more range, axe does more damage. Use them wisely to kill different kind of enemies, and don't forget 4 mana attack. Sometimes you need to mount your enemies rather kill them.The puzzles are simple, it doesn't take long for me to solve them, but I did repeat several times because there usually are time limitation.This game also has many old-school mini games. Slide/run game, defense game, even arcade fly shooting game. It's not some major developer's game that draws everyone's attention. It has minor glitches, but they won't stuck your game progress so play with confidence. View angel also needs to be changed in some places. But I believe this game has much more merits than defects. You can hardly find 5 bucks game as good as this one nowadays.I enjoyed 6 hours of my playtime. Beat the game, feeling great.Recommend.			"

It's basically ""Action Flick/B-Movie/Blacksploitation: The Video Game"". Uncharted? Check. God of War? Check. Explosions? Check. Stereotypical quips and one-liners? Check. White woman? Check. Resolution/fullscreen issues on my machine, but noth that can't be worked around. If you don't buy this while it's under a buck, you're certifiably insane.			"

												A God of War clone to a shameless extent, this budget title is a 6 hour rush through a bizarre and humorous schlock-filled, buddy cop, blacksploitation story.The combat is simple and mindless like the franchise it is ripping it from verbatim but it functions well and is enjoyable. The game's pace is frantic and non-stop from beginning to end switching you between combat sequences, platforming, rail shooting, sliding sequences and even SHUMP sections with the only lull being the games three puzzles.The game looks surprisingly good for its $15 price tag with some notable backdrops looking really impressive, combat animations that flow nicely and a solid framerate throughout its entirety. However animations in the few cutscenes that are actually fully animated look really janky and awkward which is probably why they opted to do panning/ stop motion type sequences for most of their cutscenes which are unique and work quite well.Where the game really shines though is its dialogue and sense of humor which is as plentiful and quickly paced as everything else in this game. If you enjoy character action games or humorous over the top action stories you will definitely want to check this out.			"

												Yay, yet another action adventure on rails. Then again, at least it's not a puzzle platformer! Honestly though, Marlow Briggs isn't all that bad as long as you don't mind the linearity. I have to say I have absolutely no idea where Marlow Briggs comes from, whether it's a franchise of some sorts or simply a new IP. What I do know is that it features a badass-looking African-American main character full of buff and somewhat lacking in smarts. As it happens Mr. Briggs decided to drop in an visit his sweetheart at the dig site where she works, spend some quality holiday time together. As it also happens, his sweetheart works for an unscrupulous mafia boss hell-bent on becoming a god. What follows is a standard man rescues woman plot, though in this case it's filled with cheesy jokes and commentary from the characters as well as lots of over-the-top action and destruction. Think 90's action movies maybe - big unbelievable machines, lots of explosions, and an evil mastermind who just can't help commenting on the main character's progress (and his own failures).

In terms of game mechanics there isn't all that much here that hasn't been done before. Lots of running and jumping and avoiding various implements of death, a significant number of speed slaloming sections too. A few puzzles involving pressure-plates and levers too, though they're pretty easy to grasp and rather annoying to execute at times. A lot of those are also timer-based which only makes it more frustrating. Possibly to compensate for this there are a few turret sections and some top-down plane shmup sections too.Combat is based on combos composed of light and heavy attack mixes, though I have to give credit to the ingame combo tutor. In more detail there are 4 weapons that cover the usual variety - a standard balanced weapon, a set of daggers with high speed but low attack, a whip with massive range and rate of attack but even lower attack, and a massive scythe that probably should've been a sledgehammer given its slow but devastating attack. On top of that there are 4 types of magic - Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind - and a quickfire homing magic missile. Creep-wise there are several standard varieties - including but not limited to shield-bearers, heavies, giants, gunners, or huge scorpions - sadly those feel more like a chore past the few initial encounters. Every now and then a boss comes along (5 times, to be precise) and things get more entertaining.

Visually it's a decent offering, the models look plenty detailed and the environments are rich and vibrant. And I really mean this - initially there are massive excavation machines that resemble moving fortresses more than anything and later on lots of ruins and jungle and mountains. Maybe the textures don't hold up to AAA games upon closer inspection but overall there's nothing to complain about.

Animation-wise there doesn't seem much to complain about, attacks look smooth and interrupts are more than an instant transition to a hit pose. Of particular note is the unusual style that some of the cutscenes are done it - stop-motion frames! It's kinda like what Batman: Arkham Asylum/City did - a series of snapshots of a 3D scene brimming with action an momentum. Hard to describe but pretty successful. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192811453Now on the audio side things are not as pretty though. There are a TON of dialogues and voiced chatter, and it's not the worst it could be. The main character actually sounds pretty decent, as does the main villain. However, I personally had issues and very few voice-overs actually played. If it wasn't for the subtitles I'd have no idea someone was talking. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231662424The only other big gripe I had with this title was the camera. I found the camera mighty awkward most of the time and there is no way to actually adjust the camera manually! This ties in into finding hidden bonuses and collectibles I suppose but those are few and far between to actually warrant that. And it's not like the camera actually follows behind at all times, nope, the angle seems to be pre-defined in most zones/areas/corridors.Initially I wasn't sure I'd stick through to the end. I've seen TotalBiscuit's WTF Is.. on Marlow Briggs and got hooked. Then I fired it up and noticed the missing voice-overs. And this somewhat killed the mood for me. With the voice overs (and given their frequency) the game would've been pretty engaging, as it was it turned into a rather mundane experience. Nevertheless, Marlow Briggs is a decent enough action adventure - as long as you're not expecting too much. Darksiders or DmC this is not, after all.			"

												What were to happen if Lara Croft and Batman had a wild night out on the town?  Perhaps this game.  Admitedly its similarities with batman are only its slick combat, combo, weapons and powers system though without that the batman games are mostly just cool set pieces.  It picks up alot of tomb raider vibes in its well done platforming and puzzles etc.  What this game also has is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of b-movie humour delivered by Steve Blum as the ancient aztec death mask who really does some of his finest work in this game.  This game also has a failry unique setting besides the ancient ruins in the shape of monsterous industrial machines, facilities that blanket the jungle regions, like the keystone pipeline with a penchant for outofthisworld steroids.  The games weapon and power progression is straightforward and matches the slick gameplay.  This is probably in the top 10 platformers/beat-em-ups i've ever played though admittedly my console days are long behind me.  Still this game actually works perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard, though i could see some preferring to use a controller.The games humour and slick combat and platforming though are why people should play this game, and based on the nearly all positive steam reviews I'm not alone.  Also at around 6 hours or so its a nice diversion from other game types.  It was also just another amusement to peruse the achivements and notice an achievement for skipping all in game cutscenes in a single playthrough...oh game.  Thanks for keeping the smiles going.			"

												I had low expectations for this game, but I thought it might surprise me by being a complete spoof of other games, a bit like Saints Row is a parody of GTA. But Marlow Briggs lacks both charm and quality to make it appealing. Few would argue that the pricing is reasonable. However, the game suffers from too many issues to make it a recommendable game. The game consists of platforming sections and ""hack n slash"" combat. The problem is not the variety in combos, weapons, enemies and level design. I'd go as far as saying the developers have done a decent job (for a low-budget game anyway) in those departments. The problem is simple: PLATFORMING SECTIONS. This is a game where you don't have control over the camera so it's EXTREMELY linear - as in, you can't deviate. One would think that there is little to go wrong but you'd be wrong. You will die hundreds of times not because of poor timing or misjudgement, but because the game is simply glitchy. Inputs are not handled with any care whatsoever - the game doesn't feel consistent or smooth to play at all. Everything has a delay, and sections involving grappling or swinging are very buggy - often you can't jump off the rope, for example. Although the game is light-hearted and makes jokes about its own design, there's nothing original whatsoever. It's not classy, intelligent or well-thought out by any means. The story and characters are generic, and the level of comedy is not enough to make you laugh out loud. The problem becomes apparent when you realise that the game is TRYING to be ""epic"" with all its fancy locations and scenery, yet the texture quality is bad with lots of pop-in. Whilst I highly value big-budget AAA titles, I also have an appreciation for the underdogs and smaller games which sacrifice production value for a single aspect - like comedic writing/characters or focus on one specific gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately, Marlow Briggs does not impress in any department. If you are bored and have nothing better to do and are desperate for a cheap giggle, Marlow Briggs can provide that. Just don't expect it to be anything memorable.			"

												A game that deserves ""cult classic"" status. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is by all means an obscure game. It practically had no exposure or marketing to speak of, besides the fact that it exists on Steam.Developed by ZootFly and published by the increasingly schizophrenic 505 Games, Marlow Briggs at first glance looks like... Well... Honestly it leaves absolutely no impression at first glance. I remember at one point browsing through 505 Games' library on Steam and coming across this game, and all I did was laughingly shrug it off as something not even worth looking at.Eventually, by a stroke of pure chance, I ended up looking into it some more and was quite intreagued by what I saw.So what exactly is Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death? Due to Steam and it's ♥♥♥♥tarded arbitrary character cap on reviews, you'll have to follow this link to find out!http://pastebin.com/8mHSt9b5Don't blame me, blame Valve. "

												Initially a fun little God-of-War style brawler, with nice visuals and a decent line in over-the-top 80s action movie flavour. Even some of the canned wisecracks were sort of funny.About two thirds of the way in, however, the difficulty spikes and the fights become a real chore - you're constantly dodging out of the way and never get to use any of the neat combos the game has spent the past few hours teaching you. Some of the jumping sections are also pretty obnoxious, with checkpoints set way too far back. The camera is not manually controllable, and whilst it usually does a decent job of being in the right place can be annoying when you just want to look around and work out a puzzle or plan a jump. There is a manual save function which can mitigate some of the frustration if you notice and remember to use it.Whilst the game certainly has its good points - the art is pretty cool, and the fights are fun at first - I found it too frustrating and with too many cheap-feeling deaths to get a recommendation. If you have a slightly masochistic streak and don't mind trying the same jump over and over, maybe this would suit you.			"

Graphically the game looks great, and the controls are smooth. The voice acting is well done and performed by accomplished voice-actors. The game doesn't take itself seriously and it shows in the funny story. The banter between Marlow and the Mask is great. The Mask cracks jokes when Marlow is killing enemies and makes fun of him when he dies.   I only had one problem, sometimes when trying to grab a rope or ladder you would miss. Some locations you had to stand in a specific spot to grab on, or you would just grab air. Other than that the gameplay was great.			"

												Marlow Briggs is a B-movie style romp through character action games like none before it. Based on the mechanics of Dante's Inferno (read: almost a direct copy), the gameplay is solid, fast, and fun, while the story provides a hilarious backdrop for the action to be taking place. The character of Marlow Briggs and his interaction with Tep are amusing and provide even more comedic relief. Best derivative/knock-off game I've ever touched for sure.			"

												This is a low budget game. It has low budget graphics, sound, story and characters. However, this game is fun for what it is. It is a spectacle fighter with a nice sense of action movie humor in it. The gameplay consists mainly of God of War style combat mixed with some light platforming and easy puzzle solving. If you can find this game on sale, then you should give it a shot. Completely passable. The story is also a lot better and makes more sense than Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Price paid: $0.99. Yes, 1 dollar			"

												This game is unbelievably testosterone-heavy.  Inspired (very, very heavily.  Like, ""watch out for copyright lawsuits"" heavily) by God of War 2, a game already known by all men with booming voices, beards, and indescribable road rage, this is the tale of Marlow Briggs.  See, Marlow isn't just your regular old barrel-chested he-man.  He fights fires.  Not to be confused with spraying water on burning buildings, no.  Before you have ever even picked up the controller, Marlow Briggs has had a history of going mano-e-mano with towering pillars of flame.  Fists only.  No items.  Final Destination.  By the time your dainty, effeminate hands have laid themselves down on the controller (play it with a controller, it's a console type of action game), he has had sexual intercourse with more women than you have ever seen, including your mother and all of your sisters over the age of 18, though the underage ones still jill off to him.  Over the course of the next few hours, you will direct his wrath at a menagerie of mercenaries and Aztec horrors all over a Central American jungle.  Even though I was already an adult male, this game put me through a second, much stronger puberty.  My testicles dangle like anvils with a sweater on them, my booming voice shatters windows and sends girly men screaming to the ground, and my muscles got so big that even wearing a muscle shirt still costs the GDP of a small African country.  I have to wear a shirt or else risk being drowned in a tide of slippery sloots.  The only reason I would not recommend this game is if you enjoy being imprisoned in that frail, child-like body of yours.			"

												Sometimes, a game comes along that asks little of you. Instead of pretension and criminal seriousness, there is an earnestness and a willingness to have fun with itself - even when its technical trappings are rough around the edges. With obvious inspiration being taken from the flashy beat-em-ups a la Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, Marlow Briggs' action is completely relentless, with the story travelling along at the same pace. While it is not the prettiest game out there, its visuals are stylized such that one can't help but be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of preposterous explosions. It doesn't push the envelope in terms of mechanics, story, or social commentary, but it does have exploding red barrels and a scythe. What more could one possibly need for a $5 purchase such as this?			"

												First things first I honestly wasn't expecting much going to Marlow Briggs but a cheap God of War clone. I was immediately blown away and got an amazing game instead.To get the negatives out of the way the game doesn't have any graphics options at all besides the ability to change your resolution. Textures are not the best and the game has a lot of glitches. Having said that what Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death excels at is the combat, if you have played spectacle fighters such as Dantes Inferno, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or even God of War you will find a familiar control scheme here with fluid moves to match. The over the top campy nature of the game just adds to the awesome. The dialogue between Marlow and Tep (aka the Mask) is just hilarious. 4 out of 5.			"

												While this game has a few imperfections I find it to be one of the best games I've bought. It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't star yet another white guy with ambiguous motives. You play an every man trying to rescue his lady friend and defeat a flamboyant and merciless guy hellbent on destruction. I think one of my favorite aspects of this game is that, while the story could have been nothing due to the game mechanics being fun and tight feeling, it actually paints a really compelling picture. You can tell via the voice acting and writing that Marlow really cares about his significant other and vice versa. Other larger budget games often attempt to make you feel something when it comes to romantic interests/sub plots but this is one of the first that actually had me invested in their relationship. The game mechanics are great. I really enjoy the fixed camera despite it being something that I haven't liked since Silent Hill 2 and it allows you to use your other thumbstick (I use a PS3 controller) to roll and evade making the combat even more refreshing. The difficulty also doesn't let up despite your character getting better weapons as you progress which keeps the game fresh and non-repetitive. I think the only negative mark I've found so far is that due to the fixed camera, there will be times where you make a move the game doesn't fully anticipate and the camera will float into space, causing you to restart from your last checkpoint. This has only happened twice and I can see how it could happen based on what actions I was trying to accomplish. Aside from that minor issue, the game is solid and it cost me less than a croissant.A+			"

Some of the puzzles are annoying but not impossible. The cut scenes are unique ""evolving"" freeze frames which is a nice touch. Yes there are glitches, just a week ago I tried to jump up onto something I thought was a reachable ledge to maybe a hidden item. Instead, I jumped up and went into the mountain side and Marlow just kept up this long horizontal jump into the void. But who cares! This game is dirt cheap, has great voice acting, great graphics, and is extremely fun. A must have for any fan of the God of War style action games!			"

												A cheap & cheerful God of War style beat-em-up. Although a budget title, graphically it has a lot of polish with big set pieces, a lot of explosions and decent enough effects. The plot is silly and the game knows it. As Marlow Briggs, you are a huge black dude who gets imbued by superpowers after being stabbed by a mystic, ancient weapon. You are then followed around by a floating tribal mask while you 'save the princess' and the fate of the world. While beating people up is the primary mode of play, you will also shoot down helicopters (multiple times), fly planes (1942-style), platform and puzzle solve. It's mindless fun.It's no masterpiece, though. Textures are pretty low resolution, and I encountered at least one showstopping bug during my playthrough. There are some annoyances, like how some ledges you can't fall off of (even though there's nothing blocking you from the edge) and others you can easily walk to your death. There are a few too many 'minecart' sequences (the kind where you are on-rails and have to dodge obstacles) - one of these is on an actual minecart. Most of these are just annoying instead of fun. The game is farily easy, with the exception of the final boss, which took me a few tries to beat. In fact, the hardest part of the game is the end credits (I'll let you figure out what I mean on your own).Anyway, for the price (dirt cheap on steam sale), it's easy to recommend.			"

												Looking for a game like God of War but for PC? You're in luck, my friend. This game is a GREAT hack 'n' slasher/spectacle fighter which is VERY underrated and should been given more attention. The game knows that it isn't the greatest game around and that it doesn't have the best story of all time... and that's one of the things that makes it so great - the humor. It doesn't take itself seriously.You're playing as Marlow Briggs (surprise!) as he is visiting his girlfriend at her new workplace and he... he gets killed... and resurrected by a Mayan death mask. After that, Marlow wants revenge on the one who killed him and to take his girlfriend back from the same guy. Nothing original at all but it does what it's supposed to.Great game all the way through. Give it a shot!			"

												Here's a ""what if"" scenario for you: what if Michael Bay made games instead of movies?Silly plot? Check. Cheesy dialog? Check. Something exploding like every two seconds? Check. Yeah, this game is pretty much nonstop Bayhem. And it is glorious.Gameplay-wise this is a generic spectacle fighter in the style of God of War and the like. Nothing special or interesting in the combat department, it's passable. It's a bit clunky and always puts style over substance, but it all works well enough.Same can be also said about many of the other features. Camera? Checkpoints? Platforming? You name it, they all work well enough. Some annoyances here and there, but not in rage-inducing amounts.Where this game truly shines however, is the pacing. Any time when you're starting to get a bit bored of punching enemy grunts in the face, the game throws something else your way, like a puzzle for example. Or a platforming segment. Or a short cutscene filled with explosions. Or a shmup minigame. Or a turret section (yeah, to my surprise even those somehow manage to be fun). There wasn't a dull moment in the whole 7-8 hours my first playthrough took.So all in all, when you start analyzing all the individual parts the game indeed doesn't sound all that great... but I'll be damned if I wasn't entertained the whole way through!For those who care about numbers, I would rate it 8 out of 10 needlessly big explosions.

												A very fun hack and slash game that doesn't take itself too seriously and is dirt cheap for what's within it.The Good:+CHEEAP!!!+The hack and slash feels nice and it's seriously satisfying to pull a succesful combo.+There's a leveling up system (albeit very linear) where you can buy and practice new combo moves.+Barely any quicktime events. God of War had so many of these and they meant going back to square one if you failed.+Story isn't serious, it's all over the place and goofy in a good way.+Game looks pretty damn good and could run on a toaster.The Bad:-There are too many platforming sections. If you fall, or the game glitches out. BAM! Back to the checkpoint. Fortunately, it brings you back to the most recent save. So save before platforms. It's kinda annoying buy better than going 5 minutes back.The UGLY:-The cutscenes with the stiff characters and the camera panning are so long and irritating. You can skip these, but you'll miss some parts of the story.-Gameplay is almost too reminiscent of God of War. In fact, it's nearly identical. It gives the game an indie/bootleg reek that it isn't deserve.-This game cannot balance difficulty. First you'll be platforming, seconds later fighting a snake demon with pistons trying to murder you.-This game has many gamebreaking bugs, most of which are in the sections where you climb vines or hang on to it. There are many areas where the devs looked over that make you either fall out of the map or cause a headache inducing graphic glitch. Then fall out of the map.			"

But he kills with a magic stick that makes you immortal and gives your powers, so he fuq'd up.Enemies take a millions years to kill, even though you have the power of a war god inside your body, but the dialogue is pretty great. Your best pal, Steve Blum, is an invisible ghost mask who gives you the nickname ""Princess Ballerina of Death."" to strike fear into the hearts of your foes.The boss fights are not very challenging, they're mostly just QTE's, and DASS GONNA BE PROB'M WITH A LOSSA PEOPLEAll in all, not a bad game, but not amazing either.Get it on sale, it's pretty cheap.

												A Tonne of funNo, Really, Marlow Briggs while not a masterpiece is definitely a fun little game, the term ""God of war clone"" is thrown out there a lot, this however is game play-wise pretty much exactly like God of War, which is good and sometimes bad. Like Kratos, Marlow isn't very good at platforming, but is pretty darn good at swinging.Unlike God of War, which takes itself way too seriously, Marlow is actually a pretty cool guy, he is very sarcastic and best of all, you are accompanied by an Aztec mask who will always have something funny to say, the bickering between these two always got a chuckle out of me. The editing between scenes can be jarring as it's clear most of the animations team effort went into the combat, you won't get much out of the cut scenes, nor will you really care either.That being said, the game play while not great for the platforming segments, is worth it for the excellent combat, doing insane combos and unleashing devastating elemental attacks is very satisfying, this is why it's okay to be a God of war clone, the God of war games are fun. The game also has a good amount of variety, there are the platforming segments which will probably kill you more than the combat segments, there are a good number of different enemies to fight (for a 6-7 hour game anyway) and there are fantastic action segments such as scenes where you are hanging on to a helicopter for dear life (there are even segments from other game genres that took me by surprise in a good way).This was honestly a pretty unique and satisfying experience for me, a short little game you go into knowing it'll be cheesy, silly and even stupid at times, but is a fun experience regardless, I played the game a month ago within a few days and still remember it fondly, it's not for everyone, but give this a go if you like beat-em-ups or action games in general, it's over the top, silly, action packed and a lot of fun.

												Take God of War, remove it from ancient Greece and set it in South America, present time. Take all the cheese of 80s action movies, add the bravado and humour of those as well and you can pretty much describe Marlow Briggs.It's a nice game when you just want to beat something up. Sure it's a budget title, and it shows at times with some questionable camera positions in a couple of places, as well as enemies which show up a bit too often near the middle of the game.The jungle landscapes do look rather nice, the stop motion action sequences do a really good job of capturing the over the top action of some of the 80s action movies, without having to actually animate it. The combat is satisfying with your standard light attack, heavy attack, block and dodge rolls. Some rather good platforming segments and other action segments break up the game from being just beating up enemies.It doesn't do much wrong. It's not exceptional either, but as a budget title it's a quite enjoyable time. Just make sure you play with a gamepad.			"

												Think Kratos, Lara Croft, Michael Bay and Eddie Murphy - and you will have covered a number of ways to describe the influences to this great game.Seriously, this is probably the best use of 79p (uk money) ever. This game is simply just fun. It is very clearly a GOW clone, but a good one. The graphics are very good. And is runs very well with no frame rate or crashing issues. The humour in the game is pretty good, as the game doesn't take itself too seriously (at one point I was cursing the person who designed the levels, as I kept dying in one part, for Marlow to cry out ""who designed these levels anyway?"" in the middle of the game - cracked me up.The game does have some issues, like even though you have lots of combos there are probably only three that you will ever need. The level design is a little questionable at times. The game is very god, but just not quite as tight as the GOW games. And of course, for a black dude to get super powers, we have to knock on the door of voodoo (just a minor thing - as the mask is very funny and more than makes up for it).All in all, this is an insane bargain at 79p. A very under recognised gem. It would be great value for money at £8.00. Buy it, during this sale it a no brainer.Oh yeah - YOU WILL NEED A XBOX/XINPUT PAD!!!!			"

												Rated: 7/10If """"God of War"", and ""The Expendables"" had a voodoo doll baby this is what it would look like. This game makes no attempt to take itself seriously or have a story that will blow your mind and that's actually whats so great about. It's self aware and makes fun of itself and the characters frequently.The combat is very fluid for the most part and the levels are beautiful. The game does have an upgrade system for attacks. Traversing the world is done pretty easily and the camera doesn't get in your way to often.This is the popcorn 90's action flick of video games... EXPLOSIONS!			"

												Se podría decir que este juego es una combinación de Devil May Cry (por los modos de combate, armas y combos) God of War (lo mismo que el anterior sumada con la nula movilidad de la camara) y Dante's Inferno (por la trama).La historia no es muy larga, personalmente lo complete en 9 horas, pero lo compensa con la cantidad de ataques y armas disponibles para poder destrozar a tus enemigos.En fin juego recomendable.Nota: 7/10			"

												At first it is a good cheap game but the longer you play you see more and more bugs. You will most likely die in middle of jump for no reason or a giant scorpion might kill you by hitting ground and even if the attack misses you by few dozen feet you will still recieve the damage for no reason. Sometimes your attacks do damage as intended but when your combo meter hits over 160 hits and the normal enemy that usually dies at 20 hits max is standing in front of you, you start to wonder how is this even possible. This game would get my recommendations if the bugs were ironed out but as it is now I can't seriously recommend it.			"

												Make no mistake, Marlow Briggs is not a great game. It plays like a janky and rough copy of God of War. it is however an exceptionally fun game. It has some great set pieces, fantastic action sequences and generally funny banter.I was happy with this purchase at about half off but I would have gladly paid full price.			"

												I get that this game was meant to be an over the top, 80s action movie style game, but for me it just got boring real fast. You're constantly slashing your way through the same bad guys and being bombarded with explosions which is fun for about an hour but then just grates on you. The platforming is very basic and the camera doesn't do you any favours when you're trying to jump across gaps which gets frustrating. Overall I just couldn't get anywhere near finishing it as there's undoubtedly far better games out there to be played.			"

												Surprisingly fun and well-made game. Extremely fast paced right from the start, with frequent check points so you never have to replay more than a few minutes of the game when you die. Graphics look good, with colorful and diverse environments. The only major downfall is the frequency of MAJOR FPS SLOWDOWN, especially when you enter a new area or segment of one.The slowdown is particularly noticable during the 'avoid things as you go quickly forward on rails' levels. I did some googling and this seems to be a hit-or-miss problem, some players have no FPS problems at all, while others describe having the exact same issues.PROS+ FUN!  Extremely Action-Packed and Fast Paced right from the first few seconds.+ Controls are accurate and feel great (with 360 controller)+ Block puzzles are intuitive and don't require a guide.+ Very frequent check points.+ Short Shooting segments and on-rail events help mix things up.+ Nothing feels repetitive or grindy. The game hurls you forward and never looks back.CONS- Annoyingly frequent frame-rate drops for some players, even on high-end PCs.- ""Freeze-Frame"" cut scenes don't impress and it seems like the devs ran out of money to properly animate them.- The 'mini-game' during the end game credits is horrendously frustrating. I'd rather just sit through the credits.OVERALL: 8.5/10.  Get it on sale and be thoroughly entertained for the next 5-6 hours.			"

												Marlow Briggs for 99¢ on Steam is the best game you will ever buy and play for 99¢. For the price of a candy bar you can have the best experience of your life with Marlow Briggs for 99¢ on Steam. It is a life changing experience and will change the way you see games and life in general forever. I was on a downward spiral of depression before playing this game. My good friend came up to me and told me ""Hey, have you checked out Marlow Briggs for 99¢ on Steam? It's a life-changing game and the best game you will ever play for 99¢ in your life."" I thought a great game for only 99¢? That sounds too good to be true, but I still bought it because for 99¢, what did I have to lose? As soon as it finished downloading, my computer played a chorus fit for the Heavens. As the chorus chanted ""Marlow Briggs"", getting louder and louder as I finally clicked on the game to start it. Once I did that, the chorus stopped immediately as one last ""MARLOW BRIGGS"" was sung with a ear deafening, yet mentally soothing tone. Following the silence was the game booting up and bringing me to the start screen, I subsequently went blind. My vision was brought back after a few minutes which I can only assume was Marlow Briggs himself testing me to see if I was worthy of laying my eyes upon this immortal beauty. From here I cannot say what beautiful godlike things have happened to me playing this game, as only Marlow Briggs can judge who can have this knowledge, but I can tell you now, I know everything and anything. I no longer have the capacity for depression because I have no need for mortal foolishness like emotions. Only my pure devotion to Marlow Briggs is needed to sustain my now immortal body and mind. What are you waiting for? Change your life for only 99¢ with Marlow Briggs for 99¢ on Steam.			"

												A game with a robust and very enjoyable combat system which has a very well-implemented combo system that doesn't require you to wait to press the right button for combo: you can ""dial"" the combo in the beginning and let it execute (block and dodge will interrupt it), which lets you use the combos more tactically than in other spectacle fighters. Enemies are varied as are locations. Boss battles are quite lame, but brief. The game makes no premises about what it is and is filled with self-parody and stupidity all the way through it's ""story"". Cutscenes and characters are laughably plastic and the game even has an achievement for skipping all cutscenes, which I thoroughly recommend on ""achieving"". 5-6 hours of fun and enjoyable combat and great colourful levels, supplemented by dumb and hilarious commentary of a talking Mayan mask are definitely worth this game's asking price.""If only there was a conveniently-placed AA gun for me to deal with all these helicopters...""

												You know what, Marlow Briggs may be a low budgeter, but it truly was an entertaining game.  Sure it copies a decent amount of its tricks from the God of War formula, but in all honestly, that's not really a bad template to borrow from.  Throw in a little bit of Indiana Jones, 70s blaxploitation film-making, B action movies, nonsensical comedy and you've got the vibe for this game down pat.  I actually enjoyed this game more than alot of big budget games from the same genre.  Briggs isn't a perfect game, yet it does so much right that I couldn't stop playing until I completed the hardcore mode today, FINALLY.  In Marlow Briggs you are killed by an evil Chinese magnate who wants to rule the world with a frightening, sort of terraforming magical power.  He kills you and kidnaps your girlfriend, though thankfully Marlow is brought back by a wise-cracking mask that guides him through his journey to save the girl, the day and the world.  The entire premise is ridiculous.  Once you're having fun with the game, the plot hardly even matters.  At its core, Briggs is a hack n' slashers delight.  You arm yourself with several types of melee weapons, magic, long range attacks and acrobatic abilities.  As you fight and explore, you earn experience to upgrade your powers, making you a killing machine on a machine.  You'll explore crazy industrial complexes, temples, caves, jungles and much more.  While graphically, Marlow and the gang aren't the best game in town; he surely isn't the worst looking either.  Levels are solidly detailed with lots to peer at in the distance and the enviroments look good while alternately being a blast to travel.  There's hidden secrets to find and numerous achievements to unlock.  There is also a hardcore mode on hand that will test your skills for certain.  It's not as impossible as Deadlight, but it will put up a stiff challenge and make you sing for your supper.  You upgrade with new equipment at key points of the game while fighting legions of foes that include all sorts of armed guards, giant insects, mythical looking boss creatures, teleporting evil priests, giants, a wolf like Hellbeast and other assorted demons.  The boss fights are a blast, and require quicks hands, strategic use of attacks/abilities and old fashioned pattern memorization.  That's really all there is to it!  The campagin is a decent length with alot of areas to explore and frequent differences in scenery so that you'll rarely be bored and when you're not fighting like a champ there are all sorts of gameplay variations to keep things exciting.  You'll man gun turrets, fly choppers and fighter planes while shooting down everything in sight, use your nimble abilities to platform your way to victory, etc.  The controls were mostly tight and responsive, so it's easy to get yourself in the action and stay there.  While I expected minimal of this game, I got way more than I bargained for and put in 28.7 hrs to beat it twice and get most of the achievements (97%).   Hell, once weakening certain monsters like the club wielding giants and monster scorpions, you can even ride and use them to fight Golden Axe style!  On the downside, sometimes the controls do tend to get a little wacky and combo stringing won't feel entirely accurate, making for a cheap death or two.  The QT buttom presses to hammer down on certain bosses and deal decisive blows don't always register, which also got me slaughtered a couple of times as well.  While not with the frequency of a survival horror game, the camera has potential to get a little rickety and you'll end up taking a beating from some foes you can't even see.  All of the problems with the game were rather minor and I actually thought this game was HIGHLY addicting and entertaining to play.  To be honest...I like it more than some of the God of War sequels.  You can scream blasphemy all you want, but that's how I felt.  Another downside is that the slow-motion cut scenes could have been better executed and the voice acting isn't top-notch (although its rampant cheesiness is rather endearing as this game is straight out of one of those B movie action 4 packs).  Overall, anyone into the hack n' slash genre would do well to check this out for the cheap price.  I hope they make a sequel with co-op!  Good lord, that'd be a blast. Now for some quick pros and cons:  Pros-Solid graphics and sound-Excellent set of weapons, abilities and magic-90% of the time the fighting is fluid and fun-Superb enemy variety with tough fights and killer battles with monstrous bosses-Campy storyline and voice-acting adds to the appeal-Combos are easy to execute and satisfying- 90% of the time the controls are response and fun-Great gameplay variety with everything listed above and even a few puzzlesCons-10% of the time the fighting can be a little clunky-10% of the time some button presses won't register, especially the QT sequences (fortunately they are few)-Platforming is a beotch when the controls stutterOverall:  8.2/10			"

												Marlow Briggs has got all the attributes of a budget games: ridiculous plot, cheesy dialogue, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cutscenes, and yet it manages to be as entertaining as any run of the mill AAA production.The graphics are quite superb and varied. The game runs extremely smooth at a constant 60fps and is very well optimised for PC.The price to pay for the beautifully designed environments is the fixed camera perspective, which is literally the most annoying thing about the game, but well, for that price...Other than that the gameplay is generally smooth. The controls are fluid and fast, not always 100% precise, but forgiving enough for it not to matter.Marlow Briggs alternates hack-n-slash fights, which can get a bit repetitive but never too much, with platform sequences which are more fast paced and generally more enjoyable, There are also some puzzles, minigames and bossfights thrown in for fun, and some QTEs for anti-fun.All in all, for your 3$ you are getting a ton of brainless fun, easy-play adventure full of ludicrous and unbelievable special effects and explosions.This is one the best value for money you'll ever get, if you don't take your games too seriously. The developpers sure didn't, and as a result Marlow Briggs is quite entertaining and deserves the thumbs up....oh and also, best credit roll, ever.			"

The dialogue isn't the best, but it reminds me of some cheese♥♥♥♥♥♥like black ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dynamite. ♥♥♥♥ing awesome in that respect.  the game looks just fine as well and the controls are responsive. The combo system works jsut fine, gameplay is pretty much just god of war cloning, which isn't a bad game to clone. It's already over the top and crazy, already loving it.

Levels are solidly detailed with lots to peer at in the distance and the enviroments look good while alternately being a blast to travel.  There's hidden secrets to find and numerous achievements to unlock.  There is also a hardcore mode on hand that will test your skills for certain.  It's not as impossible as Deadlight, but it will put up a stiff challenge and make you sing for your supper.  You upgrade with new equipment at key points of the game while fighting legions of foes that include all sorts of armed guards, giant insects, mythical looking boss creatures, teleporting evil priests, giants, a wolf like Hellbeast and other assorted demons.  The boss fights are a blast, and require quicks hands, strategic use of attacks/abilities and old fashioned pattern memorization.  That's really all there is to it!  The campagin is a decent length with alot of areas to explore and frequent differences in scenery so that you'll rarely be bored and when you're not fighting like a champ there are all sorts of gameplay variations to keep things exciting.  You'll man gun turrets, fly choppers and fighter planes while shooting down everything in sight, use your nimble abilities to platform your way to victory, etc.  The controls were mostly tight and responsive, so it's easy to get yourself in the action and stay there.  While I expected minimal of this game, I got way more than I bargained for and put in 28.7 hrs to beat it twice and get most of the achievements (97%).   Hell, once weakening certain monsters like the club wielding giants and monster scorpions, you can even ride and use them to fight Golden Axe style!  On the downside, sometimes the controls do tend to get a little wacky and combo stringing won't feel entirely accurate, making for a cheap death or two.  The QT buttom presses to hammer down on certain bosses and deal decisive blows don't always register, which also got me slaughtered a couple of times as well.  While not with the frequency of a survival horror game, the camera has potential to get a little rickety and you'll end up taking a beating from some foes you can't even see.  All of the problems with the game were rather minor and I actually thought this game was HIGHLY addicting and entertaining to play.  To be honest...I like it more than some of the God of War sequels.  You can scream blasphemy all you want, but that's how I felt.  Another downside is that the slow-motion cut scenes could have been better executed and the voice acting isn't top-notch (although its rampant cheesiness is rather endearing as this game is straight out of one of those B movie action 4 packs).  Overall, anyone into the hack n' slash genre would do well to check this out for the cheap price.  I hope they make a sequel with co-op!  Good lord, that'd be a blast. Now for some quick pros and cons:  Pros-Solid graphics and sound-Excellent set of weapons, abilities and magic-90% of the time the fighting is fluid and fun-Superb enemy variety with tough fights and killer battles with monstrous bosses-Campy storyline and voice-acting adds to the appeal-Combos are easy to execute and satisfying- 90% of the time the controls are response and fun-Great gameplay variety with everything listed above and even a few puzzlesCons-10% of the time the fighting can be a little clunky-10% of the time some button presses won't register, especially the QT sequences (fortunately they are few)-Platforming is a beotch when the controls stutterOverall:  8.2/10			"

												Its concepts may be familiar, and its mechanics are not best-in-class, but Marlow Briggs switches gears often, always moving forward at a breakneck tempo. You go from severing limbs in a trainyard with locomotives zooming through it, to dodging flaming boulders barreling at you down a narrow corridor, to leaping across moving platforms Frogger-style in a log-sorting facility, to riding a scorpion and jabbing scarabs with its poisonous tail. Here's hoping the sequel teased by the conclusion comes to fruition; Marlow surely has a few more tricks up his bloodied sleeve.			"

												The first thing I appreciated was that I immediately noticed that the main bad guy's voice is done by the same guy that does the voice of Lo Pan in the movie Big Trouble in Little China. He has also done a insane amount of other movies and voice-overs, including work in Diablo 3.The game loads up and just starts right away. No menu, nothing, just begins with the opening sequence. But it is automatically set at my resolution and refresh rate with vsync on which blows my mind that this obscure game can do that and hardly any other game can. I ALWAYS have to check res and vsync first thing in any game I ever start up for the first time. So hats off to this game for that, golf clap.This first thing you will immediately notice within the first ten seconds is that your guy has a serious medical condition: his veins in his arms bulge out so much that they exist completely on the outside of his arms. No doubt they were trying to make him look ripped and badass but no man I have ever seen has veins that bulge to a point of being external. Hopefully I come across a medical clinic soon in the game to have that fixed or pick up a health pack or something.By far the best deal and fun-to-dollar ratio of any game I have ever bought on steam. It was only 99 cents and it is a very good AAA game that was overlooked when it was released. It is a rail action game, meaning you do not control the camera, it just moves with you as you go along in the game. It actually works fine too this way. It's the same rail action as a game like Narco Terror. The gameplay is solid and flows nicely, and is much akin to the God of War games. The graphics are great, the entire game looks very good. Very vibrant with awesome effects. The story is instantly forgettable. If I want a good story I will play a RPG or read a book. The last place I would ever look for a good story is a action game, and there are very few exceptions.It is really amazing that I found this gem on sale for only a dollar. If you are an action game fan there is no reason you should not like this unless you are ignorant. Since most players on steam play garbage like DayZ, then you probably already are dumb beyond words. It really is a pretty fun and well done solid game. 8/10			"

												MARLOW BRIGGS AND THE MASK OF DEATH is a 24-carat diamond hidden amongst the general crap that is the world of unadvertised B-games. Zootfly has managed to clone God of War into a game that is actually better than God of War, with a more interesting (albeit more racist) protagonist in a more creative setting and plot. The gameplay is fantastic, with a character action-based style of liner gameplay, and four very fun movesets based on the weapons you unlock, each with it's own set of satisfying combos. The environments convey an enormous sense of scale, and the camera tricks you into thinking things look much bigger than they are. The environments are very surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the graphics on the PC are surprisingly fantastic. The action is awesome and very over-the-top, with an increase in scale and buildup that rivals that of Platinum's action games, and the fighting levels are broken up by decently lengthy minigames throughout, including an on-rails shooter boss battle and a shoot-em-up helicopter section. Even the end credits are a minigame (which sure beats most credits sequences in terms of enjoyability!). The characters are just developed and fun enough to make a VERY STUPID, yet enjoyable and decently funny story, and the main villain, (also extremely racist) is a very satisfying enemy to face in the final boss battle. At 5 dollars, this is some of the best value you can get form a Steam game purchase, and it's a game that will offer you significant enjoyment no matter who you are. Trust me, this game stands out. Where did it even come from?Just buy this game, it's great! Really worth taking a look at!			"

												""Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death""With a title like that, it has to be cool, right? NO. DEAD WRONG. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.  this top-down/3rd person ""action/adventure"" game was released on Steam in September 2013. It featured levels, platforming, movement and combat that makes it feel like it's 'subtly' trying to be a 3rd rate cross between a camera-challenged Uncharted, a modern day Dante's Inferno and a less gory God of War. Which seems to have an identical plot to Splatterhouse. BAD DEVELOPER! JUST BAD! YOU DON'T DO THAT TO A GEM LIKE SPLATTERHOUSE!Don't believe me? 1.) Funny mask 2.) Boyfriend dies and comes back3.) girl gets taken 4.) You become a spectacle fighterThis game has no discernably original story, very sub-par graphics ESPECIALLY for 2013! and no sense of wanting to be its own game. There weren't even more than 6 or 7 god damn options overall and that's including difficulty, camera, brightness and no graphics options apart from resolution! SOMEHOW this game has 9/10 ON STEAM, AND A 7/10 ON GAMESPOT. You better hope this game NEVER in the existence of mankind gets a sequel!			"

												Marlow Briggs is now the game I consider to be the most underatted and underplayed game of all time. I picked this game up for $5, not in a Steam sale but that was the full asking price. This game is easily a $20-30 game. It's just a fun and enjoyable God of War style game. Pretty graphics and amazing visual design, solid and responsive gameplay, funny dialogue and good voice acting to back it up, and a story that surpasses Destiny (which doesn't say much).I got around 7-8 hours from this and would loved for it to be much longer as I never grew tired. The pacing is great and there is always a challenge with the new enemies you face. Also, this game has some of the coolest cutscenes out there as well as the greatest credits sequence I've ever seen. 5/5			"

												I'd say this game is quite underrated and even underpriced. It's a pretty standard formula of action adventure games akin to the likes of Darksiders, God of War, and Devil May Cry, and it might do everything that's been done before, but it does so very well and manages to stay fun throughout.The gameplay is nicely balanced between combat sections, platforming, puzzles, and mini-games. You're never doing the same thing for too long, which keeps the experience fresh and entertaining. As you progress through the game, your weapon acquires different forms (scythe, twin daggers, whip, and hammer), which are useful in different situations and you can switch between them at any time. In addition you also learn some very powerful spells which are good at clearing out large crowds of enemies.Overall the difficulty I felt was balanced perfectly. There were no unexpected difficulty spikes and most of it was a smooth ride. In the last quarter of the game it gets a bit challenging, but it does so gradually and reasonably. Only one section involving a certain collapsing underground bridge felt a bit cheap since it gave me a lot of insta-deaths, but that section was pretty short.I really enjoyed most of the mini-games, such as the first-person shooting sections where you have to mount a turret and shoot down helicopters, or even flying one yourself, or sliding down the cliffs and dodging obstacles. No overcomplicated mechanics. Just simple and fun mini-games to give you a small break from fighting and platforming.The plot is somewhat cheesy and lighthearted, but the main character is quite likeable, and his frequent dialogue exchanges with his sidekick, the Mask of Death, are all very funny. The length was also quite spot on for a game like this. Took me about 10 hours to beat it on Normal.My only serious critique for this game would be the occasional crashes to desktop that I got (and it seems there are some other people who get them too). It wasn't too bad, since the game has very frequent checkpoints, so you don't lose a lot of progress, but it's still a bug.I'd say if you enjoy action adventure games and seek something to give you heaps of entertainment, then I'd highly recommend this game. I got it for merely £4 (~$6), which is its full price on Steam and enjoyed it way more than some games which I bought for a higher price.			"

												Wow, where to even begin with this game?  The voice cast is star-studded.  The hero, unsurprisingly named Marlow, is portrayed by Arif Kinchen (aka Pierce from Saints Row), you've also got James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda), and Steve Blum (Tom from Toonami, and pretty much everything else in existence with a voice actor). The bantor and the comedy is there, even though the game ""acts"" like it takes itself seriously, more on that in a bit...I've never played a God of War game, but having seen some gameplay videos from that landmark franchise I can see where the parallels are drawn from.  I played most of my playthrough with a Steam Controller using the default gamepad template Steam offers for all titles and it felt very natural.  I couldn't comment on the keyboard/mouse input as I have yet to give it a chance, but I also played the intro with a 360 controller just fine, so if you have a gamepad laying around you should give it a shot on this title as it has console roots, both mechanic and development wise.Speaking of development, where in xibalba did this game even come from?  I remember the tweet for the release going live on the official Steam accounts, but prior to that ZootFly was never on my radar.  Even looking into their catalog, Marlow Briggs seems like a diamond in the rough.  The game launched on PC and Xbox 360 as an Arcade title, but sports graphics that would be at home on most AAA console titles from the 360/PS3 era.  There is a decent variety of enemies, with new variations and additions being thrown at you right until the end.  The settings alternate between Mesoamerican ruins that leave you wondering ""how the heck did they build something so ginormous?"", and humongous industrial complexes/machines that leave you wondering ""why the heck did they build something so ginormous?"".  The weapons and powers follow an experience based upgrade system, but the game is plenty generous with xp pickups and you usually end up maxing out your new unlocks not too long after receiving them.  The plot, and even in some portions the animation and voice acting can be received in two different ways-1. So cheesey and jenky that it circles around to become awesome again.2. Purposefully made super duper cheesey and jenky, which means it was done with just as much heart, so also making it awesome.I mean, there are scenes where your goal is to ""shoot down all the helicpoters"" and the game proceeds to throw nearly a 100 choppers at you.  Who has that many choppers on standby?  Who is that 100th chopper that sees the first 99 explode in front of him that says ""Ef it, yolo"" and continues to come at you guns blazing?  Also there's a scene where you fly a generic prop plane like Xevious and it somehow has the payload capacity for a bunch of heat seeking rockets AND machine guns under the propeller. I know, I know: What. Even.Either way, I'm not quite sure Zootfly knows what they've got with this franchise but the cliffhangerish ending demands a sequel with just as much over the top action, explosions, and lulzy dialog.

Cheesy B-Movie story where you rescue your girlfriend from bad guy, and save the world because why the hell not. Throughout the game, you will come across a lot of explosions, platforming & puzzles, superpowers, ancient civilizations, many kinds of monsters, floating head mask as a sidekick and Asian dude with terrible accent as the main Evil guy. It's very cheap and bad, but very fun experience. Visually nothing special, with a lot of low resolution textures, decent environments, bad voice acting, silly and somewhat nasty humor. Playtime is around 5 hours depending on difficulty. Get this game it's bootlegged.			"

												While the first 2-3 hours of this roughly 6-7 hour game are fun, funny, and action packed = the back 1/2 of the game can get quite tedious and frustrating and the combat goes from tight and fluid to unresponsive and molasses-slow as your weapon ""upgrades"" (while at the same time your enemies become more plentiful, faster, and harder-hitting).  Great voice acting throughout.  The writing is schlocky and fun, but really dumb.Overall, a nice throwback to 80's achlock action movies that ends up being not especially fun to see through to the end.  Maybe get it at a deep discount and temper your expectations... this a very mild and borderline ""recommend"".			"

												This is not just ""Devil May Cry or God of War"" rip off. It's a full fledged action-packed combat game with dry humor. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death draws inspiration from several popular media like Devil May Cry, God of War, Indiana Jones and etc. It's an adventure of Marlow Briggs who was killed and then resurrected by the Mask of Death, ancient Mayan mystical artifact, in order to save the world and his girlfriend. The visual and locations in this game are nice and beautiful, giving a sense of archaeological adventure. Combat is challenging and satisfying with a lot of weapons, combos and magics. There are a lot of dry humours along the way to relief you from intense moments. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a worth entertaining addition to hack and slash action genre.			"

												Wow, where to even begin with this game?  The voice cast is star-studded.  The hero, unsurprisingly named Marlow, is portrayed by Arif Kinchen (aka Pierce from Saints Row), you've also got James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda), and Steve Blum (Tom from Toonami, and pretty much everything else in existence with a voice actor). The bantor and the comedy is there, even though the game ""acts"" like it takes itself seriously, more on that in a bit...I've never played a God of War game, but having seen some gameplay videos from that landmark franchise I can see where the parallels are drawn from.  I played most of my playthrough with a Steam Controller using the default gamepad template Steam offers for all titles and it felt very natural.  I couldn't comment on the keyboard/mouse input as I have yet to give it a chance, but I also played the intro with a 360 controller just fine, so if you have a gamepad laying around you should give it a shot on this title as it has console roots, both mechanic and development wise.Speaking of development, where in xibalba did this game even come from?  I remember the tweet for the release going live on the official Steam accounts, but prior to that ZootFly was never on my radar.  Even looking into their catalog, Marlow Briggs seems like a diamond in the rough.  The game launched on PC and Xbox 360 as an Arcade title, but sports graphics that would be at home on most AAA console titles from the 360/PS3 era.  There is a decent variety of enemies, with new variations and additions being thrown at you right until the end.  The settings alternate between Mesoamerican ruins that leave you wondering ""how the heck did they build something so ginormous?"", and humongous industrial complexes/machines that leave you wondering ""why the heck did they build something so ginormous?"".  The weapons and powers follow an experience based upgrade system, but the game is plenty generous with xp pickups and you usually end up maxing out your new unlocks not too long after receiving them.  The plot, and even in some portions the animation and voice acting can be received in two different ways-1. So cheesey and jenky that it circles around to become awesome again.2. Purposefully made super duper cheesey and jenky, which means it was done with just as much heart, so also making it awesome.I mean, there are scenes where your goal is to ""shoot down all the helicpoters"" and the game proceeds to throw nearly a 100 choppers at you.  Who has that many choppers on standby?  Who is that 100th chopper that sees the first 99 explode in front of him that says ""Ef it, yolo"" and continues to come at you guns blazing?  Also there's a scene where you fly a generic prop plane like Xevious and it somehow has the payload capacity for a bunch of heat seeking rockets AND machine guns under the propeller. I know, I know: What. Even.Either way, I'm not quite sure Zootfly knows what they've got with this franchise but the cliffhangerish ending demands a sequel with just as much over the top action, explosions, and lulzy dialog.

												I'll admit, I was quite skeptical when I heard about this Interactive Drama™. After being so emotionally engaged with the introspective masterpiece that is Shrek Treasure Hunt™ for the Sony PlayStation Entertainment System™ available at TESCOS™ for only £599.99, I came to the conclusion that there will never be a journey into the life of a misunderstood but gentle ogre as heart wrenching as Shrek Treasure Hunt™ for the Sony PlayStation Entertainment System™ available at TESCOS™ for only £599.99. Well allow me to put those absolutely disgusting and ignorant words into a delicious onion sandwich because boy was I wrong!While I don’t want to spoil too much of the intense and powerful epic saga that is MARLOW BRIGGS™, the artist brings the viewer face to face with their own pre-conceived hierarchy of cultural values and assumptions of artistic worth. During the Interactive Drama™, you will discover immersive and overwhelming moments that will guarantee a manly shed tear or two. Expect an emotional rollercoaster of joy, sadness, peace, tranquillity, and many more! For the best and most mature visual and auditory entertainment experience, I would highly recommend a box of Kleenex™ Balsalm Mansize Tissues, along with your favourite cuddly toy, and the Shrek The Third™ soundtrack playing in the background.Could this be gaming’s Shrek Forever After™? Find out by purchasing this brilliant thought provoking contemporary work!			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. PURE FUN.Mix of several generes: Platform, Hack&Slash, Adventure and Action, Arcade... everything!.To get an aproximated idea, some kind of mix between Diablo, Just Cause, Prince of Persia and  (a good version of) Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones.Graphics are top notch. Scenarios are really well designed, in a real 3D environment but, where you move in a 2.5D path.Story is tad archetypical but, good enough. No flaws.Gameplay is funny, dynamic, variate and interesting. Game offers you some nice action-film-alike scenes, from time to time (that you can skip, at your will).Difficulty is ok. Overall, affordable the most of time but,  challenging at some points but,  You can save the game at any momment so, you don't need to re-do the whole level each time you die (and you will, often!).Weapon is just one, that works differently depending on some combos. But, you have some magical powers also, which evolute while gaining experience. Available powers and difficulty increases very gradually and, I didn't feel frustruted at any point.Xbox 360 controller recommended.To me, this game is a clear example of how playability and fun should be integrated within the core of any game. PLAYABILITY IS SO EXTREME THAN EVEN CREDITS IS ONE MORE LITTLE GAME !!!			"

												Mix God of War, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted together with a B-movie script and decent controls and you have Marlow Briggs.  This game has great over-the-top action scenes.  There are better combat engines out there, but this is pure, dumb fun.  Third-person action fans should really be able to enjoy their time with the game.			"

												It has its fair share of problems - lack of advanced video options, camera bugs, knocking enemies through walls bugs, health-sponge enemies every so often, QTEs wherein keyboard buttons' mouse equivalents won't apply - but ""Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death"" brings plenty to balance itself into a worthwhile ride.  Of particular note is its inclusion of Steve Blum as the Mask Guardian and James Hong as the villain, combat that evokes happy memories of God of War, and a big-dumb-action-movie approach with many, many explosions (in the industrial environments, at any rate).  Definitely something to enjoy over a weekend, or perhaps over a single day in a weekend while nursing a delicious cup of hot cocoa or what-have-you.			"

												Marlow Briggs is a budget God of War with some of the most frustraiting platforming I've ever experienced in an action game. Late-game platforming becomes impossible to judge without at least one or two pointless deaths due to preset perspectives. In general, the camera is not your friend, and you have no control over it. The fun combat devolves into slug fests agianst enemies and bosses with increasingly lengthy health bars.I couldn't imagine throwing out combos with a keyboard, but your welcome to try. You will need near-perfect control of late game combos, and you will need combos to make any impact on late-game enemy mobs and bosses.I recommend this game because the beginning is fun. The cheese-yness of the story and bad guy got old fast, and I really got sick of my companion mocking me for my failures. However, the combat is impactful and robust, even if the overall gameplay is nowhere near tight enough for what the game sometimes demands. The entire experience can be brute-forced, if necessary. Get this if you can on sale. Otherwise, go buy something else.Gameplay:

												This is the best game that no one has ever heard of. Fans of God of War, Darksiders, or even Castlevania: Lords of Shadow will find familiar territory here. The game doesn't take itself seriously and comes off as a nonstop action/adventure game. The game is defintely short, but can be picked up for very very cheap on sale (I got it for $3.76 on Amazon for example.) Despite the fact that the game is short, it is extremely enjoyable. Gameplay is very straightforward hack and slash combat with a splash of magic. Some puzzles, ""challenges"", and basic platforming breaks the pace between the combat. The story is forgettable and is reminicent of B action movies. It's one of those settings that is so bad that it's just so good. Between the senseless dialogue and childish jokes you'll find one or two genuinely humoruous lines. Overall it's a solid experience for a cheap price that shouldn't be missed if you are even a little bit intrested in simliar titles. At $14.99 it is way too expensive, but for under $10 you'll find a solid 6-7 hour game that is much better than ""professional"" reviews claim.			"

												This game is a low-rent ""God of War""-esque game with a South America Aztec/Mayan theme. During my playthrough I ran into multiple camera issues (camera flew out of the level and I got treated to the low-res backgrounds until I restarted the checkpoint, among others). The platforming is okay, but there are a few times where it's difficult to tell where you're supposed to go. Likewise, I ran into a few sections where the camera moves while you're supposed to be moving and it threw off the jump, leading me to more than one unfortunate and frustrating death.That being said, the game has pretty decent humor and it knows its place in the game pantheon. It doesn't try to do anything special, and there are the same basic weapon and magic sets you should expect to find in a game of this type.Overall, it's a decent game. With a short playthrough (roughly 6 hours on normal) and some aggravating camera issues, I don't know that I would recommend it at full price. If you're looking for a cheap, quick hack & slash game with decent humor and a nice, new setting then I'd recommend picking it up.			"

												Fantastic Character-Action/Action-Adventure game.  The combat feels good, and can get decently challenging at times.  And the non-combat bits are actually pretty good as well (some of the platforming can be a bit hard to judge because of the camera, but overall it's prety decent, and there are some good puzzles as well).  The game also has some really spectacular environment design.  Also there are some interesting mechanics like the ability to convert fodder enemies to your side in combat.  Some of the fights can drag a bit because of high-health enemies, but overall I'd recommend this for fans of action games.			"

												The number of ♥♥♥♥♥ this game gives is astounding. ASTOUNDINGLY LOW THAT IS OOOOOOOOHHHH (see? I can write unfunny jokes, too).At first, its actually a fun game: action, 'splosions, dumb one-liners, what more could you want from a game like this? But oh boy does it get old fast. This game really has it all and then doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about any of it: not about its action, not about its characters (which IS important - don't tell me Arnie isn't a cool character in everything he's in), and least of all about its originality.What killed the game for me was not just the immense level of copypasting off of God of War - although it really is so immense that it's not even funny any more: every single game mechanic from fighting to dodging, blocking, running, climbing, chain swinging, block pushing, orb collecting etc. was aped - but the fact that none of it was copied competently. The puzzles are insultingly easy, the stylized cutscenes (that were taken from the first GoW) are painfully slow and boring, the story itself is horrendously dull even for a game like this and the combat just didn't cut it. At one point, I accidently turned off my monitor during a fight and I decided to just humor the game - attempt the combat with the screen off. Yup, killed them all, no ♥♥♥♥♥ given.The moment you receive the Chains of Olympus weapon was the moment the developers found even more ♥♥♥♥♥ to not give and did not even try hiding any more how blatantly they copied God of War. Half an hour later I heard the most forced and lamest tentacle porn joke in the history of hentai, and I suppose at that point you can guess what I refused to give.I feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not recommending this game at this price but I just can't. Only buy this if you are willing to get no more than 30 minutes of fun from this game or you are really capable of ignoring absolutely all of your standards. The game gets cut a lot of slack for being silly (and dirt cheap), but I didn't find it was possible to oversee how few ♥♥♥♥♥ the developers gave about any of this. I was prepared (and hyped!) for a B-game à la God Hand, but there is just no soul in this. As if the developers went out of their way to not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥The game is also a bit racist, but not to a level where I would consider it offensive. It just doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥I give: 0/10 poops			"

												After completing this game I felt compelled to write a review for it, because it is ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING and no-one has heard of it.  I paid the full price listing of $5 for this, got more than my money’s worth and enjoyed every second of it.  Honestly I don’t really have any complaints about the game, and enjoyed everything about it.  The environments were beautiful, the combat was fun and there were enough weapons and spells to keep it from getting repetitive.  The humor was actually funny, even in the limited amounts I saw, and the story, while simple, was well done.  Bonus: people can’t say I’m a racist because I love a game with a black MC (even if that’s a dumb reason).  The one negative I do have to say though, Credits Mini-game...♥♥♥♥ you.			"

												Well, first of all -- everyone says that this is a ""budget"" title, but I fail to see how that would affect anything. If a game is good then it's good, and if it's bad then it's bad. For me, there is no ""goodness/dollar"" value.Having said that, I'm giving it a thumbs up. It has it's flaws -- like, for example, I'm not going to play through the full game again and again just to get the ""all collectibles"" achievement, and this must be the most ""on rails"" game I've ever played -- you don't even have camera controls. However, it plays nicely for the most part, looks good, and the voice acting is well done. While I wasn't generally a big fan of Evas notes, everything else like the villain himself, the announcements to the workers, and the chitchat between Marlow and his mask more than make up for that.Also, while some people dislike the cutscenes, I actually liked them. They are still images, but they don't ""flip"" or anything -- it's one long camera swoop around and through the scene while things are changing ""offscreen"". Looks rather nice if you ask me. The beginning and the end of the game are ""real"", animated and voice-acted cutscenes, though.			"

												I got this game for a dollar, and that's all you should ever pay for it.This game is very obviously unfinished. The first cutscene feels like they cut something out, and it makes everything feel disjointed. I felt this way for several other parts of the game as well, especially this one part in a jungle where you open a door, a cutscene where you obtain a new ability happens, and then your character spends a minute using it on some enemies that appear. The worst part of that cutscene? It's shown through still diaramas, and nothing but. Then you get to try it out for about 30 seconds before you get ANOTHER series of diaramas where your character goes to the next part of the game. It felt like I just skipped an entire section that a more complete game would have allowed me to get through on my own, and it was at this point that I promptly uninstalled Marlow Briggs from my computer.I enjoyed the cheesy dialogue, and that Chinese guy who's the villain is cartoonishly evil, but I can't let myself sit through a game that feels less complete than some Early Access titles that I've played.

												Good game in general. Great intro vid and nice characters and awesome visuals with gameplay mechanics similar to most button smashers however the game has it's flaw it's way too much like a much simpler version of uncharted, darksiders and the typical button smasher. The story is average and the only people who would like this game are people that like comics, comic book films/games, button smashing with no actual purpose, casual gaming and quick short games with not a lot of things to offer. So in a critcal scale I'd give it a 6/10 while personally I would give it a 5.5/10 as it's got great potential if they make more sequels and put more tasks into the games etc. Marlow Briggs isn't the problem, the problem is the gameplay itself.

												When I recommend a video game, I tend to measure whether it's worth my time from the sum amount of fun and intrigue it produces. A game can be very intriguing, but not necessarily fun, and I can enjoy it immensely --take puzzle games, for instance, or Phoenix Wright. Vice versa, you have games like Team Fortress 2, where there's not much intrigue in story or setting but a ton of carnal fun. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death lacks any 'umph' in either of those two elements.Sure, the game can be occasionally fun. The game play is very Devil May Cry styled, quick, fierce, and sharp. The magic you get in the game, though limited, is quite satisfying, and the landscapes are generally pretty. Too often though did I find myself bored when I was chugging through the fighting segments, or struggling through some of the game's numerous mini-games. That's almost a kiss of death for a game centered around combat and platforming.On the flip side, the game is only sort of intriguing. MBMD is just brimming with explosions, and it's sprinkled with a B-movie style humor that's actually quite charming. Only thing is, it loses its charm fast. Flat characters and a bland, almost predictable story keep this game from being interesting for me, and the flat voice acting and bland animation from everyone else beside the main characters just feels stale.So for the most part, I really don't recommend this game. It's far from bad, but there's so much else out there that is worth playing more, unless you're really hungry for another platformer.			"

												Tyler Perry Presents: The God of The War (patent pending)It's God of War for people that want the cover to fool customers into thinking it's a basketball game. Run, shoot, dunk on ballas that can't step to your game. I think they wanted to make a franchise out of this, what with the character's name on the damn title. Too bad it's all mediocre. The combat is of the button mashing variety. There are plenty of combos that take the form of a light and heavy attack, with combinations being strung together. The problem with that sort of combo system is that you can't expect me to remember all the 'XXXY, XXXX, XYXX, YXXY' combos. It winds up just being a button masher with a combo system that has too much to memorize for it's own good. You wind up memorizing three or so moves and just constantly mash those out.It's boring as hell. Simplicity isn't bad, route memorization is. Metal Gear Rising had a similar set-up, but the memorization was kept to a minimum. The fun in combat lied in keeping your blue gauge up and getting those quick kills. The Arkham titles have an even simpler battle system, with the challenge being in continuing your chain of attack while thwarting enemies with properly placed counters. Marlow Briggs presents nothing unique or interesting in its combat. It's just randomly hitting buttons with the challenge lying in simply keeping your health gauge up. There's nothing rewarding in the combat itself.Apart from the mediocre combat, the game has light platforming and puzzle elements. When you aren't busy fighting, you'll be traversing the level with fixed camera angles. The platforming is all pretty barebones and boils down to jumping across pits and pressing the action button when appropriate. Swinging from cliffs and walking across ledges would be a lot more exciting if there was any sort of challenge to it beyond pressing a button. The fact that the camera angles are fixed means that there's not even any challenge in finding how to proceed. It's all meant to look nice and tantamount to simply pressing right on the joystick while ocassionally hitting the B button to jump across the ocassional pit. Again, it's boring.On the positive side of things, the game looks gorgeous for a budget title. I got it for 99 cents a few sales ago, and can't comprehend how such a cheap♥♥♥♥♥title can look so damn good. There's even some creativity in the way some of the cutscenes unfold. Otherwise, it's all mediocre and completely forgettable. For a budget title it passes the time and is...not completely offensive, but if that's its only real upside then it really has nothing going for it.Recommended if you are, plan to be, or ever will be Tyler Perry			"

												Basically the Blaxpoitation version of God Of War.You play as Marlow Briggs, voiced by the famous seventies action star Fisty McChocolate. As Marlow Briggs, you have to use your giant double scythe that probably wouldn't be a useful weapon if such a thing really existed, but thankfully, you're black, and the majority of your enemies are jive turkeys and skinny boy honkeys. Watch out though, they're being employed by a charismatic yellow fella.That isn't enough to stop you though, as you're powered by the rage sustained from hundreds of years of opression by the white man.

The pacing is just right, delivering action and slight pauses at the exact right moments. The combat is very fun and varied, and just like the rest of the game, insanely epic.The graphics are amazing. Textures are really high-quality, particles are great, and the level design is beyond awesome.The humor is original, witty, and is delivered at the exact right times.It does lack advanced graphics settings though, and the default controls (remappable) are a bit awkward.Overall, 9/10.

												I was really enjoying this game until I came accross the type of 'puzzle' I hate in games like these in a level called 'The Antechamber of the God'.  It's one of those puzzles that is illogically difficult just for the sake of being difficult.  I couldn't be bothered to spend hours battling to complete the 'puzzle' in the unreasonable allotted time, so have simply uninstalled the game and moved on.  What you're supposed to do is activiate a series of triggers within a room, but the control system and the mechanics of the game make it near-impossible to do so in the small amount of time given.  This puzzle really p___ed me off because up until then I thought the game was great.  But because it fell flat on it's face I am giving it a thumbs down.			"

												I played and finished both God of War 1 and God of War 2 from HD collection on VITA.----------------------------------------------------------------I can easy say that ""Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death"" is the best God of War.Its kinda funny actually.Its have better combat, less annoying QTE and puzzles, interesting areas and story, more likeable hero, better checkpoint system, humor that makes you keep going and it is done with a style of cutscenes never seen before.The game is 10 hour long which is not too long, not too short.

												Porting performance issues and DRM turn this from a mediocre hack-and-slasher into a Do Not Buy. This is a $5 game and a pretty solid example of getting what you pay for.The gameplay is decent, pretty good actually, but the story is slow and the platforming sections often feature really frustrating and stupid pixel-perfect jumps. Graphics are... decent.The combat is pretty solid though, with a variety of weapons and spells. Unfortunately you might have a hard time executing your combos when your framerate suddenly drops into the single digits for no identifiable reason. On top of that, the controls are pretty... weird. with dual mapping between mouse buttons and i, o and p, for one example. This leads to some confusion when QTEs reference one set of these controls when you're using the other. On top of that, the game refuses to accept any controller that isn't an XBox 360 controller, so if you have a logitech gamepad or something else, sorry, but you're screwed. Lern2Joy2Key.Overall, I would recommend this to someone who likes this kind of game, if not for the porting issues and DRM. The DRM is of the ""♥♥♥♥ your progress the connection dropped so I'm kicking you back to main menu"" variety. If you don't have a stable internet connection, I would strongly advise you stay far away from this game entirely.			"

												Contender for worst game I've ever played.  Sloppiest controls ever.  It would have been nice if the developers made the collision detection (especially during puzzles) as sloppy as the controls so this steaming pile of a game wasn't nothing but frustration as the gamer strives to manuveur sloppy controls into pin-point-specific collision points.   Pure grey-hair-producing frustration forced me to finish this game (in under 6 hours).  I do not recommend this to anyone regardless of other gamers' reviews.  A complete waste of time and money even at $2.24!  A better investment would be to hunt down a used PS3 just for God of War.			"

												What a cheese fest of a game, so many parts of it suck, but is still really charming in some ways. The combat is fun, but the talent system might as well not be there. You don't actually even get to choose, since you level exactly the pace, that the game wants you to. Sometimes you litterally don't even have a choice, so why in the world? Also, it runs like a horse with broken legs. By that, I mean that it crashes all the damn time, and it tears up so frequently, that it's not even funny. It barely ever runs over 30 fps, even with 800x600 resolution. There is a bunch of unnecessary padding and quicktime events that just serve to waste your time, since they are not challenging, fun or add to the game in any way. Marlow Briggs overall is a fun game sometimes, but is just so flawed that I can't recommend it. Especially not for 15 bucks. Maybe for 5 bucks, if you really love this genre.			"

												I initially downloaded this game, mostly from some the positive reviews and ignored the bad ones. From day one the game would not play properly as the screen was overstretched on my screen. After 3 weeks of their support not actually addressing the error I figured out a workaround which had me modify the shortcut. I was so disappointed after all the effort of getting the game to work. The graphics is poor, there is basically no graphics options. The game is basically a top down shooter, with a poor story line and average graphics. If you get it for under $1, then sure, try it out, else in my opinion, don't bother.			"

												A $5 God of War clone that refuses to take itself seriously. You play as Pierce Washington from the Saints Row franchise as he has to save his girlfriend from Lo Pan and kill a bunch of dudes/jungle bugs/Aztec gods along the way. The banter between Marlow and his spirit mask is actually pretty funny, and the controls responsive. The camera occasionally freaks out when trying to jump on the moveable boxes (though this is more annoying that game-ruining) and the game only clocks in at about 4-5 hours, but these are minor quibbles for a game that costs less than a cheeseburger and can't go more than 30 seconds without something exploding.

Upgrading your weapons/abilities lets you achieve 300x combos and there will be lots of explosions :) Also the sarcastic dialogues/comments between the main character and his fellow the mask of death are really enjoyable. Keeping in mind it´s a low budget game the graphics are very nice and the environment features beautiful landscapes.Is it worth the money? Well, I bought it on sale and I dont´t regret it.

												Cinema packed into a video game.  The game's cover art is slightly deceiving since we never see Marlow with that cheery smile. The whole game can be reduced to a line the antagonist gives midway through: ""Stop making everything explode!"".  This God of War style action platformer is a gem in all aspects which puts most other big budget games to shame in its level of bombastic fit and finish.  Beautifully colorful scenery and packed set pieces.  Great pacing that lets you chew through the whole game without dropping.  Simple combat system that is directly tuned to your position through the story.  Diverse game mechanics and enemies that keep things fresh.  A great touch of levity from your death mask avatar sidekick encouraging you along the way.   Pure entertainment and worth any paltry price being asked for.			"

												Think God of War but with a black guy, a floating Mayan mask that talks, an evil asian man, and a girl. Also the set pieces and environment are beautifully illuminated by a bright orange sunlight. Gameplay: God of War but with a black guy and a witty sacred Mayan mask.Dialogue: It doesn't suck and I actually enjoy it. The interactions between Marlow and the Mask are pretty human-like and the mask isn't like some stuck-up boring character. The mask is chill as ♥♥♥♥, bro-tier and sometimes compliments or insults Marlow playfully. Here's a good example: Mask: ""Ek Chuah Ix. This is your name as the sacred warrior reborn! Or Chu-Chu for short."" Briggs: ""Do NOT call me Chu-Chu..""Mask: ""As you wish...Chu-Chu...""Marlow Briggs himself: Actually a pretty relatable character. Although he has new abilities, he's still human and reacts to things very human-like. Instead of being some edgy guy, he reacts to situations how normal people would react. For example here is one of his quotes: ""Who designed this?!"" Setting: Beautifully illuminated and just looks pretty in general. Everything is bright and eyecandy-like. Combos: Pretty much handle like God of WarOverall: I'd recommend it to any action game/hack 'n slash fan. Also if you like explosions, you'll like this game.			"

												I'd like to say I like this game, but anybody who looks at my time played sees that I don't have the experience to justify that. I can't get the dialogue to work, and I've been trying for an hour. Just know that, upon installation of this game, dialogue may or may not work. I'm not going to bother playing it right now with these audio problems, but it's likely not going to be that way for everyone. Just know that this is a problem that exists.			"

												I bought the game today because I had some left over money from a paysafe card. But this game is absolutly amazing, the gameplay has lots of variation,cool hack 'n slash mechanics,over the top action and micheal bay explosion scenes xD. The game has some humor in it and you won't get bored of this game theres some kind of puzzle solving (i guess you could call it) aspect of it that is pretty cool. You have to jump over fires and machines while doging rockets or jungle insects. I am pretty mad that this game din't got too big because it's such a good game with decent graphics (even thou i thought they were sometimes amazing) cool mechanics , really awesome gameplay , original cutscenes etc etc. The beginning is kind of weird in my opinion. I only picked up the game today so I can't really judge the campaign even thou 'till now it's good. I would recommend it to everybody who likes slashing pyromaniacs/warriors/ninjas and much more xD . Now for the bad comment : The game is a lil overpriced just a little lets say take 5 eu/dollars off and it's fine (I bought it in sales wich whas the best 2,09 EU I ever spend on something haha.) The first level I hated for some reason xD bur if you go a little further it becomes awesome!    Anyway I had to make this revieuw because alot of negative comments saying "" Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Boredom"" but thats just stupid. Add me on steam if we have games incommen so we could play or if you want to have a chat ;-) -Slash *out*			"

ProsThis game is silly...and it embraces it! The cut scenes are almost a parody on typical Hollywood action movies, and their style is unique and beautiful (although after a while, it may become tedious to some, but you skip them). You've got an intesting 'companion' which constantly is either making fun of you, guiding you, or cheering depending on the situation.If you're into silly humor and action-adventure hack&slash games, you'll totally love this game! It has some great puzzle sections which require some thought, but not too hard to make you get stuck. You start with one weapon, but every hour or so you either get a new weapon or a new magic skill, which broadens your arsenal and keeps the combat fresh. Each weapon is the most efficient against a certain type of enemy, and that makes the combat interesting.The game has a really nice checkpoint system, so that if you die, you almost never have to complete a whole section again. This fixed a frustration that I have with many games nowadays that use a checkpoint system. You also have the option to save manually.ConsI would've liked some more enemy variety for regular mobs though. While the boss monsters are quite nice and unique, the same regular enemies keep coming back during the game (but to their credit, they sometimes add a new variety to the insect/human mix).ConclusionI've clocked in at around 8 hours to complete this game, which was perfect. It provides constant action and it pushes you forward because of it.I was constantly looking forward to the next encounter, weapon upgrade or silly jokes.I picked this game up during the sale, but knowing what I know now, I would've even bought it outside of a sale.

												Very fun. New weapons, powers and enemies every so often keep it fun. The mask has some hilarious one liners. Very humorous game.Not going to win any awards for graphics though. And the camera can sometimes ruin your combo. Would only recommend if you really want the game or it is on sale.			"

												I am not going to sugercoat it, this game at it's core is average at best. It's god of war style platforming and combat, with a simple upgrade system and turret sections. What makes this game worth your money is the presentation which is straight out of a 90s b-grade action movie: Everyman Marlow Briggs visits his archolgist girlfreind within south america, where she works for a so transparntly villianous ""Mr. Long"" who i can best discribe as a asian Hans Gruber. When attempting to protect his love, Marlow is murdered but by chance is reveied by a bloodthirsty Mayain spirt that turns Marlow into a supernatural immortal warrior, and uses his new found powers save his love and the world from Mr.Long's devious plan for power. The game plays this story straight faced, complete with cheesy one liners, endless hordes of expendable baddies and constant explosions.			"

												An absolute gem by a relatively unkwnown company, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death operates on the fact that it knows it's a low-budget character action parody of B-movies, and manages to nail it perfectly. Great voice acting, a script with great banter, beautiful vistas, and a surprisingly good combat system, the only flaws I found with it were the lack of proper options and slight framerate drops during cutscenes and moments where the action got too intense. The whole game has been a ridiculously fun rollercoaster the entire way through so far, and I recommend buying it while it's so cheap. "

A few buggy sound issues, and a few squishy control issues, but otherwise no real complaints. I got it for $.99 during the Summer Sale and set out to beat it immediately. Nice weapons and moves, even if the enemies are a tad repetetive. It's a competent Bayonetta meets God of War game, and for a steal.			"

												It's a beautiful shameless ripoff of God of War and I don't even care. The game is currently 70 odd pence on the steam sale and I cannot believe it isn't being talked about. The devs wanted to make their own god of war game, they didn't have the multimillion pound budget that you find with AAA game titles but they worked with what they had and what they made is a surprisingly fun, action packed beat em up where practically everything is exploding all of the time.Word of warning though, this game has NO graphics options, if you have a lower end machine, don't bother.

It really really really takes away from the game and reminds me that this is nothing more than a game and not some sort of cool new age multimedia EXPERIENCE. QTE's in game's are like if you went to a movie theatre and every 10-12 minutes, the movie cast would just stop and stare into the camera until the entire audience claps, then they would progress with their lines and the scene.

												This game is equal parts [Prototype] and Dark Siders, with a little dash of Devil May Cry sprinkled on top for good measure. In other words, it's a shooty bang-bang hack-n-slash. Only with Ancient magics and Death Gods.Like a classic '90's action flick, it throws you right into the action and wastes very little time trying to complicate things with story or plot; just enough to move things along from one big explosion to the next - even bigger - explosion. The protagonist, Marlow Briggs, gets the same treatment: he manages to be a little bit of every black action hero all rolled into one, complete with an overly dramatic and painfully stereotypical 'brotha' persona who is just full of less-than-witty one-liners.That being said, the game delivers on fun and exciting combat and the action is simply over the top. The platforming and 'puzzle' bits could have been a bit more challenging, but they weren't too bad.			"

												With nothing but mere pocket change, you’ll get this SICK character-action game where you get to play as african-american hero-ish fireman who fights evil chinese businesslord using ancient Mayan magic powers in industrial South American jungle! And that’s just how the game BEGINS!No but seriously, Marlow Briggs is a VIDEO GAME. It plays kind of like God of War with the feel of hype from games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. You can kind of see that they had low budget making this (cutscene animations will split opinions), but even then it’s extraordinarily high-quality game both visual-, mechanical- and gameplay-wise.It was originally 15€, and even then it was more than worth it’s prize. if you like God of War, Dante’s Inferno, DmC: Devil May Cry, MGR: Revengeance, Bayonetta or such games, throw money to this game! Way better investment than Assassin’s Creed!During Steam Sale, when it was 1€, I literally bought 3 of them.			"

												This game is pretty kickass.Don't dismiss this as a paltry God of War clone. It's a pretty good, bombastic, blacksploitation version of God of War for PC. If you've played God of War (or Dantes Inferno for that matter), you'll know the score here. Constantly dancing dealing death with bright weapon trails between simple platforming and puzzle sections.What's great about this game is the standard it sets. For such a small game, it really tries to stand out next to the AAA titles it mimics. The plot is a rather generic, tale of afterlife, revenge and rescuing a damsel in distress. The whole game uses voodoo and industrialism as it's theme, much like God of War uses greek mythology and the Underworld.The graphics are pretty spectacular for such a short and budget developed game, with some excellent framed vistas which can be compared to the Uncharted series, the soundtrack can sometimes be repetitve and tiresome but the game is complimented by funny banter between Marlow and the titular Mask of Death, heckling Marlow's 'tough guy' one liners, in a sense, a buddy movie dynamic and not to far away from what the reboot of Shadow Warrior does. The game is full of Hollywood typical explosion visuals and solid sound effects.Occasionally, the game takes you by surprise and ejects you into a minigame of a race collecting orbs, sliding down pathways avoiding obstacles, or a magnificently over the top on rails shooting section shooting helicopters down from the back of a moving vehicle and finally a top down arcade shooter much like Capcom's 1942 series, which is a pleasant diversion,The game took me eight hours to beat in total and if experienced to the hack and slash format, platforming and puzzles that GoW delivers, you'll find no problems getting through the game. Much like GoW acquired weapons and abilities can be upgraded, but the selection is very, very limited and it's incredibly easy to upgrade the weapons using collectable orbs.The controls are pretty solid and translated for mouse and keyboard, much like Blades of Time, (another PC hack and slash game), my only issue is using magic abilities using the complicated layout of holding down left control and a numberic key 1-4, which can make fights difficult if you want to attempt to use a magic move to wear enemies down. The boss fights are nothing spectacular and are just more or less obstacles from one section or another or purely acquiring a new ability. There is also no opportunity of back tracking in this game whatsoever and for that matter, nothing to backtrack for.Even the credits are a bit of fun, you can tell the developers had a lot of fun making this title and it's totally worth a blast for a quick action/adventure/hack and slash title if you want to give it 6-8 hours. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised.			"

												Reviewed after finishing Normal mode. A gamepad is highly suggested.Pros: I already want a sequel. Story doesn't take itself seriously, at all, at any point. Simple controls. Funny, B-rate movie acting. Lines from the mask and main baddie are especially funny. Extremely cheap price. This game is definitey worth more than its being sold.  Explosions, Destruction, Violence, Giant Scorpions Everything, James Hong-voiced Villian, Black Main Character, Mind Control, One Liners, More Helicopters Than Previously Expected, Mayan/Incan/Somethan' Ruins, Explosions   Cons: Somewhat repetitive battles This is also a 360 game. which becomes obvious very quickly while playing. That's not a complete con, but any preparations made for other console ports you play should be taken here. Don't expect a plethora of settings, the game is very slim there. It seems to run well, but there's also not much to change. Personal gripe: Marlow has gigantic hands, a model in which his face almost never changes, and a weird jump animation.  Personal gripe: Did not find the helicopter shoot 'em up minigame transitions enjoyable. There's only two of those specific minigames, and they are very short. It's extremely fun, very funny, cheap, linear and kinda short. Geit it. This isn't a discussion.			"

												Marlow Briggs (and the Mask of Death) is a spectacle fighter, a ""God of War clone"" if you will, and most of the time, it's a decent one at that. You're the titular Marlow Briggs, some dude on his vacation accompanying his girlfriend on a dig site. Things go wrong and you end up dead, and the story begins.Nothing about the gameplay is unique, however, the execution is competent. Sometimes you'll end up doing some things outside of the genre, and it's surprising when you're thrown into it. The quick and dirty:+ Smooth flowing combat+ Combos+ Weapons and magic+ Random activities+ Okay voice acting+ Lots of explosions and jumping away from them+ Runs all right (50-60 fps) on my Nvidia GT630M- Awkward camera angles in places- No graphics options- Rough animation transitions- Encountered bugs that did not let me progress (reloaded an autosave)I got it for a dollar and expected nothing. I was pleasantly surprised. Try it!			"

												God of War meets pulp fiction. Instead of a brooding god with a selection of magical weapons, what you have is a rather dim protagonist with a sentient, snarky enchanted scythe as a sidekick. Considering this game can be had for under a dollar, it provides a lot more value than that in absurd beat-em-up entertainment.			"

												Surprising solid and well made game. Story is mediocre at best, but the action and platforming are excellent. It isnt the deepest of action games, and it fairly button mashy(its no Devil May Cry). But provides alot of entertainment for a cheap price.I brought this in the 2014 Summer Sale for 69p. At that price you are crazy not to pick this up and play through it.			"

												It's a beautiful shameless ripoff of God of War and I don't even care. The game is currently 70 odd pence on the steam sale and I cannot believe it isn't being talked about. The devs wanted to make their own god of war game, they didn't have the multimillion pound budget that you find with AAA game titles but they worked with what they had and what they made is a surprisingly fun, action packed beat em up where practically everything is exploding all of the time.Word of warning though, this game has NO graphics options, if you have a lower end machine, don't bother. This game is shadered up to the eyeballs.Marlow Briggs has the veiniest arms.			"

												Surprisingly good game. Short campaign that pretty much just drops you in. The plot seems like it would fit in a 90s action movie. And that's great. The developers know it and took advantage of it. Marlow and the mask have back and forths through out the game that provides some additional comedic relief. There is also actual explanations for the flame jets and general hazards through out the game. Not something that is usually answered. The game does kind of hold your hand where it makes it pretty much impossible to jump off an edge unless there's a platform across the chasm, which is annoying. There is also an issue for me where jumping off a rope on to another platform higher up just doesn't happen. I have to be positioned absolutely perfectly for it to let me jump off. Other than these the game was great. Similar in play style to God of War, Dante's Inferno and those types of games where you go for combos and stringing attacks together.All in all. Definite buy for a dollar.			"

												A little jem of a game. I do not ever recall this game being advertised but it is a good game.The main villian is trying to get immortality. He enlists the help of your girlfriend. When she decides to leave they kill you to make her finish her work. You are brought back to life to stop this guy from getting supernatural abilities. As far as the plot goes, that is about it.For a pretty straight forword storyline, you travel to many locations and fight a good variety of creatures. The boss battles are interesting and cool looking. The things that will annoy you  in this game are first off the talking mask that follows you. He is not very informative and seams to suffer from exceptional hindsite. Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on. As it turns the scenes change and then you go on into the next area. Way to often! Lastly THE INVISIBLE WALLS. there are times when you plan a jump only to hit an invisible wall killing you prompting that mask to make another snide remake about how that should not of happened.All in all it is a good game with decent fighting mechanics. Not a very hard game but something that will hold your attention for some time.			"

												A fun and entertaining brawler that doesn't try to be anything more than it is. The plot is silly, which is what makes this enjoyable. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death goes over the top from the first second and never looks back. The port is so-and-so, and some might have a hard time adjusting to the controls, which at times are very clunky. The fighting system is sufficient, although some weapons and powers are fairly useless from the get go, while others become your bread and butter the second you unlock them.This is a high action brawler with little room for breaks. Unfortunately, several enemies are downright boring to fight, and after a while become overly repetitive. The final boss is suitable for a game like this, but I personally found it to be a chore more than enjoyable.All in all, if you want several hours worth of entertaining brawling and like B film plots and dialogue, this is well worth picking up.

												It's ""God of War"" meets a somewhat cheesy ""B-movie"" with some good humor sprinkled into the mix. The gameplay is a mix of platforming, ""arena"" hack-n-slash, with some minigame-esque challenges dotted throughout. The gameplay is pretty much button-mashing for the majority of the time, with the occasional timing challenge thrown in (such as boss fights) so it doesn't require much effort. The characters aren't really ""storied"" but they have a lot of personality. The banter in the game is quite enjoyable, with the ""Mask of Death"" having some great moments with Marlow. Overall, don't take the game seriously, save it for an evening that you just want to have some brainless fun, and play. It's quite enjoyable, and considering the price during sales drops to less than $1, you can't get a better deal. It's a bargain-bin find that is superisingly good.			"

												I succumbed to buying this on a whim due to friend pressure...For $1.  So, I entered with low expectations....That said, what I found was actually kinda good.It is the most random♥♥♥♥♥cliche mix of ""Guy threatened your girl, you pushed back, he killed you, magic happened and now you can go get your revenge and save your lady"".   And really, that's all the more you need, because god damn is it a lovely throwback of just mindlessly blowing s*** up and beating up dudes because, hell, because it looks cool.It fills all the naughty cliches of some quick and silly turret sections, sometimes questionable checkpoints, and wonky difficulty curve at the end.   And yes, that difficulty spike is annoying---Going from playing whack-a-mole and one or two shotting everything, to 25 hits on basic mooks with fully upgraded gear being ""standard"".   But, if you can press on, it's still pretty fun and rewarding in it's own way to conqure the odds.Filled with witty humor, some 4th wall breaking, and a trash talking God that thinks he knows it all leads to some amusing banter back and forth along your journey.   For every bad thing it does, it fills a few more throwbacks to just good old fashion, no-nonsense beat 'em up for the sake of beating them up fun.It's a 5-6 hour experience, and you know what, for $1...Or even $5, it's worth your time if you want a bit of a throwback brawler to mess around in and then but back in the closet.  You too might be surprised by it.   Also, damn, for an unheard of game, it is dang pretty at times.  Screenshots galore for this one.			"

												Who says that all low budget-games are crap? Marlow Briggs proves that this is not always the case.Despite the low budget, the game boasts an amazing presentation on par with most AAA-games.The gameplay is also really fun, a lot like God of War in a good way. Not only is the combat and platforming really fun, with great controls and a great variety of weapons and combos, but there is also variety in gameplay-styles, so things don't get too repetitive.The story itself is really simple: Save your girlfriend from her evil boss.However, the aforementioned presentation and the characters really make the experience very enjoyable.Marlow Briggs himself is a very badass and likeable character (not to mention, a rare black protagonist that isn't a stereotypical gangsta), and King Tep, the titular Mask of Death, is a hilarious companion, with praise going to Steve Blum's funny and over-the-top performance. The witty conservations between them really makes the characters memorable, not to forget the hilarious despicable villain.The only negative thing that I can think of, is the fact that you can't change the graphical settings, so people with not-as-powerful computers/laptops are going to have problems running the game at a decent framerate, unlees you change the resolution.In short, a very enjoyable fighter with a b-movie-feel, but in good way, since the game itself has fun with it.If you like games like God of War, and enjoy movies like the ones Michael Bay makes, then Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is an awesome game :D :D			"

												What do you get when you combine Uncharted's Nathan Drake with Mass Effect's Garrus?  The mostly weak Kratos from God of War.  What do you get when you combine Mass Effect's Thane with Devil May Cry's Dante?  You get the superior Marlow Briggs, Baby!  Actually, Marlow Briggs encompasses little aspects from each character I've just mentioned, except for maybe Garrus who's inconsequential.  In fact, Marlow Briggs borrows a little something from each of their games as well,  except for Mass Effect.  There's even a bit from Tomb Raider thrown in.  All this is a good thing.  However, don't expect Marlow Briggs to be as polished as any of the aforementioned games.  Choppy transitions seem to be Marlow Briggs' biggest shortcoming.    There have been many sales offering this game for less than a buck, and that's well worth it!  Marlow Briggs set pieces, funny characters, and constant explosions make this game a blast!  Not perfect, but short and satisfying fun! "

												If you want to expirence perhaps, the most mediocore game ever made, then this game is for you!It copies literally everything from God of War. The Burly screaming muscle head, the combat system, the platforming sections, the wall climbing, the weapons, the magic, executing eniemies, and grabing are ALL EXACTLY like God of War.Im not agaisnt clones but you need to have something to set yourself apart from the thing you are cloning. The only change here is the combat feels slower and clunkier, they have a black protaganist instead of a white one, and they changed the lore from greek to... african I guess? Im not really sure if the lore is made up or if its based on some tribal history.And that camera angel... The entire game is fixed camera. Which means it tells you where to go and what to look at and the platforming you'll be doing is harder because you cant judge distance. This means you will fail time and time again trying to make that jump or dodge that moving platform.The game isnt terrible but when all you offer different from your competition is a change of story then I have to ask, ""why do you exist?""

												Hack and Slash is pretty much my favourite game genre. The plot is simple but neat, and the villian is pretty wonderfully awful. I like the protagonist and enjoy playing him, and the combat is great fun and satisfying.But I found the game mechanics and terrain a little weird - I would end up stuck because of weird jump puzzles that required expert timing and control to get past. I got the feeling those parts were not meant to be confusing, just badly thought out. It just became frustrating. The controls and camera angle changes reminded me of ""Landstalker,"" and could be confusing during parts of the game that required careful control or even just pushing objects around.Overall it's a good game but I would prefer the challenge come from harder enemies or outright proper puzzles than just confusing terrain. I spent more time timing jumps than actually fighting, so it felt like more of a puzzle game than a hack and slash.I played a few hours but I don't think I'll ever finish it. If you like jumping puzzles and sometimes fighting you will dig this, otherwise give it a miss.			"

Instead of dying, Marlow gets infused with an ancient power, becoming the sacred warrior, whose prophecy it is to protect the the old artefacts. His only aim is to rescue his girlfriend and stopping the old chinese of destroying the world. Xibalba can wait. Under the guidance of his new buddy, a flying mask, he starts to fight everything the jungle and militia have to offer - or he is just making some damn silly jokes. The gameplay isn't special. It's a God of War/Devil May Cry clone, but the copy works flawless and is entertaining and challenging. The optics are nice and the soundtrack is very good. All in all a very solid game for a low price.Bonus: the most creative use of endgame credits. People with long names suck!			"

												I honestly wish that I could have liked this more, but I really just found it to be alright. It's definitely worth the money that they're asking for it, but there are a few flaws that made the game not nearly as enjoyable for me. The worst flaw for me was definitely the fixed camera. For the most part, the camera was in a place that was okay, but at some points, I would have killed to actually be able to move it at some parts. The platforming early on also really aggravated me, as it is somewhat awkward and difficult to get used to. That isn't really that big of a deal though, and it shouldn't be too much of an issue once you progress into the game. I also didn't really like how the game basically just turned into me mashing one button for all of the fights, since I didn't feel very rewarded to do combos in fights. There is also a weapon later in the game that basically stun-locks most opponents if you just do the three hit strong attack combo. Other than those gripes, I did enjoy the game, and I'd say that it's very much worth your money to buy it.			"

												I don't tend to finish games that I don't like so much...I just finished Marlow Briggs. I find it a bit strange that this game didn't make more of an impact, anyways it's a real steal now and a somewhat hidden gem. It's a basically an ACTION packed arcade brawler, platformer, shoot-em-up, slide-em-down...you name it :), but importantly the difficulty level is just right, even some of the tougher boss battles just require a bit of learning rather than MLG level hand-eye co-ord and reaction speeds. So yep, I loved it.			"

												3rd person action platformer including all the cliche of these kind of games with some B-movie plot and humor. None of the parts of this game is really perfect, but as an overall game it is quite good.Everything is in this game you would expect and more: turrent sections and vertical scrolling shooter sections, sliding while collecting orb section etc. These sections are of proper length, not outstaying their welcome. I really liked the design of the gigantic ore harvester which is one of the major area's you play on.The combat is a bit button mashy, but satisfying enough. Some of the jumping puzzles and fights can get a bit frustrating, for example by respawn points just a bit too far away or some cheap deaths not really your fault or that it is not very clear what is expected to do next.

												As a preface, I got this game for 99 cents from the Humble Bundle winter sale.  For one dollar, it wouldn't take a lot to impress me.  However, this game is pretty fun.Cons:-No new ground-Not much variety-Forgettable musicPros+Great main character!+Pretty decent action platformer+Good graphics for a budget gameProbably the best part of the game is the cheesiness of the constant action.  The explosions, cliffside leaps, jumping from flying helicopters, etc. almost never stop.  I usually don't like action movies much, but this game handles itself very well.  It knows there shouldn't be so many explosions, but it lets you know right out of the gate that this is how it is going to be and jokes about it the entire way.I like the combination of solid action mechanics and platforming.  The addition of difficulty settings helps the cause as well.Honestly, it is a good thing the game only takes about 6 hours to beat.  If it were any longer it would wear you out and get boring.  It is just long enough to introduce the characters and humor, let you get in some good fights, power up, and then it is done, inviting you to come back later on to try a harder difficulty.  Everything considered, it is definitely a game I will go back to every few years for a quick start-to-finish run.			"

												What do you get when you cross Darksiders with God of War? The answer is... well, lots of things actually, but Marlow Briggs is perhaps one of the least well-known of the various clones that have spawned as a result of the aforementioned combination. It's a budget title with little in the way of innovation or originality, and its lumpen, cheese-tastic story is nothing to write home about, but in here lurks a fun, respectable, though flawed action game. Perhaps the best thing about Marlow Briggs is that the action rarely lets up, as it shifts from set piece to set piece, never really giving you a chance to get bored as you deal with waves of enemies by using a variety of combos to slice them to pieces. Throughout the 6-7 hour campaign you're furnished with a number of new weapons and magic powers, all of which are then upgraded via XP that you earn from kills and pick-ups. Along the way you'll find plenty of health and mana pick-ups too, helping you to replenish your stock ahead of the next big fight. It's a relatively simple system, and the combos aren't too difficult to master, though you'll probably stick to a couple of good ones and use those throughout. Along the way you'll be taking out human enemies, insects and spirits, along with a few boss battles to spice things up, and all with a smooth, easy-to-learn control scheme.Honestly, I was really enjoying Marlow Briggs up until around the halfway mark, where the game then insists on giving you incredibly tanky enemies that take far too long to kill, artifically increasing the difficulty and the length of the game in doing so. As fun as it was to slice and dice my way around, I felt like the tanky enemies began to detract from the enjoyment of the game, with spirit creatures that disappear every few seconds, forcing you to spend longer running around as you slice away at them until they finally go down. I began to get frustrated with some of the enemy encounters in the second half of the game, though unlocking some weapons and powers did help to satisfy my desire to finish out the game. These encounters won't kill the appeal of the game for you, but they might make the last few hours of it less palatable.It's hard not to recommend Marlow Briggs at just £4. You're getting a decent game, and you may even improve the experience a tad by dropping the difficulty level down to Casual (I played on Normal), where the tankier enemy encounters that pop up constantly in the second half might be a bit more tolerable. I was impressed that the game has a bit of gusto, and though I encountered a few bugs and glitches, it was a smooth experience overall. There's a bit of humour and self-awareness to the whole thing, and the game never takes itself too seriously. Oh and James Hong is in it, and he's pretty much playing Lo Pan from Big Trouble in Little China again. So if that's not going to sell you on it, I'm not sure anything will!			"

The 1st half was amazing, I had a lot of fun but the 2nd half got repetitive and just felt dragged out. There isn't too much else that bothered me other than getting somewhat bored during the 2nd half. I had 1 glitch where I went through the map but other then that, no issues. "

												I bought this game on a Steam summer sale for only a buck. The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely. This game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided. In the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time. Isn't that what games are supposed to be about anyway?			"

												A $5 God of War clone that refuses to take itself seriously. You play as Pierce Washington from the Saints Row franchise as he has to save his girlfriend from Lo Pan and kill a bunch of dudes/jungle bugs/Aztec gods along the way. The banter between Marlow and his spirit mask is actually pretty funny, and the controls responsive. The camera occasionally freaks out when trying to jump on the moveable boxes (though this is more annoying that game-ruining) and the game only clocks in at about 4-5 hours, but these are minor quibbles for a game that costs less than a cheeseburger and can't go more than 30 seconds without something exploding.

												Hack and Slash is pretty much my favourite game genre. The plot is simple but neat, and the villian is pretty wonderfully awful. I like the protagonist and enjoy playing him, and the combat is great fun and satisfying.But I found the game mechanics and terrain a little weird - I would end up stuck because of weird jump puzzles that required expert timing and control to get past. I got the feeling those parts were not meant to be confusing, just badly thought out. It just became frustrating. The controls and camera angle changes reminded me of ""Landstalker,"" and could be confusing during parts of the game that required careful control or even just pushing objects around.Overall it's a good game but I would prefer the challenge come from harder enemies or outright proper puzzles than just confusing terrain. I spent more time timing jumps than actually fighting, so it felt like more of a puzzle game than a hack and slash.I played a few hours but I don't think I'll ever finish it. If you like jumping puzzles and sometimes fighting you will dig this, otherwise give it a miss.			"

												I bought this game bc someone said it was like God of War and it was a dollar. Easily the best quality to price ratio I've seen in years. You play as Marlow Briggs, a man who takes getting shot and being imbued with the power of ancient Mayan spirits all in stride. While they've traded Kratos' brooding for banter, the gameplay is identical to God of War: slash your way through bad guys, solve some minor puzzles, fight a boss. What's truly surprising is that the visuals are pretty close to the quality of a AAA series like GoW, the only time it's low budget becomes obvious is in the several cutscenes where they show a series of freeze-frames... it's a stylish presentation but it's pretty obvious they just didn't have the cash to do all the action. The levels you actually play through though are practically lavish in the details. It's a short game and it keeps you entertained throughout. Well worth it even at the full price.			"

												Yeah, it's a God of War game. The parts that aren't God of War are clones of other games you probably know. However, I found it difficult to get bored because the game goes batshit crazy at a breakneck pace. It's laugh-out-loud exhilarating and heart-pounding hilarious.It belongs to an elite class of games like Killer Is Dead and Monkey Island - while you're playing, the game seems to be having as much fun as you are.You can tell that it was made on a shoestring budget - every unncessary corner has been cut, but no shortcuts were taken where it counts. Cutscenes are kept to frozen key frames, but those frames are gorgeous. The characters are simple, but fantastically acted. Combat's just God of War, but it's God of War done very right.Issues include some minor control issues during platforming and some awkward camera angles, but these are the rough edges of an uncut diamond. Even when I got frustrated with repeating one section over and over again, I couldn't stay mad for long before a beautiful view and a great kill animation had me cackling with delight.9.5/10			"

												This game surprised the hell out of me. While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany. That said, for a cheap♥♥♥♥♥game like this, it sure has great value. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay. The story is weird and silly and the cutscenes seem to come out of nowhere sometimes, but that's part of the cheap-o charm. The game itself, as I said, is a God of War ripoff unabashedly. Which means it has the problems of God of War. Some weapons are completely useless, and the stupid enemies that go underground and burrow up elsewhere are here as well. When emulating or copy and pasting a game, at least leave the bad portions out. This is a short, fun, and cheap game that will appeal to character action fans.

												Very strange action game. A combination of Devil may cry + monster hunter tri + Soul Calibur and that scene in star wars: phantom menace where anakin tames the wild beast in the arena. You also get a really annoying mask that talks to you, gives you meaningful advice, but at most times a bit too talkative for a ceremonial deathmask. It even makes fun of you when you fall off and die in the platforming parts of the game. But there's a lot of work done for just $5. If you like Jax from Mortal Kombat series or a luke cage fan, and want to play as an overpowered, black american sacred warrior, you might want to pick this up.			"

												This is actually a really great game! Think of it like if Michael Bay made a God of War like game. There are tons of explosions with some platforming with a mediocre storyline. The mask is actually quite witty with some very funny death monologues. The fighting style is easy to work with and doesn't require any kind of controler. This game is a lot of fun though a tad on the short side. Definitely worth the 3 bucks I paid for it and I know that everyone who plays it will enjoy this little jewel of a game.			"

												I was gifted this game to play live on stream as a joke. What happened was amazing.I had some music in the background (completely random) and it seemed to go along with the level I was currently playing.After a few random songs, we realized that ANY SONG fits with this game as the background music. We ended up turning on my song request bot and my viewers/subs had a great time with this game and picking some hilarious songs to go with the gameplay (somehow hanson's mmmbop works...).It plays like a God of War title with a super low budget. You can upgrade your abilities as you progress through the game, has some decent animations and some comedic value.If you're looking for an inexpensive game with character, check out Marlow!			"

												What do you get when you combine Uncharted's Nathan Drake with Mass Effect's Garrus?  The mostly weak Kratos from God of War.  What do you get when you combine Mass Effect's Thane with Devil May Cry's Dante?  You get the superior Marlow Briggs, Baby!  Actually, Marlow Briggs encompasses little aspects from each character I've just mentioned, except for maybe Garrus who's inconsequential.  In fact, Marlow Briggs borrows a little something from each of their games as well,  except for Mass Effect.  There's even a bit from Tomb Raider thrown in.  All this is a good thing.  However, don't expect Marlow Briggs to be as polished as any of the aforementioned games.  Choppy transitions seem to be Marlow Briggs' biggest shortcoming.    There have been many sales offering this game for less than a buck, and that's well worth it!  Marlow Briggs set pieces, funny characters, and constant explosions make this game a blast!  Not perfect, but short and satisfying fun! "

At that price point, you would be a FOOL not to buy it.The gameplay and fight mechanics are basically of God of War, but the graphics are great and the action is very fluid, albeit with a few very minor video artifacts.It is extremely pick up and play - the storyline is there but you are engrossed within the first 5 minutes, and it's not so serious that you would feel bad for putting this game down for a week or two.Upgrade systems are basic, but still satisfying. Exactly what you would expect from a God of War game. But what GoW game can you buy for less than 1.00 USD?Highly recommend this game on sale.			"

												A very good indie God of War Clone. It's clearly, clearly a budget title, but for the price you get a surprisingly Hype game with plenty of combo-mashing action, explosions, surprisingly good scenery, etc.  It has the same faults any God of War-esque game has, but it's fun and you'll root for Marlow Briggs far more than a certain guy who screams ARREEES a lot. You also get a just-shy of annoying Aztec mask spirit-guide thing and some fun dialogue here and there, though don't expect anything mind-blowing. The stop-motion fly-by changeovers is actually a nice touch when you realize they probably had no budget for multiple cut-scenes, and looks stylistic(though not everyone will like it. I find them to run a bit longer than they should be but ehhh).It won't be the best game you play this year, but it's worth the money you pay to get it and play through.Also, the main villain is voiced by Lo-Pan. Which is worth the few bucks Marlow Briggs cost alone in my humble opinion.			"

												This game surprised the hell out of me. While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany. That said, for a cheap♥♥♥♥♥game like this, it sure has great value.

												So after a couple of hours with the game, I found myself not truly interested enough to finish. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death isn't so bad or terrible that it isn't simply worth playing, but it's a very straight forward God of War clone that didn't keep me interested. The highest mark for this game is the comedic banter between Marlow and the mask - it will make fun of you for dying and Marlow will say a line that is clearly meant to break the fourth wall - commentary that is self-aware. I genuinely laughed when the mask berated me for having magical powers and then jumping off into a pit and asked if I was looking for enemies when I jumped into another.All aspects of the game are standard quality for 360 era spectacle fighter, except for some jumpiness with some animations. One cool feature that I like are the frozen cutscenes, involving the camera moving around a scene frozen in time and will ""update"" as it passes things that obscure's your view. This has maybe been done before, but it was done well before and it was nice to watch these cutscenes. Still, I found myself uniterested in continuing any further - many other games of this genre do it better, and the comedy and cutscenes are good, but not enough to keep me going. That said it is $5 as of writing, and it meets, arguably, exceeds that value if you intend on finishing it. If your time is limited to better games, I'd only bother if you're really looking forward to some occasional laughs. If you have played all the good spectacle fighters and still want more, then Marlow Briggs is an ok title to add to the list.			"

There's a couple of times where the non-controlled camera doesn't show the best view, and there's some pointless frozen-in-time flyby cutscenes (skippable, at least,) but most everything is well-polished and enjoyable.It's big, it's dumb, and it's fun.It's also GRILLIN' TIME			"

Banter between main hero (voiced by Cyborg from teen titans??)  and his sidekick are entertaining but never really made me laugh or anything. Handles okay but you can definetly feel the low budget in the way you move and such.6.8/10    It's pretty okay for something made by a small studio and theres worse hack and slash out there, but there's better.

												Reviewed after finishing Normal mode. A gamepad is highly suggested.Pros: I already want a sequel. Story doesn't take itself seriously, at all, at any point. Simple controls. Funny, B-rate movie acting. Lines from the mask and main baddie are especially funny. Extremely cheap price. This game is definitey worth more than its being sold.  Explosions, Destruction, Violence, Giant Scorpions Everything, James Hong-voiced Villian, Black Main Character, Mind Control, One Liners, More Helicopters Than Previously Expected, Mayan/Incan/Somethan' Ruins, Explosions   Cons: Somewhat repetitive battles This is also a 360 game. which becomes obvious very quickly while playing. That's not a complete con, but any preparations made for other console ports you play should be taken here. Don't expect a plethora of settings, the game is very slim there. It seems to run well, but there's also not much to change. Personal gripe: Marlow has gigantic hands, a model in which his face almost never changes, and a weird jump animation.  Personal gripe: Did not find the helicopter shoot 'em up minigame transitions enjoyable. There's only two of those specific minigames, and they are very short. It's extremely fun, very funny, cheap, linear and kinda short. Geit it. This isn't a discussion.			"

												At first glance, and from popular opinion, this game will seem like an underrated, cheesily self-aware but still-enjoyable spectacle-fighter at a budget price. And it is largely those things, but it's still not far from being mediocre.What the game has going for it is its cheesy, self-aware humor, and it did a great job of delivering on it. I smiled and got some genuine joy out of that aspect quite a number of times. I also enjoyed the set-pieces and technical-efficiency of the game. But past those, it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill CAG/hack-n-slash.After the novelty wore-off for me (maybe 2 hours in), I started to get increasingly bored as I progressed because the combat just didn't deliver. It's your standard button-masher where victory comes relatively easily, and where ""Hard"" mode doesn't make the game more difficult, but more tedious (eg, less forgiving, so you have to be more liberal with dodging, damage-sponge enemies). Any time I got into an enemy encounter, and couldn't just run past them or quickly kill them by throwing them off a cliff, I would find myself falling asleep, doing the same attacks and dodges repeatedly until everything was dead.Some other aspects that detracted were: The puzzles. They were all mind-numbingly easy, and executing them felt like a punishment. The on-rails sections and quick-time events, because they took-away agency from me. The story. I did mention that the game was pretty funny, and it is, but the story really is nothing special. And the ""panorama""-style cutscenes -- which I took great indulgence in the first few times -- eventually got old and hampered the pace of the game. The audio-logs were also pretty pointless.Overall, Marlow Briggs is beautiful, funny, and a very competent budget-priced game. But for those who have high standards for games in this genre (think: Ninja Gaiden II), it just doesn't hold-up.			"

												I bought this game bc someone said it was like God of War and it was a dollar. Easily the best quality to price ratio I've seen in years. You play as Marlow Briggs, a man who takes getting shot and being imbued with the power of ancient Mayan spirits all in stride. While they've traded Kratos' brooding for banter, the gameplay is identical to God of War: slash your way through bad guys, solve some minor puzzles, fight a boss. What's truly surprising is that the visuals are pretty close to the quality of a AAA series like GoW, the only time it's low budget becomes obvious is in the several cutscenes where they show a series of freeze-frames... it's a stylish presentation but it's pretty obvious they just didn't have the cash to do all the action. The levels you actually play through though are practically lavish in the details. It's a short game and it keeps you entertained throughout. Well worth it even at the full price.			"

												 It's not often that you'll come across a game as odd as Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death. It's a budget title from ZootFly, famous for their Ghostbusters demo they released a few years before the actual game from Atari.  On paper, its a generic action game. You play Marlow Briggs, you work on a rig?..., bad guys come after you, you get infused with the power of the jungle, now you can fight the bad guys. But Marlow Briggs, to experience Marlow Briggs, is entirely different thing all together. Imagine, almost to a fault, a Sony all-stars mashup. Imagine the world of Nathan Drake's Uncharted, invaded by a mildly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Kratos, who is guided along his journey by the “Aku-Aku” mask from Crash Bandicoot, roll them together like a Katamari Damacy ball and you have Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death.  This game, is for lack of a better definition a B-Game. It's story doesn't rival any of the before mentioned games, and it isn't trying to. Marlow is a clever mix, cherry picked from the finest parts of other games, and created it's own awe inspiring game.  It's fun, the action is constant and enjoyable. The story is simple, but the characters are interesting. Marlow is a tough, but soft hero, imagine a Keith David meets Sidney Poitier. He's a character who can be kind, but shake some sass if he has to. He's followed by the Mask of Death, who like the Aku-Aku mask follows the player around, providing the comic relief and instructional help.  The action is non stop. It just keeps blasting right around you. The gameplay is almost exactly like God of War or DMC, hack and slash, mowing down enemys left and right.   For $5.00, or if you've purchased it during the summer sale for $0.99, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fantastic game. It has the polish and action of a AAA title, not a budget title, and could serve as the perfect black sheep to the family of Sony games that inspired it's creation. A must buy.			"

												I bought this game on a Steam summer sale for only a buck. The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely. This game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided. In the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time. Isn't that what games are supposed to be about anyway?			"

												A decent game for 69p certainly. But really it is a poor mans DmC or GoW. Nothing really original here but its a solid fun ride for the 6 or so hours it takes to complete. If you can get it cheap and need something to fill some time you can do a lot worse than this!			"

												This game is fanastic, the Graphics are incredible, the controls are tight the hack and slash combo's all feel natural and aren't overly/needlessly complex. The Boss fights are interesting as are the puzzles and level design.The fluidity of the combat is almost unrivalled very few lower budget titles delivery gameplay as clean and polished as Marlow Briggs does. I recently played X-blades (which is terrible) and was shocked to find how much of a disaster the controls were, playing Marlow briggs feels as tight as playing Dark Siders or Devil may cry ( but not DmC that one sucked a big butt).The whole game from voice acting, art style and writing are all meant to convey a certain kind of ""cheese"" but there are genuine moments of deep content and criticism of the videogame narative.Have you ever played a game and wondered how workers in the factory actually got over these jumps and dodged the steam pipes and flame pillars? Well in Marlow Briggs the game explains that the workers in the ore refinery actually sabotaged the building by removing ladders, breaking platforms and turning the flames on. Making the level design actually have a place in the world, unlike a lot of games where only the protagonist could actually navigate them making them non functional or convoluted.Small fourth wall breaking features and moments in the dialogue that poke fun at the narrative of videogames really help build a relationship with the main charactersCheck out my lets play of Marlow Briggs at youtube.com /Deppresso			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a great game. I love the funny chats between Marlow and the mask. My only complaint is that the camera is a bit weird, being that you can't control it so it makes some jumps difficult to aim. Had a great ending and a nice extra after the game is finished.I really think you should get this game alot of fun in at least 8 or 9 hours of gameplay.			"

												Marlow Briggs is an action platformer, with an amateurish art style (mostly the lighting, and unrealistic physics and animations) reminiscient of AAA PC games from the late 90s and early 00s, or more recent XBLA and PSN titles.  Cheesy dialogue, goofy plot and villains, you name it... its like a blast from the past.Those comments may sound like criticism -- they're not, really.  Marlow Briggs is fun, and worth every penny.  Just don't go into it expecting the kind of drama you get from major titles -- it's not there.  What is there, is campy fun, and lots of explosions, deflecting rockets back at the bad guys with your magic scythe (which makes more explosions), executing brutal combos on bad guys while exploding more stuff off them and then throwing off the nearest cliff.  If you can appreciate that kind of over-the-top fun, you will enjoy Marlow Briggs.			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a surprisingly fun God of War clone. It has lots of over-the-top action, enormous bosses, flashy fights, colorful graphics, and a great sense of scale. And it's legitimately funny too.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death doesn't do anything new; it's essentially a God of War knockoff in a modern-day setting. But it succeeds at what it sets out to do, and the action and absurd setpieces never let up. Other God of War clones like Dante's Inferno started strong, only to peak early. Marlow Briggs avoids this pitfall by constantly throwing bigger and bigger stuff at the player. This game can be ridiculous at times, but in way that will put a smile on your face.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a blatant copy. But it's a highly entertaining one. Check it out.			"

												Action and adventure, served up with a liberal dose of Death-God humour.  Add in a villain voiced by the amazing James Hong.  Worth playing simply to hear the villain's commentary to his henchmen while the base is being dismantled by our hero (commentary given in the form of public announcements regarding firings via intercom), Marlow Briggs is a great bit of platforming fun.  It's powered by a 3-D engine, and the camera is on rails, but as a bargain title, it more than delivers its quota of fun.			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death (MBATMOD) is a very fine, small Hack-and-Slay action adventure in the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry. It resembles God of War in many ways, you got 4 different weapons, each unlocked at a certain point in the story, 4 different kinds of magic (which aren't that balanced..), and orb-like collectables to upgrade your magic and weapons. it got a very good combo training system. nice visuals for a small title, at certain points it can easily be compared with AAA-titles. but over all that you got the worst screen-tearing! real xbox360 feeling ;) but it doesn't get in the way of the fun you can have with this title. grab it for a discount price and it's a steal! I got around 5hours gameplay on medium. ah, and the difficulty level likes to spike sometimes..so, now go and buy it already. cheers!			"

												This game is equal parts [Prototype] and Dark Siders, with a little dash of Devil May Cry sprinkled on top for good measure. In other words, it's a shooty bang-bang hack-n-slash. Only with Ancient magics and Death Gods.Like a classic '90's action flick, it throws you right into the action and wastes very little time trying to complicate things with story or plot; just enough to move things along from one big explosion to the next - even bigger - explosion. The protagonist, Marlow Briggs, gets the same treatment: he manages to be a little bit of every black action hero all rolled into one, complete with an overly dramatic and painfully stereotypical 'brotha' persona who is just full of less-than-witty one-liners.That being said, the game delivers on fun and exciting combat and the action is simply over the top. The platforming and 'puzzle' bits could have been a bit more challenging, but they weren't too bad.			"

												It's ""God of War"" meets a somewhat cheesy ""B-movie"" with some good humor sprinkled into the mix. The gameplay is a mix of platforming, ""arena"" hack-n-slash, with some minigame-esque challenges dotted throughout. The gameplay is pretty much button-mashing for the majority of the time, with the occasional timing challenge thrown in (such as boss fights) so it doesn't require much effort. The characters aren't really ""storied"" but they have a lot of personality. The banter in the game is quite enjoyable, with the ""Mask of Death"" having some great moments with Marlow. Overall, don't take the game seriously, save it for an evening that you just want to have some brainless fun, and play. It's quite enjoyable, and considering the price during sales drops to less than $1, you can't get a better deal. It's a bargain-bin find that is superisingly good.			"

I mean it's rather cheap so really I would recommend this game to anyone with $5(or less if you catch it on sale).I'm not a huge fan of this genre but for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed the game. The 1st half was amazing, I had a lot of fun but the 2nd half got repetitive and just felt dragged out. There isn't too much else that bothered me other than getting somewhat bored during the 2nd half. I had 1 glitch where I went through the map but other then that, no issues. "

That said though, it's a shining example of a bargain game that goes above and beyond the call of duty by making the most of its low budget. Despite the previously mentioned flaws, the combat is fluent and satisfying. For $5, I'd recommend it.			"

												Criminally short game! For the price and its obscurity, I've been shocked and impressed with this game over the hour and a half I've played so far. That said, I'm already 40% through the game. The combat's simple but fun, the static cutscenes are gorgeous, the writing is passable, but the voice acting! The voice acting's so amazing! I have no clue what engine was used to make this game, but it looks phenomenal, and almost makes the game an interactive movie.I've been totally unimpressed by Uncharted and God of War, but this game's phenomenal.TL;DR: Aztec God of War			"

												 It's not often that you'll come across a game as odd as Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death. It's a budget title from ZootFly, famous for their Ghostbusters demo they released a few years before the actual game from Atari.  On paper, its a generic action game. You play Marlow Briggs, you work on a rig?..., bad guys come after you, you get infused with the power of the jungle, now you can fight the bad guys. But Marlow Briggs, to experience Marlow Briggs, is entirely different thing all together. Imagine, almost to a fault, a Sony all-stars mashup. Imagine the world of Nathan Drake's Uncharted, invaded by a mildly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Kratos, who is guided along his journey by the “Aku-Aku” mask from Crash Bandicoot, roll them together like a Katamari Damacy ball and you have Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death.  This game, is for lack of a better definition a B-Game. It's story doesn't rival any of the before mentioned games, and it isn't trying to. Marlow is a clever mix, cherry picked from the finest parts of other games, and created it's own awe inspiring game.  It's fun, the action is constant and enjoyable. The story is simple, but the characters are interesting. Marlow is a tough, but soft hero, imagine a Keith David meets Sidney Poitier. He's a character who can be kind, but shake some sass if he has to. He's followed by the Mask of Death, who like the Aku-Aku mask follows the player around, providing the comic relief and instructional help.  The action is non stop. It just keeps blasting right around you. The gameplay is almost exactly like God of War or DMC, hack and slash, mowing down enemys left and right.   For $5.00, or if you've purchased it during the summer sale for $0.99, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fantastic game. It has the polish and action of a AAA title, not a budget title, and could serve as the perfect black sheep to the family of Sony games that inspired it's creation. A must buy.			"

												A hidden gem among PC games. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death plays very similar to God of war, but manages to feel fun like God of war. The story is okay, and the voice acting is good. Controls feel tight and responsive, enviroments look awesome and varited. At one point your on a snowy mountain top and the next you deep in the central american jungle.This game is underrated and is worth way more than the steam price tag. I recommend this to God of war fans because it feels similar but has a style all on its own. And Marlow Briggs is a badass! Gets awesome Mayan powers and nothing can stand in his way! Get it if you have a few bucks to spare. You won't regreat it!			"

												By far the best B-tier game I have ever played. This game is a non-stop rollercoaster ride of explosions, hilarity, and bad voice acting, with incredibly solid fighting mechanics (combo chains, command grabs, etc.). The visuals and music set a very interesting tone and the game features the best controller rumble integration I have seen in any PC game ever. If you're up for a God-of-War meets Michael Bay thriller where the protagonist is an average Joe turned into a magical undead Mayan, this is the game for you.If you like sitting around and being bored like a loser, go play Knitting Simulator 2014 or something.

												With nothing but mere pocket change, you’ll get this SICK character-action game where you get to play as african-american hero-ish fireman who fights evil chinese businesslord using ancient Mayan magic powers in industrial South American jungle! And that’s just how the game BEGINS!No but seriously, Marlow Briggs is a VIDEO GAME. It plays kind of like God of War with the feel of hype from games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. You can kind of see that they had low budget making this (cutscene animations will split opinions), but even then it’s extraordinarily high-quality game both visual-, mechanical- and gameplay-wise.It was originally 15€, and even then it was more than worth it’s prize. if you like God of War, Dante’s Inferno, DmC: Devil May Cry, MGR: Revengeance, Bayonetta or such games, throw money to this game! Way better investment than Assassin’s Creed!During Steam Sale, when it was 1€, I literally bought 3 of them.			"

												I bought this game on a Steam summer sale for only a buck. The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely. This game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided. In the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time. Isn't that what games are supposed to be about anyway?			"

												This game is fanastic, the Graphics are incredible, the controls are tight the hack and slash combo's all feel natural and aren't overly/needlessly complex. The Boss fights are interesting as are the puzzles and level design.The fluidity of the combat is almost unrivalled very few lower budget titles delivery gameplay as clean and polished as Marlow Briggs does. I recently played X-blades (which is terrible) and was shocked to find how much of a disaster the controls were, playing Marlow briggs feels as tight as playing Dark Siders or Devil may cry ( but not DmC that one sucked a big butt).The whole game from voice acting, art style and writing are all meant to convey a certain kind of ""cheese"" but there are genuine moments of deep content and criticism of the videogame narative.Have you ever played a game and wondered how workers in the factory actually got over these jumps and dodged the steam pipes and flame pillars? Well in Marlow Briggs the game explains that the workers in the ore refinery actually sabotaged the building by removing ladders, breaking platforms and turning the flames on. Making the level design actually have a place in the world, unlike a lot of games where only the protagonist could actually navigate them making them non functional or convoluted.Small fourth wall breaking features and moments in the dialogue that poke fun at the narrative of videogames really help build a relationship with the main charactersCheck out my lets play of Marlow Briggs at youtube.com /Deppresso			"

Upgrading your weapons/abilities lets you achieve 300x combos and there will be lots of explosions :) Also the sarcastic dialogues/comments between the main character and his fellow the mask of death are really enjoyable. Keeping in mind it´s a low budget game the graphics are very nice and the environment features beautiful landscapes.Is it worth the money? Well, I bought it on sale and I dont´t regret it.

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is an action adventure hack and slash made by Zootfly games released on September 20th, 2013. Is this game just another mediocre God of War clone, or does it rise above that by being a hilarious and self aware budget game? Spoilers: it does.Story: Marlow Briggs takes place in South America, where your ladyfriend is translating ruins for a crazy businessman. When she tries to quit working for him, our protagonist Marlow is stabbed by a ancient Mayan weapon and killed. He is brought back to life by a talkative mask and goes out to kill the bad guy and save the girl. Pretty normal stuff. Anyway, it doesn't take itself seriously, and I did get quite a few laughs from the magical mask, who acts as the comic relief throughout the game, and gets some good banter with Marlow. Also the evil businessman is absolutely amazing, he has enough ham to feed a West Virginia family reunion (In case you didn't know, that is a lot of ham) It might not make much sense, but I had fun, and that's what matters.Graphics: Looks great, lots of colors, good animations for Marlow's attacks. Very few options on PC but runs smoothly, so I didn't mind. Not much to say here. One quick sidenote, why are some people saying the graphics in this are bad? It's a budget game, 15 bucks at launch man. Are people comparing this game's graphics to AAA 60 dollar games? Cause that doesn't make a whole lotta sense.Gameplay: The God of War comparison is easy to make, and it certainly follows the formula. Light and heavy attacks, combos, health and mana items, all of that stuff. Not being an expert at God of War (or any game, for that matter) I don't know the small details, for instance if the 43rd frame of Marlow's combo ruins the game or any super indepth thing like that. I can tell you the combat is smooth and responsive on keyboard and mouse, combos feel very natural to pull off,  dodging works effortlessly, and magic attacks feel very powerful and satisfying. It also has quite a bit of variety, platforming, very basic puzzle solving, and turret sections that don't overstay their welcome. Everything in this game works well, and controls pretty much perfectly. Here's a quick side thing, I didn't try using a controller, because the keyboard and mouse worked perfectly. As a guy raised on consoles, it's rare where I play an action game that feels flawless on Keyboard and mouse. Length and replay value: The game takes about 7.5 hours to beat, probably less if you don't suck as badly as myself. Not many reasons to replay unless you want to beat the game on hard mode.Should you get it? If you like fun games, I'd recommend it. If you don't like fun games, buy Call of Duty Ghosts instead. Just kidding! Even if you hate video games, don't buy Call of Duty Ghosts. Buy Marlow Briggs and give it to someone who likes games.Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, ""CultGamerAlliance"". Check it out if you get a chance!			"

I'm surprised that this game isn't more of a hit or cult classic, as it isn't bad at all. It's a pretty well made game with good visuals, but I think the title and overall goofy feel of the story might've held it back.Regardless, it's worth checking out as it's a very competent and fun game!

Worth playing simply to hear the villain's commentary to his henchmen while the base is being dismantled by our hero (commentary given in the form of public announcements regarding firings via intercom), Marlow Briggs is a great bit of platforming fun.  It's powered by a 3-D engine, and the camera is on rails, but as a bargain title, it more than delivers its quota of fun.			"

												Nous avons de plus en plus de Beat'em Up sur PC de nos jour, ce qui me plait grandement. Mais nous n'avions pas eut encore de clone du mythique God Of War, je ne sais pas si Marlow Briggs est le debut d'une franchise, mais le titre est tres plaisant à jouer, meme si le en lui meme à copier sans honte sur God Of War et Dante's Inferno, c'est une excellente surprise.

												There was a time when I didn't play this game. I distainfully look back on those times as the dark ages, when I was unaware of how little budget you really need to make a game good or how even the no nameyest game can still be exciting. Unfortunately the renaissence of my optimism was quickly killed by the grim reality of the Western Gaming Industry, but it was fun while it lasted. Ten outta ten.			"

												It's a beautiful shameless ripoff of God of War and I don't even care. The game is currently 70 odd pence on the steam sale and I cannot believe it isn't being talked about. The devs wanted to make their own god of war game, they didn't have the multimillion pound budget that you find with AAA game titles but they worked with what they had and what they made is a surprisingly fun, action packed beat em up where practically everything is exploding all of the time.Word of warning though, this game has NO graphics options, if you have a lower end machine, don't bother. This game is shadered up to the eyeballs.Marlow Briggs has the veiniest arms.			"

Is it a great game? No.  But for the price, you could do a whole lot worse.  I've certainly wasted more money on much lesser games.If it's not on sale though, I don't think I can recommend it for more than say, $3.50.			"

												Surprisingly good game. Short campaign that pretty much just drops you in. The plot seems like it would fit in a 90s action movie. And that's great. The developers know it and took advantage of it. Marlow and the mask have back and forths through out the game that provides some additional comedic relief. There is also actual explanations for the flame jets and general hazards through out the game. Not something that is usually answered. The game does kind of hold your hand where it makes it pretty much impossible to jump off an edge unless there's a platform across the chasm, which is annoying. There is also an issue for me where jumping off a rope on to another platform higher up just doesn't happen. I have to be positioned absolutely perfectly for it to let me jump off. Other than these the game was great. Similar in play style to God of War, Dante's Inferno and those types of games where you go for combos and stringing attacks together.All in all. Definite buy for a dollar.			"

												Easily the most underrated game I have ever come across. It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.I wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....The game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price. In terms of value for money, this game is definitely up there. It is easily the best purchase of the summer 2014 sale for me, and one of the best steam purchases ever.			"

A few buggy sound issues, and a few squishy control issues, but otherwise no real complaints. I got it for $.99 during the Summer Sale and set out to beat it immediately. Nice weapons and moves, even if the enemies are a tad repetetive. It's a competent Bayonetta meets God of War game, and for a steal.			"

												Every aspect of this game has been carefully designed to make you feel special.-The achievements are stupid easy to get. Upon getting your first achievement, you will receive a second achievement called ""Achiever,"" just for getting your first achievement. That's because you're special, winner!-It's crazy easy to build up massive combo numbers, of which you will get an achievement for. Because you deserve it, winner!-The game progresses at a brisk pace. I'm only 2 hours in, and I've already seen things as diverse as a factory to a jungle. You get more experience points than you can use at any given time, and you're already well on your way to mastering your newest skill (which I already have a large amount of) as soon as it unlocks. That's because you're tired of living the grind of life, and you deserve to be treated well, winner!-Most of all, I feel special while playing this game because I just got something that looks and plays amazing and has a good sense of humor for 99 cents. I feel like I just conned Steam out of a really fun game that's worth at least 20 dollars, kind of like the yard sale down the street that is selling something that costs 250 dollars on ebay for 8 dollars because ""it's just taking up too much space."" I almost feel guilty taking this off Steam's hands for 99 cents, but I'm not complaining. Though it may have felt like my review struck a somewhat sarcastic tone at the beginninng, I am totally serious in my statement that having cheevos pop up all the time because I did something simple does make me feel special. And I want my friends to feel special by snagging this up while it's ridiculously cheap. I'm less than half-way through, but I already feel like I got my money's worth. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!			"

												I bought this game bc someone said it was like God of War and it was a dollar. Easily the best quality to price ratio I've seen in years. You play as Marlow Briggs, a man who takes getting shot and being imbued with the power of ancient Mayan spirits all in stride. While they've traded Kratos' brooding for banter, the gameplay is identical to God of War: slash your way through bad guys, solve some minor puzzles, fight a boss. What's truly surprising is that the visuals are pretty close to the quality of a AAA series like GoW, the only time it's low budget becomes obvious is in the several cutscenes where they show a series of freeze-frames... it's a stylish presentation but it's pretty obvious they just didn't have the cash to do all the action. The levels you actually play through though are practically lavish in the details. It's a short game and it keeps you entertained throughout. Well worth it even at the full price.			"

I'm surprised that this game isn't more of a hit or cult classic, as it isn't bad at all. It's a pretty well made game with good visuals, but I think the title and overall goofy feel of the story might've held it back.Regardless, it's worth checking out as it's a very competent and fun game!

												I've played this game for about half an hour and saw like 50 big explosions, learned how to throw energy daggers at enemies and how to do a fire blast to beat the sh*t out of everything that's on screen, fought building sized machines and big as* insects. This game is like a walk into a 80's action movie with twice the cheesy dialog, explosions and beating. I think I even saw the ground exploding at some moments.The main character is a badass fella that looks like a Kratos + Terry Crews son. The plot is as chiché as it could be, rescue your girlfriend from a big corporation villain boss with a assassin/ninja henchgirl and sh*tloads of gun for hires. Beat everything that moves (and boxes) until you find your girl and that's it.Also for it's size, the game have nice graphics, good sound effects and the controls are very smooth. The only minor thing is the câmera angle which is automatic, you can't rotate it manually. But that's ok, I got used to it in few minutes.10/10 I would recommend it for everyone who likes action hack'n slash games and cheesy action movies. And all of this for only 3 bucks.			"

												Describing Marlow Briggs to someone would be easy. It’s an over the top, in your face action and comedic hack and slash. I definitely enjoyed my playthrough of it. You play as Marlow, trying to save your girlfriend, Eva, after she is taken hostage to decipher some ancient codices. I was quite surprised with the range of environments that you are taken through. They are nicely done too and feel full and rich.An odd thing to point out, but I will. The game sets up the “camera” to be the Mask of Death following you around. Or at least that’s how I interpreted it. Reminded me of how Mario 64 implied the Lakitu Brothers were “filming you” during gameplay. Since we are on the camera, there is a love/hate relationship with it. The camera is FIXED and you cannot control it. This can, and is, used to hide secrets and extra experience points that are out of view until you explore a little. Generally, it’s good and doesn’t get in the way. But on occasion, especially during battle, it will not let you see where the enemy is. It also tended to lag behind if I started moving too fast. The multiple rope swinging segments are brought to mind where this happened. In the end, it wasn’t too much of a nuisance.Marlow Briggs is extremely linear. I don’t mind this at all in games, but I know this is a personal preference. There are invisible walls everywhere and you cannot explore much outside your destined path. I say can’t explore “much” because you can go in little crevices and off camera areas that give you experience. It definitely rewards you for doing what little exploring you can. Controls feel relatively tight during combat and responsive during the many platforming segments. I would highly recommend a controller to play this game. It was released on the 360 and it shows. The mouse and keyboard controls are awkward and I immediately switched to a controller. The game switches seamlessly between the two, which is appreciated.Marlow can upgrade and acquire a few more weapons and magic powers throughout the playthough. You can switch quickly and easily between them for whatever situation you’re in. I tended to stick with the weapon that was on a chain for a majority of the game after I acquired it. It’s the only ranged weapon and felt the most safe using it. It was also easy to break out of a combo and dodge an enemy attack. The magic powers are visually cool, but consistently felt underpowered. They were expensive to use (Mana) and would usually not even kill the smaller enemies. I wish they were quite a bit more powerful or used less Mana. Saving is spectacular. Tons of auto-saves and you can save manually at any point. I always love to see this in games. Graphically the game is quite good! I found myself taking a lot of screenshots because of the really nice looking environments I was in. However, there are NO graphics options to play around with. You get to choose your resolution and if it’s full screen or not. That’s it… Sound and music is good. I felt some of the epic songs got tired since they were used a lot during the cut scenes.Let’s get to the Pros and ConsPros+Awesome, over the top action. All the explosions you could ask for+Nice graphics+Great auto and manual save system+Controls feel good (use a controller to play!)+Fantastic variety of environments+Solid variety of enemies. (Possessed enemies are recycled)+Weapon combos are cool+Good game length. Not too short or long.+Rewarded for the small amount of exploring you can do+60fps throughoutCons +No graphics options?! (Just resolution and full screen toggle)+Magic powers felt weak, cost too much Mana+Puzzles could be more challenging+Camera at times can be frustrating+Slightly repetitiveWorth the $5 asking price and a “must buy” if it’s on some type of sale or in a bundle. I had a great time playing Marlow Briggs. The gripes I had are easily overlooked by the crazy action everywhere. 8/10 Very good			"

												I got this for $1 in a sale a while back.Best $1 I ever spent.It's pretty much God of War, but if Kratos was a stereotypical tough black dude who bantered with a crazy skull mask.Sometimes the gameplay shifts from hack-and-slash to turret segments, or like... Weird rope-dangling bits. In any other game it'd be jarring, but there's a certain level of QUALITY that this game brings that makes it all fine.THIS SUMMER.You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll contemplate over what it truly means to be alive.Marlow Briggs stars in: ""The Mask of Death""			"

												Awesomely good God of War rip-off that knows it's a ripoff and quickly moves past it. The cutscenes are unintentionally hilarious and it only makes the game even more enjoyable. You will be shocked at the strange combination of hilariously bad story and unironically amazing gameplay. You'll love every minute of it. Honestly, I give it a ten outta ten.			"

												Playing Marlow Briggs is playing through a walking paradox. No game with this small a budget should look this good, no game with this small a team should PLAY this good, and no premise as absurd as this should work as well as it does. Yes, it's short, but it's also dirt cheap, and the four hours I spent on this game alone make it an incredibly worthwhile experience. It's funny, amazingly well paced, looks great and has some suprisingly good combat for being a God of War clone. It's a game I think everyone should play at least 20 minutes of, so they can see and bask in the glory of Marlow ♥♥♥♥ing Briggs. What i'm trying to say is that you should play this game because it's really damn good.			"

												I haven't written a review on Steam before, but with this game I thought it was necessary. I haven't even finished the game yet and I already know this was a good purchase. It's a pretty basic Hack n' Slash game, the combat and combo system actually feels a lot like Dante's Inferno on the PS3/XBox 360. The storyline is mediocre and the dialog is pretty cheesy at times, but this isn't what the game is about. This game is about ridiculousness and knowing it's ridiculous with simple and satisfying combat. Plus it has James Hong (the Chinese Samuel L. Jackson) as the bad guy! Definitely worth the $4.99! If I had to rate it 1-10 for what it is - 7.5/10			"

												This game has some BAD pacing issues. Leaves a lot of questions about what the hell is going on. The game looks absolutely beautiful. Outside of some terrible platforming and a bit of repetition in the enemies, the gameplay is just fantastic. Combos feel good to pull off and attacks have a strong weight to them. I did enjoy the back and forth dialogue between Marlow and the mask quite a bit. Like God of War, but more goofy and campy and much, much less edgelord angry.			"

Because both games are considered to combine Hack´n Slay with Jump-Run Elements qith an intense Storyline - which i like very much.If case you´ve already know Enslaved - i would gave Marlow Briggs a 7,5 of 10 and Enslaved a 8,5. Marlow Briggs forcing more the Combat Elements - it has drastic more moves an combos than enslaved. So if you like a more action an even more difficult jump and run elements, it should be worth a try for you.			"

												Portrayed as a God of War Clone, Marlow Briggs is, indeed reusing most of god war mechanics.However, what makes this game great is the non stop Action and hilarious Dialogue reminiscent of a 90's action movie.Graphics are good, not nextgen proof, but still quite decent and definitly superior to other games with higher price tags. The levels presents a good number of different environments and thus prevent getting bored of the scenery.Also, you can rename the game title as ""Pierce and the Mask of Death"" because Marlow's voice actor (Arif S. Kinchen) has lso voiced a certain saint in a different game XDBest way to summarize it:Pierce get its own movie with Michael Bay in charge of the fight scenes and Crash bandicoot Mask ""Aku Aku"" as an hilarious sidekick!My advice: Play it! Beyond the fact that this game price is incredebly low, and regardless of your take on the story, the dialogue and actions will keep you entertained for the ride :D			"

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a moderately compitent spectacle fighter.My play time for the full game was roughly 7 hours.The game feels better with a gamepad though it features keyboard controls, On screen prompts will switch between Xbox 360 and Keyboard controls on the fly if you begin inputting from another source.The story follows the titular Marlow Briggs and his bound by death partner as they attempt to save his girlfriend... and the world. The game is made to be funny but some of the jokes mainly the ones said when the platforming mechanics fail and send you to your death fall flat.I can't say that Marlow Briggs gripped me to my seat and didn't let go but it was fun. There are some bugs and glitches some of which were caused me to have to reset my game but nothing really terrible. Pick it up on sale.			"

												Marlow Briggs is a fun game, action packed game with tongue-in-cheek B movie style humor and fun God of War style gameplay. Marlow Briggs isn't exactly breaking any new ground however a good game doesn't need to break new ground to be fun and an enjoyable experience. Sometimes it's the games that just want to have fun that make you enjoy your time with them the most. Marlow Briggs fits this description so aptly. The voice acting is decent but still has the cheese to really emphasize the B movie style. Marlow is actually voiced by Pierce from the Saints Row series. The combat is solid with a lot of combos. You're given the ability to do light and heavy hits, but there's no automatic counter attack button which means that you still need to pay attention to the game to win. The enemy variety is rather decent. You'll fight bugs, big guys who want to melee you and guys with rocket launchers and flamethrowers. The enemies are dispatched kind of simuilarly but the amount of combos at your disposal means that you can vary it up yourself. The game is about 6-8 hours in length depending on how you play. Overall an enjoyable experience and a steal for $5. Highly recommended.			"

												Kind of a cross between God of War and a 70s blaxploitation action flick: Marlow Briggs, firefighter, is visiting his girlfriend at a Mesoamerican dig site when he is murdered by her creepy boss with an impracical antique scythe. He awakens as the ""sacred warrior"", accompanied by an annoying talking mask, and must battle through hordes of mercenary mooks, jungles full of exploding bugs the size of dogs, scorpions the size of cars, and giant zombie warriors.Like its obvious antecedent God of War, it's a reasonably solid mix of platforming and button-mashing combat (long ""combos"" created through the light and heavy attack buttons, with four different weapons unlocked through the game), with occasional puzzles. As is often the case with this sort of design, it doesn't do any one thing particularly well -- the Arkham games ruined combat for everyone else, and it definitely gets repetitive here, and the platforming sequences are uninspiring make-work. There are also a number of strange mini-game sequences, e.g. manning a turret to shoot down helicopters and two instances of flying an aircraft in a particularly terrible Raiden-style top-down shooter. Where it really shines, though, like God of War, is as blockbuster spectacle -- a ""boss"" that's an enormous screen-filling sea monster, platforming through a collapsing mine etc. The story isn't much to write home about it but it provides a reason to hurtle from one explosive crisis to the next. It's entirely linear.The variety of environments and enemies is fairly good, though the game is relatively short (~6 hours). It's not stunningly polished; there are invisible walls everywhere, occasional issues with the controls etc.Some negative reviews here complain about checkpoint spacing, which I wuold agree with except that it appears to be possible to create your own checkpoint at any time with a quicksave from the menu.It's good fun and available so cheaply that it's well worth giving a go.

												Admit it.  We all loved God of War.  When those games first hit the market, videos games as an industry woul never be the same.  In a market that constantly demands innovation, development of new concepts and methods of interaction, it can be easy to forget how amazing certain tried and true formula can be.  I STILL love playing God of War...  and this game, is a shameless clone/update, call it what you will.  Graphically upated, and skinned in a different mythos, Kratos becomes Marlow.This games isn't promising anything revolutionary.  It also refuses to take itself seriously.  The production value is solid, the voice acting well done.  The narrator that is Marlow's ""spirit guide"" i suppose, is constantly making wise cracks.  I found the game delightful.Every time I wanted to put the controller down, it kept pulling me back in...  a familiar feeling.  It isn't perfect and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it brought back a play style and experience that I feel you don't find enough in modern gaming.  I think someone described it as being able to play a 90's action blockbuster....  fairly dead on.Get it on sale and you will not be dissapointed.  It's FUN.  Engaging and you will not have to think to hard.  Everyting in it takes place on an epic scale.  An abundance of great Mini-games too.I am not finished with the game at this point.  I did notice the absence of any MEGA boss fights (Kratos vs the hydra  or kraken) but perhaps those are to come.			"

												There are reviews out there saying that this game is one of those that is so bad that it's good. I don't know what they are smoking. Sure, given it's low price i can understand that many start the game with low expectations about it. But i found this game amazing, deserving well more than 5 bucks. As soon as you get to the main menu, you are greeted to one of the best epic main menu songs out there. Everytime i started the game, i couldn't help but listening to the music for at least 2 minutes. The rest of the music is ok, but this song makes up for all of them. Now speaking of the game, it's a ripoff of God of War, but a pretty good one. The story surely sucks, but there's plenty of funny dialog. The graphics are decent and the game is surprisingly well optimized for PC. Now speaking of the gameplay, it's mostly an Hack and Slash. There's a light and a heavy attack that you can combo, and a grab, block and jump buttons. There's 4 weapons and 5 magic powers that you collect, and they all play differently. You can also upgrade them. The combat is good, with a solid variety of enemy types and bosses, but blocking feels a bit off because you can't block in the middle of an attack, so you'll be evading most of the time. Besides combat, there are also sections of platforming (those could be better), puzzle solving, evading obstacles, 3D shooting and top down shooting. Together, it'll last about 6 hours, and if you are like me, you'll play right again on the hardcore difficulty, which isn't really that hard except for some encounters later in the game. For it's price, it has a good lenght. And you can also replay some challenges from the story in the menu with leaderboards, but for me only the first time was added. Probably a bug, but didn't care much about it. And there's also a minigame in the credits, which sucks but lets you skip the credits the faster you complete it. It was a nice addition to finish the game. In the end, the game isn't brilliant, but surprisingly good given it's price, and you should definitely get it if you're a fan of Hack and Slash games. And one sale, it's a steal.			"

Marlow Briggs is objectively an easy Hack'n'Slash with simple platforming and outdated graphics game. But don't judge so quickly it might have a linear storyline yet you encounter and experience the wildest things from hanging upside down on a helicopter to fighter a huge fish God. All while you try to save the ""Princess"" with your mask companion, who will bring all mental encouragement you need. Warning though some people might not enjoy the dialog, which is filled with cheesy comments, but also with funny comments of the ancient mask, who will tell you all about the Aztec culture and just generally comment in a funny way on what happening.Like I said earlier gameplay is fairly simple and you unlock 4 different weapons and 4 different spells plus a ranged attack as you progress. You also have a lot of time the possibility to mash the ""E"" button or the ""B"" button, if playing on a controller, which I found to be superior to the keyboard controls, but none the less you can play with keyboard, you'll be at a slight disadvantage against later enemies though. To no surprise, enemy variety is not that high, up until the last third of the game, where you encounter most of the bosses and harder enemies.Overall a very cheap and cheesy, but very fun game, if you enjoy over the top stupid games. Recommended!			"

I would then restart and play for another 45 minutes. Reinstalls and verifying integrity did not fix it. But for .99 the amount of fun I had made the technical glitches worth it.

												Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a surprisingly fun God of War clone. It has lots of over-the-top action, enormous bosses, flashy fights, colorful graphics, and a great sense of scale. And it's legitimately funny too.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death doesn't do anything new; it's essentially a God of War knockoff in a modern-day setting. But it succeeds at what it sets out to do, and the action and absurd setpieces never let up. Other God of War clones like Dante's Inferno started strong, only to peak early. Marlow Briggs avoids this pitfall by constantly throwing bigger and bigger stuff at the player. This game can be ridiculous at times, but in way that will put a smile on your face.Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a blatant copy. But it's a highly entertaining one. Check it out.			"

												Marlow Briggs is an action platformer, with an amateurish art style (mostly the lighting, and unrealistic physics and animations) reminiscient of AAA PC games from the late 90s and early 00s, or more recent XBLA and PSN titles.  Cheesy dialogue, goofy plot and villains, you name it... its like a blast from the past.Those comments may sound like criticism -- they're not, really.  Marlow Briggs is fun, and worth every penny.  Just don't go into it expecting the kind of drama you get from major titles -- it's not there.  What is there, is campy fun, and lots of explosions, deflecting rockets back at the bad guys with your magic scythe (which makes more explosions), executing brutal combos on bad guys while exploding more stuff off them and then throwing off the nearest cliff.  If you can appreciate that kind of over-the-top fun, you will enjoy Marlow Briggs.			"

												Marlow Briggs is satirical. I don't know if it intends to be, but it definitely is.This is basically a God of War clone. A well-executed, fun-to-play, efficiently built one. Every aspect of the game is enjoyable (though, in the case of the story, enjoyable for all the wrong reasons), and it's worth the money. Just don't expect the level of polish you'd find in a God of War game.Expect a God of War level story, though. It's just as ridiculous and laughable, but I think it's a self-aware ridiculousness. The mechanics and graphics are both good enough and consistent enough, and the game is a lot of fun. It's a little rough around the edges, but Marlow is worth trying to keep a straight face through.It's also nice to see some love paid to another mythology. We see a lot of European and Japanese mythos paid homage in games, but it's not so common to see something from the ancient Americas.			"

												Describing Marlow Briggs to someone would be easy. It’s an over the top, in your face action and comedic hack and slash. I definitely enjoyed my playthrough of it. You play as Marlow, trying to save your girlfriend, Eva, after she is taken hostage to decipher some ancient codices. I was quite surprised with the range of environments that you are taken through. They are nicely done too and feel full and rich.An odd thing to point out, but I will. The game sets up the “camera” to be the Mask of Death following you around. Or at least that’s how I interpreted it. Reminded me of how Mario 64 implied the Lakitu Brothers were “filming you” during gameplay. Since we are on the camera, there is a love/hate relationship with it. The camera is FIXED and you cannot control it. This can, and is, used to hide secrets and extra experience points that are out of view until you explore a little. Generally, it’s good and doesn’t get in the way. But on occasion, especially during battle, it will not let you see where the enemy is. It also tended to lag behind if I started moving too fast. The multiple rope swinging segments are brought to mind where this happened. In the end, it wasn’t too much of a nuisance.Marlow Briggs is extremely linear. I don’t mind this at all in games, but I know this is a personal preference. There are invisible walls everywhere and you cannot explore much outside your destined path. I say can’t explore “much” because you can go in little crevices and off camera areas that give you experience. It definitely rewards you for doing what little exploring you can. Controls feel relatively tight during combat and responsive during the many platforming segments. I would highly recommend a controller to play this game. It was released on the 360 and it shows. The mouse and keyboard controls are awkward and I immediately switched to a controller. The game switches seamlessly between the two, which is appreciated.Marlow can upgrade and acquire a few more weapons and magic powers throughout the playthough. You can switch quickly and easily between them for whatever situation you’re in. I tended to stick with the weapon that was on a chain for a majority of the game after I acquired it. It’s the only ranged weapon and felt the most safe using it. It was also easy to break out of a combo and dodge an enemy attack. The magic powers are visually cool, but consistently felt underpowered. They were expensive to use (Mana) and would usually not even kill the smaller enemies. I wish they were quite a bit more powerful or used less Mana. Saving is spectacular. Tons of auto-saves and you can save manually at any point. I always love to see this in games. Graphically the game is quite good! I found myself taking a lot of screenshots because of the really nice looking environments I was in. However, there are NO graphics options to play around with. You get to choose your resolution and if it’s full screen or not. That’s it… Sound and music is good. I felt some of the epic songs got tired since they were used a lot during the cut scenes.Let’s get to the Pros and ConsPros+Awesome, over the top action. All the explosions you could ask for+Nice graphics+Great auto and manual save system+Controls feel good (use a controller to play!)+Fantastic variety of environments+Solid variety of enemies. (Possessed enemies are recycled)+Weapon combos are cool+Good game length. Not too short or long.+Rewarded for the small amount of exploring you can do+60fps throughoutCons +No graphics options?! (Just resolution and full screen toggle)+Magic powers felt weak, cost too much Mana+Puzzles could be more challenging+Camera at times can be frustrating+Slightly repetitiveWorth the $5 asking price and a “must buy” if it’s on some type of sale or in a bundle. I had a great time playing Marlow Briggs. The gripes I had are easily overlooked by the crazy action everywhere. 8/10 Very good			"

												Not a bad little game, if you don't have a rig strong enough to emulate PS2, this might be your closest chance to play God of War. Starts up a bit on the easy side, but some fight later on can be quite challenging. The combat system is well rounded, so is the enemy design. Transitions between levels could be handled with more grace, and the game acctually could use some quiet time - it's non stop crazy action. Overall, I had a lot of fun with it. Like a good popcorn action flick, highly reccomended considering the price. Acctually I belive it's worth ten buck instead of 5, price cuts notwithstanding.P.S. The person responsible for choosing the screenshots for the storefront did a terrible job, after the first (kinda borign) location, which is the source of all the screenshots, the game acctually looks really good.

												A decent game. I put around 3 hours into it which is about half way through because according to howlongtobeat.com it takes 6 hours to finish the game.It's a hack and slash game with a variety of weapons and some magic abilities. The combat is fun but can get repetitive when you are just spam clicking and using shift to dodge. The game looks pretty decent for the age and price and there is a ongoing story throughout the game. There are also some puzzle elements but they are quite simple and shouldn't cause too many problems, if at all.My only complaint is the camera. You don't control the camera, it moves around automatically as the character moves so it will swing around and adjust itself automatically so it can get a bit disorientating.Overall it's a pretty decent game, especially at the price. It's just not for me but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it.			"

												This game deserves way more than the 5$ charged for it.Imagine the best of the Uncharted series (platforming, cinematics, likeable characters with good writing) being combined with the best of Ninja Gaiden (fluid combos, aerial flourishes, sick sweeps and effective ranged shuriken throws). It is relentless in its action and never takes a deep breath. You are constantly on the move and even after killing a boss you're immediately thrust back into the fray with some sort of epic escape sequence or intense battle with a group of challenging grunts.This is a good blend of platform and action and for five dollars it's a ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Should be in any action fan's library.			"

												Only recommend on deep sale.This is a decent-but-flawed hack & slash game. Combat is good, even though weapons lack impact (except the hammer) and hit detection isn't always precise. Platforming is frustrating due to bad camera, leading to frequent cheap deaths.There could be some game breaking bugs. The camera once pulled away until I can't see the character and all other models weren't loaded. In another stage, the character fell through the floor and die. These bugs aren't permanent though. After restarting the game, they're gone.You can max out every weapon and skill on the first run, so no replay value.It's less than a dollar on sale, so it's not bad for its price. The game runs smoothly on my PC.My PC: i7-6700, GTX 1060 (6GB), RAM 32GB, Windows 10 64 bit			"

												Marlow Briggs is one of those games that refuses to take a moment to catch its breath. There's always something going on, you're always moving on to the next section, no intermissions or results screens.That being said, Marlow Briggs is really, REALLY engaging. In the first 20 minutes, you go through a handful of large areas and beat up more than a dozen enemies with the power of your newly acquired ancient aztec weaponry before fighting the first boss, which suddenly changes the core gameplay from a hack-and-slash to an on-rail shooter.With a bang, you're given a new toy to play with and are sent flying from the boss arena to the next part of the game, where more enemies lie in wait for you to combo to death, along with a variety of slightly clunky platforming and puzzle solving.Rinse and repeat for 6 hours.9/10			"

												Okay, this is a fun game for a few bucks, but don't play full price. The story is B movie, which actually makes it kind of funny because it is so bad, but the action is alright. Limited combos, limited number of enemies, and not much exploration. Just a hack and slash style game. You can level up multiple specials and to keep the combat fresh you end up with 4 different types of weapon. I ended up just using the original weapon and the heavy weapon. Combos are pretty responsive and you can interrupt using a dodge. The only really poor thing IMO is that you cannot control the camera. Overall the game manages the camara pretty well, but I would have preferred the ability to control it myself. Fun game on sale, pretty short (about 6 hours).			"

												I can't really add to the things that have been said before, just giving this my thumbs up. Great action game, extremely similar to God of War, ridiculously cheap for what it offers (I bought it 0.99 on sale). No idea how I never heard of this up until now, but I am glad I stumbled upon it. I had the time of my life. Not only is it a great action/hack n' slash game, it also incorporates a variety of different gameplay sequences like, for example, events similar in gameplay to bullet-hell video games. As I said above, can't really add anything new to the positives that others have mentioned before me. I just wanted to add another positive review to the mix, since these guys deserve it.  "

												I've played this game for 2.9 hours so far and, no kidding, it's crashed and closed on me about 8 times now. Luckily, it autosaves often, loads up again quickly and when the game is running, it runs smoothly without lag. So, I don't know what's causing the crashes, but it's not the end of the world.Game itself is alright. Easy achievements. It's a decent price for what it is, and I got it even cheaper on a sale, so great. It's just a regular hack and slash game in which you can't control the camera angle, similar in feel to Darksiders and DmC. Not incredible, but kills time nonetheless.			"

												Best game I got for 0,99 Cents. Above average god of war / castlevania clone, very linear levels but decent, diverse action oriented gameplay with running, (good) tower gunning, slashing, mini-puzzles and platforming sequences aswell as entertaining humor. Decently polished game and fun hidden gem. Some fights are a bit on the frustrating side, but overall it's pretty good. The surroundings and boss monsters are a bit dated but still look pretty cool!			"
