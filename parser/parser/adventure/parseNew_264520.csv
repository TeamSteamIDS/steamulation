												A game where pretty much everything went wrong.It's impossible to discuss Moebius without sounding cruel, but they say honesty is its own reward, so here we go.First of all, the game is hideous. Not just ""not very pretty"", not ""outdated"", but positively hideous. The kitschy 2D art is sort of acceptable if you close one eye; the poor 3D models and inexplicably terrible animations, however, are not. Either the artists are aliens who never saw a real human being, or they are simply people stuck doing a job they have absolutely no talent for. The ugliness permeating the game is unbearable.But okay, looks aren't everything; let's be mature and look past that. How does it play? Well, badly. Everything is stilted, unresponsive and seems to be plodding through a thick layer of mud; even the simplest actions take half an eternity punctuated by random pauses. And speaking of actions, let's discuss puzzles. By and large, they are oversimplified to a point that's almost insulting, and yet still manage to make little to no sense:1. There is an object lying in the corner of a dark alley. Malachi will happily come right next to it, but won't pick it up, because it's too dark, and you need to fix a streetlamp first. It's a brick.2. A cut lanyard is fixed with superglue. Lanyard. Superglue. Seriously.A bizarre addition to the traditional formula is that Malachi won’t pick up objects until he knows where he’d like to use them, with precisely one result: backtracking guaranteed, which really doesn’t play nice with the lumbering pace of it all. And dear lord, the whole thing ends with an honest to goodness maze. In an adventure game. I thought the nineties taught us never to do that again, but apparently I was mistaken. So. Dull.But alright, alright, who cares about puzzles. Characters and story, that's what adventure games are all about! – Well, that is the worst thing. When I first learned what the overreaching plot was, I burst out laughing. Not because it is particularly funny, but because it is absolutely ludicrous. Sure, Gabriel Knight 3 and Gray Matter got sort of silly towards the end, but Moebius gets to that point about one third in and never stops going until it dissolves in a raging torrent of crazy (and painfully sexist to boot). And as far as characters are concerned, while I sort of want to appreciate the romance angle that’s going on in here, everyone in the game is so very wooden, whether it’s talking about the models, voice acting or writing, that it’s like watching two robots trying to learn what this “emotions” thing was all about. And failing, just like everything else in Moebius is wont to do.Oh, well. I backed this on Kickstarter; clearly, nobody's perfect.			"

												Moebius is not as bad some of the reviews say but it’s not that good either, it’s a bog-standard adventure game that does very little to make itself memorable. It’s a real disappointment considering this is Jane Jensen’s newest game. Jensen’s previous games, the Gabriel Knight series and the more recent Gray Matter, were quality written games with likable characters that got you immersed in the games and their stories and are some of the best adventure games around. Moebius is not this, while the basic plot is interesting enough at first the main characters are really bland and the side characters are all horrible people but not in an interesting way. The puzzles are alright for the most part, but the last section of the game is a terrible slog of padding and occasional trial and error puzzles. The graphics aren’t good, but they were on a budget so I can easily forgive it. I didn’t run into any glitches so it’s solidly designed in that regard.Ultimately I don’t really regret buying it, but I wouldn’t recommend it. There are more than enough  recent adventure games that are far better that you could play instead. (Broken Age, the Blackwell Series, Kentucky Route Zero, Gone Home, Walking Dead, and Wolf Among Us just to name a few) Not to mention that you’re also better off playing the Gabriel Knights and Gray Matter, the former you can buy on GOG, the latter on both GOG and Steam. You can do a lot worse when it comes to adventure games so I would only suggest getting this game if you’re really hurting for adventure games and it’s on sale for cheap. Overall though Moebius is just really mediocre and easily forgettable; for the average person I’d say skip it.			"

												Moebius: Empire Rising is a (relatively) new adventure game by Jane Jensen. If you've played Jensen's previous games (e.g. Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter), then you might have certain (high) expectations.If you are a Jane Jensen fan, you probably won't be (too) disappointed. Her signature strengths are mostly here. The game has many flaws, but they will likely be tolerated by most.Additionally, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, you are even more likely to appreciate this, as there are numerous similarities (e.g. likable antisocial lead with high intelligence and observational prowess, awkward bromance with sidekick).If you are unfamiliar with Jane Jensen but like adventure games, then (assuming you even exist) this might not be the best place to start unless you can get it cheap. Also, you should be aware that this, like other Jensen stories, are, uh, somewhat ""metaphysical"" in nature. If you need a game to be squarely constrained by generally accepted physical laws of reality, then you might want to pass on this.GOOD* Good writing* Clever blend of real and fake history and current events* Great voice acting* Good music (though seems a bit inappropriate at times to me)* Great concept* Good story* (mostly) Good art (somewhat inconsistent)* Interesting 'analysis' puzzle concepts (but, can be frustrating sometimes)NEUTRAL* Old school point system* Mostly easy and straightforward, but some rough points* Mostly unoriginal puzzles* Hotkey to reveal interactive objects in scenes (except in the maze at the end) with intuitive radial interface* Hint system exists, but I haven't tried it* Low budget CG cutscenes, 3D models* Many ""missable"" achievementsBAD* Weak, inconsistent writing in places* Some terrible animations (e.g. Malachi's walking)* Needlessly frustrating maze puzzle at the end* Glitchy scripting, including some game breaking bugs (save often!)* Some interface glitches* Aforementioned bugs have gone unresolved for over a year, new bugs were added with post-release updates* At least one broken achievementParting thought - I can't help feel that this could have been a much better game. But, I enjoyed it. There is also hope for the future as this seems quite open for additional titles in a series (though this title is quite self-contained).Disclosure: I received a copy of this game as a gift from a friend (thanks!)

												Moebius is an entertaining and decently good point n' click game that lacks a lot of polish. Jane Jensen's story is bit silly but interesting. Robert Holme's music is fantastic but bit repeatitive. The gameplay is little bit disappointing because of the narrow amount of choises you can make. Moebius feels like a simplified and slightly modernized version of those 90s point n' click adventure games that we all grew up with. The length of the game is around 10 to 15 hours for an average player.I liked the characters in the game and I liked the story. Althought I do have to write that Jane Jensen in past has written better material than this. There're issues with the narrative that feel stupid after you've played the game though. And even during the game you occasionally wonder why certain things had to be done in a particular way.Moebius is a fairly basic point n' click game that doesn't do anything particularly well or bad. It's like it was made following a googled tutorial on how to make a point n' click adventure game. It doesn't add anything new or even try to challenge the existing concepts.Most of the puzzles in Moebius are fairly easy to figure out. There's usually only one route to take to a puzzle and only one solution for that puzzle exists. Sometimes the solution is rather unrealistic. To avoid making Moebius a ""hidden object"" game and to add some realism into it the game doesn't allow you to pick up items or go to some places until the need to do so arises. That leads to an issue where you need to remember place of certain items you previously couldn't pick up. Occasionally there are more challenging puzzles that are well written. The main character also has infinite pockets to stuff things to which I thought was amusing.Towards the ending of the Moebius started to fell apart. For example (without spoiling anything) the player needs to fly from Washington to New York to pick alcohol from a bar the main character has contantly refused to enter into any given point of time during the game. There's nothing indicating you need to do so. I don't even understand why there couldn't be alcohol store at Washington player could enter. This is done so because main character thought that the antique item in his shop he saw earlier would still be there and that he needed to pick that up for a certain character. This is done based upon observation of that character's tastes. And so upon exiting antique store main character thought that he would also need to bring alcohol seeing the bar on other side of the street. That is some truly horrible game writing and game design in my opinion.Graphics in Moebius are decent and I like the art style. But this is probably a good point to start talking about the bugs. Moebius has lots of bugs. None of those bugs break the game and they're mostly just visual annoyances. Such as main character is able to stand on certain places he isn't supposed to be able to stand. Or certain water effects are places on surfaces where they shouldn't be. Occasionally the animations have timing problems. Sometimes there are texture related issues such as really low resolution textures. None of the visual issues are dramatically bad. It's just a sign of a lack of polish in Moebius.Music and audio is good and there are lots of nice music. However sometimes the main theme just repeats itself so much that it's the only thing you'll remember after you've played the game. This is due the fact that the main theme is also present in various tracks in a suttle ways. So even if I do like the main theme quite a bit, it became an annoyance to hear so often during the game. Sometimes there were audio tracks where the mixing had failed. Voice acting in this game is decently played out.User Interface of the Moebius is weird but it works. There are no ""verbs"" which makes the game easier to play since the game always offers only the actions you can do with various points of interest. Moebius is designed towards people who have little or no experience with point n' click adventure games. The way UI has been designed and the strong hint system in this game reflects that. I also thought it was weird that the game didn't have end results screen despite counting points in a similar manner to the classic Sierra adventure games all which have the end results screen.Technically the game works fine most of the time. But being based on top of Unity Engine has all the good things and all the issues that come with the Unity Engine. For example the game has freezing issues on certain hardware. But those can be corrected with a launch parameter. And sometimes the rendering quality is pretty bad.To sum things up, Moebius is entertaining game which is fun to play. The story is interesting but sometimes badly written. I liked the main characters and would like to see more of their adventures in the future. Moebius as a game also severely lacks polish and fine tuning. It's worth the cost but it's not outstanding game like Gabriel Knight or Gray Matter.			"

												I consider myself a big fan of Jane Jensen's and classical adventure games in general (as you can probably tell by my choice of the Steam avatar), but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. It rehashes all the  adventure game tropes and clichés (not in a good way) and much of the puzzle design is flawed or illogical. Most crucially, though,I found myself getting bored with the plot and couldn't care enough to keep playing. I never got to finish the game as much as I wanted to because it felt like a waste of time. It simply wasn't fun or engaging enough. In a genre of games that specializes in storytelling, I'd say that's a big minus. The characters (especially the main character Malachi Rector) are unlikeable, the dialogues are uninspired, and the animation is stilted. For the longest time, I seriously wondered to myself if the main character was supposed to be a hunchback by design because of his very unnatrual-looking posture. It turned out it was just bad character modeling. You'd think they would invest some time and effort in designing him to at least NOT look like a disabled person. He's only the protagonist of the game. That you have to stare at for the ENTIRE duration of the game.In the meantime, I will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of GK 20th Anniversary Edition.My verdict: 2/5			"

												I made a negative review about this game elsewhere prior to fully completing the story and I'm kinda sad that I did. The game's technical issues which are glaringly obvious when you first start the game gradually got better along the way. The story takes a little bit to actually get going but it is decent. With that being said though, the horrible animation (walking animations, climbing, talking etc.) really takes away from what is quite a decent game to play. I think some of the smaller bugs will be fixed over time (eg: cursor disappearing, skipping dialog causing the characters to move in fast forward etc) but overall the game was enjoyable.Malachi is not very likeable, the voice actor is really good at what he does in other roles (Omid from Walking Dead Season 1/2) and a few characters from LoL for example but he seemed really flat in this particular role which was disappointing. It's not a groundbreaking story to tell but it's definitely a decent one for the genre :)			"

												Do you like good games? Then this game is not for you. Do you like demented puzzles and being annoyed out of your pants? Then this game IS for you. Ironically, though, I have no doubt whether to recommend it or not - I enjoyed it, a lot. Guess it's a question of what you're looking for. If you're looking for Cesar Bittar, by jove you've found him. It is obviously a game developed solely by him without any involvement of that pesky Jane Jensen whatsoever. Or at least by Phoenix Online, and not by Pinkerton Road at all. Pay attention. If you're looking for, say, cool characters, then you should marry it - Malachi and David are amazing, and everything that concerns them is done brilliantly. From the beginning of their friendship through all the shunning of Gretchen to the pointed indifference to Amble it's downright adorable, sincere and applauds-inducing. And man, I love these straight to the point dialogues where characters are saying the most logical things that suit the situation. I can't say enough just how perfectly it is done. It was  a pure enjoyment and a crate of marbles in a world of pervasive bureaucracy and Leisure Suit Larry remakes.Unlike everything else in the game. The story? Have you heard of the world's silliness contest of '72? Where Helen Slapps was standing on one leg on a frozen turkey with a thrashing fish in her mouth and an open urn of ashes on her head, and playing a triangle? It was waaay less silly than the plot of Moebius. The puzzles? Oh, don't even start about the puzzles. When I was flying back to Chicago from New Orleans because I forgot to pack my toothbrush, that was painful. And this game made me relieve the experience. Honestly, the only good thing about them is that they're easier than the ones in The Walking Dead. The graphics? You know you have issues when you visit New York, Venice and Zurich, and the only pretty place is still a bar in New York.The music? Well, there were some niceish pieces, but nothing comparable to Gray Matter.The technical issues? I thought it's good pairing when characters are walking through one another on a regular basis.I must say, it IS a Jane Jensen's game, mainly meaning that it's amazingly written and tries to tackle metaphysical issues with a healthy dose of excitement and a pinch of old fashioned naivety. It is worth your playthrough. It's good like that. It's just you'll have to put up with its♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there're surprisingly big amounts for a game you can complete in ten hours. So there. Scratch what I said, don't marry it. It will ruin your life.			"

												Firstly, I'll begin by stating that I am an avid Jane Jensen fan and was a backer for Moebius ER.As for my review, I'll begin from the positives:* The story is great. It’s mature and somewhat relevant to real global events and pulls you right in the mood for a grand mystery.* Malachi is a TERRIFIC main character! He’s well-written, multi-dimensional and evolving through the story… (I was hunting for all the hotspots just to hear what he had to say about them!)* Another thing about Malachi… His VA (Owen Thomas) hit the role out of the ballpark! His was the best performance in the game by far. He MADE the character, not unlike Tim Curry made Gabriel Knight.* David is also a great sidekick to Kye, and there’s a great chemistry between the two.* Robert Holmes, again, paired the game seamlessly with a terrific Soundtrack, ranging from mysterious ambient themes to action-packed thrilling rock pieces.* The multiple locals are diverse and beautifully rendered and colorful on most chapters.* The game is pretty long and will take an average player from 9 to 12 hours to complete, depending on how long you’ll get stuck.Now to the cons:* Some characters’ body proportions and / or postures are way off, too bad one of those characters is the main one.* Animations are ranging from mediocre to bad.* They are also unbearably slow, esp. when there are multiple animations performed in a row.* The music is sometimes too loud and you have to rely on the subtitles. (The prison scene and some movies towards the end come to mind).* The subtitles going up from the bottom of the screen and flying out again is annoying and straining on the eyes, especially during short sentences.* Some puzzles felt too simple and the game “held your hand” while solving them. (Sometimes getting stuck is a good thing in an adventure game!) "

												Jane Jensen is a master not just with intelligent plotlines (which sadly is rare in adventure games) but is also the master of storytelling and editing.  Giving succinct but a lot of valuable information in various ways as to never be boring and, if you are like me, learn a lot while having a heap of fun at the same time.The storyline background was art history and the unfolding plot was about Moebius Theory (there are the same patterns throughout history, everything repeats itself)   Your character is an antiques dealer who becomes involved with an organisation that wants his insight into a few people.  You investigate each character which have information points, once you collect all the points you solve a puzzle by comparing these character's facts with historical figures.  Along the way, we see how the Moebius Theory unfolds through him personally and the people he is investigating.Each chapter is usually in a different country, but with only about 2-3 places to visit in each country, you don't get lost and it is very easy to go back and forth via a map if you miss something, thus minimising or eliminating the need for hints (which this game does have) or a walkthrough.  There are a few puzzles but even with the  obligatory maze at the end  there are logical clues.Glitches in the achievements have been fixed, they all now work.Now to the not so great:-  Artwork - sometimes is in the just OK range - The multi-step inventory, I could have done without the 'envelope' icon and just use the interactive icon when I wanted to use an item.- Main character is plain 'I want to bonk him in the head' annoying.  He does improve a bit as gameplay progresses but not quickly enough to care about what happens to him till near the end, where there is a redeemable characteristic.  In Gabriel Knight the main character was a sexist pig at times but he also was a lovable rogue.  Sherlock Holmes was very loyal and really nice to people he found interesting.  House M.D over time, was very loyal and cared in his own way to people in his life.  This game isn't long enough to develop a ""House"" type character.Overall I loved it, preferring the storyline and plot over GK and Grey Matter.  Maybe if Jensen had more unlimited funding it would have been a longer more involved game in every way than GK and even Contradiction.   But, it's still a really good game, good puzzles, great plot, dialogue and well worth playing.  I really recommend it.			"

												Moebius: Empire Rising is a point and click adventure game by Jane Jensen and published by Phoenix Online Studios. If you aren’t familiar with the name Jane Jensen, she is one of the big names in adventure games from back when adventure games were the showcase genre of the PC who are still working primarily in that  genre.  I don’t want to go all auteur theory, but Jensen’s is important because Moebius is recognizably the kind of game she’s been making for the last couple decades. There’s a pulpy, melodramatic concept and story. There are some continually repeated minigames that are too simplistic but seem like they could be great with a little more work. There’s an annoying maze area that should have been cut entirely from the game. Basically, fans of Gray Matter will probably like this. For those who haven’t played Gray Matter, some more explanation is probably needed.Moebius is traditional in design, to the point of being predictable.  You pick up objects, and use them on other objects in a, hopefully, logical way to advance the plot. The only change to the standard gameplay is that Moebius only lets you pick things up when the puzzle requiring them has been reached. So you can’t just pick up a boat pole and carry it around for no reason, unlike the kleptomaniacs who starred in the adventure games of old. Occasionally you need to guess passwords, but this is usually done by selecting the password from a drop-down menu, there is one that you enter manually, so the passwords aren’t fundamentally different from finding and using items. The passwords also provided the best example of how the game is too eager to keep thing moving for the puzzles to be really engaging, Late in the game there is a password that involves using cryptography to decode the password hint. You’re provided with various keys and three methods of encryption and decryption to figure out the password.  It could have been an interesting exercise in figuring out how to use the different methods. Instead you’re brought to an interface that applies the encryption for you. All that the player is left to do is apply the cipher and copying down the decrypted message. A shorter way to put it, this is one of maybe three that I’ve managed to complete without a walkthrough.The game isn’t all item puzzles and passwords, though. There are two minigames intended to emulate the classic “Sherlock scan” and the comparison of modern and historical people respectively. In the Sherlock Holmes minigame you’re given different qualities of a person, like “shifty eyes,” and then select one of three options for what it tells you about that person. This isn’t inherently a bad idea, but these options always break down the same way. One is an obvious joke option, one is relevant but doesn’t actually relate to a character trait, and one just flat-out tells you some character trait of the person you’re analyzing. Comparing people to historical figures is probably the biggest disappointment of the game. You are given a list of traits and next to each of these traits are the historical figures who had those traits, then you need to figure out which of the historical figures shares the most traits. So if someone has seven traits in common with Eli Whitney and one in common with Chuang Zi, you need to sigh deeply and imagine what could have been. It really should have been an exercise in comparing and contrasting information is instead a test of whether you can count. The story is very much in line with the goofy-but-sincere gothic melodrama that Jane Jensen usually does. Malachi Rector (keep in mind that Jensen’s Gray Matter featured a character who wore a literal Phantom of the Opera mask without a trace of irony) is asked by a mysterious quasi-governmental organization named FITA (which was sadly changed from the far more appropriate FIST) to determine if the life of a recently murdered woman resembles any historical figures. After carrying out his mission, he is attacked by ninjas, who photograph his passport, and finds out that he is the center of various conspiracies and so it goes. I don’t want to expand on the plot too much, because people hate spoilers. I will say that if you’re a fan of Jorge Louis-Borges, you might be disappointed, as it’s nothing as clever as that. It is a very entertaining pulp sci-fi story that has a lot of genuinely well done moments, and runs with its central conceit fairly well. I really thought the story was a strong point of the game, except for one problem.The problem with the story is Malachi Rector. He is a whiny, entitled, self-righteous, narcissistic, judgmental prick. They were obviously trying to emulate the BBC Sherlock, with Malachi as the insufferable genius who everyone needs despite his grating personality. They even tried to emulate the look of the BBC Sherlock in many of the cutscenes, with floating text to represent Malachi’s analysis of the situation. The BBC Sherlock has a couple of advantages, however. First, that has Watson around to look at the camera and sympathize with the viewer, and, second, Sherlock is not the viewpoint character and you get an occasional break from him. The Watson in Moebius is so bland I’ve entirely forgotten his name and Malachi is the viewpoint character for most of the game, which means almost everything the game tells you is passed along by him; this is a problem when most people will want to punch Malachi in the face every time he speaks. I don’t think it kills the story completely. If you keep in mind that he’s supposed to be unlikeable, it’s actually hilarious what a ♥♥♥♥♥ he is.Graphically, it’s exactly what you see on the screenshots and video above. It’s got a nice stylized design intended to conceal the low quality of the models, the animation is a little off at times. Overall, I think it works well, when it works. The engine for Moebius, like Cognition, the previous game from this Phoenix Online, has a tendency to suddenly pitch a fit every so often and the character models starts flopping around, an absent character remains a hot spot in the level, or the game just locks up. I don’t want to exaggerate this too much, I had four or five noticeable issues in the nine hours I spent playing the game. Three were cosmetic and only one, when the game locked up, required me to restart the game from an earlier save. I’d advise you to save often, though, in case the game does suddenly freeze on you. To sum up, I may have accentuated the negative a little too much here. Moebius is a nicely traditional, if overly easy, point and click adventure game with an interesting plot that is partly kneecapped by unlikeable characters, oversimplified puzzles, and the occasional bugs. That sounds bad when you put them all together like that, but I really do recommend it if you like the genre. If you’re not a fan of point and click adventure games, this probably isn’t the best place to start. Maybe try the Blackwell games or Gemini Rue or something first.   "

												7/10Although the puzzles were all rather easy, the story was intriguing enough to play to the end. It’s not as bad as many of the reviewers make it sound.I want to address a few point I’ve seen in some reviews:-This is not as good as Gabriel Knight.Yes, we all love the GK series, but let’s not forget you had to put tape on a fence to get cat hairs to make into a moustache. Moebius is not GK, it’s different. Both have good and bad points, but it’s unfair to compare a current game with your memory of how good another game was.-Malachi is not likeable.He’s human. If you stopped to consider his character and what he has been through and seen, it’s easy to see how he became “not likeable.” I didn’t find this a hindrance to the game at all. More importantly, his character evolves over the course of the game, which is lacking in many games.-Animations/graphics/character models suck.They aren’t Final Fantasy graphics, but they serve their purpose. They’re obviously much better than GK3 graphics, and everyone loved that game. Yes, smoother graphics would’ve been nice, but it’s not game-breaking.-The game is buggy.There were some bugs. They recently released a patch which was supposed to fix many of them. The bugs I encountered weren’t game breaking; just skipped animations. But personally, I feel that bugs in an adventure game are less forgiving than other genres. You don’t want to feel like “maybe I can’t solve this puzzle because there’s a bug.” So minus points on this lack of polish.Now on to the positives:+ The story was interesting, and I liked how you had to make connections with historical people. The game (like all of Jensen’s) was well researched and I felt that I came out of the game with new ideas or thoughts, which is more than can be said of many games. + The puzzles were a bit on the easy side, and some were illogical (or just time wasters) but for the most part, they made sense.I know I spent more time addressing negatives than adding positives, but overall, I thought the game was good. Not superb, but not half as bad as a lot of the reviews made it sound. There was nothing really ground-breaking with the game, but the story was strong enough to make it worth playing. "

												This is the latest game(2014)  from Jane Jensen, creator of the Gabriel Knight series, a classic sierra's adventure game made in the 90s. She made very interesting puzzles at the time, and some terrible ones, but the end result always won. Now, she comes back with a kickstarter project that begun in 2012 and came up in 2014, this time working independent, with little money of course, and a new small team of game devs called Phoenix online.The truth be told, when i first tried the game, the first impression was pretty shocking, and not in a good way... Of course this is a small team working, with a tiny budget, but still there are some things that can't be justified just because having little money. What i mean is, the first impression was bad, and yes, i am talking about the graphics first, because that's one of the first things that you take from a game, but its not the only thing, also the game was bad (aparently) meaning the puzzles, and even the main character was bad, alltough this could be atributed to his akward way of walking (little joke there).The thing is, the game starts to make some sense some time around the end of the third chapter (almost half of the whole game). The story starts to come around, there's this theory of moebius, of the pattern and these special persons (no spoilers here) and then the main character starts to develop, he becomes more interesting, he's having weird dreams and visions and it somehow relates to what is hapenning in the main story. The great music of Robert Holmes (creator of the gabriel knight soundtrack) comes in full force here, like in old times having some great moments, specially during the revelation moments. The puzzles, about analizing patterns and people starts to emerge  and it's something interesting to try and adds to the game. The graphics, still ugly, get somehow much more better, in terms of finishing and polish. It's like the game almost changes around the second half, and then you arrive at the last part of the game and all that diminishes somehow and you encounter the same problems, and the samethings from the first half.And that's the problem, right there, a double problem. First, you have no consistency. Because , i liked this game (in parts) , meaning at first i didn't like it, then yes, and then no. So, it's like i've been playing two different games in one. So you have great elements, interesting story, great music, some interesting puzzles, but not at first, and not at the end, so when the game starts you don't really want to play it that much, then if you have patience you reach the good part, and then...in the end, you are left with a bad impression, again.The second problem with this game is that, ive played it because i like (and knew) about past jane jensen's adventures, and i know what she is able to do in a game, and that's why i even continued playing this one after the start (and i did get my reward, i like this game) but if i didn't knew jane jensen was behind it i've probably wouldn't have tried it, and i don't see how people who are new to her would get interested in an adventure like this.It's a shame because i love adventure games, and i want to see the genre succeed (and it is coming back in these last years) but not with games like this. The genre has to move forward, have great production values have great game mechanics, be modern, be fun to everybody, played by everybody, not only hardcore adventure gamers (without stop being and adventure game), like for example the Sherlock Holmes games by frogwares. I liked Moebius, but i don't think it will appeal to people outside those who played old adventures games  (you can try fellow newcomer, but , you are warned) It's a shame also, because to be honest, this game's story has great potential, and i see why jane jensen would like to continue it. In fact, her previous adventure game from 2010, Gray matter, didn't have as good a story as this , and funnily enough, that game had better graphics than this one. But Moebius has in fact a greater a story, one that it has certain moments that are more close in spirit to the 90s era with gabriel knight. Even the music is more close to the Gabriel knight series.I have to say, in the end i liked moebius better than Gray matter. Moebius is a better game because it has heart in it, and it is more a jane jensen game than gray matter will ever be.I can't recommend this game to everybody, but i like it, and that's why the positive thumbs up calification.I would say that, from 2014, this was possibly the best story for and adventure game. but not the best game by far. (see my other reviews for the best adventure from 2014)			"

												Industry veteran Jane Jensen joins forces with Phoenix Online to deliver a new adventure. The result?Contrived writing and formulaic characters (not exactly surprising if you've read that Jensen interview on Gamasutra...), mostly vapid ideas, some daft puzzles, but clearly the most eminent problem lies with the Holmes deduction process analogue mechanic: it probably sounded a great idea on paper, in practice the solution is either a) blatantly obvious, akin to compiling a simple form b) total guesswork: ""what did they have in mind when putting together this trope-y character?""The execution looks budget, with the usual issues stemming from the use of 3D characters; it's not intolerable, more like excusable, what with the KS campaign having raised slightly more than 400 grand, but definitely noticeable. At some point the game was updated to Unity 5, and it appears the job was likely done hurriedly, leaving behind very obvious bugs. There's also some blurry textures here and there.Noteworthy: while the game is under most respects almost exactly what you would expect from a modern adventure in terms of general experience, it does bring back some old fashioned design decisions nobody really missed in the first place; in one instance, it combines them like inventory items to unleash maximum mayhem on the unsuspecting player: the Rubber Tree lesson went out of the window here in favor of a throwback to the heyday of Sierra, and there's no manner of autosaving or checkpointing, so it's definitely possible to be forced into replaying a whole chapter (or two). If you hated Resonance for not saving close enough to the ending, this one may elicit long strings of insults.Nevertheless, I couldn't muster a real dislike for the game; it shares elements with Cognition, and indeed many Phoenix people have worked on this one as well; but past the opening and on to the second episode, that one already seemed a better game than Moebius.I would only recommend this game to specific types of players: the indie adventure game renaissance train may have made a short stop at this station, however, it has also long left the platform.

												I enjoyed this game despite it's failings. For me I want an adventure to make me feel like I'm living through the interesting detailed story it's telling me and Moebius does this quite well. Now the plot itself is a tad bit laughable but I expect adventures to have B Movie plots. The plots of the much loved Gabriel Knight 1 and 2 were also laughable and somewhat offensive. IE in GB1 the fear of a large black murderous voodoo cult where every black person in the story is involved taps into racist fears that the American population have had and yet again portrays black people in a negative light. MILD SPOILER ALERTS: So the plot that reincarnated people of the past are 'chosen ones' and supior aristocratic blood lines wasn't one I warmed to but it worked in a B movie kind of way much like GB1 worked similarly. The way you investigate who is a re-incarnation of who is a kind of cool innovation to.The relationship was based on BBCs Sherlock as were the 'analyse' feature where Malachi like Sherlock analyses people at first glance. The relationship between the 2 men and Malachi being a savant is clearly based on this to. The bit were our genius rewires an electrical circuit without first turning the power off wasn't thought through. You can see it steals bits from Assassin's Creed in the way it deals with 'destiny'.There are strong themes of sexism and mysoginy in the way women are judged throughout the story. Yes I know the writer is a woman, but sometimes women judge other women more harshly. I was also a little uneasy with the middled aged men marrying teenage girls. The puzzles are generally logical and nowhere near as nigh on impossible as the puzzles in Gabriel Knight puzzles. I prefer this, some people prefer HARD puzzles though so if this is you maybe this isn't the game for you. Graphically I've seen negative comments. For me I think it's a beautiful looking game but I don't play the latest games so it probably is dated, that doesn't bother me but it may bother others. So for me it's not far off Gabriel Knight 1 in terms of quality.			"

												I bought this game right after finishing Cognition (highly recommended). Contrary to other reviewers, I quite liked the character of Malachi and his exaggerated British accent, and I found his relationship with David surprising - in a good way. I felt I learned a bit about genuine historical figures through his pattern-seeking puzzles which is a plus. It wasn't as challenging as Cognition and it only took me 9 hours to complete. I also wasn't a huge fan of the short chapter format but all in all I would definitely recommend this game, once it goes on sale! "

												Is Moebius bad? Short anwser: Yes, and I wouldn't recommend it. Long answer, see below.There will be spoilers below.The game starts out fine, if a bit odd that Malachi would go investigate a murder victim when his specialty by all accounts is evaluating artifacts and antiques, but I'll go with it. The puzzles are fine for the most part (if we ignore the end of the game, more on that below), the only real gripe being a safe code that is the date a newspaper article was written about a character's parents' divorce. Let's assume it makes sense to have some attachment to the day your parents announced publicly they were getting divorced, why would you then use the date from a newspaper story about the announcemen, which was presumably written at least a day later? Did the character get really attached to the newspaper article?But that's relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. The real problem with this game is the story and characters. The story has the potential to be interesting, but is executed terribly. Character motivations are never really apparent, because you don't really know anything about them. No real attempt is made to make anyone likable, even Malachi. Some might say this was intentional with Malachi, but that's just silly. If you can't like the character you're supposed to be, then you have no real emotional stake in what he or she is trying to do. Even anti-heroes are made to be likeable or at least developed to invoke some amount of empathy. Not here.The point when I went from finding this game mediocre to bad came fairly late in chapter 6, though. At one point you are required to seduce and then hold a knife to a woman's throat to get information from her. That was just vile. If the point was to make me loathe Malachi and Moebius, it was succesful. This is all followed up by a fairly simple but boring, boring, boring maze. The maze is broken up by an even more boring puzzle where you click on pictures that might be related to the location you are in. Then you are ""treated"" to a rather anti-climactic cutscene that ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger.The character models and animations are bad, but that's not something that really concerned me. If there was a good game underneath I would easily look past that. Sadly, there isn't.I don't really think I'll be paying Moebius 2 and I would recommend you don't bother with Moebius 1.			"

												After playing the demo and catching up through reviews I decided to wait until the price of the game dropped and it just did that a few days ago. Everything you can read about the game in negative reviews is true, but unless you have a very limited and narrowminded view, it will likely not be as true for you. The 'strained' relationship between the two main characters can easily be explained with a bit of human insight. This game really starts off on the wrong foot. Everything, but the characters, looks nice and it takes quite awhile to get used to the poor lip syncing, wandering eyes, animations and pauses, but once you are past that it's quite entertaining and chuckle worthy on occassion. The puzzles are generally pretty straightforward and even though you can't pick up anything before you actually need it, which is a really bad design choice imo, it isn't really that interruptive to gameplay, which can also be alleviated by using the location travel from the toolbar and movement in areas by the double-clicking teleportation. I had to turn off music (volume down) after 10 minutes, because it was giving me a headache. I recommend using space a lot to highlight points of interest - I didn't do that in the beginning and I missed an item and was stuck for an hour. The hint system is pretty useless, completely unlike the spectacularly userfriendly one from Broken Sword: The Serpents Curse. I only got one analysis wrong (Caroline Aflfonse) and had to check online for mismatches, because I was dead sure about some mismatches, which wasn't shared by game logic. I spend around 25 hours on this game due to some mistakes, that ""interrupted the pattern"" followed by clicking on the wrong button (I clicked on Load and realized that the game had made no autosaves, no progress saves and that I generally had forgotten to save any games beyond the intermissions) and the game also crashed on me once. ""Retry"" is the key to use and saving in general is a good idea, unless you like repetitious gaming. I would rate this game 7/10, because of bad design choices, poor lip syncing, wandering eyes, weird movements, annoying pauses, jittery animations and a general lack of polish. Had those things been fixed I would have rated it about 8.5/10, because despite the glaring faults it's actually a pretty good game with some interesting new points of Adventure and story-telling.

												Would have loved being able to recommend this game. The plot is interesting(though not stellar). The puzzles are acceptable. I can overlook the early 2000 animations. I can overlook some of the control issues. But playing for a bit and then encountering a game breaking bug (the same one described in: http://steamcommunity.com/app/264520/discussions/0/617321352093942871/Sorry, that is simply not acceptable. This game has been out for months. Having a bug that pretty much ends your playthrough there and then is acceptable if the game is just out. Not if the game has been out for months.Had I paid the full price for this one, I would be fuming.As it is, I can only advise you to stay far, far away, unless ALL bugs have been resolved. When that happens, this game will likely be OK.			"

												This has all the strenghts one comes to expect from a Jane Jensen title. Good Story, great music and a vast varity of characters. I enjoyed the game a lot and the plot kept me guessing until the end. For a KS game with a buget of app. 300'000 dollars it serves it purpose. The puzzles weren't outstanding and somehow distracting from the story and I didn't appreciate the animations that much. Still you should give the game a chance. I'd rate it with 3/5 stars. Anyone with a soft spot for good old point and click adventures as well as a good story should give this a try.			"

												Please note 2 things:1) I give this a thumb up, cuz i enjoyed it, but still it barely passed the line, a 6/10.2) This review might contain serious SPOILERS, read at ur own risk.(+)First of all let's talk about wut's good about this game.1) Some mechanics in the game are quite fresh, like finding matches between modern and historical figures and ""judge him/her by the look"".2) I enjoyed some dry humors in the game, and i'm rofl to some of the sexual innuendos. (David's joke? Ha-Ha-Not-So-Much)3) The BGM is definitely a good part of the game. The music for opening credits was stunning. (-)And wut's lacking in this game.1) Character Modelling. Can it be more obvious? The way ppl walk and stand is ultra stiffy and awkward.2) Item Interactions. The problem is that when u find something that might come in handy, Malachi will tell u he doesn't need it right now, and u have to perform certain moves to set off the ""flag"" then take the item to solve a miny puzzle, this way is quite absurd, since Malachi can take plenty of things with him, y can't he just take it when he sees it? (And don't get me started on he actually put a LANTERN into his suit's pocket...(?)And in-between, let's talk about some controversial parts.1) The Concept. To me, the concept is unique, and not unique at all. Sure, the Moebius Theory is quite intriguing, but the execution lacks novelty, just find someone with historical importance and create a modern doppleganger, wut's creative about that?2) The characters. I like the two starring roles, I can literally cut the tension between Malachi and David, sometimes i'm even yelling to the screen ""Just get over your UST you two"".     Still many ppl thinks the characters are too shallow, I think the issue is that the characters are not meant for us to immerse to. If i recall corectly, there was a place that Malachi directly address to the PLAYER saying something similar to ""I can lift my leg that high, but I'd kill YOU"" Who's that YOU? The PLAYER is. Seems that the writer are telling us we are just playing the role of puppet masters and controlling the two characters. It's more like an interactive book than a role-play game. I'm fine with it, but a lot of ppl would/will not.3) The game-play. I have to say it is not satisfying. It's too mediocre.    For Hardcore fans, this game is seriously lacking level of difficulty. Nothing in the game is challenging or brain-wrecking.    And for casual players, the story is not that great either. So wut,  [i'll spare the spoilers here] blah blah blah so the two start competing against each other and played a game called ""Let's See Who Can Find A Historical Doppleganger First - Wanna-bes Don't Count Edition""? Yeah, funny. And let aside the fact they used chinese as a disguise, and I'm Chinese. Do i feel offended? Meh... and do I find the idea fascinating? You gotta be kidding me.     But nevertheless, the turning in plots is somewut impressive, but doesn't stand out either.For a price of 30 bucks, i'm really looking forward for more. Perhaps a free sequel? (I just want to see the Malachi & David's Rom Com again lol.TL;DR: Be nice to panic attack suffers, they are Angels of broken wings.			"

Music is by Robert Holmes so you know it's gonna be good.The puzzles are interisting although a bit on the very easy side of the spectrum which means you won't have much trouble progressing through the game which is either bad or good depending on the views of the player.All in all I do recommend this game if you like adventure games.

This is a very small team that managed to duplicate the quality of GK3 (warts and all) with about 1/5th the budget. The story is fantastic and Malachi's voice actor was brilliant. I am supporting this game because I want this studio to succeed and Jane Jensen to continue making new adventure games - the quality will improve as evidenced in the GK 2.0 trailers where walking has been fixed. It would be nice if they spent the extra 2-3 weeks to fix some of the glaring animation issues, but if you want a good fun story - buy and play this game!			"

Yes i had to get past the usual stuff you have to get past with one of these games, graphics aren't that great, horrible animation and a bit buggy.. though its not as buggy as phoenix online previos game cognition, only a few glitches here and there like the mouse cursor disapearing for a moment or one such part of the game where i couldnt get it to leave a close up! The puzzles are fairly simplistic and its fairly linear with only 1 problem to solve at a time usually... but i played the original Broken Sword again recently and was struck just how linear that was also! I'm not that great at adventure games but i didnt really get stuck. Some people have comented that the game is too short, but it took me a good 15 hours to finish with hints disabled and no walkthroughs, i can only imagine people who finioshed it quickly were using hints or walkthroughs or just rushing the game. 15 hours to me is about average to above averaege for one of these games. I really enjoyed the storyline, someone said it felt unfinished but without giving anything away i thought it was all wraped up at the end and felt satisfied with the ending. I look forward to the Gabriel Knight remake!  "

												If you're really into adventure games and enjoy pseudo-historical / metaphysical storylines, you MIGHT enjoy this game. Otherwise, and I'm sorry to say as a backer and fan of Ms. Jensen's past work, it's a train wreck. The graphics and gameplay are just atrocious. Everyone looks like a scary alien. 3D animations weren't this bad in the 90s. The puzzles are just dumb. At one point, you have to take a private jet from DC to NYC to buy a bottle of wine. Seriously, the whole thing is so badly done, they actually threw in a couple of timed action sequences AND a cave maze to top it off. The voice acting is actually fine, but the writing is sloppy, so much of the dialogue is hardly bearable. The best part is really Robert Holmes's soundtrack. Pity, this story would have made a good book, but it's been made into a failure of a game.			"

Fortunately, though, the puzzles were straightforward and didn't lead to any frustration (I think I had to look up the answer to maybe three over the course of the game). The 3D graphics were a little blocky and people clipped through objects at times, but the 2D environments were generally pretty nicely drawn. Overally I'd give it a 5/10.

												Moebius: Empire Rising is a classic PnC-adventure. Good:Story: The story of Moebius is pretty decent overall.Voice acting: The voice acting, is solid, I have nothing to criticize here.Bad:Gameplay: You can die in this adventure game. But considering that there is neither autosave nor checkpoints this was a bad design decision.There is a game mechanic that lets you analyze characters (and sometimes objects). This mechanic is supposed to give you clues. But often those analyses can only be solved by guessing, so it creates just as many problems as it solves.Often you can pick up objects only after some event. Therefore you have to explore the locations multiple times, which is rather annoying.Bugs:A variety of bugs make the game pretty annoying. The game also freezes quite often and crashes sometimes. Graphics: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Prerendered backgrounds might have been acceptable ten years ago, but not anymore. The 3D character models aren't great either.However, the biggest problems are the animations. They are not only ugly and hideous. Moebius has managed to reach a new low that I did not even know existed: sometimes the animations fail to make their point and communicate something completely different than intended, like making characters look evil or surprised when they are clearly not. The eyes are completely mishandled, instead the characters move their noses all the times when talking! I want to make the animators watch WALL-E: Most facial expression comes from the eyes, the nose has almost nothing to express at all.The only way I could endure the game was by permanently focussing my eyes on the subtitles.Recommendation: Find a walkthrough on Youtube, but don't look at it, just let the audio play in the background.

I was a little apprehensive about Malachi's character but I promise he grows on you and you get really attached to him.I'm also pretty into the idea that these characters aren't really straight, which shows a variety that most games avoid if they can.  I also appreciated the supernatural aspect which was completely unexpected.  I also got a bit of watson and sherlock vibe from our 2 main characters (and i don't mean the bisexual or gay part I mean their dynamic).I would definitely reccomend this game to everyone.

												I'm hitting Positive on this one because It Is What It Is, and ultimately I did enjoy the game.HALLO, YOU MIGHT BE HERE BECAUSE YOU HEARD THIS GAME IS GAY. And it is! Very! You might be able to ignore it if you're really determined-- why tho?????-- but as someone who has read considerable slashfic and m/m romance in her life? Yeah, this is an interactive m/m thriller you see on Amazon but never can force yourself to buy because ao3 has so much more of it available for free.(Also, I was so so certain that this was The Sentinel worldbuilding fused over Stargate: Atlantis characters, but nooo, it's Sherlock BBC characters. Which made me sad, because I never liked Cumberbatch's Sherlock, the dude is far too pissy and mean. But it does explain so much about how unlikable Malachi Rector is at the start, and why he only starts to unclench as soon as he meets his ~Watson~-- who in this case is David Walker.)This game is very much a middling adventure game as far as gameplay goes. I had to look up where I was supposed to go three times in the course of my 10+hr run because the next action was obtuse. However, for the puzzles? Eh, they weren't that difficult, which I actually appreciate after the cluster♥♥♥♥ that was Dropsy and the ""You'll Never Figure Out This Game Because IT! IS! ART!"" thing.There is rampant misogyny here, but I took it as typical misanthropy; I don't expect a socially stunted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to see anyone in a positive light, men and women alike, so it didn't bother me. Your mileage may vary.The character models are hysterical, especially the way their eyes roll around in their head. If I hadn't had the flu as I played I probably would have made a drinking game out of it and gotten rip-roaring drunk as a result.So, uh, TL;DR gay game is gay but with some flaws, pick it up if you like Jane Jensen and/or want a game that stands at the edge of the roof of a skyscraper to scream GAAAAAAY out into the wind while there are soulmate AU tones running amuck on the ground. No really. All the fanfic tropes, oh man.Like I said: It Is What It Is.			"

												I am always on the lookout for the latest point and click adventure, so after reading the description I jumped at the chance to play this game. The plot is inspired by the Moebius theory in which time forms a loop with events repeating however in this game it is not events that repeat it is a person's biography, his/her life pattern. (Not to be confused with reincarnation where it is the actual person that is born again not just his/her story). Example: Mozart's bio goes something like this; wrote his first piece before the age of ten, marries at age twenty, has two children, lives the life of a pauper, and dies in his mid thirties unexpectedly of an acute infection. Now in the present time Malachi Rector (the main character) will attempt through his extensive knowledge of history and observation skills to find the one person that could fit that profile. He is hired by a top secret organization to do just that.( It isn't Mozart but the bios are of people you as the player would recognize).Some of the characters might not be likable but all are interesting especially Malachi. I am reminded of a certain late nineteenth century character a flawed but brilliant private detective. It is David his bodyguard that gives Malachi a touch of humanity or should I say a bit of compassion for David is everything Malachi is not, There were times when I got frustrated because some of the solutions  to the puzzles didn't follow a logical and  intuitive conclusion. In fact there was one solution I felt was down right ridiculus. Definitely thought and care were invested in the graphics department.I give this game a rating of 7/10 it isn't the best point and click I have experienced, but certainly not the worst. I bought this game while it was on sale so I feel I got what I paid for.  "

												Long story short, a fun and interesting game. (MAY HAVE SPOILERS)the good:- fun gameplay- nice art- detailed settings and characters- nice dialogue- decent gameplay pacing- fun story to unravel- user-friendly- parts of the gameplay can be pretty comical, like how obviously stupid the NPC's can be :P- original ""analysis"" game mechanic is pretty coolthe bad:- buggy at times (maybe they'll do some patches?)- the 3D animation and meshes are a bit wonky- to me, this game doesn't top Jane Jensen's best older games- I don't know about the Chekhov's Gun game mechanic -- to me that just means more time taken wandering around just to get items you could have taken earlierHere's my ""essay"" version of my review. I really enjoyed playing through this game. It's hard enough for me to want to look at an online walkthrough here and there, but easy enough for me to figure out how to move further into the game without a walkthrough, most of the time. I really like the analysis mechanic. It's a different way of learning about people, objects and the story. I have some complaints though. Game design-wise, I wouldn't readily praise the ""Chekhov's Gun"" take on collecting items. In the end, it just means ""oh there's an item I need, but I can't take it now but I will later and take a jumbo jet to come back for it..."" it seems arbitrary to me. Is this to save space in your inventory? *shrug* Story-telling-wise, this game was alright. I really liked the mystery. I never gave a second thought to the meaning of the title for the past two years, long after I'd helped fund the kickstarter for it. But I'm glad I didn't give it a second thought, because it helped in creating a positive gameplay experience. The text appearing as a way of telling us Malachi's thought processes? I've seen very few other pieces of entertainment that use this method of telling us what the character's thinking... and the only other place I've seen it is in the TV series Sherlock. I get pretty bothered when a creative piece is being this blatantly obvoius about borrowing, if in fact this is what happened. There isn't nearly as much shock and twists in this story as I would have liked. There's way more intensity in Gabriel Knight, for example... and wasn't that how Jane Jensen was advertising Moebius? So that we'd have another game that's like Gabriel Knight? (I'm thinking of Sins of the Fathers).As for the art, the 2D art is pretty nice. But there's a lot of inconsistency and distracting wonkiness to the way the 3D models react to their animations, as well as the animations themselves. The first time I saw Malachi's walk cycle from the front, for example, I complained about it out loud. I'm not asking for every creative piece to have ""top notch"" graphics, whatever that means. Someone decided to have this game use 3D characters and objects... so it's going to bother me if Gretchen's upper arm bends completely the wrong way as she's drinking her martini, unless it was completely intentional. My only expectation is *consistency,* no matter what style of graphics is chosen. This is one of the reasons why I sorely miss the old game graphics from Jane Jensen games... like that of Gabriel Knight or King's Quest VI.			"

Final chapter revolves around clicking your way through 60 caves, all animated with the same 4 bad backgrounds. Did the budget run out?Do not get this game, even if it is on sale.Hurts to say this, considering I love Jane Jensen's work in general, and both Gabriel Knight and Gray Matter are favorites of mine.

												Entertaining, but does have its flawsThe story is interesting, and I would be quite happy if this became a series of games.However, the puzzles need polish; most are quite easy, or are open to multiple interpretations. Still, they are not your regular puzzles and stand out.Voice acting is excellent, graphics wise it's also good.overall I'd give it a 6 out of 10. Still worth it, although the pricing is a bit off (soundtrack 10 euros?)Get it on a discount.			"

												I kickstarted this game because of it's promise to bring the glory days of 90s point-and-click adventures to the modern era. The Kickstarter campaign turned out to be a sales pitch for a Gabriel Knight remake. The developers probably had just started this game when the business deal was done for Gabriel Knight, and you can tell that they moved most of the developers off this project soon after that.This game feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and rushed in order to keep the Kickstarter backers happy. It has poor art and animation, cheesy music, puzzles with difficulty that is more suitable for children and a weird card system that just says ""yeah we couldn't be bothered so here is this stupid clue thing and if you get them all you win"".Avoid this game.

												Moebius has a gripping story that takes you all over the world searching for the perfect match for someone in the past. This someone is important to the future of the global economy and different factions are trying to get their hands on her. And only one man, Malachi Rector, can decipher the clues as to her identity. In true Jane Jensen fashion (famous for the Gabriel Knight series and Gray Matter), this is a game that holds true to her style. Intrigue, danger, a mystery that spans centuries, and even the occasional bit of lighthearted humour make themselves known throughout this seven chapter epic. There are even some romantic undertones for the observant to pick up. The music and voice acting are top notch, the backgrounds are beautiful, and the story and dialogue gripping. The only real negative point that I can make here is that the animations could use a bit of touch-up. But this is just a minor gripe that is far overshadowed by the positive aspects of the masterful tale woven by Jensen.			"

												I'll buck the trend and say I did like the game, and I would recommend it...I get what the other reviewers are saying, especially with the technical issues. I suppose there is a sexist element or two, too, but it's still not enough to destroy the story for me.Unlike others, I liked Malachi, the main character. I sort of liked the secondary character, albeit less strongly. I thought the characterisation on these two, especially Malachi, was quite strong. The story, too, was original.The concept and story were good, and in terms of creativity, I liked the ""brain"" function - analysing people before speaking to them. That especially was interesting and innovative.Graphics? I liked that aspect. And I don't play adventures for the graphics, anyway.Difficulty? Not too hard, actually. Mostly very intuitive.My rating? An enjoyable 7.25/10. I liked it marginally more than Gray Matter, a lot more than some more forgettable games, but not as much as certain classics of the genre. It's no Gabriel Knight, but it's still very enjoyable.			"

												I personally loved this game. The only thing really terrible about it are the character models (mainly the hunchback bodies, the faces are alright) which is very evident when they try to move around. This is pretty inexcusable especially for the two main characters, it doesn't require a bigger budget for someone in the team to nudge the artist and tell them that's not how arms connect to the torso. That said, everything else is exactly what I enjoy about point-n-clicks. Decent length, interesting story with enough twists and turns, ample variety of settings and situations and oddly compelling characters. The main character is hard to like, but it's pretty clear that was intentional and I appreciate that kind of risk taking, it really sets him apart. My only two complaints about the plot are that the main enemy appears really late into the story, kinda out of nowhere and there's no way to care about who he is, making the plot twist about there being a mole	 pretty much irrelevant, and also that I wish they had had the courage to make Malachi and David seemingly romantic interest actually explicit, as it stands it's so obvious and there that it seems dumb that the only thing they don't do is say it out loud, but with today's gaming scene I can understand why they wouldn't.

												The best adventure game about a snobby bookworm falling in love with a gay soldier you'll find on the market. And also there's conspiracies or something. Look, take Broken Sword, replace Nico with a gay soldier and you've got Moebius Empire Rising. I'm glad that Malachi Rector has found someone special in his life and you will be too.Important notes for adventure gamers: Spacebar shows all hotspots, you can double click to warp around a room, and to quick exit a room. But the game has a verb coin so you won't be able to double click on a hotspot.			"

												This could have been a fantastic game - and to some high degree, it is. It has many positive elements that make it stand out and be a great gaming experience, which is why I am definitely recommending it anyway. Coming from the team that created the Gabriel Knight series, this was more or less expected. The characters are good, the plot is good. There is variety in settings and puzzles, there are some really nice dialogues,  beautiful ambience and gorgeous music throughout. The main hero travels to several parts of the world, after accepting a complicated mission that involves several riddles. While at it, he meets an ally, who seems to be connected to him in more than one ways. Their relationship is extremely interesting, and in particular when interwoven with the - imaginary but very well-developed - theory that runs through the story. Said theory brings together influential people from the past and specific individuals from the contemporary world. The parts where you have to examine several characters and match them with those historical personalities are wonderful. Like in all purely Adventure games, you have to do lots of research, talk to people, carry out sub-missions, combine info and reach conclusions. You also have to collect important items and use them when necessary so as to move on. All this is very well-organized, although some of the dialogues, especially with people that do not play crucial part of the plot, may feel sometimes like they drag out too long. On the technical side, the characters (especially the main hero) seem to have a bit of awkward movement, but personally I didn't mind this much because it didn't affect the gameplay in any way. There are a few really serious issues however that make the game frustrating without reason and lower its overall quality. There is one puzzle at some point that you have to solve; it is based on cryptology and you are supposed to figure out the various options, rule out those that do not fit and solve the puzzle with the one option that is suitable. All this is OK when you play the game for the first time, but what about when you want to replay it? You have to go through the whole chore again, even though you already know which is the correct option and answer. You have to search again, find all the options, rule them out and stick with the correct one. As if this wasn't enough, if you try to use directly the correct option, the game locks the puzzle and you can neither reset it nor cancel it. The only solution is to use a previous save, assuming you have one. Personally I found this issue extremely serious for a game of this class. A game designer should always keep in mind that their game may have replay value for a player; and if a player goes through a game for a second or third time, they already know what to do and they should be given the option to do just that. I have played lots of games of various genres and this is the first time that I come across such a situation. Some other time, I had to search a sleeping character. I searched him and exited the activity screen. It turned out then I hadn't searched him enough so I was missing an item. I tried to search him again, but it was impossible. Again the puzzle was locked and I had to reload. I don't know if this was an actual technical glitch or if it was designed that way on purpose so as to frustrate the player, but if it was the latter, it succeeded. On another occasion you are in Washington, visiting a woman in her apartment, and you have to take some info from her. To make her talk, you have to flirt with her in various ways, and part of the process is bring her whiskey as gift. And what do you have to do? Fly back to Manhattan, because Washington obviously has no bars, buy a bottle from the bar opposite the hero's office, then take the plane and return to Washington. Oh, and if you try to buy the whiskey beforehand (ie, before flying to Washington in the first place), you are unable to. I know it's a game and realism is not exactly necessary, but some things are just too much.Despite all this, I did enjoy the game and liked it a lot, although I am not very much into this genre. There is enough mystery and intrigue to keep you interested, and there are a few pretty intense situations that you will surely remember for a long time.			"

												A bit on the easy side. But not too short. The ending kind of fizzled though. It wasn't a cliff hanger exactly but to me was suggestive of the possibilty of a sequel (which I think is uncertain to even happen). Or perhaps they just ran out of money and that's why it ended so suddenly.The plot and world building are excellent. The idea of archetypal characters recurring through history and the main character being able to deduce this and solve related mysteries is a really cool and could potentially yield countless adventures. The interface for deucing things is fine. At first it seems great but eventually it can be rather frustrating. Or infuriating for some, as I have come to learn. Those parts were hilarious to me though. It's a really funny game.The main character is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But a well developed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think he was intentionally constructed as an antithesis of Gabriel Knight. Not to say Gabriel Knight isn't an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he is, they're just opposite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Perhaps I'm drawing conclusions though since I played through that game right before this one.The game is kind of buggy. An item, the cryptology book, would not appear in game. That did not hinder progression though. I did get stuck in a rather hilarious endless death cycle though. Unfortunately that resulted in having to replay a good 15-20 minutes, so I advise you to save going into each new scene.So yeah, it's good. I'm happy to have played it, and would enjoy a sequel.			"

												As a longtime adventure gamer and fan of Jane Jensen, I am a bit disappointed in the game. Maybe it was the budget, yeIf you are a devoted fan of adventure game, buy it. If not, there are other better choices like Grey Matter, Secret Files 1-2 and the Blackwell series. Many people complained about the 3 D animation, but the weakest point of the game is that it fails to get you really involved in the story. Overall, taking into account the slow animation, the game is much shorter that it should be.Pros:beautiful backdropsinteresting story, with the historical refences and the analysis systemthe bromance between the main charactersthe musicConsmost important, the feeling of superficiality when creating the supporting characters and subplots. the puzzles are generally boring and  meant only to advance the story, they have no real spark in them. tedious slow movement of the characters "

Yes, there are a few plot points which are nonsensical - as another review mentioned, flying to NY to get a bottle of whisky, for example - but I didn't think it was gamebreaking,  Some of the game mechanics are really cool, like using Malachi's attention for details to get a read on people before you talk to them:  you put together their various tells and figure out how they tick.

												I received Moebius: Empire Rising for backing the Pinkerton Road Kickstarter and just finally got around to finishing it. It wasn't a terrible way to spend my time, but I wouldn't describe it as a good game and I wouldn't recommend it unless you really have nothing else you'd like to be playing. The feel of the game overall was very unpolished, and while I could forgive the aesthetics not being perfect, things like the animations were not only stiff and unrealistic, but they were very slow and you'd have to just sit watching the characters slowly and awkwardly move around while waiting for them to do what you told them too. In the instances when it was unclear exactly what you were supposed to be doing and I was having to repeat certain actions multiple times trying to get things right it got very frustrating.They did try to do some interesting things with the point-and-click genre, for example, you couldn't just pick up everything you'd eventually need right when you first encountered it if there was no reason for you to be carrying that thing around, so you'd often have to remember where you saw something useful and go back for it, and it seemed to work out pretty well most of the time. There was also the analyzing of people to learn more about them, which mimicked the BBC TV show, Sherlock. That was clever at first, but it mostly ended up with things either being obvious or else needing to guess randomly. They also relied a lot on stereotypes, and it got kind of insulting at times, especially towards women as it seemed like half the women were vain and out to get a man, often the protagonist, Malachi Rector. Malachi thinks pretty lowly of most people, but his generally insulting attitude combined with the use of negative stereotypes about beautiful women, various tropes like women getting fridged or damseled, and the women in the game almost all being puzzles or tools to use to solve a puzzle, including sometimes in a sexualized manner, was pretty disappointing. Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers wasn't exactly great in its treatment of women, but there were more interesting and diverse female characters around, even if Gabriel himself was a bit of a womanizer, and I had hoped that Jane Jenson was capable of writing protagonists who didn't objectify women so much and that this game would have been able to show better gender representation than a game from the 90s. And while I'm on representation, Malachi and David's relationship borders dangerously on queer baiting.Overall, there were some good moments in this game, and I didn't hate it, but mostly I felt that it fell short and that there were elements that could use quite a bit of improvement in every aspect of the game. If a sequel were made I definitely wouldn't get it right away, but I would see what people have to say about it and find out if they've made enough improvements to make it worthwhile.			"

												TL;DR the story has potential, but suffers from mediocre dialog, and flat characters. The animations and character graphics are bad. The puzzles are varied with some interesting mechanics, but not necessarily hard. It has a solid length. Recommended to people who really like adventures and people who can get past some bad dialog. Well backed the game on kickstarter, played through it.. The graphics are rather bad (or the characters are), and the animations are awful. That would be ok if the story was solid, but it really isn't. The idea is good, the premise is ok, but the execution and dialog is medicore. Well the dialog is at times really bad, corny and too predictable. The characters are awkward but not in a good way, and they are rather two dimensional and uninteresting. I'm reminded of the scientist Joshua from the Runaway series, though perhaps not that irritating (really felt that it hurt runaway 2 that he had a more prominent role). The protagonist Malachi is not very likable, but that is intentional. He suffer from bland/poorly executed character development. It is a bit like the classic windows progress bar, it comes in weird chunks and it is not entirely sure how far it has to go. The character development is a classic ""Taming of the Shrew"", but then again what isn't.The interaction between characters are bland and lack depth. There is a weird chemistry between the main characters, which ""left unexplained"" but with rather heavy suggestions. I would have prefered if the story either had aimed at Watson/Holmes buddies relation,  or a more serious approach with deeper meaning.The FITA and the baddie seems like they have been slapped together in a hurry, as they do not offer much other than trying to frame the story.The story is rather predictable once the scene is set, with a few twists here and there. The last chapter feels both rushed and drawn out, especially the last puzzle since the highlight feature is turned off and it suffers from the slow transitions between scenes. I found the puzzles in general to be quite nice, with good variations. I did get stuck a couple of times which is nice enough, but for the most part they were pretty straight forward. Some of the puzzles does suffer a bit from ""no that is not the right order"" syndrome. Such as why do I need to climb an object in order to get to the object i'm interested in, especially as Malachi says ""I need to climb box first"", please just do it. It is however just minor inconveniences. I really like the compare/analyze historical people mechanic, that is the guess who this person is puzzles, not the overly negative, shallow and nonsensical ""look at that tramp"" analysis of the characters in order to get the obvious clue for conversations.The historical comparison is a nice mechanic, and there are a lot of interesting historical facts in them , well also some mythical ""facts"".  It worked for me all the way up until the last part of the game, where the historical characters began to be too modern, and not enough ""space"" to support the idea behind the moebius pattern.Some reviews on the net talks about game breaking glitches, I did not run into any, but the slow and glitchy animations were a nuisance at times.The music is quite good and provide a nice ambiance. All in all Moebius has a lot of interesting ideas and mechanics, but suffer from poor execution, shallow characters and not enough polish. As a point and click adventure game there are two areas you should focus on, the story, the characters and the puzzles, and both characters and story feel rough.I do not regret having backed the game, but do hope that Pinkerton Road will listen to the critique and do better with their next game(s) because the potential is there.  I know it was created on a tight budget, and for that I can forgive a lot of things and i would probably score it at 5/10 leaning at 6/10 due to the analysis puzzles.			"

Disclosure: I was given a copy of Moebius: Empire Rising to review for our website.  I will copy and paste my posted review and link to the actual post, because I am not doing this for our site traffic but rather to review this title.Today, Phoenix Online Publishing has released their highly-anticipated mystery adventure game Moebius: Empire Rising for both the PC and Mac.  The mind behind this title is Jane Jensen who launched a very successful Kickstarter campaign to back this project and deliver a very entertaining title to her fans.  Jane is a veteran of the gaming industry and mastermind behind amazing adventure-based plots.  Her company, Pinkerton Road, teamed up with the indie team at Phoenix Online Studios on this project.  Moebius: Empire Rising is available through their online store for purchase or via Steam.  Later this year, the game will release for Android, iOS and Linux platforms as well.  The game is also available for Demo if you just want to check it out before buying it.  For an “official” description, here is part of the press release from Phoenix Online Publishing:A sophisticated, story-driven interactive thriller, Moebius: Empire Rising is the first in an originalseries of titles from renowned game designer and novelist Jane Jensen. Her award-winningGabriel Knight adventures have been ranked among the best games of all-time, and her 2003sci-fi novel Dante’s Equation was nominated for the Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥award. After nearly a decadedesigning casual games based on franchises such as Agatha Christie and James Patterson’sWomen’s Murder Club, Jensen appealed to her fans on Kickstarter and crowdfunded more than$435k to make Moebius: Empire Rising. These funds were used to develop the game inpartnership with indie team Phoenix Online Studios, which is publishing the title under its newpublishing label.Moebius is the story of Malachi Rector, a brilliant antiques dealer and historian whosephotographic memory and eye for deduction transforms locations and clues into interactivepuzzle pieces and historical patterns.A secretive government agency has tapped Malachi for anunusual assignment: fly to Venice and assess whether a recently murdered woman resembles aparticular historical figure. As Malachi soon learns, this seemingly innocuous request is linked toa powerful paranormal theory the U.S. government will protect at any cost—and the more hediscovers, the greater danger he faces.Enter David Walker, a former Special Forces operative Malachi randomly encounters in histravels. David’s exactly the wingman Malachi needs: calm under pressure, an experiencedbodyguard, and good with a gun. In fact, the typically distrustful Malachi can’t shake the feelingOk, now that all of the official stuff is out of the way…you want to know what I thought of the game, right?  I was generously granted a review copy of the game, via Steam, and spent in excess of 15 hours playing it.  It’s a single-player title that supports both Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards.  I was able to work my way through the entire game during that time and really only found myself “stuck” in a couple areas.  My first impressions of the game were that the cut scenes were very well done and while they can be skipped, I would recommend sitting through them to really get a feel for the story.  If you’ve read the prologue comic (if not, go read the damn prologue comic) it will also help set the table a little for the game.  One thing I enjoyed about the cut scenes along with the story line is it made the game feel very much like an interactive comic book.  That is not to say it’s graphically set that way, it isn’t.  The story line however was very well done and engaging.  The other major thing that I noticed straight off was the soundtrack.  I am serious when I say, it may be one of the better soundtracks that I have experienced in any game I have ever played.  The music was spot on with the story and really added to the overall feel.  It was clear from the beginning that there was a lot of thought put into this.  I found myself feeling like I was not only playing some sort of interactive comic book but rather watching a novel develop before my eyes.You play the majority of the game as Malachi, who will come off as a brash and pompous pretty boy for the most part.  Malachi possesses several talents, some of which I will not spoil for you but the main talent being that he has an amazing ability to analyze situations and details.  This serves him well as part of the antique business that he owns and where he makes his money.  I will admit, this is typically not my genre of gaming.  I am normally an FPS or RPG type guy, but I also enjoy games involving puzzles.  This is what intrigued me so much about this title, solving puzzles.  I found that throughout the course of this game, up until the ending cut scenes, I was really learning to shape the way I was thinking in-game.  Once I started looking for those minor details that would eventually get me past an area, I was hooked.  It’s a game where attention to detail is key and decision making is crucial.As Malachi makes his way through the story, I found myself liking him more than I did when the game began.  I am sure this was by design.  The other main character is David Walker, a former Special Forces operator who Malachi eventually teams up with.  The two character’s couldn’t be more dissimilar and I thought David was a great addition to the story and game.  As a matter of fact, once David was introduced to the game, I found myself laughing a lot more throughout the story and conversations they would have.  I won’t spoil anything, but do yourself a favor and listen to David’s corny jokes.  By solving puzzles, analyzing people with detailed dossiers and web searches as well as choosing the right topics and questions to present to other characters you progress through the game and often affect certain paths.  That is not to say it’s a “choose your own adventure” style game (my God I just dated myself) but there are situations that can go one way or another based on actions/dialogue.  Some of the puzzles may seem a little mundane but I will say that some really made me think, and a couple of them had me simply stumped.  The game also offers the ability to turn hints on or off, and there is an achievement for completing the game without them on at all.Overall, I started the game admittedly skeptical because it just wasn’t my typical genre.  What I was left with was a very great appreciation for the time put into the game and just how engaging it ended up being.  For someone that likes a solid story combined with thought-provoking puzzles and situations, this game is fantastic.  Add in extremely well put together cut scenes and an incredible soundtrack and I would say that for $29.99, you’d have a winner on your hands.  Honestly, aside from some moderately corny dialogue and wonky walking animations, I couldn’t find any significant flaws with the game.  There is no current DLC plan for Moebius: Empire Rising but I will be surely keeping an eye out for some or any new titles from this publisher and studio.In the end, I would give Moebius: Empire Rising 4.5 out of 5 Pink Cows.Source: http://tailgate365.com/2014/04/moebius-empire-rising-review/ "

												[Disclosure: I backed this project on Kickstarter.]Moebius: Empire Rising is kind of a mixed bag, and it's easy to pick out the negative elements and highlight them. The writing is sometimes a bit cheesy, and every character is unlikeable, with far too little done to bring you around by the end. Some of the puzzle solutions are laughably ridiculous, and both recurring puzzle mechanics are irritating at best, semi-random at worst. The tech really needs a lot of polishing: Character animation is almost universally terrible, the interface is buggy, inconsistent, or simply non-intuitively designed, and character models don't even begin to look human, much less realistic or evocative. (Seriously, have you ever met anybody with fingers that long? There's not a single person in this entire game whose fingers are less than eight inches long.) Also, it's shortish (around 10-15 hours) with a lot of loose plot ends at the end, which makes it feel more like an ""episode"" (or a few episodes) of a seasonal game than like a full game.However, the game mostly succeeds despite itself, and I played it pretty much exclusively through from beginning to end. The puzzles for the most part are followable with very little ""just try everything together"" (with the exception of the observing-a-person puzzle mechanic, which often does devolve into just trying every combination). The story is interesting, and as much as the characters may not necessarily be likeable, you do get caught up in wanting to know what happens to them, to at least some degree.I think I hoped for a lot more when I backed and when I bought this game, but what I got was still enjoyable, and I think that if you're interested in this type of game (point and click graphical adventures), it's definitely worth playing. Jensen is also clearly setting this up as the first in a series, so it would behoove you to get in on the ground floor.One last note is that if anything one of the largest disappointments came, oddly, during the end credits, where you get to see artists' mock-ups of the various characters. They universally fit the characters much better than the clunky mess that the implemented character models wound up being. It made me long to have played *that* game, with those characters.I feel like Pinkerton Road's standards did bring this game up above the standard Phoenix Online fare, but I really think that if the two continue to partner together and work together, they have to strive for better.

												This game is not without its issues - primarily technical, which have been covered at length in other reviews. Yes, the animation leaves a lot to be desired, there are noticeably long pauses waiting for an action sometimes, and the lip syncing makes the characters look somewhat scary at times...However, despite all that, I don't just recommend this game for adventure fans, I wholeheartedly recommend it!It's strange to me that so many reviews on here have panned the story and the puzzles in this game. The puzzles weren't overly difficult, but I didn't feel they were bland either. They matched the tone of the game, never felt forced or shoehorned in, and were quite fun.Perhaps, as a fan of the fantastic, I have less problems with the primary conceit of the story (the Moebius idea), and as a history buff I found the idea far more intriguing than a lot of people might. What I can say is that it's the first adventure game in a long time that has held me glued to the screen until I finished the entire thing.The mystery is intriguing, the main character is surpringly likeable given his personality, and he comes across very much like a modern day sherlock holmes. In fact, the little analysis puzzles that pop up through the game attached to people or objects give the game the best ""sherlockian"" feel of any game i've played - including the sherlock holmes games themselves.Overall, highly recommended.

												I really enjoyed Moebius: Empire Rising and it's certainly one of the best adventures I've recently played. It's got a very interesting story with two sympathetic protagonists. The puzzles aren't really that hard, but not too simple either. The only negative point are the animations which are really awful - thanks to the story and overall atmosphere you can ignore this though.If you're looking for an adventure focusing on the narrative and the plot this one's for you!

												Moebius: Empire Rising is nothing revolutionary. It's typical point & click with puzzles thrown in. Yet for some reason it is a game I come back to and replay again and again solely because of the story. It's corny and not neccesarily that well put together but still keeps me entertained and pulls me in for hours and hours.Not everyones cup of tea but if you can ignore some bugs, glitches and a story you shouldn't really think too hard about, then you should give this one a go.

												I was a Kickstarter backer for Moebius, and loved playing the beta versions that they sent out to the backers. So my play on the full game was definitely advantaged by knowing many of the puzzles ahead of time. Your mileage may vary if you buy and play the game from scratch. I loved this game, and the story and characters. I'd happily buy other types of games in this genre, and wish there were more that were available. I hope they do a sequel!			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  The main character, Malachi was different than most adventure game heroes, at first he was stiff and almost unlikeable but he grew on me.  Actually he reminded me of myself at times. You also play as David, a muscular action hero type.  The settings that the game took you to were nicely done and varied.  The music and voices were well done too.  There were a few graphical glitches here and there, but nothing to worry about.  No game is perfect.  So far my favorite game of 2014!			"

												It is finally time for another Jane Jenson authored game, and this one is called Moebius Empire Rising. You are going to take on, primarily, the role of Malachi Rector, an expert of antiquities. You will soon find out that your abilities are far more specialized with a secret organization calls on you to find someone, but here's the twist, it is the reincarnation of a famous historical figure. Will you be able to take on the challenges presented in front of you, how deep does the conspiracy that you have unearth go, and will you be able to trust anyone who crosses your path?Graphically this game looked decent, there were definitely some animation issues which made a character appear to be limping around the screen, and there were also issues of colision with the background which was really just a picture and not geometry. I did like the different character models, they definitely gave life to the characters, but the facial movements left much to be desired. There were several times where characters were talking through their teeth, and there were times where the movements looked over dramatic to try to add additional effect.I did really like the music that went with the game, there was always a slightly different flavor when you went to different places, as well as a main theme that you could find either in the main menu or between chapters.The controls are pretty straightforward you are going to be point and clicking with your mouse. Now I highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the arrow and target icon that can be found in the menu system that you can pull up from the top left of the screen, clicking on this icon will allow you to see all possible objects you can interact with. Oddly though there are a couple of places where when you are just trying to find the exit, and there's nothing else to interact with you can't find the exit.So you are playing a Malachi a pill popping, overly dramatic, character who is a brainiac. One could say that he is a Sherlock Holmes type of character that does not give a lick about crime, and what is going on in the world as long as it does not interfere with his day. There was definitely a little bit of a soap opera feel to some of the parts, and there were some stereotypical characters that were thrusted into the story. You are going to go on many different adventures, but at the end of the day this game is STRICTLY an origins story. You don't really get your feet wet with what this franchise can do, which is unfortunate because I felt that the story had finally picked up to where I not only needed to play the next chapter, but had to. The thing that basically puts a nail in this game's coffin is the fact that the title never makes sense by the end of the game.So at the end of the day, this game falls a little bit flat with a couple of faults sprinkled throughout the game. If you like a good mystery point and click adventure, this would be a good starting point but it will not satisfy the hunger you are looking to feed. I will say this though, I CANNOT wait to see the next chapter of this game, and I hope it comes sooner than later. This game gets a 6.7 out of 10.			"

												Τελικά το “Moebius: Empire Rising” μοιάζει μ’ ένα ακριβό πετράδι, ακριβώς σαν εκείνα τα αντικείμενα που εξετάζει ο πρωταγωνιστής του: Ενώ αρχικά φαντάζει πολυτιμότατο, έστω κι αν έρχεται σε μία όχι και τόσο όμορφη συσκευασία, στο τέλος αποδεικνύεται ότι η αξία του δεν είναι και τόσο μεγάλη. Δεν είναι επ' ουδενί κάλπικο,, αλλά δεν ανταποκρίνεται σ' όσα αρχικά υπόσχονταν η εικόνα και η φήμη του…Moebius: Empire Rising bears a resemblance to an expensive item, like the ones its protagonist values. While initially it seems extremely valuable, even though it comes in a not so beautiful package, in the end it appears to be of not so high value. It's not fake by any means, it's just that it does not correspond to the promises its fame and figure had created. http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/moebius-empire-rising-pc-review "

												I'm very sorry to say this, being a longtime fan of Jane Jensen and GK2 & 3 being my all-time best loved game, but i cannot recommend this game to anybody.Technically, the game is mediocre at best, but this is something I can get over with.The major letdown is that the scenario is mediocre, too. The core concept is vaguely intriguing, but only surface scratched, with no depth. I feel very sad, indeed. I was hoping to relive some of the great moment of mystery I got with JJ's game, but I didn't.			"

OVERVIEWMoebius: Empire Rising is a dramatic point-and-click adventure game in the style of Jane Jensen's earlier titles, such as the Gabriel Knight series.You play Malachi Rector, a New York antiques dealer who also happens to be a non-violent psychopath with exceptional analytical abilities. Early in the game you're contacted by the head of a mysterious organisation and asked to investigate a murder in Venice. What you uncover leads Malachi through a life-changing journey across the world to discover more about the Moebius theory, and friendship.GraphicsThe graphics in Moebius: Empire Rising are a weird mix.Backgrounds are generally great and the mix of hand-painted and photographed textures and images is usually quite well done, with a few notable exceptions (e.g. the wedding photo in the Billionaire's house looks rather odd). Dynamic lighting in the final scenes is also rather good, although the water reflection effects caused significant slowdown for me.The character models, though, are odd, with some strange animations and facial expressions, and limbs and joints that look rather unnatural in some scenes.The game has a certain offbeat graphical charm, but I've found myself laughing out loud a few times at some of the scripted scenes that are supposed to be the most dramatic.SoundMusic is used to great effect, and sounds are acceptable. The game is fully spoken, and it's mostly done extremely well, but Malachi's accent is all over the place; I assume it's supposed to be British, but some of the words are pronounced in a distinctly American manner.GameplayMoebius: Empire Rising plays like a traditional point-and-click adventure game, similar to Jane Jensen's earlier games. With Malachi's antiques business, complete with a very organised female assistant, I felt like I was playing as an alternate-universe Gabriel Knight, although Malachi is nowhere near as charming and likeable as Gabriel was.The puzzles in Moebius are not as interesting as Jensen's earlier games, though, and consist mainly of very obvious ""use this item there"" solutions. Sometimes you'll find an object that you know you'll need later, but the game won't let you pick it up until you've done something else, so there's some backtracking required, but it's only a minor annoyance.Overall, the actual gameplay seems to take a back seat to the story, which is fine in an adventure game like this. The addition of Malachi's smartphone seemed like it would be a good one at the beginning of the game, but in the end it was only really used as a way to provide the player with very limited in-game information and a reminder of progress; I found myself ignoring it most of the time. I do have to wonder why Malachi needed a flashlight in one section, though: I don't think I've seen a modern smartphone without a flashlight app.There are a few points in the game where Malachi freezes, preventing you from doing anything for up to 30 seconds or so, but these were only a minor annoyance; the game always came back eventually. The game also features some timed quick-time event sequences, which are terrible and have no place in an otherwise-traditional point-and-click adventure like this one. I'm not even sure what I did differently to succeed rather than fail at one of these events (Walker on Malachi's balcony); it was more luck than skill.Steam Achievements are integrated into the game, but as seems to be inevitable with point-and-click adventure games on Steam, it's likely that you'll miss some of them unless you're using a guide. Since this type of game has a completely linear story, it has next to no replayability, so I don't really like this approach; I don't want to spoil the game by using a guide, but I'm not going to play through it all again just to get missed achievements. It's not unique to Moebius, though, by any means.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Interesting story+ Solid writing and high production values+ Mostly great voice acting+ Steam Achievements and Trading CardsCons:- Timed events don't really work- Some funky character animations- Overly dramatic parts of the story just come off as amusing- Puzzles are a bit disappointing- Malachi's accent is not quite believableCONCLUSIONMoebius: Empire Rising is a solid point-and-click adventure game in the traditional style, with an interesting story from one of the masters of the genre. Unfortunately some of the most dramatic moments fall a bit flat, but if you enjoyed Jensen's earlier work then this should keep you interested, too.7/10 "

												The game starts off really well, with an intriguing plot an interesting, if somewhat unlikeable, main character, and his much more likeable love interest. But it kind of stalls out.  The dialogue is good, too, but the plot line never really comes together in a particularly intriguing way.  The ""memory"" puzzles, while novel at first, become a bit waring by the end because they never really develop into anything.  In fact, just generally the puzzles never do much.I was excited for this because I really enjoyed Cognition immensely, and of course I liked Jane Jensen's Gabriel Knight a lot, but this fell flat for me.  That being said, I thought characters were very well realized and I would visit them again if there were another game in the series.  So, I suppose I will still give it a positive review.  Hopefully too, a new game will be less 90's innuendo about Malachai and his boyfriend's relationship.			"

												It's not that I didn't have fun playing Moebius, I did, it just isn't a very good overall experience. Malachi is a terrible, paper-thin character, the kind of guy Grace Nakimura (from Gabriel Knight, ostensibly this game's spiritual predecessor) would dump after a single date. The historical, Carmen Sandiego stuff was really fun, but it's been crammed, rather than woven into the story. The music is forgettable. The phone is cumbersome.Moebius is basically a bad, sometimes pretty Gabriel Knight without Gabriel Knight. Don't do it. Jane Jensen is gonna keep doing better things. Skip this.			"

												Moebius: Empire Rising is the newest game from Jane Jenson, creator of the classic adventure game series, Gabriel Knight – one of my favourites. As I backed this game on Kickstarter, I obviously really wanted to like it. Sadly… I didn’t.In Moebius, you play Malachi Rector, a brilliant antiques appraiser whose social skills are lacking. Malachi is hired by a mysterious organization to do a mysterious job which takes him all over the world. As you get deeper into the story (minor spoilers alert) you find out what you’re actually doing. The group Malachi is working for believes in a “Moebius pattern” where the lives of people in history are being repeated in the present. They hire Malachi to find key historical figures who could bring about an era of stability and prosperity. Basically. Summarizing the plot to this game in a coherent manner was harder than expected.The game does have some good things going for it. I did find the game occasionally enjoyable, especially at the beginning. The dialogue was decent, as was most of the voice acting. The background images were pretty and the music was good – very evocative of Gabriel Knight. There were also some unique kinds of puzzles. As your main objective in the game was to relate people to historical figures, one of the main puzzle types was matching up their characteristics. This was both interesting and educational, though once I had done it a couple of times, I figured out that just guessing was often quicker than reading though all the information.My favourite feature of the game was a button that highlights all objects on the screen that could be interacted with. While using this could be considered easy-mode, I found it incredibly useful. Pixel-hunting for objects is not something I’m interested in doing, and this was totally prevented.There were a few things that started out as positives, but turned into negatives. Adventure games are often far out there in terms of reality and physics. Adventurers often walk around with shovels, coffee tables and iron statues in their overcoats. Where do they put them? In this game, the protagonist often refused to pick things up until he saw a need for them. At first, I applauded that. Why would you walk around with a can of motor oil? But after a while, it got very frustrating. For example, at one point I needed to get into the VIP tent at a political rally. In order to lift a pass off someone I needed to go back to my apartment to pick up an mp3 player I hadn’t been able to pick up earlier. Once I used that to bribe someone to be a distraction I needed to go back to the apartment again to pick up some scissors. When I successfully stole the pass and had to go back to my office to get some superglue that I also was unable to pick up before. Then back to the rally to get into the tent. That’s a lot of back and forth that could have been avoided. Not picking up every single item in sight makes sense, but as it turns out, that kind of realism in video games is not a great idea. “How irritating” Malachi remarks. Tell me about it.Items and inventory use wasn’t all bad though. I enjoyed that you were never overloaded with items and there weren’t any nonsensical item combination puzzles. No cat fur mustaches in this game.Some of the puzzles fell flat. Malachi was able to analyze people to learn more about them, similar to the recent Sherlock Holmes games. Sounds like a neat idea, but in practice it mostly involved guesswork and the process of eliminating the most ridiculous options.The most unforgivable part of the game was an excruciating 50+ screen underground maze at the end. There’s only something to do/interact with on maybe 5 of the screens. The rest is just running through dark tunnels. Considering how the rest of the locations in the game (like France, Egypt, New York) have only a handful of screens, dedicating so many to this awful, dismal, repetitive place is almost insulting. Who could have possibly thought this was a good idea?Moebius runs about 8 hours long. Though there were parts of the game I enjoyed and I’m glad I finished it (other than that awful maze), it was disappointing overall.Rating: 4/10 – The story was so-so, the characters were a bit flat and some of the animation work was downright bad. The game lacked the charm and historical detail of Gabriel Knight and really did nothing to advance the point-and-click adventure genre, or even replicate it at its height.			"

												Wow just wow...Was given the privilege of reviewing this before it officially came out for my site. Basically put, It has been a long time since I have played something so damn interesting, especially due to a captivating storyline.Furthermore, it tries something unique and creative due to its paranormal setting. It feels fresh.If you love adventure games like The Wolf Among Us, or good stories in general, be sure to give this a go. Malachi IS A BADASS! MS. JANE!!! I WANT MORE ADVENTURES FROM THESE TWO!			"

												Moebius: Empire Rising is a new Adventure game created by Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight series and Gray Matter) and Phoenix Online Studios, best known for Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller and a never-finished fan-made game entitled The Silver Lining, which was based on the King's Quest series.So it's a decent pedigree (at least as far as the writing is concerned), but is it actually a good game?In my not-so-humble opinion, no, it's not. I wish it was, but unfortunately, the game barely qualifies as bargain bin fodder. I'm not someone who hates Adventure games, either. I grew with up Sierra Online and LucasArts games, so I've played a bunch, both good and bad. It's a shame, but this title is within the ""bad"" camp.What's bad, you ask? Basically everything except the story. Phoenix Online Studios took on a lot more than they could handle. It's too bad the game suffered for it.My reasons for the ""thumbs down"" review are below:Character Models: The characters look gangly, with unusually thin arms and legs. They have high armpits and long, thin fingers. They also move awkwardly and their faces contort in odd ways when speaking. One character in particular looks like she's snarling when she speaks. Animation: The characters move like stiff dolls at best. While I didn't expect motion capturing or super high budget work, I'd have liked to see animation beyond what would be normal in the early 2000s.Textures: I know some AAA games have poor textures at times, but virtually every texture in this game is sub-par. Honestly, it looks like a game made in 2005 (and even that's being generous). Skin looks flat, hair doesn't move, clothing is blotchy, and cars look like plastic toys. In addition, background characters look like low-res VGA placeholders. Environments: At first glance the environments don't look too bad. They're 2.5D and quite decent. When you look closer, however, you see the low-res work, jagged contours of objects, poorly placed light sourcing, and ridiculously inept shadows. Seriously, the shadows under Malachi and Gretchen in the antique shop make them look like they're floating. Plus, the shadows are blocky and tend to shimmer. It's like looking at a PS2 launch title.Audio: The music is quite good (I actually left it on, whereas I usually turn music off in games) and the general sound effects used work fine. It's when the characters speak that it all falls apart. The voice actors deliver their lines in a flat, awkward fashion, as if the voices were created by a synthesizer. The only voice actor who was good at all was Malachi's, which is good I suppose considering he's the main character.Options: Not much to speak of, but it's a Point-and-Click Adventure game. It's not like FOV or SSAO would really matter much. That said, there is an option to choose up to 8x antialiasing, but it doesn't work. Jaggies are ever-present in the game.When you start the game, a launcher appears and you can set the resolution and graphics quality (although your options only range from ""fantastic"" to ""fastest""). You can also decide if you want to play the game in a window or full screen.One thing that's odd is there's a tab for input on the launcher, only it's meaningless. It doesn't affect a damn thing in the game and gives the impression that a gamepad could be used. It can't, and I have an Xbox 360 controller hooked up, so it's not like I need Xpadder or any other piece of software to ""trick the game.""Interface: It's all mouse-driven, with the exception of a few hotkeys. You can also press F5 and F7 to bring up the save/load menus. Like classic PC games, these are real manual saves (not quicksaves or autosaves or checkpoint saves!) and you can even name them. Story: It's a Jane Jensen game, so it'll have an interesting storyline. I haven't finished the game, but if I had, I wouldn't go into detail here. Doing so might accidentally post a spoiler.I will, however, say that the characters aren't that likable, especially Malachi, the protagonist. He's a jerk and not a charasmatic jerk like Gabriel Knight. End Thoughts: If you play this game, do it for the story. Try to ignore the mess that makes up the rest of the game. I'd also strongly urge anyone interested to wait for a sale, preferablly one that's at least 75% off the normal price.			"

												Initially enjoyed it. It was interesting and my kind of setup to a story, then it got uninteresting halfway through with unlikable characters and mixed plot points. The story was really going nowhere. I didn't mind seeing the ending really, but I am sure that wouldn't have given me closure. Of course, I don't just choose not to see the ending but an adventure game curse fell on me. Yes, I call it that because they only exist in point and click adventure game. Rant Over. Regret my purchase.2/10			"

												I loved this game.  Definitely old school adventure game.  May not be the best game in this genre or not as good as Gabriel Knight, but I thought it was entertaining and good, nonetheless.  I refuse to nit pick this game because I miss this style of games.  Not enough of them are made anymore.  Therefore I appreciate it when one is made and will not be picky about reviewing it.  The game was fun, not too easy but not impossible, the plot was enjoyable, the characters were likeable and played well, the look of the game was nice, and gameplay was easy to understand.  I'd like to see more from Moebius or at least more from this style of gaming.			"

												Characters' animations and a couple of subtle game freezes spoiled a little bit this awesome game. Despite of these two bad points I really, really enjojed Moebius. It's a good adventure itself, but the investigation and storic-matching mechanic make it unique and absolutely worth playing.And on top of that there's Jane Jensen. If she's involved, even as supervisor, there's a good story behind it.If you like Moebius, you should take a look at Gray Matter and Cognition: an Erica Red thriller too.			"

												This is a commercial failure with top-of-the-line writing by one of the industry's most veteran adventure creators. If ever there was proof that the mainstream market has given up on this genre, it's that this wasn't one of its year's top sellers. I can't recommend it enough. A brilliant story, solid acting, fun puzzles, investigation mechanics... if none of that means anything to you, just quietly go back to Doom.			"

												I got this from a bundle and wasn't expecting much taking into consideration all the bad reviews.Well, while it's not among the classics of the genre, but it's pretty fun all things considered. The plot is very silly, but quite consistent in its stupidity, and the cutscenes are very low budget. But the pacing is very good, the story is b-grade fun, and the puzzles are very logic, even if a bit easy.Ignore the reviews (except this one of course). Play it.			"

												A good game! only ciritcism would be puzzles are a little too easy. It has an interesing main character that will annoy you intially but will come to love. It has the Jane Jensen vibe thoughout (think Grey Matter) and the soundtrack took me back to Gabriel Knight 1 days. So I really liked it.			"

												This is a great game. The characters are well done with design, development and voices. The story is intriguing and with good development. The music is good and changes well with the setting. There are many great jokes with the characters as well as a more serious story. This is a game is very enjoyable and great fun. Malachi is essentially a Sherlock Holmes of antiquities.			"

												So this game was developed by the same studio that worked on the excellent Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller. If you played that game, chances are you really liked it and are looking forward to this one. That's why I have to warn you that if you expect Moebius to be Erica Reed's spiritual successor, you'll be incredibly disappointed. It pains me to see that the amazing Jane Jensen worked on Moebius. Nothing about it works. The graphics are terrible, the animations are atrocious, the conversation options are there just for the sake of you having to talk to people, and the puzzles are downright boring. There's even constant backtracking involved, which in this genre is unforgivable. The story might seem promising at first, and sure, the deductive powers of Malachi are an interesting element, but that's about it. The more you progress, the more you realize this game is not going to take you for a fun ride. It's boring, it's painfully slow, and it ends on an anticlimactic note. Oh, Erica Reed, how I miss you!			"

												Bitter, crushing disappointment. I loved the Gabriel Knight series of games, as well as Jane Jensen's early forays into adventure games like KQ6 - so I had at least moderate hopes for this game. I got it I believe as part of a kickstarter as well as the GK1 Remake, which is another story.This game made me realize just how important the vibe of a game is to the player as well as the writing. Gabriel Knight was beautifully written (and admittedly a little hammy from a not so rose tinted perspective) - but it had ATMOSPHERE. Through the myriad of jerky animation and excruciatingly annoying voice acting - this game felt lifeless, cheap. I couldn't get past the first few screens. The interface was also painful. I had to turn it off.And the thing that frustrates me most - is that the team behind Moebius seem to see all of this as less important than the writing itself. They crush criticism on their forums, and hide behind a screen of people who are able to let nostalgia light their gaming fire.Well guess what, guys? I'd prefer pay whomever owns the rights to the original Gabriel Knight and buy it again, than play either this or GK2014. Because they both suffer from a huge lack of quality control. The original Gabriel Knight may be low resolution and 20 odd years old, but it was a beautifully crafted piece of storytelling from the ground up. You may say that budget is an issue - then make smaller projects so you can produce higher quality content. Because until I see something of a higher calibre, I'm never spending my money on anything Pinkerton Road makes again - and will actively campaign against it.			"
