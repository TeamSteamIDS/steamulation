												At first, the atmosphere seemed to be very immersive, but soon you are faced with terrible character models and awful dialogues, which kinda break it. The story is quite interesting, although simple. The game is pretty confusing too. Lots of times it gives no clues as to what you have to do, and sometimes you have to do some pretty weird stuff, like hanging an amulet on a random statue, or pickpocketing a key without even being told you can pickpocket.  I am a huge fan of werewolf related stuff, which is why I bought this, but I was rather disappointed. Overall it isn´t terrible, but it feels a lot like a test or early access game, so with a few updates it could become pretty decent, since the main idea and settings are great.			"

												I was hoping this game would be good. Unfortunately, I can not in good conscience recommend this game. First off, the map is horrible in the game. It doesn't tell you where you are, where you need to be, no hints, nothing. You stumble through the game with absolutely no direction or hints. I can overlook the horrible character models and cheesy dialogue, but the whole ""Stuck wandering around in hopes that i'll stumble on the right thing"" is a big turn off.*Edit* Sorry if my personal opinion of a game offended anyone. Although I shouldn't have to defend myself, I will. I'm not a ""noob"". I've been gaming since the original Mario Bros. and Zelda. Games usually tell you where you are on the map so that you have a general sense of your surroundings. No, I don't like things handed to me in a game, but some direction would be nice. I love trying new games and I love challenging games, however, this one just didn't do it for me. That is MY opinion which I am entitled to. If you don't like it, then skip over it and move the hell on with life. Don't bash someone just because they have a different opinion  (on a damn GAME I might add) than you.			"

												okay first off i wanna say that i kinda dig this game, its got an interesting story that doesnt give you many hints so you have to figure things out for yourself which can get kinda frustrating. BUT...this game is so new and poorly develped that it has so many glitches. these glitches will scare the sh*t out of you. no lie. they happen completely at random and are not expected at all. these glitches include but ARE NOT LIMITED TO:-walking up to NPCs that are scared of you because they know you are a warewolf and a LOUD, GLITCHY, WEARWOLF GROWL PLAYED ON FULL BLAST QUEUES IN. so at first its like peacefull music and then LOUD SCARY GLTICH NOISES FOLLOWED BY RAPID NPC MOVEMENTS. -character bugging. at times after completing cirtain quests sometimes the charachter your supposed to talk to, glitches out and becomes only HALF a charachter. His face is missing, the whole front half of his body is missing. its freaky as hell.these are the two biggest things that killed this game for me. I was rather enjoying the game but after being scared sh*tless like that i cant go on. sorry guys, im a ♥♥♥♥♥ but i cant do it. A scary horror game is a scary horror game. this was not ment to be a horror game, the glitches MADE it a horror game.			"

Bad, bad wolfRating: PoorThis game was a bit of a disappointment. When a game implements a certain style and feel it should be done right and with lots of details. This game fails to achieve just that and fails to deliver. It just feels not done and rushed, and those things keep it from being an enjoyable game. A few examples:It starts with the resolution itself, some weird low-res 1000 x 800, not widescreen but not 4:3 either. The graphics are cell-shaded but done very generic and it looks just bad. The effects for water, fire and particles are dx6 or something. The sound is also not very good and sound rather cheap. The voices are rather cheesy and lipsinc is not in sync (understatement).  Music is ok but gets annoying quickly.When you move it feels like you are very small because you are a bit close to the ground. You interact with things when your dot changes to a hand. That's about it what you can do. The story is a bit weird; you wake up outside a castle, run around a bit and faint again, wake up and look at a pre-2000 character model that asks you questions and it feels like they know a lot about you although they just found you outside the gate. Pretty weird.The story path is very linear, just look up things and use then to pass a gate. That's about it. Plenty of better games around and I suggest  you stay away from this 'game'.			"

												This game is terrible.It's horrifically buggy. You can glitch through most ""solid"" objects in the game which sometimes breaks the game. The character models all look like they came out of 1998. A stealth system is entirely falsely advertised, as there are no stealth mechanics whatsoever. Much of the voice acting is horrifically bad.Please, don't get this game.Here's a video on it :D "

												Lazy, unmotivated game design that has built and old school key and lock format game (ie: you must find the key objects or actions to unlock the gate preventing further progression in the plot) with a 3d engine and virtually NO clues or hints in the game about most of what you must do... It's a hair pullingly frustrating game format that most people abandonned in the point and click days. In it's new release state, it also has a long list of bugs, some potentially game breaking, and is seriously lacking in in game options for the most basic things, like screen resolution.The game looks and feels more like a high grade earning school project that demonstrates all the key priniciples in game design without actually embracing any of them and does not feel at all like a finished commercial product... Definitely the first candidate of the year for Worst Game of 2014, but it's not so bad that it will likely retain the title, as there will surely be worse games released by the end of the year.			"

												Let me  start by saying that the developers should be ashamed of themselves for this project. (except the music artists... they did good.)  In no way shape form or fashion at the final stages of development should you all have said, ""Yeah, game looks good, ship it out.""  Were you rushed?  Were you strapped financially?  Those questions are irrelevant.  After a project like this your company should just fold, hand in the towel, and send its employee's elsewhere to find better career opportunities.  This game is TERRIBLE.Now to the meat and potatoes, so we can figure out why its bad.  (I am not even going to give a warning for spoilers, because I think everyone who bought this should fight steam and have them refund their purchase.  Anyone who has not bought it.. DON'T!)I played this game for 2 hours and 54 minutes (approximately) that is from start to finish.  The opening of the game gives you no indicator that the story is even actually happening beyond the main character saying that he needs to go someplace and find someone.  It starts you off in a fashion that someone made a level in unreal tournement where you spawn in a location with no intro.  There should have at least been a cutscene introduction on par with the ending cutscene of the game. (don't get me started on the quality of the ending cutscene, but at least a cutscene to explain what is going on is nessesary!!!)With no true direction (or clue) to where to find your current target objective (due to a lack in informative begining), you might decide to follow the blood trail to a horse.  Thats it for the clues beyond that. You are then greeted with the option to head for the gates, only to be told that you are missing something.  now with no sense of injury or purpose, you then are left to wander the cold wilderness in an attempt to find the corpse of a character that is literally meaningless to the plot due to no introduction or other such information.You are then greeted with yet another way the game decides to illustrate story.  By walking up to the gate, it immediately warps you to a bed chamber and a talk to a literal stick of a human being.  The characters that ARE present in the game, are emotionless and look like they are incredibly dated (probably inspired by 2001 time period character models) HELL THATS BEING GENEROUS!Regardless, the options are bland, they don't have any apparant meaning for either selection of choice, and the voices seem remarkably quiet and uninspired.  And this is constant through the game, when you actually do get choices for dialogue.The game play is dated, adventure games have come along way since this rustic example of old school room escape games.  (even in those games, the items you used to solve the puzzles disappeared out of your inventory.)  Instead, the items you collect kinda serve to guide you as a gauge for how much longer you have to suffer through the game.The tutorial consists of a help file that opens from the options, or in the start of the game.  And even that tutorial does not actually explain some of the mechanics of the game (LIKE THE STEALING MECHANIC!)  Its ambiguous, and not intuitive.  There should have been a small, subtle example of each mechanic as the game introduces them to you, but it never does explain anything in the game.  It doesn't even have a story that really truely explains what exactly is going on.The story is there, but its vague, and rarely seen.  The journal entry literally gives a hint as to your next direction, and that is your only motivation to do much of anything.  Its rediculous.The stealth mechanics are terrible.  There are two spaces in the game where you are actually supposed to hide from the crappy looking werewolf.  TWO.  And one of the doesn't work.  Those two specific instances don't even really add to the tense atmosphere that was supposed to be there.  one of them was out right  broken, and I ended up solving the area, by grabbing the cog, and dying only to appear back at the ladder with the cog in my inventory.  The stealing in the game is effortless and in general unessesary outside of two times due to the lack of need for anymore than 200 gold pieces.  You only need to steal a minimum of 3 times.  And when you do need to steal, there is no indicator as to where and who you need to steal from.  Good luck guessing on a first playthrough.There is no sneaking in the game.  There is no descernable combat in the game.  There are very small amounts of platforming, and the puzzles are actually few and far in between.  Its mostly collection oriented situations.  ""Man I would like an apple."" - go get apple- ""Thanks, here is a key to the door to continue the game."" - rinse and repeat.The music, is good.  The music is actually well done, and probably the only thing worth-while in this game. After this dev team is disolved I hope that the music artist will get a job somewhere else.The end cutscene in the game looks and runs like a damn story board.  The art is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because it looks genuinely un finished.  If you ever watch a story boarding session for disney or something, you will see how this cutscene runs.  Its insulting.I paraphrased alot of what the issues are with the game.  And if you realy want to see how bad it is, then check out my youtube channel for the whole playthrough of the game. In closing, the game is not worth a penny, its clearly an early alpha build at best.  I spent some of my time trying to figure out how to unlock myself from the terrain I clipped through, or figuring out how to get back into the level after moving through it.  Bad game is bad, and this one is just terrible.  Not worth the time, not worth the money, and a disappointing addition to the ever small selection of werewolf titles.Devs, you asked me to play the demo for you, and you got my hopes up, and you got me excited.  I jumped in to green light this game, I spoke highly of it for you people.  And then you do me this.  I am sorry for sounding brutal, but I am honest.  You mislead anyone that believes your description of the game.  Half of the description for the game in the steam advertisement section, is either pulling for strings in an effort to sell the game to folks, or outright lying.  This game is terrible, and I am not happy that I jumped and spent money on this title.  Anyone that bought it, needs to go and demand steam refund the purchase.If you are one of the two people (at the time of this review) who gave this game a thumbs up (despite the 4/10 from one of you), you should come chat with me so I can show you some actual good games to play to put this game into some perspective.  That or I would be lead to believe that you were paid to give your shallow praises for the game.Bad show devs... bad show.  I want my money back.  I would suggest you either take this game off the steam roster, or drop the price to free to play.  This is (at the time of this review) a 15 dollar purchase.  I expect much more from you guys if you are going to charge this much.			"

												This game was an absolute MESS. After the initial... I hesitate to call it a quest because it wasn't, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the game was broken as the key to moving forward (I hesitate to call it a puzzle) relies on a mechanic that the game never really tells you exists. There aren't really any puzzles, certainly none that couldn't be solved by applying a solitary brain cell to them. The only challenging part to this game is finding all the things necessary to complete missions, and that's not a good kind of challenge. It's one that frustratingly made me stay up until four in the morning playing because I wanted to see if it redeemed itself in the end and I knew I wouldn't have the willpower to start it up again if I shut it off. The combat is wholly unnecessary, as you can quite blithely run straight past the guards who are too slow to swing to really do any damage to you and not only don't chase you, if you transform right in front of their bloody eyes and then leave the room and come back, they have apparently FORGOTTEN that the alchemist they're talking to just transformed into an unholy beast right in front of their eyes, making them utterly superfluous. Not helped is the fact that their dialogue (And pretty much everybody elses) is completely phoned in on the part of the voice actors. There are only four characters in this game, counting yourself, and two of them have a whopping THREE LINES, and yet we're supposed to care about them. Oh, and that monster they're always touting? Seen three times in the game. You see it, it chases you, you hide or cut off its path, and then it just gives up IMMEDIATELY.  I regret this purchase. I sincerely, sincerely regret it.			"

												Quite simply, do not buy this game.I found myself intrigued about this game being about werewolves. But the story really fell flat on it's face. There is no real substance or engagement in the very brief storytelling. After being given a screen telling you the controls; you're unceremoniously plopped in a field with no clear objective what to do. That theme continued throughout the game.For being a puzzle based game; the puzzles themselves are easy and short. Having to navigate from objective to objective is numbly frustrating. I found myself consulting the community guides just to find out where to go next, as the game will not tell you. The game itself is very short, easily beaten in one sitting after you understand your objectives. The only real challenge, as I said, is figuring out where to go next on your own with no hints.There are no game settings. You get one setting and that's it. My XBOX controller half worked in the beginning. But, glitch after glitch, I gave up and went back to the keyboard and mouse. And even that didn't fully work. I didn't experience any game-breaking bugs. But, the glitches and sub-par programming will annoy you.I would not recommend this game, regardless of the price. It's too short, minimal story, missing objective tracking and glitchy.			"

												i waited a long time for this game like most people I was quite disapointed. the game play kinda bites game feels very cheap.  while i didnt have many bugs at all. only one crash..  its the story line. There is really none..  You get bitten find a cure. ok..  the map system  is horrible.   not even a icon showing you exactly where you are all it does is highlight the area. Gameplay is boring when you find the potion to  hide you from the werewolves..  they never show up after that..  i didnt beat the game it was too painfull to keep playing with the low rez. how about the werewolf attack sound bug.. no hints to find any objects you constantly backtrack through everything trying to find that one thing to progress.. i could go on and on.. but really i feel like i wasted my life playing this.

Yeah, it's not a Crysis but for such game it's totally okay.-Game engine: 1.bull♥♥♥♥, stupid engine doesnt want me to play this game. Constanly crashing, glitching, and so on.-Game mechanics: 1.♥♥♥♥, go there, take this, take that, go there. After 2nd transformation I started to hate such long unskippable animation.-Game addiction: 10.0, perfect, the only perfect point of this game, I think. Every time it becomes too boring for me - game just throws me on the Desktop. What a pleasure.-Gameplay: 0.0, The only thing in my mind was ""Oh, shi~ another quest. I dont want them, give me the endings, I want to see Credits"". Holy alchemy.TOTAL: -2.5Heh, that was interesting experience for me. Even my love to the indie games and old-school quests cannot help in this particular case. I do NOT recommend this game, and there are some reasons for that.Boring story (surprise, surprise), useless inventory model, stupid Key-Door mechanics which requires the same action (inventory - use key - on door) to be performed several times through the game on the very same door, FPS limited to WASD+LMB and instakill (guards are more stupid than doors), long loading time for such small locations like a guest room (wtf guys, reminds me ""Bloodlines"" when it was just shipped). Hell, I can continue this list and spent even more time than I spent on the game itself.Only music and graphics are not bad in this game, music even nice. And ""memory"" minigame.Sad but true.			"

												This game is hilarious in the same way someone falling down a flight of stairs is hilarious. What I mean by that is it's horrible, but it's still sickly funny in that ""How could someone (FUN Creations) mess up that badly?"". The only difference being that you want to help someone up who's fallen down some stairs, but in this case, the dude is gonna take seven dollars from your pocket. That cactus needle can go fall down another flight for all I care, that was my lunch money.My only observations on this game have been said a million times before, buggy, terrible looking,  voice actin' is pretty bad, etc. Now I always laughed whenever I saw how deep the rabbit hole went in reference to these qualities, but I'm fairly sure not everyone will see it that way. Well, okay, it's soundtrack isn't.... Terrible. Point is, unless it's on sale, I wouldn't get it. Even when it's on sale, I would only get it if you're the kind of dude who likes laughing at bad game design. I guess you'll also get access to it's not so terrible music in the music player, and you can get some trading cards as well... So, um, yay? Maybe send it as a joke gift? I dunno.Of course, this is all my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and see if it's a game for you, but it's certainly not on my reccomendations list (Even if I did enjoy it to some extent).The Bottom Line: Guise Of The Wolf is a game you get for the lelz.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

Posted: February 18, 2014
												I have to get this out of the way first and foremost - I am a HUGE fan of werewolf fiction. Not Stephenie Meyer's shape-shifting pet poodles, or the wolf anthros that plaster Furaffinity, Tumblr and DeviantART; the horror werewolves that made the werewolf the legendary creature it is today. And I'm sure you are too! But I just can't help but feel that this is a cash-in on one of horror's most venerated creatures.When I first started Identity of the Canine, it was good enough for an indie game. The atmosphere of some serious faecal matter was about to happen was great and the controls were intuitive enough that I didn't need to reference the controls at all. Then it came to an abrupt halt when I was rudly told at the front gate that I had to look for some special item. Scrounging around the countryside (if it can be called that) of naked trees with a ridiculous cartoony outline for about 45 minutes, I finally found an axe in the least probable area one would expect to find it: Lodged on the opposite area of the map where the logging cabin was! Suffice it to say that it was one of the most jarring treasure-hunts for the most basic item that shattered the suspension of disbelief. But a voice in my head said, ""Be nice. It is their first game. They at least took your advice to take out the irrelevant jump-scares.""I was starting to wonder why I listened to that voice in the first place until I saw the highlight of the gaming year so far - a poorly voiced Russian princess (who oddly has a Spanish name and British-American accent) with a shocking taste in clothing and historical accuracy, and a comical outline that gave her the hint of a five o' clock shadow. After I finally stopped laughing if only to save my underpants, I began laughing at the dialogue structure. It's so clichèd with the genre and roles of the characters that I had to step out for five minutes to calm down. It's not totally asinine, though. There is a nichè choice structure that at least changed the next piece of dialogue, but for the sake of the chair and linen - I muted the sound. The magic-man behind bars was a similar story, though his voice acting was at least a cut above the rest. The Count wasn't much better than either, and his lines screamed of his role in the story. Probably the most organic lines came from the guard to the front door, and that was just plain flat. But I calmly reminded myself that Shape of the Lupine was still an indie game.I know I said the controls were tight and intuitive enough that I didn't need to look up the controls again, but the gameplay itself was like the graphics - patchy, glitchy and unforgiving at best, and nightmarish cluster-bomb on common sense's front doorstep at worst. Getting chased by the hairy attack dog was a nice shot of adrenaline through the game, but its appearances give you no option to escape or hide other than the linear chase prescribed by the developers. One chase even has you charging TOWARD the werewolf when there are no less than three good hiding spots to wait for the hulking mastiff to pass on. And no less than five times did I think, ""Hang on. There are windows around with moonlight coming through, and I have an axe which smashes through baricades. Why can't I fight the poodle?"" I discovered the answer after being savaged for the umpteenth time: because it's not using your brain. I know that the protagonist is a brainiac in his own little lunch-box, but we, the cruel angels of fate, are not. By this point, I was thoroughly outraged I spent $15 on a game worth about $7 for its cheap laughs and wacky graphics. But brace yourself for a shock, because there are some things that did go right. Just enough to bump its worth up to a possible $8.50.The fact that you can turn into a werewolf, if only for two minutes and in set checkpoints of moonlight, is really what gives a credible note to the game. It was a nice little feature but it sucks in that the only combat takes place in wolf form. Even then, it's you - the unstoppable pet bulldog of The Hulk - against a scared guardsman just following orders. Horror games like Outlast and Amnesia have little, if any, combat, but it's done well! You can run, you can stun, you can hide, you can be savaged and wait for the beasties to pass on post-mortem - not follow blind instructions to the letter by running down a hall and pressing the ""I Won the Race"" button. Taking a chunk out of the guards was oddly satisfying in its own demented way, but I soon felt guilty after killing the most human and realistic characters in the game.I still think it was a damn shame that you couldn't take a chunk out of the characters that mattered to the wearily predictable plot. You have so many stereotypes packed into each character that you can judge their role just by looking at them - the cursed love interest (if you hadn't worked that out within the first ten minutes, you were probably too busy staring at her incredibly well-endowed bosum), the bad guy with a name, the deus ex chamberpot, the bored guard, the scared castle hand, the self-insert know-it-all-but-can't-remember-a-thing protagonist, the.... Oh wait, that's the list. They're so riddled with nits and bullet-holes that it's hard to sympathise with any of the characters. Hard at best and frustratingly difficult at worst, but it is possible. I did find myself at one point going, ""Awww.... Poor Filch."" Though it still doesn't excuse the fact that he only shows up once in a while to say a few lines, give you a book and reveal his backstory, only to leave you hanging for the puzzles. The princess is about as useless as you would expect as anything other than the protagonist's love-interest McGuffin, and the Count's plan was sure to backfire from stage one. I'm sure it sounded great to the drunk, semi-literate peasant farmer who the Count discussed the plans with, but he could have at least planned it with someone along the lines of Caesar or Alexander to get the kinks outFor those cheaky strumpets that skipped right to the bottom: A good game this is not. Good and Likeness of the Wild Tundra Dog just don't mix. Not bad for what it's worth, but just not good! By all means, get it in a sale or for the cheap laughs or if only for the fact it has werewolves in it, but not for something serious.			"

												Well, this game makes it easy to point out its flaws so to make this more challenging I decided to find good things to say about the game!1. It's short. Only have 2 hours to kill? Here you go! I was called away from the keyboard for about half an hour and still managed to get a time of 2.8 Hours on Steam when getting the ""Bad Ending"" achievement2. The falling snow effect looked alright in the courtyard3.  Isabella has large breasts4. Gives a good life lesson ""It helps to have a map.""5. It does not overburden you with options6. It gives the illusion of having Steam Trading Cards (at time of posting while the store page says it does, It does not)7. If you are not into puzzles this is no problem, It only has 3 and one of those 3 is repeated about 10 times!8. You do not have to waste time waiting for NPC's to move, they tend to not move at all or teleportAnd that's all I got for you... Not recommended unless you're a masochist like myself. "

												An exercise in tedium and sloppy gamemaking.PROS:-errr,it ends? and it's pretty short overall,if you follow a walkthrough.-it's good for comedy value,if you get it for free.CONS:-horrible graphics,fake cell shaded stuff all over the screen,with black lines floating all around,bad models,bad textures.-horrible sound,repetitive music,voice acting that's so bad it's almost good (for comedy,that is),weird ambience sounds-bland story,bland characters,I honestly couldn't properly care for anything that happened-bad level design and quests,unless you follow a walkthrough you're gonna be stuck several times,you probably missed an item in a corner somewhere,good luck finding it-bad tutorial,several things aren't explained,and the nonsensical item placement doesn't helpAvoid like the plague,unless you somehow get this for free,then by all means play it for 10 minutes to laugh at the overall crappy blandness that permeates this game.

												This piece of garbage is literally one of the worst things I have ever met on Steam.Graph is like a very amateurish Quake 1 mod. Yes, it looks like a 20 years old engine ruined by keen but dumb kids.Quake 2 has much more poligons. Im not joking!And it has a lot of bugs. Surfaces arent fitting, the ""cell shade effect"" is a bad joke like the whole game etc.Options menu: volume control and language selection. Nothing else. Cant change the resolution or bind keys, cant set mouse sensitivity or anything else.The only reason why its not a big problem is the facth this game is so miserable you wont want to play it anyway.I walked around on the first map 15 minutes cuz the game is so shockingly bad I forgot myself there. After that I left it run in the background to get the cards out of it so any game time beyond that was only for the cards.I got this rubbish from a bundle thats why I can write about it without anger but it doesnt worth 1 cent. If u get a key for free give it to somebody u hate. "

												Pile of $#!^, this game made me a bit convinced when it first came out...as someone who enjoyed werewolves and have been wanting a good game based on the classical tales...I tried to like it, I really did, but there's nothing to like. The controls are unexplained, the storyline is bland, the cutscenes and gameplay are exactly the same in quality and the writing is irritating.Not only that, the developer has been ripping bad reviews from the page, this may not even get to you people..but know that you should, under no circumstance, pay ANYTHING for this game. It would be a rip-off if it was free.			"

												Guise Of The Wolf is easily one of the worst games I have ever played. The idea is not so bad, but the implementation is horrible.Just from the start of the game, you can see that the only options are music/sound and language select. No resolution, graphics, controls or anything. The game has many bugs and glitches, it crashes, and even has performance problems. It has lag spikes on my PC, where I usually run every game on max. The gameplay is really boring, there are a few ''puzzles'' which are almost the same, they are either too easy or make completely no sense. The NPCs do not even move or teleport, they just stay in one place and say 1-2 standard lines. Aslo, their talking animation made me laugh so hard. There are only four characters in this game, counting yourself. The game is pretty confusing too. Lots of times it gives no clues as to what you have to do, and sometimes you have to do some pretty weird stuff. The combat is horrible you can run from the guards as they are too slow and won't hit you, and after you get past them they will quickly forget about you and get back to the work of standing still. If you do choose to fight back and kill them, the game hardly seems to notice. If two guards are standing on either side of a door and you kill one, then transform back into a human, you can speak to the other guard as if nothing at all happened. The most common obstacle you’ll come across (besides locked doors) are locked chests. Each time you open one, you’ll play through the same minigame in which you have four buttons that rotate one or two of the four tumblers in the lock. As a one-time puzzle, this could have been mildly amusing. Instead it comes back over, and over, and over again, never getting any harder or less tedious. The game is also really short, you can finish it in 2 hours... if you can play this game for that long. The map system is horrible. not even a icon showing you exactly where you are all it does is highlight the area. The graphics are horrible, it looks like it was made an decade ago, feels amateurish and unfinished in every aspect. Textures are lazy and all the same, it has no real enviorment effect, other than a crappy snow. The only good thing about this game is the soundtrack, it is pretty nice, however the voice acting is a joke. The cutscenes are not skippable, and it also has big loading times for a game like this.Stay away for this game, don't play it even for free. 2/10. The developers should be ashamed, in my opinion this unfinished game was made to cash-grab from werewolves lovers.			"

Posted: October 10, 2015
												Guise of the Wolf is a first person puzzle game with a cell shaded aesthetic set in a medieval castle where you play as an alchemist tasked with defeating a werewolf. The twist becomes that you are stricken with lycanthropy and after dabbling in some potions, you unlock the ability to control yourself as a werewolf. Its a game that has charm enough to be playable despite being ripe with imperfections such as stiff animations, clipping through background objects, poor voice acting and seeing through the seems of objects just to name a few.The bulk of the game, you're in a snowy castle that does a good job of detailing the look and making it convincing as a real place that someone could live in. There's a kitchen, a dungeon, a main hall, a courtyard and so on. The dungeon has bear traps set for the werewolf, so always look at the brown floor to see the rust colored traps. Stepping on one or any kind of death will restart you at the last frequent checkpoint.There are a few characters to interact with. Some with instructions and other are there just to flesh out an area. They are voice acted and as wooden as the acting is, I'd rather hear it than read it. That's one of the game's issues, hearing the text. Even with the sound cranked up in the settings, the speech from person to person is inconsistent. Some are soft while others are clear.You'll encounter the werewolf a few times where your only choice is to run. There are levers to pull that will spare your life when a gate comes crashing down to separate you. For a budget game, the werewolf's animation is serviceable, but its basic. Every animation is basic in the game, but at least the characters have moving mouths. Almost nothing else moves though. No one blinks, but they seem to breathe by slowly bobbing at the knees.When you become a werewolf, you have the ability to dash and destroy objects like twenty stone statues or barricades. You can even maul citizens to death. To transform at key moments, simply stand in the moonlight for long enough until your character drops to the ground and his arms get longer, grow claws and hair. Its a basic system that lets you get to the next area. Your time as a werewolf is limited, the moon on your screen will time how much time you have left. Its a good mechanic.The game is linear, but you'll still have to search around a bit to discover things like ingredients for a potion or a lever to open a door. You can even see your current objective in the inventory, but its never that far away. Its good if you take a long hiatus from the game.The controls feel like a lot of other games, mouse to look, keys or controller to move. You have buttons and keys to interact, run, a pathetic jump, map, inventory and cancel. Its a game that is self explanatory that keeps you on point and task. It quarantines you in an area until you figure out how to progress. If you try to proceed without doing what you need to, the game will prevent you from leaving.You'll need to look in your inventory, select them and find something to use them with such as giving an apple to a prisoner that could kill for an apple rather than saying, ""Could I bother you for some food? You see no one has fed me in quite a while, in fact you are the first person I've seen in maybe a day."" You'll need an item that breaks down weak doors and drop ingredients in a cauldron to make a potion.The puzzles are never anything that cryptic and solving one will lead you to the next area in fact the game will often tell you what needs to be done and you figure out how to do it. There are switch puzzles, places where you'll need to mix a potion using a list. Just follow the instructions. You can even pick the locks on a treasure chest by clicking four switches to make four tumblers shift into position. Its a fluff mini game, but its still engaging at the same time.As simple as these tasks are, there is a moment early on in the game where you need to realize that you're supposed to pick pocket a guard for the key. This is so cryptic and soon into the game that it can turn people away from the game forever. A different guard comically tells you no one is allowed to pass, but he'll let you pass for two hundred gold. Now go loot the castle. What? That's like having a bank tell you, sorry you don't have enough for an account, but if you rob us, you'd have enough.I have to say the cell shading makes the game stand out in a good way. There are so many games without it, that just look awful. Its better to have something that looks unique and better than cheap. The torches and light affects do a lot to enhance the visuals as well, but upon closer inspection you can see faults with the art style. The black lines are drawn as objects rather than on the textures themselves. So if you put your nose up to something like a book or a bar, you can see black lines floating. One specific giant crack in the wall is just in front of the wall, so if you move, the crack will shift position on the wall. Its nothing game breaking, but its still noticeable.Guise of the Wolf has a lot of noticeable faults. Walking through bushes and chests. When you click on something in the menu or your inventory, you need to move your mouse cursor off it in order to click it a second time. The fireplaces look tiny compared to the beds. Rather than pushing a door, its the handle you need to interact with, even if there is no handle. The alter in the church is up to your chin, as are some of the tables. Some barrels you can only click on their lower half from far away and last, it just looks funny seeing your hand as a cursor on a character's body parts.Its two biggest sins are the cryptic pick pocket leads to frustration and its production values fall short. With better animation, the game would excel to its audience, but it still needs some hint that you can pick pocket. These are both things that could be fixed, along with the visual issues and the menu. There is a good game under all of this that people can still enjoy.While I like the game its tough to recommend with all the hate it gets. I can overlook its faults, because they're all visual and it still manages to interesting to me. The problem is that a few years after the game's release and these minor issues never went away.			"

This game is totally in the alpha state. There are plenty graphic glitches, stucking places and even bugs in it. If you can overlook this problems, you will get a good idea with boring gameplay. The NPC just stand around in any corner and talk 1-2 standard sentences. Some of the NPCs give you a little more text and small easy to achieve quests. In my opinion this game is totally not worth 11,99 € (~15,00$).It feels like this game was made by someone, who had a good idea, but not the endurance to make a good game out of it. I TOTALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN THIS STATE! If the Devs decide to make a full content patch (a really big one), with a lot more life, quests and puzzles in this game and get the bugs, glitches and stucking places out of it, then it would be worth the money. But until then....this games really sucks!			"

												Maybe one of the worst game I've been played. Even though I actually liked the idea of a werewolf game, you only meet it a few times (a number of three).+ The dialogues, the only thing the game still has its value. I mean, ""Helps to have a map."" is so hilarious it could be.+ I actually liked the achievements- Bugs everywhere- See the positive commentary above. The reason why it's hilarious, is that it's sad you can't see or do much in your implemented map. Even though you are in the Dungeon or just in the Count Hall, you can't see your position in the map where you are going or standing.- Voice actors in general- The graphics could've been better- No hints when and how pickpocketing the guards, bad tutorial at all- Sound bug when being the werewolf- The werewolf you encounter is really boring- Boring lockpick mechanismI'll give this game a 1/10. If you want a bad game, buy this. Otherwise, go and play real horror games where you could be frightened or just having a good time.			"

												Do I recommend this game?  Yes, I do, but not in a good way.  This game is bad.  Everyone already knows that.  I recommend it just so you can see how much of a trainwreck it actually is.  The developers even put you into the drama by not having the Steam trading cards for the game and saying they do on the store page.  They have actually gone that extra mile!  That is dedication to being terrible right there!  Finally, just because I am recommending you get this piece o' crap, please do not purchase it at the insane price they are asking.  I personally got it in a Groupees bundle and ended up paying 50 cents for it.  A penny more and I would have been ripped off.  Buy it cheap, gather your friends around and stare in wonder at this anti-masterpiece.  Revel in the developer's disrespect for their customers.  Just laugh.

												There are bad games and then there is pain like ""Guise of the Wolf""... Though the concept might seem quite appealing, the execution is extremely poor.Guise of the Wolf contains several bugs (even almost two years after release) and annoys with a trivial and boring plot, bad textures and  amateurish animations. To me this game is like an unfinished school project and I'm really sorry I wasted money and time on it.			"

												Not entirely a bad game.I mean sure, it'll crash on start, crash during gameplay, and since it only autosaves when it decides to, you'll definitely lose progress.It's wouldn't be such a bad game if the developers spent another year or so working on it, fixing bugs and having the game make it clearer what you're supposed to actually do at various points in order to progress.Oh and don't get me started on the ending. I think they literally spent $5 making that.			"

												I enjoyed this old-fashioned adventure game a lot, despite some annoyances. The problem with games based so much on puzzles is occasionally you bump into a puzzle you can't solve and that brings your gameplay to a dead halt. I ran into that fairly early on, and if I hadn't found a walkthrough, I probably would have stopped playing. The solution to that particular puzzle wasn't ridiculous -- it made sense -- but I doubt I would have thought of it. And it was a lot of fun running around as a werewolf, smashing pylons... until I realized I'd missed one somewhere in that insanely complicated map. It took me two days to figure out which one I'd overlooked! But overall, if you don't mind the 1990s-style graphics, I recommend it.			"

												If you can get past the bugs and horrid voice acting, the story is quite interesting, if you're into midevil/alchemy. In Guise of the Wolf, you play a character who is cursed with lycanthropy, which turns you into a werewolf without your free will. Your main goal is to cure yourself and stop the werewolf who gave you the bite in the first place. Along the way, you learn to control the transformation, to the point only direct moonlight can make you turn. I'll rate the game overall in 5 categories: Replayability: 4/10 If you want to get all of the achivements you need a minimum of 2 playthroughs to get all of them (because there's 2 endings).Graphics: 6/10 Standard graphics, seems like a cartoon set in 2005, but it doesn't impede the experience.Story: 7/10Again, if you're into midevil/alchemy, you'll find this interesting to say the least. Voice acting: 3/10It helps to have a map.Overall experience: 6/10Read total below. Overall: 5/10It's not at all a bad game, nearly all of the negative reviews were due to the fact it didn't release trading cards along with it's innitial release which is sad that's all people care about rather than enjoying the game. If you have a couple of hours to kill (if you don't follow a guide and just play the game normally) you'll find a good experience to say the least.			"

												This is the best game I have ever played.  This is the best game I will ever play.  People owe it to themselves to load up GotW, and I'm a little disappointed Steam/Valve haven't bought it on behalf of every single Steam user.  The game has amazing graphics, fluid animation, wonderful mechanics, the best sound effects money can buy (the 'walking on wood' sound was so good I felt I was walking on water) and an atmospheric, chilling soundtrack.I play this game every day.  Sometimes I pretend I'm actually the main character in person, skulking around the dark, moody castle (my bathroom), whilst other times I pretend to be Isabella and hide from everybody else, no matter how often they get upset and beg me to come out.Here's my take on the in-game characters:Laszlo's sadly dead from the start but that very discovery will make you tear up and suck you into the detailed plot.  Even dead characters here put other games' in the shade.Filch Hoodwink has the misfortune of looking like a creepy child molester and having a name that people often mistake for 'Filth', which doesn't help matters.  It's a shame, really, as all he wants to do is eat juicy, juicy apples.  I've never met anybody that immediately wants to hold a conversation about them, but this man is positively apple obsessed and brings the subject up several times in the game.  He loves seeds too and will hand them out to anybody and everybody at parties.Isabella, friendly soul, insists she'll be nearby and yet shows up a total of three times in the adventure (one of which involves being rescued at the end), for a combined screen time of probably a minute.  Curiously, despite the brief encounter(s) she seems to hint of a possible romance between the pair of you; Filch clearly doesn't do much for her and, frankly, who can blame her?Artemis was born with a permanent Roger Moore-esque raised eyebrow which, I'm sure, led to a great deal of ridicule as a child (but fruitful experiences when he was old enough to discover women).  He has the deepest, villianiest voice I've ever heard which must be annoying when attempting to hide villainy motives.  In any case, I hope his sore throat clears up soon; I recommend Wrigley's 'Lockets' which have a lovely, gooey, honey centre.The guards are all very helpful and uniform (which guards should be!), greeting you cheerfully and pointing you towards your map.  If I found a real guard like this I would want to shake his hand quite firmly for a minimum of no less than five seconds, or until he asked me to stop.Kitchen Wench™.  Unknown motive(s); one suspects cooking food.  Prone to panic.  Prone to face collapsing when killed to death.I refuse to comment on the wolf itself as overexposure will diminish its quite dramatic entrance.  All I can say is this: once you see it, you will never forget.  Isn't that what we all strive for in life?  I know I do.I'd like to address some laughable 'negative' points I've come across, both here on Steam and elsewhere:Stealth.  The stealth system is actually nuanced and in-depth.  Each guard has their weapon on display at all times and an unsuccessful pat down of their bottoms will result in a major tongue-lashing.  I can't explain the sheer euphoria I felt when I managed to steal a key to a dungeon; something I can only claim to have done a handful of times before in real life.  The fact this genre-busting mechanic isn't documented anywhere within the game is entirely the point; you have to get into your character and into the mindset.  Don't be lazy; explore, probe, discover, learn.  Fondle.Now, I'm puzzled by the negativity in regards to the black outlines.  They are perfect.  They are us.  They accurately convey the darkness we all have in our souls which is, presumably, why Filch 'Filth' Hoodwink is completely encased in blackness at one point.  To remove these outlines is to remove a part of ourselves.  Even the scenery needs these lines; nature can be unforgiving and cruel.Another gripe seems to be in regards to objects, and the fact many can be walked through.  All I can say is this: if you were trying to hide from a werewolf, I think you'd be thankful you could hide inside a large rock or tree!Overall, you must buy this game.  This is not a request and it makes me weep to know there are genuine, decent people out there deprived of this experience.			"

												I regained consciousness about the strange lock, my carriage was destroyed by an animal. About my God! My driver was gone, László where you? I wandered at walls of the lock and found it, but it was already dead it something killed. I moved in lock gate  consciousness I regained consciousness in a bedchamber where I was met by the daughter Isabel column. Now I learned all evil what to be poisoned in this lock. I packed the things and I moved further.Having stolen a key from the policeman I got to the cellar and I found the person locked in a cage. The captive was presented Filchem and told that the count locked it and prepares to take control of all. Having released Filcha I met it in kitchen and started preparing 1 potion (here I found 1 transformation into the werewolf) the Lycanthropy. Wandering on a dark vault of this lock in search of ingredients at last I find the necessary. I mix hurrah! my potion is ready. the daughter Isabel column tells truth of the count and gives akonit. All parts of a puzzle met together, and I realized Filch was the first alchemist the comer here he created a damnation by order of the count. After it I rose against Artemis having refused to create 1 more potion.Entering a conference hall I see the count Artemis he tells about all ominous acts... About my God Isabel! She was that werewolf who chased me on the lock, about there is no Isabel... You will pay the count!!! I do the decisive course. Isabel refuses to take a potion, suggesting to recover most.I don't want to tell about graphics, the main thing only here history which I received. My assessment = 5\10			"

												Guise of the Wolf delivers where many AAA titles have faltered. Truly, this is a remarkable breakthrough in the gaming industry. The studio behind this masterpiece have made their entrance into the gaming world and it looks like they'll be sticking around. My sense of smell actually feels heightened and I can feel the tingling hairs on my nipples as they grow tenfold. Can you smell what the ROCK is cookin? I smell a sequel, do you? But I digress, reviewing time baby. The game throws away unconventional and worthless things like clipping. You, the player of masterpieces, will have nearly infinite freedom. No longer will we be limited to roads and paths, this is the FUTURE. The first rock you encounter will have something special cookin' inside of it, so make sure you go in there and look! You won't want to leave-and can't! Next, we do away with voice acting. These NPC's do not know what acting is! They are alive! Each one of them feels like a dear friend and every person you encounter shares a special memory with you. When they are harmed you can truly feel their anguish and pain. Don't even get me started on the wolf. It's just like Jakob from Twilight. Hell, I even named him Jakob. He is unmatched in his CGI cutscenes, nearly ruining every other game character with the sheer awesomeness of an ability called existence. The dialogue is very open and you even have the option to say things in different orders. Sometimes, I forget it's a game and howl into the night. Say farewell to your life because this game truly absorbs you into its dark atmosphere. I won't spoil the plot. I can't even fully comprehend it. Its complexity cannot be adequately appreciated until I complete a novel version for all to read. I've already written 9,001 pages and I've barely touched 12% of the whole plot.You see my friends, you MAKE the plot. The creators took a gamble and allowed YOU, the player of masterpieces, to create your own story. It leaves many plotholes on purpose for your imagination to fill in, making the replay value infinity. Beware, once you start this game you may contract a disease known as ""Large Dong"". I'll let the details be a surprise, but know that you won't want it to be cured. Keep napkins closeby as the female lead is a true Goddess. Her beautiful voice echoes forever in your mind and you'll spend the vast majority of the game not actually playing but searching for this divine Amazonian. She watches over the player giving advice and health/love potions from time to time. You'll fall in love with her soothing voice quickly, so be sure to listen to her. Make sure you check the map often. It really helps, the guards told me so and they've seen everything. Everything! Good luck sneaking by them. Additionally, they're incredibly handsome. If you find that you cannot contain your primitive lust I must warn you to be extremely careful when patting them down. The one named Jesom specifically likes his left ear stroked gently. Try it, you'll get a extra 15 gold. Play on, friends. This game is the greatest buy of my life, and I bought twelve ladyboys for a night.

Guise of the Wolf is a beautiful trainwreck.  Pick it up on sale or in a bundle, procure an alcoholic beverage of your choice, and prepare to laugh the night away.And by prepare, I mean make sure you can actually run the thing.  I had some issues with launch failures at first, and to fix them I had to mess with the DEP settings.  Once it's working, though, it's a fun creation.Oh, also, to pickpocket guards, crouch, get behind the guard, and click.  This is not explained anywhere ingame, and you do need to do it to progress.  It is obtuse nonsense like this that makes Guise of the Wolf the true successor to the adventure games of old.Look, I know it was uncouth of the dev to try censoring TotalBiscuit, but Tommy Wiseau tried the same thing on the Nostalgia Critic and his movie still has fans.  Leave your outrage at the door and laugh at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  You won't regret it.			"

												I love werewolf themed things.  Thus, the reason I got this.  The other reason I got it, was because I thought the artistic touch was well done.  The art is unique and thoroughly different.  Yes, poor dialogue and vagueness abound, but the art style just amazes me.  If you can look beyond the annoying items, and just explore the style, you might find yourself enjoying the environment more than the game itrself.I remember a time I paid $40 bucks for a game, that came with a free game.  Turns out the free game was the only thing I played...so for the $7 or so bucks, it doesn't pain me too much and I at least get to explore the world.I hope this company can make other games like this with better dialogue, map, and so forth.

												Inconceivable!By successfully completing the stages in ''Patience tester 2014'' you can expect to be paid 1.000.000 $ through paypal.As seen in email to ''TotalBiscuit'', ''FUN Creators'' claim to be a huge self-investment company. They hint at having so much money in their pockets, that they would even send lawyers at no cost to you.Created in UE4, it is a successor to Trine 2 in terms of graphics.The story is so amazing, it even features 2 endings. In fact, it beats Mass Effect 3 with the quality of those endings.Ultimately I played it just for a few hours, explored every hole in totally non-dark environment and virtually touched all chests in the game. I could even hump poor and totally not ugly ladies in the form of the beast.This tester does hurt stomach and eyes, but given enough time your body will build up immunity.I would rate it 16/10 and give it the title of ''the best inconcievable game since the creation of human kind'', but I obviously didn't get paid yet. Keep fingers crossed and wish me luck!			"

It took me a grand total of 3.5 hours to finish the game according to Steam, much of which would have been spent wandering about trying to figure out what to do next, so I wouldn't be surprised if a 2nd playthrough only took an hour, but that just means it didn't wear out its welcome.Yes, you will definitely need to lower your standards somewhat to not be put off by the awful graphics, loose controls and vast number of bugs (including but not limited to dead NPC's magically coming to life for the duration of a cut scene, transformations getting you stuck inside objects and the odd CTD), but underneath all that is a fun, casual adventure game, with a few inventory puzzles, a couple of lever puzzles, trying its hardest to break through.

												Such a fun little game, i began playing and now i can't stop! Awesome if you got it for cheap in a bundle like me. But i could see someone would be upset with the simplicity of this game if having paid the full steam price.Theres really nothing wrong with it. It works fine, its pretty self explanatory. Just a fun little adventure with some occasional little puzzles. Love the cool outlined graphic effect			"

												This adventure is simple and story goes quickly. For someone it's a good and for someone not. For me it's good because I never stuck in a storyline. Game has two ends and the more difficult it can only be achieved tamed(??) wolf page, etc, but the game is no indication this part. And it's good. :-)Game control is fast and smooth. There are some graphics bugs like you may go through the trees or stuck in a rock, but it can get out of it jumping and/or crouching. Restart the game is not necessary. In the library, you can by jumping over the books to the top of the shelves xDSave system is quite stupid, but it's nothing terribly. :-) Gameplay is relatively short, about 5-7 hours for both ends.Sorry for my bad english. Google translate FTW! :D "

												This is a fun and puzzling game. It forces you to spend time on puzzles aswell as understanding the object. It also includes multiple endings! So, this game is surely a 4/10, though sadly it aint free :O			"

												You’re start out in a random country side and your carriage gets attacked by some unknown creature. You wake up in the middle of a wintery forest area and start to look for your carriage driver. You eventually venture into the abandon castle to find out you’ve been bitten. As it turns out the Lord of the castle called upon you to create a cure for this curse that plagues the castle.The story is so so. It slowly draws you in and will put many to sleep at the same time. It gives little to no character development and still leaves holes in the story even at the end. For a ‘horror’ based game there is very little horror to the story seeing as it’s either laughably bad or easily defeated. They did take some unique turns in making a monster story, like making potions and cures. But it ends slightly cliché, even with two different endings. Don’t get me wrong the endings are nicely done, but you’ve probably seen them before.The graphics are terribly dated, but that’s nothing new with Indy games. Even with dated graphics many have found a way to make them artistic looking or add some different qualities to enhance their limitations. One good example is Papers, Please. It’s a very stressful take on living in a 3rd world country as a boarder security guard. The graphs are utter crap. However shading and simple design help bring the game to a very dreary vivid world. With Guise Of The Wolf it very much reminds me of Theif 2, except it lacks most things. In many areas where a shadow would be cast on someone it shows them in regular lighting. Also many of the characters appear to be BRIGHTER then the surrounding area for some reason. Then when I’d load the game again it would do a 180 and show the complete opposite of what I stated above. Another thing that stand out is that many of the characters have very very limited movement. The guards of the castle seem to have 3, a women you meet in the kitchen seems to only have 2, and the main bad guy only has 4. Now sure it would be different if they were 2d, but this is a 3d world that would probably be a few more hours of coding to be a little lusher and it drains away from the submersion aspect of video games all together. To a certain extent the graphics set back the experience all together.The controls are wonky to say the least. They start out smooth, but it seems there are too many unfinished parts of the game. So despite how many times you smash down a button it becomes more and more difficult to wiggle out of a glitch in a piece of scenery. Many times I found myself falling through the world or I would get stuck on invisible pieces of something that would render all the controls moot. Other times I would hit a button to perform a action and it just didn’t work. Like say if I wanted to take something. It wouldn’t grasp a clearly graspable object, but when I hit the same button seconds later it would pick up that same object.In the end this was just a bad game. It was a good attempt for a indy developer. However due to the graphics and story it would have probably been higher rated if it was released years ago and put more time into it. With dated PlayStation 1 like graphics and bland story I can’t recommend it, but can’t say you shouldn’t avoid it either. Although I will say the things that they did well, like some of the voice acting, doesn’t do enough to redeem it completely. However for the more ADD ridden gamer they’ll find themselves bored and frustrated. So if you can get it for cheap buy it. It’s worth a few hours if your really bored. Unfortunately in the end it’s easily forgettable and a mildly regrettable experience.2.5/10			"

												When i got this game, i enjoyed it and played it, never had any issues, but when i got off for a while and decided to start it up again, it doesnt even load me in all the way, it shows who the developers are and shows credits and it sits there forever play a short tune the repeats itself. I ask for help on the issue by the developers and they told my that the engine doesnt run on Windows 10, when i bought and plays the game on windows 10. Until they can tell me how to fix the issue or update its launch, dont get.			"
