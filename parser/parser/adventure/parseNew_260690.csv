												This game is actually very, very smart.  Unfortunately, I am quite, quite dumb, and don't know why I even attempt these point-and-click adventures (perhaps the existance of rare ones that I can actually get my stupid head around, like Sam Peters).     But unlike, say, Scratches, which is essentially a poorly-designed imitation of this, I can recognise and appreciate that the puzzles in this are by-and-largely quite sensible and clever, I just honestly COULD NOT BE BUGGERED investing the many hours of my life it will take to complete this without constant reference to a walkthrough.  In other words, I'm happy to concede that in this instance it's not the GAME...it's ME.  Sigh.  The adventure games I ""grew up"" with were more of the early Resident Evil / Silent Hill-ish ilk - that is to say, more ""action-adventure""-ish games - and I believe the more sporadic and generally EASIER nature of the puzzle-solving in such games may have stunted my intellectual growth.  Oh well.  Another failure in life that I will have to tuck under my well-weathered belt...   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this, however, to those of you out there who can rise to this kind of challenge.  It's atmospheric, ever-so-slightly scary and as I said, very smart.  The sound design in particular is very impressive, with spooky noises aplenty and voice acting well above par for a video game from any era, not least of all the one that this is from.  It's a quality product, no doubt about it.  Just depends on your cup of tea, and the head that you're pouring it into. Verdict: 8/10.			"

												I'm used to playing the usual point-and-click games, but this one is definitely one of the bests. Reasons why I loved it with a passion:1) It can be considered horror, but it's not a survival horror game. That means you can't die. Nonetheless, the combination of graphics, music and sounds make it wonderfully in horror mood. It doesn't have the classic ""jump-scares"" (which, for me, is a good thing), but it has an overall eerie atmosphere that had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Now, most players who enjoy survival horror can't feel scared if they know that they can't die, but this game is creepy enough to give me some occasional goosepumps.2) The puzzles aren't too silly or obvious, but the difficulty doesn't rely on the dreadful pixel-hunt for that little object that you don't know that you have to find*. Also, my favorite thing about this game is that there are absolutely no ""inventory based"" puzzles (meaning, combine items from your inventory in the most illogical ways until you find that specific combination that makes no sense to anyone except the developers). Not here. All the puzzles are logical puzzles, things that you solve by finding clues and using your little gray cells. And that's just my cup of tea.3) Even though you can't run (there isn't double click to move faster), I never got to the point of wishing I could. You don't really have to watch your character walking; it's first person view and movement feels natural.4) This quality for the price is unbelievable. I would recommend buying the Dark Fall Collection (1 and 2) together, even thought I haven't played the second one yet; that's how much I loved Dark Fall: The Journal.*Note: I don't particularly consider it a real puzzle using a key to open a door. I'm talking about actual puzzles that you have to solve.			"

												This is a really smart and creepy game! I bought Dark Fall 1 and 2 in a bundle sale a couple weeks ago and I have to say that knowing what I know now, these games are worth their full retail price. First the good stuff: This game has a wonderfully creepy atmosphere. This is an old game, but I think it still looks great. You are alone in an abandoned 1940's English train station, investigating the disappearance of your brother, and what happened to the people who were at the station. You never truly are alone, since there are ghosts all around you, watching you, and sometimes helping you along the way. The scares are all in what you hear, not what you see, which I think is more powerful. There are no jump scares, and there is no fear of dying. However, I always felt a little on edge which says a lot since I knew I couldn't die. There is lots and lots of reading. I personally like that because it fleshes out the lives of the people that worked there, the times in which the events took place, and the story the protagonist is involved in. As far as the soundtrack is concerned, for the most part we get ambient sounds that fit the atmosphere. Now for the potential negatives. I do not consider these things negatives, but for many gamers these may be stumbling blocks. As I mentioned be prepared to read A LOT of material. The puzzles are smart, but not impossible. They range from pretty easy to having to think for a while. While you do have an overall objective (help your brother) the game does not give you mini objectives, forcing you to just jump in and piece it together as you explore the train station and train hotel. YOU WILL TAKE NOTES! There is no in game journal, so be prepared to have a notepad and a No. 2 ready(Does anybody use No. 2's anymore?)! Since you read so much and the game does not tell you what is important or not, you will probably end of documenting a lot. As you progress through the game, it does become more clear on what to take note of. You will also need a notebook to decode two messages you find. Now the only negative I had with the game is that while it is a wonderfully creepy game that is meant to be played with the lights off, its hard to play that way when you need to take notes! However playing this at night with no interruptions has helped keep the mood creepy.So for those who consider themselves true adventure fans (this game really brings out my inner snob), definitely give it a play. This may scare the adventure gamers of today who need the in game journal or constant voice over instead of reading. I thought this was a pleasant challenge and I look forward to playing Dark Fall: Lights Out.			"

												I liked this game a lot. It's very very similar to Myst (probably most like Myst 2 aka Riven) except spooky and about ghosts. There's no jump scares at all which is rare to find. It's just a point and click about ghosts and you basically roam around learning what happened. It's actually really neat if you like reading notes. You pretty much slowly start to learn everything thats going on and get to know the ghosts that are there slowly. A lot of the notes are optional and only give you information about the place you're at but it usually comes together in a neat way. an easy example that doesn't give away much: you go into the womans bathroom and there's a flickering light. For just a split second in one of the flickering lights you see a shadow of a person. Sooner or later if you're looking around you'll find out that there had been complaints a LONG time ago about peeping toms and what not. It's just cool how they work it all together. Everything is there for a reason and easy to overlook, but neat if you focus. big problem though is like Myst is its an old school point and click and expects you to write everything down or just know to click certain tiny pixels you'd probably miss. If you want to keep your sanity play this game with a guide on hand and just use it when you get stuck. overall its pretty cool. Really nice atmosphere and generally spooky without a single jump scare which I appreciate a lot. Play it if you like those old Myst games. If you're not a fan, it might not be best to start here.

												Just finish the game.First of all I recommand this game, it has a really good quality/cost ratio. Cons: Stupid voices talking while trying to read medium to long text.(A pet peeve of mine)Lots of backtracking if you don't take the time to make lot of notes. (Would be great to have all important data on hand like in shivers).Didn't understand how the cue system works (not needed to finish the game)Some anticlimatic long text. (Remove the feeling of danger and urgency)Pros:Really nice puzzles!Nice gameplay (Not just basic point & click)Lot of backstories!Good atmosphere (But Scratches had a better one I think)Good lenght for a ""Ghost hunting"" point & clickGood unexpected endingGood priceA good game that I recommand.

												Now this is a game I would love to see remastered. Despite the horrible old graphics, it is still cool to play. Dark atmosphere. Cool ghost story. Summary: You get a call from a worried friend. He wants you to come to an abandoned hotel. Claims he sees ghosts. Then he disappears.  That message was the last you heared from him. You go to the hotel and , in an oldfashionned way , try to unravel the mystery of his disappearance.With oldfashionned I mean: no ingame notes, no ingame journal...you have to make your own notes.  Got quite some pages written full by now. No clue what I would need or not, but feeling the urge to write down every detail.  I recommend this for a remake with todays graphics! Allready looking forward to play part 2.  I do hope part 2 looks a bit bettter;) but hey it's an old game, can't expect to much.			"

												I enjoyed this game, but would only recommend it to people who are either already oldschool point-and-click mystery buffs - or, like me, want to play a spooky game without having to worry about monsters, jumpscares or dying. I didn't want to use a walkthrough so I probably spent many hours wandering around when in fact this isn't a terribly long game. It was hard to tell what information was relevant, so prepare to read a lot and write a lot of things down with actual pen and paper. The slow exploration of abandoned locations with ghost hunting gear kind of makes this a ghost hunting simulator, which I thought was fun because I'm a big fan of Ghost Hunters. The creepy soundscapes and locations kept the atmosphere tense all through the game, and I really liked the various bits of ghost stories and mythology scattered throughout. I'm looking forward to playing the next game in this series!			"

												There are degrees of puzzle games, and honestly I'm a fan of the straight-forward ones that go HERE IS A PUZZLE and then have you put gears on a board or rearrange a chessboard. Older puzzle games were puzzles unto themselves, where half of the challenge was determining how the actual puzzles manifested in the world. Dark Fall is one such game, so if you're going to dive into this one you'd better have a fresh notebook and a sharp pencil at the ready.Dark Fall takes place entirely in an abandoned train station, where years prior a mysterious event disappeared all the employees and passengers. You're on the trail of your brother, but all you're going to find here are empty rooms and ominous whispers. Delving any deeper into the story will require you to pore over the many letters and newspaper clippings that litter the station, some pages long.You'll need to do that to solve the puzzles, too, or sometimes just to FIND the puzzles. People like to talk about games holding their hands but Dark Fall doesn't even have a hand to hold, just a cauterized stump to wave at you. There's no highlighting, no journal, no clues, absolutely nothing to guide you to your next task in any way. Points of interest are hidden just like they would be in the real world, with lockboxes buried in the deep corners of chests and important documents tucked away under piles of clutter.In fact, just navigating to a point of interest can be a challenge. Dark Fall uses static, rendered backgrounds which you can traverse by clicking to reach a new vantage point. The connections between scenes almost approximate tank controls, with forward and back moving you in that direction but left and right turning your view in place. That means a small room can have eight or twelve perspectives just based on two or three positions, and some of those are just staring at barren walls.I know I'm not doing much to sell the game, but honestly I don't think I should. Not everyone wants to keep meticulous notes on the scraps they find in case they have something to do with an obscure puzzle an hour later. I certainly don't, but I recognize that for those who do, Dark Fall delivers exactly what is expected. With conventions dating from the Myst era, the challenges are more similar to puzzling out an ARG than clicking though a modern adventure. And I will give points for atmosphere, because some haunting sound design made even the decades-old renders creep me out a bit. If you're looking for a real challenge in your puzzles this will deliver, just be sure you know what you're getting into.			"

												A Classic Myst-style supernatural mystery. Very decent story and interesting enough to keep your attention until the game's ending. Although be warned that the ending is a bit of a let-down and actually quite bland compared to the story leading to it. Anyway, you'll get a decent 7-8 hours of adventuring here if you're good with this type of games. The puzzles are never too obtuse or complicated to solve and you have a chance to freely explore the different environments and find your own clues. Be sure to keep pen and paper around as you will be jotting down a LOT of clues and pictures and notes. This game truly makes you feel like a paranormal investigator who is trying to get to the bottom of a very intruiging mystery. A wealthy amount of notes and diaries flesh out the miriad of different residents of the haunted hotel. The game looks dated and does not run in widescreen but that is not the point here. I still got chills down my spine every time I stepped into the hallways of the derelict hotel. The detail in every nook and cranny is very impressive and does not show any sign of true aging. The use of sound is limited yet strong and to the point. I loved every bit of audio this game had in it. If you are looking for pure horror then this game will be a waste of your time. However, if you want a very atmospheric and spooky adventure classic with good story and challenging yet fair puzzles give this mystery a go. I'm very sure you'll appreciate it if you choose to take it slow and enjoy the full story.			"

												-this review may or may not contain spoilers-i am not a fan of the genre, actually i rarely play horror-adventure games, i first played this when i was a child and never finished it after i got stuck at the very beginning, after many years i find the chance to buy and finish it,  and i just gotta say this game is really hard to keep up, atmosphere is very nicely created, and its kinda made me keep up notes about the stuff in game (which i liked the most) , a bit disappointing at the end but the thing is you dont know what the hell you supposed to do at first, you gather and learn everything piece by piece, the game doesnt even have a menu except save / load / exit buttons, and this makes the game interesting.if you look up to walkthroughs or youtube videos, well you will completely ruin all of the stuff the game has to offer.you gotta use your brain to get somewhere in this game , you gotta sit and write notes, study the game by reading every piece of paper, sketch the symbols you found and  build the story by connecting the dots yourself.as i said before the game disappoints a bit at the end, but it is a point and click game so i wont judge the game about its ending.that music(the one at the main menu) is still ringing in my ears after all those years.tl;dr if you are going to buy this game, know this you are either going to hate this game and treat it like a garbage, or you will love this game and memorize every aspect of it.

												Note: I played this game after playing Dark Fall: Lost Souls, which I'm sure is effecting my feel of the game.It's a fun and challenging point n' click puzzle game. But the story for me kind of lacked anything interesting.  It was more of a ""Oh cool more x character background!"" Then I was like ""What is going on??"" I also never really felt like the puzzles were rewarding.  Mainly a decoding part were I wasted time decoding the whole message just to be like ""Welp I already know this."" The story, though for me was lacking, did a good job presenting itself at least.  It is a pretty game for a 2002 game. Finally, just because it says ""Horror-adventure"" in it's about I have to say, it's not that scary at all. And this is coming from someone who refuses to have a TV in their room at night and hates being in a dark room. I was waiting for something thinking 'well it said horror', but other then some moans, random chatter, and the annoying phone...nothing really screamed horror even to me.  Also, if you don't like writing stuff down and keeping track of things then this game is so not for you. Almost anything you do needs to be remembered (Therefore written down if you aren't the best at remembering words and what not.) I also felt the ending a bit lacking but I won't get into why because I don't wanna spoil anything.Over all, I just didn't find this game enjoyable enough to recommend it.  And if you really wanna get it, I would suggest waiting til a 50+% discount...			"

Posted: September 14, 2016
												No spoiler review. Helpful hints for beginners included.Dark Fall: The Journal is the type of adventure game that I really love. It's Myst-like in that it presents the player with an environment to explore, provides minimal instruction, and allows the player to wander and gradually begin to put pieces of the story together. It is an exploratory journey first, and its atmosphere bleeds through the screen because of its setting: an abandoned English train station with attached hotel. Great sound design, detailed environments, and some well performed voice acting create a fantastic sense of dread, without resorting to cheap (and highly overdone) jump scares. You really feel like you're exploring an abandoned location. Within that rotting an beautiful environment lies the focus and goal of the game, which the player is not given at game start, they are left to read journal articles, newspaper clippings, NPC notes, and the building itself in order to understand what is truly going on. With some footwork, a keen eye, and logic, the player should begin to see a pattern emerge, and then they'll be solving puzzles, and uncovering the mystery of Dowerton Train Station in no time.With that said, I will also comment on the difficulty of this game. Dark Fall doesn't really offer its players any support at any time. There are, obviously, many walk-throughs and guides the player can access on the internet nowadays, but the true adventure game fan would do everything in their power to avoid going that route. I consider it the absolute last resort to use anything resembling a guide, and only after several hours of wandering, experimenting, hoping, and piecing illogical strings together, in the hopes of that elusive 'aha!' moment. If you're a fan of these types of games, it's those moments that you play them for. I'm ashamed to say that I used a guide at two points during this game, and I immediately felt guilty aftwards, though I was surprised at the solutions. This is a very challenging game, in some sections. The difficulty isn't necessarily in the puzzles themselves, but in the execution, perhaps limited by the technology of the days when this was programmed, or in some oversight by the designer. Some rooms are difficult to fully explore unless you swing your mouse around on every section of every room, looking for the right batch of pixels to activate a piece of furniture, or locate a necessary inventory item. Also, the inventory items aren't obvious at first, and using them may catch you off guard; when your mouse arrow becomes a wrench this is when you need to use an inventory item. Sometimes it's just best to experiment with clicking on the inventory items anyway, even if you're not sure. Also, sometimes, using the item in the correct spot can be very difficult and sometimes frustrating. I think these are all fair criticisms, and could certainly be improved in some form of rerelease of this game, though I don't think it really needs one. Being a game that was written, built, and designed by a single person, Dark Fall is a top notch, wonderfully atmospheric horror adventure game that is perfectly designed for the slow-burn weird fiction fan. Highly recommended with the following caveats: - Go slowly, and expect anywhere from 10-20 hours of gameplay.- Scour everything, every room, and every location for anything you can find. You will be visiting and revisiting many of the same rooms fairly consistently. I kept a room log for each floor with the items that were in each, and anything of note that may be important later. It was very helpful. But really, move your mouse around and point it in places you wouldn't even expect there to be something to interact with - there probably will be here.- Take notes, lots of them. Write down anything that you think may sound important. There is a lot of story in the game, a lot of characterization of the NPC's, and a lot of environmental details that don't necessarily lead to any specific puzzle solutions, but you may be surprised here or there by something that didn't seem important at the time. This game has journal in the title, and you should be keeping one filled with notes as you play. You'll be proud looking back on it afterwards when you complete this epic quest. - And once more - go slow. Enjoy this experience. It's worth it. With Autumn coming, and the cold, dark, days of the year approaching, I can't think of a better game to sit and work your way through, especially with a friend or two. This is a great and very rewarding experience.			"

												If you're into point and click adventures/puzzles, this is a pretty good one. I remember playing it as a kid so when i saw the combo deal of DarkFall 1 and 2 i had to pick them up. It was pretty fun. The puzzles were good and well designed and weren't so obtuse that you need a guide to get through them. The story is very interesting, and each note or letter you find makes you feel as though you're slowly fitting together the pieces of a big puzzle. The characters are interesting, even if you're interactions with them are limited to sorting through their belongings. The voice acting could use some work, but it's a pretty old game so I cut it some slack there.			"

												I've been PC gaming since the early 90's so I can appreciate a game like this. In fact playing it has been more relaxing and engaged my brain much more than a lot of newer stuff. Pure genius. Like a graphic novel that you navigate the pages yourself and piece the story together. There was just one item that was hidden in a silly spot. I would have found it eventually but I work too much and have no time so had to give in to a walkthrough. O:) Starts off so easy but as you get into it, old skool graphics aside, it can give you goosebumps. Can't wait to play the second Dark Fall. Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good detective game.			"

												Firstly, I am playing on windows 10, I have had no problems at all but i see others have. Saves work fine but there is no auto save which I think people may have expected.TL:DRRECOMMENDED, Buy it now regardless if on sale or not!!Higlhy recommend for those who have patience, do not mind old graphics and are willing to REALLY think, this does not hold your hand, it is a supernatural mystery with a fair amount of reading, it will leave you scratching your head often.It is eery and really quite indepth as you piece together all kinds of evidence to get to the bottom of the mystery. I have not yet completed it but if you loved the old games that were story driven and dont mind using your brain you will love this game.THE LONGER REVIEWI have always lived in sussex, I recognise a lot of the locations mentioned (the main location is fictional however) so this was like playing a mystery game set in my area which is a personal thing to me that I loved.The graphics are very basic and very old but the story is so involved and gradually gets pieced together with all kinds of snippets of information.The sound and audio is excellent, it isnt used often but used with effectIt is a great ""dectetivy"" game, its not that scary but it is definitely very eery in places and has the odd jump scene too it.It is a game to take your time over, impatient people or people who do not like puzzles within games probably wont like this.If you want your brain to be tested and want to learn the back stories of the characters to get to the bottom of the mystery then I cannot recommend this enough.It is highly beneficial to make notes on paper/text doc etc to save you some backtracking!!I have played the lost crown which i will go back too and wont comment on here but its the same people, the game writers clearly have put passion into this game as it has a rich amount of information, some of which ""seems"" to just flesh out the lore of the game while other bits and pieces prove to be subtle yet crucial to understanding.It can feel a little overwhelming at first but once you immerse yourself in the story it becomes addictive.The game writers clearly have talent in this genre and a passion for it and I look forward to any games they make in the future, I WILL be buying themPROS:Great story: The creators appear to be invested in this game and show a love of building the background ""lore"". The story itself unfolds at a good pace and you really will feel you want to learn what happened.Atmospheric: Eery in places, play in darkness, it is not that scary, more atmospheric which is more immersive than lots of inane ump scares.No hand holding, you really have to think in this game, some of the puzzles are really quite tough at first but with htis comes satisfaction when you solve them.CONS:Graphics: Obviously this game is ""old"", the graphics were probably only average when the game was released and now of course they are dated, they are still good enough and you are never wondering what something is supposed to be, they are functional but I mention this as a con as a lot of people wont like it due to this but this game is not about the graphics!Movement: You cannot use keys, you have to click on the arrows on the screen. Probably the ONLY thing about the game i am not too fond of.I have tried to be objective, I cannot really think about any other cons to this game.If anyone wants to ask questions I will answer them, I do not give spoilers.

												Another Myst like game. You have to take note of all the clues, follow the story carefully as it unfolds and of course as in Myst you have no have no idea what your goal is right away. I never cared too much for those games where you get no clue as to what is going on, you have to figure it out yourself and you don't know the story or what your goal is until you figure it out but it's an ok game. Got it on sale so that is a plus. Plenty scary at times, but nothing nightmare inducing.			"

												Want a bunch of screamers and jump scares? Want blood and guts? You won't find them here. This isa classic horror story a la 7th Guest. It reminds me of Myst too. Perphaps the developer had some of thosein mind when he made the game.Defenitely recommended for those who like atmospheric and enganging adventure games. You will have toread, but it's not too bad. Definitely not as bad as Black Dahlia. Watch for the unexpected ending.See you in Dark Falls 2			"

												I'm a fan of point and click first person adventure games...even horror one's, but they have to make sense.  The Darkfall games are indeed creepy at times but the scariness subsides when you don't know where to go or what to do next.  Frustration sets in and you're forced to use a guide to finish, which ruins this game for me.  You are constantly walking around the station looking for things to click on next even after you've already been in a certain area.  Backtracking is a huge deal in the DF games and personally I can't stand that.  The old pre rendered graphics don't bother me...its the lack of an explanation of what to do next that irks me.  With that being said, I don't think it's a terrible adventure title, I just couldn't get into it. Animations and sound bits will constantly recycle if you keep clicking on things, even much later in the game. For example, clicking on a portrait in one of the rooms will play a sound bit from a ghost. Clicking back and again on the portrait will just recycle the sound bit over and over. You'd think that ghost would get tired of saying that same line over and over. Just stuff like that ruins the immersion for me.  Get this and DF 2: Lights out only if they're on sale.			"

												I came across Dark Fall: The Journal while looking for games similar to Scratches (another excellent horror/suspense point-and-click) and I'm really glad I downloaded it and gave it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised by the rich story and immersive atmosphere. The game certainly has a Myst vibe to it; the player feels completely isolated and must put together the answers to puzzles without much in-game guidance. There is a small hint feature in-game but it's rather unpredictable and not particularly useful toward the end of the game. If you like this old-school type of adventure game, then I would certianly recommend playing Dark Fall. If you are not into puzzles or prefer games that offer a little more hand-holding this game is probably not for you.			"

Ghost won't come easy.Literally this game is a ghost hunting adventure. It is a point and click adventure with a lot of examination and walking around a haunted station and hotel. You'll have to take notes during your adventure to set the ""ghosts"" free in this game. The game plays like an older first person point & click and that is exactly what it is, don't forget that you have a game that is already twelve years old. It wasn't a smash hit back then, but it is a decent game nonetheless. If you like mystery adventures give this game a try, you might be genuinely surprised by the game. Also because of the ghost hunting fad of the recent years this game might also catch a nerve with fans of those Series. The game is decent, as I already said. Decent means that it has no surprising features, but also that it's quite solid fare, nothing to grind teeth on. The riddles can sometimes be hard, but that is also no surprise to a game from the past, games back then were far less casual. Sound and graphic are of course dated now, but still good enough to keep this game in your library and actually play it. I can recomend this game, but you have to be an adventure aficinado to actually enjoy this game, more you also have to be a retro adventure fan and you require to have quite the energy to sit the game through. This said it's thumbs up by me.			"

												Game has some genuinely creepy elements to it, but it amounts to one of the hardest adventure/puzzles I've ever had the pleasure of going through.  Just like it was 1991, grab a pen and a notebook, and start taking notes about all the things you see and hear in the strange hotel.  Sure, there are walkthroughs and such that cna do this for you - but this game must be played as though you are a genuine detective or you will definitely miss out.A word of caution - this is a strange game without clear direction.  The solution to the puzzle and the pieces you need to solve it are hidden well.  There is absolutely zero handholding.  Good luck.			"

Reminded me a lot of 7th Guest which was a truly excellent game... in it's time. 256 colours and low res graphics simply don't do it for me anymore I'm sorry to say. As if to further emulate that nostalgic time, the only way I could exit the game was to Alt-Ctl-Del to task manager and crash out of the game. I really wanted to like this, but it's just too primitive for me.			"

												Really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys point and click adventures and doesn't mind some thinking. However, the game is TERRIBLE at explaining things. My advice would be if you want to play this to have a pen and paper to hand and write down EVERYTHING that you can. Often there will be some tidbit in some random book about some random character and that will actually be crucial information. Whilst this is not necessarily a problem, it isn't even mentioned from the outset you need to either have a notebook and pen to hand or be rainman. It's extremely frustrating to have to go back and re-read through everything (and worse, repeating completed puzzles - unforgivable!!!) just because there is some random word(s) you will need to remember.Aside from those few nags GET THIS! It creates an awesome atmosphere and if you get into the storyline and follow it to the end it can be really satisfying. A respectable 7/10			"

												People who compared this to Myst are out of their minds.  Honestly, I'd rather be beat in the head with a hammer than to have to play this game any more.  I'm sure it's fine for people who like such things, but there are just loads of huge documents to read and strange puzzles with little to no direction on what to do.   When I got to the substitution cipher and realized I needed pen and paper, I lost all remaining interest. I explored the entire hotel in less than half an hour.  Maybe there are places you go after you solve the disappearances that took place in the hotel.  I have no idea.  But from what I can tell, you'll be going back and forth, room to room, retracing your steps for hours in this small, ugly hotel.  All to solve a few obtuse puzzles.			"

Just No. Horrible intro Very boring Quite aimless Not scary in the least Totally mediocre audio Too dark to see much No subtitles/text at all Extremely primitive gameplay controls Counter-intuitive game mechanics Too low-res (on 1920 x 1080) ""Story"" is fragmented and lameFootnotes to above Someone supposedly speaks over the telephone with you, rather unintelligibly, in a thick British accent. There are no subtitles so all I managed to catch were fragments of the conversation. The voice acting is unbelievably horrid. The man implies that something malevolent is going to get him, and that it's getting closer and almost reaching him, but yet the way he speaks sounds dead calm and monotonous, with zero sense of urgency. This, coupled with the absence of any graphics or animation (except seeing a map of London appear), made for a stupefyingly unexciting and underwhelming start to the game. Once you reach your destination, all you do is wander around very dimly-lit places. There is the voice of a supposedly ghost boy or whatever at the start to guide you a bit, but there is no indication of who he might be, or why you should care. Exploring the individual rooms reveals stuff you can zoom in on, but not do anything with. This is related to how fragmented the story is. You are thrown into the location and expected to explore, with no prompts or further hints as to how all of this is coming together. All you discover are loose pieces of information that have seemingly no relation to one another. The lack of cohesion and further instruction makes everything you do seem pointless. It may have been due to the general cheesiness and tiredness of the plot and its elements (old hotel, dark trails, dimly-lit rooms, etc), or just the fact that the story (and how little we know of it) got off to such a lousy start and is so uninspired, but this game struck me as being more lame than scary. I wanted to roll my eyes and laugh at the fact that anyone could find this creepy, eerie, unnerving, frightening, etc etc etc in the least. It all struck me as being extremely B-grade horror flick. Now, if you want a truly nerve-wracking game, give Corrosion a try. This one comes nowhere close to matching it in terms of story, ambience and immersion. No music, just sound. You hear a few ghost voices now and then, and weird clinks and clunks. And somehow it all adds to the cheesiness, not scariness. These developers were going by the book way too much.  All you ever see is blackness, really. It takes up about 70% of most screens. And yet, it's still not scary. I played Corrosion (mentioned above) just a few days before this game, and all the screens were brightly lit but you still felt a general sense of unease. Horror isn't just conveyed by dark corners and weird sounds. I couldn't understand why there was no option for subtitles. Voice comes on quite suddenly at times, and you have to wait till the person finishes speaking in order to get all the information. With subtitles you could readily click them away once you were done reading them. What a time-waster. It was also irritating because sometimes the voice came on when you zoomed in on an object, and when you zoomed out, the voice disappeared. Which meant you had to zoom in again and wait for the voice to completely play out. UGHHHH. And when I mean ""no text"", I mean that there are absolutely no descriptions of anything whatsoever in this game. If you hover over an item, all you see is a cursor change, telling you whether you can do anything with it or not. So very often, you're not quite sure what exactly you're looking at, which limits how you think about the item and its possible uses. So, in addition to there being no subtitles, there's also no ""return to main menu"" option. No audio level controls, no brightness setting, no windowed mode, nothing. There's only ""save"", ""load"", and ""quit"" tucked in the right-hand corner of the screen. And when you click on ""save"", a Windows window (not the game's own window, mind you) pops up, prompting you to select a location to save the file. And - get this - the file is a .TXT file. Yup, a TEXT file. Wow, is it the 1980s again or something? I mean, I've nothing against this, but well, it sure shows how archaic this game system is! This is a point-n-click adventure game, but it sure as heck doesn't play like one, in terms of controls and game quality. Items aren't labelled at all, so you've sometimes no idea what you're looking at. And I couldn't figure out how to use the items in the inventory, because they don't work like in other games where you click them and they become ""active"". No in-game help or tutorials explaining how things work either. And, as mentioned above, clicking on any item - whether or not in your inventory - yields no description whatsoever. This to me just spelled lazy programming, or extremely primaeval game mechanics. Since there's no windowed mode, I was forced to play this on my 1920 x 1080 screen. The graphics were very pixellated. Lack of guidance, lack of clear goals, lack of understanding of what you're looking at, lack of understanding of location, lack of relevance of items to the story, etc etc all contribute to everything being too loosely tied together to matter. My patience wore thin really fast. Perhaps there was a great story underneath this mess, but if there was, the player sure wasn't given any indication of it! "

												Pretty Good!This game manages to keep its air of spookiness throughout. No jump scares but some quality, ""did I just see that?"", moments. Puzzles are, with one exception, well laid out.I also have to give props to the ancillary writing and details in all the rooms. The game presents a remarkably clear picture of everyone who was in the hotel, where they were staying, and what they were doing when they went missing.There are a couple of arbitrary ""why can't I just do X?"" moments as you near the end of your clue hunting. And there are a few really annoying hotspots. Sometimes you can literally see what you want to click on but can't because you need to be one step to the right. Or back.

												Although not as great as Dark Fall 2, and with some pretty random puzzles, figuring out the solution is actually very rewarding. I won't spoil what you need to do, but you need to piece together some information that the game helpfully provides in a number of different ways. There were a couple parts where I started to feel like ""they already told me this"", but I feel I was well prepared when I finally reached the end. A bit of a spoiler-free note: there is an early section that is fairly easy to overlook, because it doesn't stand out, that has some vitally required stuff in it.			"

												Finally, a game that doesn't resort to blood and gore just to scare you. Dark Fall is an old school point and click adventure game in which the player explores a haunted hotel to uncover the truth behind a series of dissapearances due to somekind of supernatural creature. It's a well-made ghost story that tickles your curiosity enough to make you want to keep going till the very end. It's old school in the sense that in terms of puzzle solving, Dark Fall doesn't hold your hand. It is your responsiblity to keep track  of clues. Some players may find it aggravating that you have to write things down, but for Dark Fall, it surprisingly doesn't get tiring. Same for objectives. The gameplay consists of the player clicking on various parts of the scenery to move about and explore. Some areas are blocked off and will require an item or a puzzle to be solved in order to advance. In what order you choose to solve the puzzles is mostly up to you with the exception of a few.			"

												The main reason I don't recommend this game isn't because it's ""bad"" but rather I found it incredibly tedious. This is very much an old school PnC game where the effects are pretty minimal. Voice acting is pretty decent though. Not for those that expect a lot more interaction with NPCs and humor.You might like this game if you've played through Myst a few dozen times.[I got the series in some bundle, either Humble or Royale. Best save your money and get these discounted.]			"

												Quite nice paranormal detective story. But nevertheless I have some complaints: 1) The developers posted a spoiler on the store page for some purpose. Yeah, there are no clues how to find that symbol in the game at all. But they could improve this with patch. 2) The alchemical puzzle has incorrect clues. Position of the bronze symbol is wrong on the photo. Maybe it's a bug, I don't know. But again they could fix this with patch.Everything else is good. Highly recommended to purchase.			"

												One of the most enjoyable point-and-click games I've ever played.Take the role of a reluctant paranormal investigator: You've bitten off more than you can chew, but you have to find your brother somehow! Creep around the not-so-deserted train station/hotel in search of clues while witnessing hair-raising paranormal activity. I recommend keeping a pen and paper beside you as you solve these puzzles.
