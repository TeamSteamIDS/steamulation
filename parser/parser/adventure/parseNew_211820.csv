												For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you.With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion. You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe. you play this game for the journey it takes you on. I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game. If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right.10/10, hands down.			"

												See my hours? I know this game, and i know that i say it's by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one.Congrats Chucklefish, if i could give a neutral review i would, consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive i'm still going to lay it down on you.After spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned, they didn't and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access. Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates. I would by lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish. After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for. Development is slow, very slow.PROS:+You will probably spend at least 100> hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth.+Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space).+Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs.+Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations.+7 Starter races that are diverse and unique.+Modding support for this game is well maintained.+(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings.+Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy).+Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others. The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has.+OST is amazing +Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community. Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC.+Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots).+Liquid and Light dynamics are ""realistic""+Supports .ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO)+Boss fights are unique-ishSEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone)+/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer+/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally+/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working+/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1.0CONS:- AI can be pretty stupid- The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game.- Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons. (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP)- The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss- APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses.- Penguin crewmates are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>- No ship protection in multiplayer*- Besides farming, there is little incentive to actually build a planetary base.- Mining can get boring quickly, especially if you are used to Terraria's systems**- Game has a falloff point where you sit down and go ""well, what next"" (but that is quite some time later)- Some mechanics seem halfbaked, where its easy to see how to improve and you are frustrated that the devs let it sit there (some bad design choices and flaws)- Starting a new game on a server is almost impossible if the server is populated.- Seriously, the biggest con for this game are just design flaws. Like, the hotbar for example is arguably very unintuitive and some of the aspects are left out almost completely. You will be using a feature of the game and be scratching your head ""Why didn't they do ___ instead?""- Techs are now simplified and ultimately nerfed and more boring- Only 6 tiers? Come on, where is the 10 we had before.***- So what are ship pets for there exactly? They do like to stand in front of my containers.- Options screen needs a bit of a rework (if you need to explain a UI, its not a good UI)- Wiring things in your ship can get cluttered and incredibly difficult if there are many tracks- Matter Manipulator customization is a joke*Any member of a party can steal or break things in your ship even still. People are divided between ""simply party with people you trust"" and ""just give us some bloody protection options"". Personally, protection options sound better because otherwise whats the point of public servers if you cant show off your ship a little bit? EDIT: After some more thought, ship protection options should just be a thing, honestly. The existence of multiplayer comes with some things you need to take for granted and one of those things are ""not everyone will be a decent or honest person"".** Okay lets clear this up: Starbound is NOT a Terraria copy, YES it does have elements and inspired features that Terraria did but honestly, whats the wrong in that? Imagine how hard it would be to make a game that is nothing like any other game you've ever played. Terraria arguably perfected some aspects of the genre and there is nothing wrong with following footsteps.*** Tiers are an iffy one, they sacrificed having 10 tiers of weapons and armor for having 6 more specialised ones; Ranged, Melee and Staffs. On top of that, where the hell are the tiered weapons for classes? They totally disappeared! In a sandbox game the idea is you have endless content and things to do - this doesn't just mean a million different blocktype, just give us some more depth and flexibility. (Should clarify, technically giving specialised class armor instead of more tiers is flexibility but it just feels cut short and i cant be the only one)Last time i played this game on a server with friends, we didnt mine, explore, pvp, build or do quests. We all sat in a ship and played ""guess the song"", if that isn't simultaneously the most concerning (gameplay wise) but coolest thing then what the hell is it.The game's development could be described as a mix of ""one step forward, two steps back"" and ""missed opportunities"" because the thing is it's easily playable but frustrating.(removed score, decided it wasn't a good choice)Worth the money? YES...Runs on most computers? NO (as of right now, 1.0, which harbors some optimization problems)Honestly i want to love Starbound i really do. To me no matter what happens now it got far enough that i enjoyed it, but was constantly disappointed in the missed opportunities(25/7/16) Top review, didn't expect - gonna add a little more.(also edited grammar and reworded some stuff a little to better reflect my feelings_If anyone from Chucklefish reads this, what ARE you doing? This game is confusing, because it obviously has potential (and lives up to some of it) but falls short at the silliest of things. Look at some community mods and ideas, people are screaming at you to add certain things or change stuff but it just goes overlooked. When you make a game it won't be exactly how you envisioned it to be but thats because the people who play it want some input too. You added skyrails and some other features - hell back in the day i helped get modular matter manipulators in the game but prime example, the ""modular"" Matter Manipulator has 12 upgrades and no actual customization. I don't want to devalue or dishearten your work but there is nothing as helpful as constructive criticism, because you seem to only take in the good things about the game and ignore much of the big criticisms. I would hate for this to be another ""let the modders deal with it""All that being said, good job thus far not abandoning or totally messing everything up, you do deserve praise for a lot of the work you have done and i won't discount that.(word limit)			"

												EDIT: damn, top of the list... i hope this changes something.EDIT2: got sick of people misinterpreting the reference to No Man's Sky, so i removed it. sorry!Don't let the negative rating fool you - I don't hate this game, I just don't like what it's become.TL;DR Loved Koala, don't like Giraffe. Generic environments with generic dungeons and towns, repetitive and boring combat, shoehorned and unengaging story gates your progress constantly.Let me start this review off with a little nostalgia from my first experiences with the game. I played - and loved - the Koala builds. Every planet was different, with different creatures and different landscapes and colours. It was nice. I didn't know what I was going into, and that was great because each experience was a new one!However, I feel the direction the game's taken is downwards. Planets are now segregated into different types, and each one has essentially the same thing to expect.A lush planet has a mine and some ruins. A forest planet has a swamp and some frogs, maybe a few Avians. A snow planet has llamas and some monkeys.This happens again and again and again, and while the terrain is varied and gives a hint of adventure to the ""exploration"", seeing the same rebel camp or monster-filled mine or generic temple over and over again gets boring, fast. Seriously, on every planet, you'll be sure to find the same thing in a different shape.This is a weakness that demonstrates itself in spades when you begin to actually explore the universe.Additionally, there's the problem of the combat system. Throughout the course of your exploration, you're constantly thrown the same preset enemy with the same preset fly-towards-you-and-do-damage-on-contact tactic. (I'm exaggerating here, but still, there is a shameless amount of monsters which simply run, hop or fly at you and deal damage as soon as they touch you.)More creatures with mechanics like the Poptop, who come at you slow but do a lot of damage when they charge, would be a lot more fun, and would make the fighting more engaging than ""this creature runs at you and mobs you until you die, kill it"".There is so much more that could be done with the system, and it shows with the complexity and variety of weaponry in the game, but the way that every monster attacks you is insultingly and unfittingly simplistic! It's also annoying to get cheap-killed on a regular basis, and degrades the gameplay significantly when it literally starts punishing you for daring to venture from your house on your starting planet.Finally, there's the problem of the story being shoehorned into everything you do. I don't know about you, but I play Starbound to build pretty things and venture out into the unknown. Unfortunately, the game forces you into the shoes of a superhero, and it constantly rubs me the wrong way.I couldn't give half a damn about the fate of the universe. I play this game to build and chill out. Maybe that's an incredibly shallow way to play a game, but it's just the way I play. Unfortunately, the way the devs have implemented the story is annoying and broken, disallowing you to actually explore, instead holding your hand like a gameplay-long tutorial level.I don't care for the story because it's inconvenient and slow to work through, gating your progress while never bothering to actually engage you outside of ""save the universe from Cthulu"".I don't think there's any more that I can say other than please, for the love of God, Chucklefish. Make the worlds more wild and varied. Add more building configurations. Make some biomes NOT spawn buildings as often - people don't need to live everywhere. Reduce the spawn rates of your preset creatures and work on the combat - it's boring and it starts to grate after a while.And, please, make the story optional. It's so painfully linear and shallow that it feels like I'm trying to read a children's book than play a game.Please make this game fun again. I'm starting to get sick of installing mods and turning off monster spawning just to have a nice time.ADDENDUM:About two weeks of experience with the game later, and my opinion hasn't changed - though I can certainly list out some good aspects of the game:BASE BUILDINGThe wide range of blocks and items, and the option to have NPCs inhabit things you create, makes for a fun and relaxing to play. My only gripe is that the interactions are far too shallow, and the radiant quests have a very, very limited range.MODDINGModding is absolutely amazing in this game, and is exactly as advertised. While confusing and frustrating occasionally, modding is incredibly flexible and often instantaneously satisfying.Also, the ability to add mods to the game to flesh out your experience is rather pleasant.Unfortunately, it's the most fun I've had with the game thus far.If something passes my mind, I'll add it to this addendum. I would have written something on the community but I currently don't know what I'd say on it.			"

 Playtime and Time/money I'd say about 60 hours of gameplay maximum for the state it's in now. Thats what I spent on it while playing with 2 other friends doing absolutely everything.So even in that regard it's 25 cents an hour, which is absolutely fantastic. Exactly what is this game?  The good: This is starbound. The game that it currently is, is a space themed, construction and survival exploration game. Comparable to terraria, it has improved upon a lot of things from that such as the ability to use one block as a back wall and a forewall, there are more space related things like atmospheres (1) space creatures (2) space ships, a space story line etc. There are planets to discover (3), theres progress to be made through building a colony and adventuring through planets (4), Plenty of fun to be had with interesting tech mechanics (5) a very large assortment of vanity goods, and a nice multiplayer experience. The inventory feels not too full all the time as it is now catagorized into everything you need (such as an ore bag and a building materials bag etc), and it comes with a complete story which you'd have a hard time finding with such creative games (6). The Bad: The game is rather short with only 6 tiers of progression.You run around on planets and can easily move on to the next section by scraping the surface alone.The armor balance for players is slightly higher than the game seems to want, it's so mind numbingly easy that a toddler could sit around with a stimpack and a med kit and outheal any damage coming at them.It's so incredibly easy for other players to ruin the efforts of a server because the protection isnt in the game by default, in any way.The game will get extremely laggy for many players when there are too many entities in one area of a world. (which should be something obvious, however I'm saying that it's taxing on higher end systems even)It will consume many of your hours doing simple things like building, or gathering a crew/upgrading your ship/mining. (ok, this one isnt really bad, unless you hate that sort of thing.) The Unforgivable: this entire ""the unforgivable"" section will be gripes about features removed from the game, they will not impact you if you do not know about what was in the past. I advise you to keep clear if you are fresh and have never had your hopes high for the game.As much as I don't want to say this, I feel as though it has to be said, the game has been stripped of features. The justification for this is improved framerate, when honestly it is worse now. So I cannot and will not let it go. Lets start off with the numbers 1. They removed the heating system, and the complexity of atmospheres from the game. you now craft a survival pack that allows you to eventually traverse all territories, instead of how it was before, which was harsh and based on your selections. While this choice for sure makes the game easier, it takes out the fun survival part of the difficulty.1a. They also oversimplified the hazardous environments, so it doesnt matter if you take cover, or build a fire to stay warm, you will always be suffering the consequences of a planet, no matter where you are, if you don't have the correct survival pack.2. They drastically reduced the randomness of creatures that spawn on planets, there are now a total of 3 major variants of creatures, large, small, and flying and are trash monsters who have no meaningful attacks. There are now many pre generated creatures that inhabit every single planet in the game, and they are very common. I hope you enjoy going to the same 20 planets over and over again.3. unrelated to the creatures but stemming from the random generation, planets now are even genned the same, and the color of planets is only based on the planet you're going to, which you will find out are very limited in number, it's not a mystery of what you're getting anymore, you go to an ocean planet, you've seen them all, you go to a starter planet, you've seen them all etc. the only thing that remains are the random dungeons generated in the planets themselves.4. Adventuring is blindly easy, everything has been simplified down to looting all the surface boxes of a planet for ""EXTREMELY RARE"" matter manipulator upgrades and the ore the planet has that you want, along with tech tokens which allow you to buy whatever tech you want, never forcing you to try something out because it's your only option. shrug5. Techs. oh my god techs. They removed all the fun ones, removed all the flying ones, removed the mechs the cards and the interesting ones, and of course replaced the hazard protection ones with the survival pack. somehow, they took the worst tech of them all (the nearly useless morphball) and made it worse AND a focus at the same time (they removed the bomb feature and gave it trashy mobility options) (also I say this as a fan and a person who tried implementing 2 high tunnels in my bases for fun.)The current state of techs involves head techs, body techs, and feet techs. They are painful. 5a. The morph ball is the head tech. and it has several variations, one that climbs walls (at the cost of moving like a ♥♥♥♥ing snail), one that does ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING (it makes you float to the top of water) and one that makes you spin dash like sonic (without the damage, honestly that would be too fun). imagine being forced to use the morphball tech and it having no real use, ever. thats exactly what it's like.5b. The body tech. you remember the dash tech? the one that moved you several feet? that one will be your primary mobility tech, for 8 tech cards you can restore it to it's original state, being able to use it mid air, which is pretty ok. You can use it for a slightly-faster-than-running sprinting, which is pretty ok. and you can use it for a blink dash, which is completely useless and not a mobility option in the least. unless you like roleplaying tracer or something.5c. The feet tech. Double jump! Thats good! triple jump! that..... ok because they're smaller hops. wall jump :O now you can be super meat boy..... but.... thats never useful in a game like this except if someone build a map for it. and the roc(ket) jump, which will give you a decent jump that will clear gaps and stop you mid air without fall damage. Which is a good tech.6. The final gripe that I can think about while writing this lengthy review; you no longer have the mystery of an unknown story. there is a story in place, it's shrugworthy, and it gives your character a reason for being there. I don't like it, because it takes away our needed freedom of imagination. final notes: I don't have enough space to gripe forever here as there is a character limit, read the other reviews.So now the standard game rating:Story: 4/10 (it drops you in a generic story, and forces you to play through a story on a creation/exploration game in order to advance.)Gameplay: 10/10 (tennouttaten it's an excellent idea and plays very well)Presentation: 10/10 (The game is absolutely amazing looking, you'll love the game you're given with the absolutely massive selection of materials and decorative goods.)Soundtrack: 7/10 (It will blast in your ears at the worst times, and you will like it (mostly (if you like classical style music)))Replayability: 10/10 (Very, very very, very high. play it with friends, find a server to play on, play alone, build to your hearts content, explore till you can't find anything new, and enjoy the time that you waste playing on your computer.)Buy it, play it, it's a great game, but it could have been better. so much better.

Posted: July 15, 2014
												I last reviewed this in 2014, when the game was in early beta; It was really bad.I've come back now that 1.0 has released to see if the game is better. This review was earlier incomplete during a 1.0 playthrough, but after playing about 70 hours total of the release version, my feelings have not changed, only worsened.I couldn't even push myself to complete the story; I searched it up, and found it was more dissapointing then i could have expected, making me actually glad I didn't go through it. The rest of the review has been slightly modified, but only slightly.I pre-ordered this as soon as it became available and have been watching it for 5 years. I wanted this game to be great. So, is it good? is it bad?It's ok.The game has some value to it now; the building is fairly entertaining, providing a lot of options for furniture, and ways to progress through it with farming/colonies. As well, combat has a good deal of variety, and the bosses are pretty decent. There is a lot of variety in weapon types later in the game. The story missions are pretty good in design, and hold a lot of nice secrets. The fossil collecting minigame is a fun distraction as well. That's unfortunately where things fall off to being either poor, or outright bad.The exploration is awful. The biomes are devoid of content minus some rare biome chests, and that's how all of the biomes work. Enter biome, look for chest, hope it has an interesting blueprint. You can't craft anything of note from the biomes until luck does you well. Alongside that there are  procedural buildings throughout planets in the form of rooms and dungeons. They are sadly all handmade, meaning you will constantly find the same exact rooms/dungeons while playing. I never went through a biome underground without finding at least 3 of the same exact room; it was often 5 though. As a result of this lack of variety, lack of reward, and really a lack of anything else to look for, exploration dies rapidly. Every planet is mostly the same, and they can be grouped into a few categories; normal planet, ocean, barren, moon, and possibly asteroid.The story is also terrible. Collect the 6 special artifacts. Done.It's badly written, and the lore is lacking in every way. If you know any of the source material/theme concepts (cavemen for floran, 1984 for apex, aztec/inca for avian, etc), then the lore and story will not branch to any interesting point whatsoever. It all feels very generic.Weapon generation is also bad. Melee only has damage, firerate, and element, though 2 handed weapons have an extra special attack. Ranged is the same, though it has energy cost as well. There are also staves/wands, but they just change damage into level, a less varying stat. The weapons themselves are nice to use, but the lack of statistical variance means the procedural nature of weapons feels entirely pointless.Cooking = potions, but there aren't a lot of unique buffs.You can get crew members for your ship, but they aren't useful past the first few tiers, and they otherwise do extremely little. The toolbar is a mess.Crafting takes time for no apparent reason.Procedural quests send you to the same areas, revealing the way the system works, damaging play experience and providing lackluster repetition. As well, there aren't many actual quest types.Colonist rewards are lacking, and serve only as an alternative to normal play for getting items. As well, the thoughts and traits of colonists actually seem to do nothing in my experience.Character gear options consist of only 4 armor slots, a passive augment, and movement abilities. Customization is thus very limited in terms of character build depth. There aren't any passive gear slots other than the single augment, which are all very basic.Armor is also very lacking; there aren't very many unique sets with most being reskins, and they lack any notable special effects.Not to mention a lot of things from beta, like character customization options and techs, have been removed.And... Well, I could go on.But after all that, I still don't think the game is terrible, it's just lacking. Badly. I focused on the negatives a lot, but those negatives are a huge part of the game. It's a jack of all trades, master of none kind of ordeal, but its not bad. I wouldn't recommend it unless it is on sale, with exceptions;If you like animal crossing, or relaxed games about collecting and freeform building (like minecraft mixed in with animal crossing), I think you'll like it, but I'd say pick it up on a sale (say 5$). I was enjoying it for awhile based on the building and fossil hunting, but the rest of the game being so shallow pushed me to leave eventually. As well, I can say with certainty that my enjoyment value dropped rapidly over time; it wasn't even 10 hours in before I was watching youtube videos on the side to distract myself, and I only realised as of my last jump into the game that I wasn't having any fun at all, and it was just time killing due to how long it takes to find things.The game may be long, but it is not deep. I'm sure some will find enjoyment out of this, but it died quickly for me, so I reccomend it only if you are into that type of gameplay, and only on a sale... As on the slip side, if you want a game about fighting loads of different enemies, finding unique interesting gear, discovering a strange path through progression or exploring exciting places, you are likely going to be very disappointed.I personally hope for the sake of everyone playing (including myself) that they take the terraria style of updating and add massive swaths of content after release to fix these issues. But that's all I can do; hope. With a similar development time of 5-6 years as terraria has had (due to terraria's year hiatus in 2012), I don't know how much will change at this rate.			"

								Only a beta, but first impression seems good. Smooth controls, and it looks lovely. Text is a little hard to read though, and the controls are not rebindable (yet). Worth an investment if you enjoy games like Terraia, but I would not say this is an insta-buy at the moment. Still very enjoyable :)			"

												Starbound was enjoyable, and I once used to regularly sink hours into it. Years ago, that is - in some of the earliest released versions, as I'd backed it since before release.The game used to be a fun, fantastic experience - each world was unique, and it was fun to share coordinates of interesting things or unique items with others in this huge universe. Everything had attention and care put into it. It was exciting - you didn't know what to expect. Back in the Koala versions, that is...then, it released fully. Good god, what a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every world is the same. There's nothing to go back to. The story is shoehorned in and gates progress arbitrarily, every world has at least two pre-created enemies (and the random-gen ones just melee and mob you stupidly), and the worst of all;   nothing's really random any more. This planet is forest. Oh. This is plains. Woo. Everything's the same. You can't explore one world type without seeing the same bloody decrepid tower, or a single high level planet without running into another resistance base with three specific buildings in a marginally different order. A huge load of content has just been straight-up REMOVED from older versions - the ship AI isn't even race-specific!The care once put into this game is dead, and things have been ruined, ravaged, and torn apart to save development time and costs. Most music present in the first releases has been removed. Combat is annoying and gets in the way, if only to serve as a distraction from the underwhelming facade of exploration the lackluster world generation presents. The shallow puddle of content is drip-fed through gating off entire planet types. There used to be a newsletter that highlighted the best of the community's creations - but that died along with any care that had once been put into the game.A space exploration sandbox should be something to replay, something with a substantial amount of content - you're in space, for crying out loud! And yet, it's somehow, through development, become more distilled and reduced down to a shallow unimmersive experience frought with grinding, arbitrary progress gates, and is generally an unsatisfying experience.Originally, you were just some random person in space - either your planet was destroyed, you were exiled, or were just an outcast, depending on race. Now you're forced into a hero role to save the universe, or some dumb thing.I regret playing through the release version of this game. I finished the story and was severely underwhelmed and disappointed - and haven't launched the game since. I'd explored everything. Done everything. The game has been cut down and had pieces hacked off since the first releases, and has been reduced to a shallow, unfulfilling experience that leaves nothing to make me want to return to it.It had potential at one point. At least the old music's nice. That's all I have left to enjoy from this shambling corpse of a once-good game - and most of the old music isn't in the game any more, so there's even less in Starbound to like.It's such a shame to see this brilliant concept be misled into the atrocious mess it is now.

Early Access Review
								This game got alot of flack because Chucklefish went silent for a while and people thought it was an abandoned project.Turns out Chucklefish was just working too hard to bother making any wab updates, they started up again a couple months ago and there is now three update branches, Stable, Unstable and Nightly. Nightly is the most glitched, as it's updated every midnight, so play nightly at your own risk. I play Unstable and they just gave it an update, the addition of quests has changed the game quite a bit, there are now quests as opposed to just 'get this ore, build this thing, repeat'. You need to prgress so far in the quests to get to a new solar system. This game used to be like a bigger Terreria with less point, now it's finally turning into what was promised and Chucklefish is giving us regular updates again. They're introducing new bosses, I've only so far had to tangle with Dreadwing(the penguin UFO) and they haven't tweaked him much aside from give him a bazillion and three HP and he has his own level you can't build on. So while he's not that much harder, he's ♥♥♥♥ing hard.If you got it and stopped playing give it another shot, I'm not sure if stable branch has been updated to the new quest system yet, though, I'm on unstable. If you don't have it and like sandbox tree punching sims definately give it a shot.EDIT:Hey Terreria fanboys, unless your crappy attempts at snarking can make me laugh like Sid1120's down there I'm deleting them. I'm sorry if this offends you. Also I accedently deleted a post from somebody who said Chucklefish was being 'condescending' to fans during the silence, didn't mean to, accedental double click. I didn't consider that a snark and can't comment on it as I was taking a haiatus until updates started again.ANOTHER EDIT!:I was completely unprepared for so many votes... My second most popular review has one downvote.			"

Early Access Review
My review...A few months ago, I would have written a negative review.Back then, I had stopped playing the game because I had hit a wall: I couldn't find the incredibly rare items required for the next two quests.  I had the highest level armor and weapon so powerful it could kill anything with one or two hits.  My rapid-firing high-damage assault rifle could hit birds at any range.  At that point the game had stopped being fun.  Even the extreme planets were too easy; meteor strikes were few and far between.But now?  You can start a colony.  Weapons are no longer ridiculously powerful, and the accuracy of some guns has been reduced.  Soon there will be hoverbikes.  Hoverbikes?  Hell yeah.  Colonies?  You're kidding me.Nope, not kidding.  Colonies.  Nothing like settling on a fiery planet, building a beautiful city inhabited by unique and endearing people, and watching it be obliterated by one giant meteor.  That taught me something... build underground.  So now I have my own little ragtag band of survivors, duking it out with nature.Pros: Epic gameplay, both at low and high levels Beautiful atmosphere, covering a huge range of fantasy and science fiction Creepy undertone; there are hints everywhere that there's some greater power behind all this BananasCons: The quests get tedious once you've gotten pretty far; it's eventually just ""get this"" and ""get that"".  Hopefully this will be fixed soon... The races could use some more differences; while it is cool that they have specific armor, weapons, and ships, it would be much more interesting if there were race-specific abilities, even if they only affected the early game. Still some balance issues with weapons, but this is much better than it used to be. This is a personal pet peeve, but I really want some more high-level bows.  After a certain point they're no longer useful, as they just don't do enough damage.  If there were more bows to go with the top-level gear, I'd be in heaven.My final rating: 9/10Great game, but not perfect.  Keep in mind, Starbound is still in Beta.  I'm sure they'll get at least some of these things fixed before the game hits 1.0.One more thing: I haven't yet explored all the game has to offer.  I'm sure there's tons more to see, and more problems too, but I haven't found any yet.EDIT: Nevermind about the bows, I just realized you can craft a Ferozium bow.			"

								I'm really glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews. There's a whole community of people who feel that life has let them down when it comes to Starbound. They seem to know all this history. They're certainly full of informed opinions. They've got a thousand and one reasons for you to NOT try or support or play this game. And they're quite vocal. However... from my perspective of a new player, none of that crap is important. Circa June 2016, Starbound is quite playable. Not very buggy. It progresses. There's stuff to do. Its story light like most Early Access games. There's a great platform to tell stories here. Lots of character customization. Its quite good. Don't become part of some communities trivial political agenda regarding the development of this game. Make up your own minds. Its worth a shot, and like so many things... its a matter of opinion.I like Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								If you played terraria and survival/crafting/sandboxing games you'll know what this game is about. This sandbox adventure/survival but with an actual quest system being put in place which falls into the realm of space/sci fi genre. The game offers so much fun especially played with friends. You start off on a planet looking for crafting materials just to survive and get ship off the planet but as time goes on you start advancing through tiers through various tasks, quests, and boss battles which enables you to travel throughout different sectors and random worlds, offering you new  biomes,dangerous envioronment, and hazards which you'll have to explore to find materials to craft. More will be added  as times goes on, ship battles more quests, more hidden treasure in a planet etc. The planets themselves have very nice environment and fun to explore because it is randomized on a galactic map, by inputting x and y coordinates  which acts as seed numbers, you'll travel through endless randomized worlds and discover awsome adventures either by yourself or with friends. You'll dig at least over 24 hours into this beta and still finding yourself replaying it over and over with new content update. Winter update Gameplay As it stands right now the system for combat is still WORK IN PROGRESS but the there is an actual story to the game now that is flows really well. Quest systems and mining to progress. Once a quest is completed the character goes back to the hub to turn it in to gain a tech upgrade to visit certain planets i.e Radiated, Cold etc until the final tier. The bosses and quests are repeatable and hardcore and the fun of the discovery is back again with tons of new items and secrets to discover. The new biomes are fantastic. A long awaited update that took just way too long but glad that it is finally out so far in unstable build but hopefully we'll see a stable release of it this month.(I'll be working on the review for this game now and also giving out free keys on my stream each week. I fully support this great game. working on video review.  I do recommend this game but I don't have a full review on it yet since it is not a finished game, as the game update changes and progress I will throw a new updated review up.[pros]+ Randomized planets and biomes+ Organized travel system + Actual quests in the game+ Great music+ Great animations+looking forward to more+MOD SUPPORT!+addictive gameplay of mining and being able to build whatever you want through progression+Multiplayer with friends and strangers+ The Winter update FinallyCons- updates cant come fast enough! moarrr-if you dont like minecraft or terraria or those type of games you will probably not like this game that much,- Right now the game is in a stand, where its trying to shape itself into a better game, The devs moved close to each other and well, the game stopped updating for a while, with buggy nightly builds as far as updates are going which you can get your hands on the newest content to at least try out but remember, its tests and bugs, the game came to a dead stop atm. Awaiting a massive overhaul to the game and the things promised. I have faith in these guys so I'll leave this right here because there isn't anything more to do in the game after you acquired everything in the adventure. I hope to see great things when the game jumpstarts again for I will definently be there.			"

Early Access Review
								I won't lie. I thought this game was going to suck.I read most of the bad reviews saying that ""Chucklefish has bad management"" and ""This is just another terraria clone.""But you know what?It doesn't.After reading most of the bad reviews, I had already removed the game from my wishlist. Until a friend of mine said I needed to get this game, me being the open-world loving exploration enthusiast that I am. So I said, and I quote, ""Yeah, whatever mate.""And I got it. And I played it. And oh god did I love it. When I play a video game, I try not to get caught up in the developer drama. There are a plethora of stories on this game page about how Chucklefish ""missed their chance"" at increasing their popularity, and how the hype ""waned out and died."" I like to look past all of that. Same with Arkham Knight, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port that it was. I played it, I liked it, and I didn't have to get caught up in all of that developer drama. And it's the exact same with Starbound.If you look past the early access hell this game is going through, it's a really good game. It's fun to play around in, build in, and generally explore.And it would be telling a lie if I said that the whole few hundred billion or however many unique variations of planets there are fact didn't impress me.- Great music, although often repeats.- Tons of biomes on different planets to explore.- A surprisingly rich backstory, although the only way you could find this backstory is from randomly dropped codexes :(- Randomly generated temples, tombs, castles, villages, research facilities among others are always a blast to explore.- Surprisingly challenging for an open world platformer. (EDIT: That is, if you choose the normal mode.)- There is no story. Litterally. You're planet explodes, your ship is broken, you fix it, and do quests for people around an interstellar outpost. (Not a very impressive one, I might add.) (And I also imagine that Chucklefish will be expanding on the story as they go, if Starbound ever makes it out of EA.)- Randomly generated guns and swords are fun to collect. (also, the cosmetic armors are super awesome once you collect a full set.)- Easter eggs. Everywhere.In conclusion, you should get Starbound if you like exploring cool looking planets, collecting unique and fun to use items, and overall having fun killing unique monsters, looting enemy bases (and maybe a few friendly ones along the way), screwing around and decking out your space ship (Also, did I mention the ships? There are eight tiers to a ship, and once you get to your eighth tier, it's a blast decorating it.).If you play games for story, dialogue, immersion and sidequests with a lot of effort put into it, this isn't the game for you.You can listen to the bad reviews if you want, but what I'm trying to say is that it's not as bad a game as they say it is, for the reasons listed above.But overall, it's a great game, and I do recommend it.And it's not even finished yet!

								Starbound was released to kickstarters about a month after I lost my Grandfather.  I did 3 things for 6 months after he died.  I took care of my kids the best I could, I cried when they went to bed, and I played Starbound.The opening music still haunts me.  I still remember how unique and crazy this game was, and even though most of that eventually got removed, I can go back to old screenshots and invoke a sense of memory, of where I was emotionally while grieving when I took them.  Yeah, Starbound induced a few metric tons of negative energy in a lot of folk's lives.  Starbound is a ""toxic"" game by its own developer's description, because without the community, the people who loved it and wanted to see it succeed, there never would have been a place for any of the hate.I used to do frequent ""Starbound Adventures"" series in the forums where I'd detail all the updates.  I actually enjoyed doing that in spite of how awful Chucklefish and the Starbound community were behaving toward each other.  I got super mad, then decided one day to just dive in and play.  It was fun.Then nothing was updated for a long time, and as more nightly builds got pushed, I started seeing them remove content.  This is why I associate Starbound with Trees.My biggest distraction from tragedy came in the form of Starbound's trees.  It became an obsession, something to do feverishly while taking breaks from the swollen eyes and snot.  I collected almost 600 unique tree seeds and made an entire planet from top to bottom a farm of them.  I'm not sure how many could actually be generated, but they were all different, and it felt like I was playing this epic-level Harvest Moon as I farmed trees and food.  I can never rate this game down because the collecting and planet-hopping was some of the biggest fun I'd ever had in a videogame, period.Then they got rid of the trees.  The variety was slashed into fragments, and most of them became these dreadful brown/pastel mixes.  All of the color and imagination disappeaered.  They became background objects, the junk you ignore while you play any random SHMUP.  The farming sense faded instantly, and the wind was knocked out of me.  The one thing I was still enjoying in this game, gone.  I haven't played more than 10 minutes since the last time they made the experimental build a seperate library option.  I got on, made a character, warped around, I guess they decided the trees were ""axed"".  I don't know if it was a performance decision, but I can vouch that at the time I had my huge tree farm, I had zero lag with around 2000 trees on a single planet, around 500-600 variations among them, on an old 2012 system:Radeon HD 6970 2GB graphics cardIntel Core i5-3570k8 gigs of ram, no SSD.144hz Asus 27"" 1080p.No lag ever, the game just ran beautifully, and it looked beautiful too.  Now its just drab and unappealing to me.  I'm trying to make sense of why all the color was taken out, all of that art, what a waste.			"

Early Access Review
								Starbound is the perfect example of when ""Early Access"" goes wrong. I backed this game a long time ago with several of my other friends who couldn't wait for Starbound's release. After receiving a RIDICULOUSLY large sum of money for their pixel game, Tiy and the rest of the devs have failed to release a finished product after missing their release by over a year, coming up on 2 years. Because they have already been paid a ridiculous sum of money for their incomplete game, they do not have the motivation to finish their PIXEL RANDOM GENERATION game. I have played this game since day one, and it has barely evolved since then. Exploring planets seemed fun at the very beginning, but it gets old real fast. The different races mean nothing, and will maybe eventually have different effects. Gathering minerals is almost always the same and repetitive for each planet and sector, bosses are unimaginative, boring, and easy. The ""new"" questing system that has been added is boring and monotonous, the missions seem almost pointless in that they only exist to stall the player before more real content is added. If you are thinking about buying Starbound, turn away and play Terraria instead. You will have a much better time, with a complete game that is still receiving more content at a better rate than Starbound, an unfinished game. Chucklefish really needs to step up and finish this game, its honestly pathetic that it is still early access. Do not give Chucklefish any more money until they take the action to actually complete and polish this game. Until Chucklefish gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, this game will remain a disappointment to me and many others who were expecting much, much more from the lazy devs at Chucklefish.			"

												As someone who's been with Starbound since it entered open beta I can say that This game is, simply put, the best 2-d Sandbox game I've ever played.Picture this: An open, vast universe with 4.something quadrillion planets. each unique in their own ways.There are seven unique playable races, each with a rather vast ammount of lore behind them.I was a bit worried when the developers said they would be adding a storyline, but I'm sure glad they did. The storyline serves to direct the player and encourage exploration. There are plenty of weapons to destroy your enemies, with each type having several special stats. If you like terraria, I highly reccomend this game.  "

Early Access Review
								I would not recommend this game at this time. Perhaps in the future.I have a few reasons for not likeing this game, but mostly they break down to the game not being fun. For instance, the 'Randomly generated monsters' that are touted as a key feature just end up making the enemeys less unique. The combat system is slow, and unrewarding. Crafting, while the game boasts 'thousands of items' and 'a deep crafting system' that crafting system is really just a menu where it shows you every thing you can make, and you have to search out what you have the materials for.And while i do like the idea of owning and decorating my own starship, and going to diffrent planets, there really is no need to, nor is there a need to return to planets you have been to before.The farming, hunting and survival mechanics spoken of are simply a food meeter that ticks down, it dose not add anything. I think what really makes this game not fun is the 'free updates' part, this game hasnt been updated in two months, while in early access, why would they update it affter release?			"

								For an indie game of this proportion, it had a big budget, a sizable team and ample time, yet the game is 2 years behind schedule, still in alpha and doesn't come close to delivering a quarter of its promised features.As of now it's struggling to ape Terraria, which it was supposed to blow out of the water.Really a sad sight but a good lesson for everyone considering to invest in crowdfunding/early access games.I can only advise you to stay away from this game for now. Play Terraria instead.Time will tell if Chucklefish will deliver, but for now it's a 15 bucks alpha with scarce updates.			"

												I have played Starbound since its Early Access days, and it is easily my favorite game in sandbox exploration/building genre.Among the games of its genre, Starbound puts strongerest focus on exploration rather than fighting. Rather than adventuring in a single world, in Starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome, but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list, from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards. So you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit, which makes exploration very addictive: you will always want to explore “just one more planet”!In regard of building, Starbound offers one of largest (if not the largest) selections of both decorative and functional items to place in your house or base. It also has mechanics that allows you to populate your base with as many NPC as you like, potentially building a whole town with dozens residents.And uniquely among its genre, Starbound also has quests like one might expect of a RPG rather than a sandbox building game: a fairly long main quests and an infinite number of random quests provided by NPC in towns or those you've placed in your home or base yourself.Only one aspect of Starbound is somewhat lacking: combat, or specifically, its difficulty. While you may encounter some difficulty if you are poorly equipped (especially at the very start), as long as you are equipped with a gear of the same tier as the planet you are exploring, you will likely have little difficulty fending off local wildlife. There is some difficulty during boss fights, but bosses are still easy as far as bosses go, and if you expect challenging battles that Terrarria or action games offer, you won't find them in Starbound. Some storyline and random dungeon can also offer some challenge, but there it mostly comes from traps or indestructable dungeon elements, like flamethrowers or laser beams, not enemies (in fact, random dungeons often have few to none enemies, and focus on making you avoid dangerous environment).So, overall, the combat isn't that bad. Just don't expect constant challenge that Terraria or Edge of Space present.I fully recommend Starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try.			"

Early Access Review
								Promises don't mean anything.Announced in 2012, Beta released in 2013. Officially claimed to be ""fully released"" by 2013, this game was pushed back in development because it was not properly finished. Through many updates at first, the game's difficulty was scaled down drastically, and was turned into something equally easy as Minecraft. Originally being made by the Developer's views, the game was changed drastically by community requests and incorporating user-created mods. Originally promised to have ""thick and fast"" updates, the game met a stagnant halt, only to be given a beta-beta release by the name of [Unstable]. This is where the small updates were to be shown, and for a time, they were. A very short time, at that. After a few small patches and one moderately average sized patch, stagnant development once more arrived. The crew behind the game moved out of the country over to Europe, and set up shop where everyone was close together. Surely the updates would be fast now, you'd think. The biggest update since March 2014 is that they have a small dog at the office.The game had such a booming and viral start. It was a game of promises, dreams, and a great pixel game; something incredibly rare nowadays. The game had a somewhat rocky start, being a cleverly disguised alpha instead of the stated beta release, but it was playable. Many features felt nice, and the gameplay fit well with the atmosphere and music. Then it got boring because nothing was new. Through lost promises and hilariously bad customer support on the official forums, many people believe this game is dead. It pretty much is, when the developers are spending little time developing as they once did. At first, we had developer streams. We could talk to the developers for HOURS, talking about everything down to the color of the kitchen sink. Then we had some streams of gameplay with less discussion. Then we had preorder bonuses, including some really lame things like a statue of ""you"" in the game. Then we had promises of fast updates, which has so far been a lie. It's been months since the last real update as of this post time, and there's no real sign of progress. There were people who donated HUNDREDS to this game, only to be shafted so far. By definition, as of the game's current and past iterations, this game is a scam. I still hold hopes that the developers will EVENTUALLY do something for the game's betterment, but I will definitely not expect them. It's obvious they ran with the money. If you want this game, look up youtube videos first. If it looks like something you'd want to play, then by all means buy it, but just remember that it's a buggy, unfinished game with no hope in the nearby future of completion. Other Early Access games are more likely to be fully released ten times over before this is out of the current be- I'm sorry, ALPHA release.			"

Early Access Review
								So, a lot of the reviewers for the game are giving it positive reviews because the devs have released an update. I felt like I should write a new review and focus less on the developers and more on the game that is available. I know a lot of you will look at my play time and think ""He has X amount of hours in this game, he must have enjoyed it."" But if I could have my hours back I would. Think of all those hours you spent in your last relationship and then try telling someone that the other person was worth dating and that you don't want a minute of your wasted time back. I tried to love it and I tried to be a beta tester and hunt down bugs, but it just wasn't worth it.Right off the bat you'll notice that the game is very grindy.  Now, a little bit of grind is okay in a sandbox game as long as it's well paced and it never becomes tedious and boring; but Starbound does just that. The game becomes go from this planet to the next looking for another tier of ore and a boss to fight. You'll spend hours mining away, looking for the next ore. You run the risk of brain death while doing so, but it'll all be worth it in the long run, right? The boss fight and new enemies will be amazing, right? Nope and nope. Many bosses just feel like regular enemies on steroids, and the new enemies are just variations of the standard ones you see regularly.Secondly, the game doesn't excel in any particular field. It's a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none and each mechanic has been done somewhere else much better. Minecraft had better sandbox building, Terraria had less grind, more interesting bosses and a better sense of progression , and the combat is only adequate for what it is.In the end, this game is merely a poor man's Terraria that manages to be more expensive. You're much better off playing that instead of Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is based on the state the game was in when I played it, and these issues are ones that were a problem back then. If the issues have been fixed, then this is a good thing.Only reason this is still up here is because it's the biggest thing I have done on steam.After the early access phase ends I may play the game again and write a new review whether it will be another negative review, or a positive one I am unsure. Here is the original review:This game may look like the Terraria lover's dream come true, and indeed it did look so to me at first, but after playing through the game and aquiring the final tier of tools and armor, I discovered that all is not lollipops and unicorn farts as I thought. These are my reasons for why the game lets me down:*The game has terrible gear scaling to the point that you can skip entire tiers of tools and armor and not miss out.*There is no reason to create a permanent settlement on any planet, as when away from that planet, time does not proceed. Meaning that a farm on that planet will not grow. Causing you to have to make a farm in your ship, so that it grows everywhere you go.*While the first planet may play like terraria, once you get the ship modifications to go to other sectors, you will likely move your storage and crafting stations on to your ship, so you have it available easily.*Poor difficulty scaling. The difficulty on terraria scaled well. Making what was previously the best armor the lowest quality armor for the next section of the game. Where in Starbound, the next tier of armor gives you slightly more health and slightly more energy.*Weak guns and unavailability. For a game that boasts randomized guns, they are quite unavailable until later in the game. All of the guns I ever found in the game felt like I was toting a piece of cardboard. They consumed far too much energy for their damage output.*Farming endgame. After about the second tier of tools, there are no more hunting knives or hunting bows, so the collection of leather and alien meat becomes a lot harder than it was on the first planet. Causing the player to slump into a farming lifestyle for all their food.*Stale combat. All of the enemies hop around the same, use similar attacks or cheap tactics that allow easy hits on the player. *Inconsistency between clients. When playing with others, the creatures are not consistent between clients. You may think that an enemy looks like a Pikachu, which makes squeaky noises. But for your friend, it looks like a puddle of custard with seven brown eyes on a round head on a long neck, and it makes noises like a sheep. This makes it hard for players to convey to their allies or friends what they are seeing/being attacked by.As I achieved the final tier of gear, I feel no need to play it again unless it changes dramatically. As such, I have not played to the end in every single update, so I am unaware if any changes have improved on the problems I have outlined in this reviewHowever, this game is in early access, and it should improve with time. I advise letting the super fans help the developers kick the kinks out of the game for you, and grabbing the game at a later time, when it is out of Early Access.When the game fully releases, I may play it again, and revise my review.

												Video games don't exist in a bubble. They don't exist independently from their makers when they're as horrifically unfinished as Starbound. The game itself is deceivingly shallow, having a huge lack of content, especially compared to Terraria. On top of a lack of content, it has tons of issues that still aren't fixed.It has been months without a substantial update for a game that they swore would be released in 2013.https://i.imgur.com/J1zHrOB.pngOn top of that, the developers and moderators have taken to blaming the community for their disappointment.https://i.imgur.com/M3JBlk8.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/2zJax3Q.pngThey've gone so far as to blame ""vote brigading"" for negative Steam reviews.https://i.imgur.com/91TgOme.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/YY0UmkZ.pngAnd of course, they don't want you to get refunds anymore.https://i.imgur.com/sDGmkYM.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/egHvklC.pngDon't waste your money.

								Don't buy it. At least now. Devs haven't implemented even a half of cool stuff they promised. And it's already half a year since early access began. Wait for the release patiently and only then decide whether to buy the game or not.I really hope they'll make it though, but now it just doesn't seem so. If they ever finish it 100%, it won't be soon that's for sure.			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR: Avoid this game at all costs. For now.So, I really liked Starbound. I love the CONCEPT of Starbound. The idea that you can look around countless worlds and find new and weird randomly generated stuff is such a great concept to me. The races are appealing too from a character design standpoint, and the worlds (at one point at least) were fun and interesting. It was the makings of a perfect game, at least for me.So, why am I not recommending it?In short, the problem is that the developer, Chucklefish, has seriously mismanaged the project. Let me be clear, it's only the developers that are holding this back. The concept and world they've built is strong. They just seem to enjoy pulling anything unique out and making the game bland and generic. I would strongly recommend this game when Chucklefish either goes bankrupt and sells the assets or if a new development team comes in. Let's go through a list of changes.1. Monsters are no longer all randomly generated. They added ""hand-crafted"" monsters to most worlds. If the ridiculous hipster name didn't turn you off, the mundane attacks will. They add nothing to the game, but they were heralded as a great feature.2. Damage on contact. This was in the game when I first started and it was annoying. They removed it in favor of combat using tells from the monsters and dodging attacks. They then added this back in for no reason. This is the biggest reason I have for abandoning the game. The game is not built for damage on contact. You have to move the (barely visible) cursor to one side or the other of your character, otherwise moving backwards makes you crawl like a snail. When the combat was all about dodging, this was great because it meant you could jump out of the way of an attack and use that time to get yourself back under control. Now, that's impossible because, if you jump, you then have to spend all your attention trying to NOT land on the stupid thing. Keep in mind that almost all monsters are faster than you and will run to your position making this a futile endevour. FUN!3. They're taking the exploration out of the game. What used to be a fun trek to see what you could find on a planet's surface has devolved into exploring a world to see what micro-""dungeons"" (loot rooms) have spawned there. Given that there are only a handful of potential microdungeon themes, you're done pretty quickly. As a minor side note, they went over random weapons and turned them from cute rusted weapons that made sense... into a series of pallate swaps. ""Oh boy, I found a random axe! Unlike my current random axe, this one has a blue spiky head instead of a red swooshy head.""4. They've taken out interesting summoned bosses and have given us bland, fairly easy boss ""quests"". Don't get me wrong, the summoned bosses were terrible. Mostly because you could cheese them really easily. But they needed tweaking, not removal.5. Content removal. There used to be tentacle planets. There used to be a lot of things in this game. But it's just gotten blander and more generic every update. The races are even getting blander. They SHOULD have had racial traits that made each one interesting to play. They don't. In fact, in the next update, you're losing racial themed weapons. So, you're losing anything identifiable about the race outside of the sprite, and even that's covered up by armor most of the time.Verdict: Get this on sale for >80% off.			"

								Do not buy - the only thing the developer is doing is filling their 'dev blog' with empty promises, poor excuses and fake 'progress updates'. Game didn't receive an update in at least half a year (recently they added ""experimental"" ""updates"" that add almost no content and STILL break the game without fixing the old issues, so you get 1 exp. update to fix the one that came before it) now. Most recent update on their 'blog': a picture of a mob without much context and ""Well I don't feel like typing much. See you later!"" at the end. This just explicitly shows how lackluster and amateurish (or simply lying) their whole team is. On one occasion I had an unpleasant talk with a few of their devs and I can only say that if those people worked in any real company, they'd be fired by now.  Combat is extremely tedious and boring - hit stuff with swords and spears. For ten tiers. In a sci-fi themed game. Stuff kills you in two hits. Then you equip for that tier. Then you kill stuff in two hits until you go up a tier. Bosses are all incomplete and bland. Have trouble with one? Encase it in a dirt tomb and stab it/ blast it with turrets or underpowered guns. The only challenge in this game is dealing with the blatant lack of any though in the combat system EVEN THOUGH it was already redone to make it seem ""better"". One bad design decision leads to another and leaves the player frustrated, bored or simply regretful when he realises that he could have spent his money on something better (like a couple of actually good games). (as of 09/08/2014 this is STILL the case)Exploration is bland. Run around the planet, looking for labs for tech, cutting down trees. All planets feel exactly the same with a different colour palette. Best thing you can get out of this is some uniquely coloured blocks if you like building (but if you do, there's Terraria and Minecraft where you can do as much and more) (as of 09/08/2014 this is STILL the case)Tech is limited to new jumping mechanics and mechs which have a very limited window of usefulness. If any at all by the time you get them.If you ever wondered why the Early Access programme should have more restrictions and a refund policy in place then you can take a look at this game and find out. This project if we can even call it that is a cash grab by many standards and it reminds me only of one other game that was in the same state - the infamous scam ""WarZ"" now known as Infestation: Survivor Stories. Not to dwell on this for too long but if I am to be honest: this is the only purchase on my list of over 150 games that I have ever regretted and asked for a refund (that was refused because bah, early access shield).

Early Access Review
								Starbound is a sandbox adventure game that has been hailed as a long-awaited successor to Terraria. Unfortunately, I am applying the ""sandbox"" bit very loosely.At first glance, Starbound looks exactly as you would've expected it to look like. A game about building stuff, exploring countless alien worlds and generally killing♥♥♥♥♥♥for the hell of it. While in a literal sense, all of this is true, Starbound makes it apparent that all of these aren't going to be of any use to you throughout the game, and you're not going to have any fun trying.Starbound's linear progression system is a blatant contradiction to the term ""sandbox"", and mind-numbing amounts of item/material grinding don't help either.You see, while Starbound also bases its core elements off what has made games like Minecraft and Terraria so successful, there is also a very apparent lack of actual freedom-- the very same freedom that made the aforementioned games so enjoyable. Starbound's not-so-subtle linear progression is basically landmarked for you in small steps, telling you what you have to do in order to get ahead in terms of equipment. And by landmarks, I mean boss fights when you've done everything that the game tells you to do in a particular sector --basically just an area of space where creatures and items are all locked on a particular ""level"", so to speak. The sectors themselves are essentially levels, backtracking earlier ""sectors"" being completely useless; as most materials/items you'd find there would be of no benefit for use or crafting equipment of your current tier. And let's not forget that because these landmark bosses drop items that are absolutely necessary for crafting items of a higher tier, in the flavor of some advanced crafting station.Starbound also features needlessly complicated requirements for some basic items. For example, a device that allows you to breathe in space - in a game about space! - requires you to kill a mid-game boss, hunt down midgame minerals and have a crafting station that in itself requires some irrelevant materials. And mind you, this sort of pointless grind is necessary for a great deal of practical items such as armor, weapons and other equipment. While some weapons and armor are simple to create, those particular items are usually sub-par, if not utterly useless for the sector you'd be using them on.Exploration and the gathering of resources are pointless and incredibly unenjoyable, respectively.For a game about gathering resources and exploration, Starbound is still incredibly bland in both of those aspects. Of course hunting down minerals is a must, but Starbound seems to make even that a frustratingly boring experience. (I'm not saying it's amazing in any comparable games either, but Starbound somehow makes it even worse.) And don't even bother digging deeper into a world, it's easier to just find a different world and dig for whatever resource you need there. Also keep in mind that there are certainly no unique resources on particular worlds that would be of any use to you. And the only variation of equipment comes from the fact that most of it is randomly generated, with the exception of legendary or otherwise named items. Speaking of other worlds, and exploring in general, I can't say Starbound doesn't make it somewhat memorable to find some secret lab or mining complex hidden beneath the ground. But overall, these really don't help you at all in the long run. Functionally, almost all worlds are the same, they have trees, they have minerals, you should look to see if there's a structure that you could loot. If so, loot it and move onto the next world, if not, just move on. The only exceptions are asteroid fields and moons, which have no air, low gravity and more minerals. NPC villages basically exist solely for you to raid them, buy things from them and/or rest in themCombat is a slow-paced mess with unnecessary amounts of difficulty in places.On combat, Starbound is just plain bad. There's just no other way of putting it. It's arguably the most incredibly boring part of the game, either being an awkward cover-based ranged engagement or painfully monotonous melee combat, which consists of little more than ""click to swing thing"" until either your enemy dies or they knock you off a cliff and you die. Movement is teetering on 2 extremes, it's either a slow gait around your enemies with a bit of small hopping, or being knocked around at high velocity by the said enemies while completely helpless. In both cases it's extremely unenjoyable and very stiff, while some ""implants"" have since been added to remedy this terribly static combat (Such as higher jumping or quick bursts of speed), the fundamentals remain almost completely unaltered.The rewards of combat are almost completely null; regular enemies will not drop anything aside from a few bits of currency. Bosses will give you some necessary material to progress in the game, while mini-bosses occasionally drop some form of decent weaponry. That being said, boss fights as I've had them are crouching in a spot where the boss can't hit you and attacking them until they die, because it's simply too hard to attempt to attack them head-on. When I say hard, I mean they'll just kill you in 2 hits; combine that with the fact that combat is unredeemably boring and you're set for the most unenjoyable fighting you've had in a while.The fact that healing pots (known as StimPaks) are inexcusably rare and expensive do not help this at all. While highly effective, you'll burn through whatever miniscule amount of them you have left incredibly quickly. And with the pathetically small health pool you're given, (which does not scale to the enemies you'll be up against, even with appropriate armors equipped) you have little choice but to rely on them.Now, I'm going to be forthright here so pardon my unprofessional choice of wording, but Starbound's dev team is ♥♥♥♥ing incompetent.Chucklefish has done a lot to show us how hard they work to make Starbound what they promised it to be. Which to say is taking four million dollars of kickstarter funds, taking a long vacation after releasing their barely passable early access game, playing bloody Mario Kart instead of working on their game, and let's not forget acquiring a puppy for the office. They had promised game updates to come incredibly quickly, yet the last big update was six whole months ago. When they attempted to work with ETAs and failed, instead of taking the inevitable backlash they got and trying to improve on it, they just used it as a further excuse to not do anything. All official Chucklefish sites are heavily censored, any sort of criticism is flagged down as ""trolling"", regardless of how valid it actually is. And better yet, the devs take time out of their non-existant schedule to whine on Twitter, blaming ""trolls"" as the reason they're not getting their own work done.Chucklefish should be receiving no further support through Starbound or any other game, they're irresponsible, incompetent and show what little they care for everyone who had supported them.Feel free to disagree with me, but Starbound is a train wreck of a game. I give it a 3/10, there is enjoyment in the game, but it burns out way too fast. Linear progression in a sandbox game is downright unacceptable, grinding for items is an unnecessary meatfest, exploring nets you little reward, and combat is unreasonably hard with little health, disproportionately powerful enemies; also being painfully monotonic and boring. And it has also become quite clear that every dollar spent on Starbound is just another dollar Chucklefish is going to run away with.Starbound is a journey into the skies and beyond, and according to Starbound, the skies and beyond aren't very enjoyable.Thanks to Flashtirade for being my editor once more.

								I'm not even sure how to begin.It doesn't suck, it's not that bad, I can dig the space travel and the overall theme of the game and like anything else; having friends makes the experience pleasant for everyone. But that's where it ends for me. Five months have come and gone with nary a word of an update to fix the glaringly obvious issues that this game still has and the most we've gotten out of it was the manure splattered onto the windmill and the community has all but completely annihilated itself because of it and the joke so funnah maymay of a gods forsaken Horse AI with enough backpedaling to by the Community Managers that it would knock off miles from any car when the poll was “accidentally” deleted.I put down $15.00 in hopes of this becoming a big thing and even though Chuckles and his crew grossed nearly $20 MILLION in terms of funding. THIS is what they have to show for it? I expected better from them. I'm no developer but even I understand that leaving people high and dry with nothing but empty promises is a d!ck move.Don't get this game. There are plenty who have, there are plenty who held out hope for something. It's not happening and it never will. Spread the word, let others know what they're going to walk into if interest is shown.EDIT: There's a couple of informative links that'd probably blow my review out of the water:Google Doc articulating why development will always be thin and slow (work in progress):https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLyZCI1a9i5q0slPXzAdO37qfd6QjLs5s5ALg3op4qs/editA timeline showing several concerns.http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHy "

I can't recommend this game as the basic foundation of it is not complete. Save your $15.			"

Early Access Review
								A prime example of why people should stay away from Early Access, when this game is complete it might be truly fun however in this state its a definitive DO NOT BUY. Some games are capable of being fun in unfinished states but Starbound is not, what is currently offered is a sandbox, a very dull sandbox. It's great if you want to build or just stare at the same procedural environments over and over. Sadly even the core feature of the current alpha is lacking, the combat.The vision for this game is sweet, however it's far beyond the horizon and I don't get how the game could be finished in even a year at the current rate of development, I think perhaps 2 updates in total so far have come out, ones which didnt add content but rather just remixed the barest progression system ever. There might be some turn around with this due to the recent restructing of Chucklefish, I have seen some interesting progress in their daily updates (showing us what they're working on, not actually playable).I have seen some negatives of the game just from this alpha and they don't bode well for the final release. If you are a fan of Terraria's tight controls and graphics they are not to be found in Starbound. The graphics are fluffy as well as player movement and combat.To elaborate I feel as if all movement in the game is slow, from the velocity of bullets to fall speed, as well as the hitboxes of monsters being somewhat strange, probably in part to their procedural generation. I have a hard time believing the game will have a high difficulty lacking of frustrations, whereas in Terraria due to its good performance it can ask much of the player in it's boss fights. My current outlook is that more fun will be gotten from the noncombat experiences of the game. Those experiences however apart from building are nonexistant in the current build, features such as trading, questing, farming (plants are in but the full extent of the system is missing), and storylines are still in development.

Early Access Review
								I decided to update my review due to the influx of comments I have recieved on it. First the game is not worth the money you pay for it. Not by a long shot. Early game is fine, very playable, but mid/late game is extremely bare and unfinished and the game progress is very linear. There are no options when it comes to gear choices as you simply build the next tier of gear then fight the next boss.All the planets FEEL the same. You run across the surface, find a few chests, then find a NPC building, kill the mobs inside then move onto the next planet, each planet follows this same pattern. They do LOOK different, but its the FEEL i am talking about. Digging seems pointless as you can find all the ores you need above ground and the weapons you get as drops are better than the ones you can craft. Combat is fun at first but very samey. All the weapons seem the indentical. Some have a few gimmicks but there isnt much difference whatever you use.  My biggest problem with this game is the lack of updates to the STABLE BUILD. There has been 2 tiny updates to the stable build since February, which added virtually zero content. The game has 2 other beta options which are the unstable build and a nightly build. The unstable build is updated once in a while, but again no sizable updates. And then there is the nightly build, which apparently gets updated nightly, but it is very broken. I have yet to see a sizable update to this either, its always just little things, like a new AI interface which is purely cosmetic and adds no content. When I did update to the nightly build I couldnt even start the game for a while. To conclude with the beta options: updates are tiny and irrelvent, they are badly broken sometimes, so you are left with the choice to play the unfinished game from febraury, or a even beta beta build which might break your game and saves everyday. So yeh, in the description they say ""UPDATES WILL COME THICK AND FAST"" but the updates have been neither thick nor fast. Buy this game at your own peril.I will also be deleting comments off this review, good or bad. If you disagree, go make your own review and dont waste your time commenting on mine.			"

												Since this game attracts the Terraria crowd, here's a review about what you should expect out of this game compared to Terraria. For starters, Starbound is kind of like Terraria on steroids - it's bigger, far more involved (it actually has a quest component to it) and it's way harder.+++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Gameplay Differences Even on the easiest setting, Starbound plays like Terraria Hardmode from the very beginning. There's a difference between 'hard' and 'obnoxious', though, and in my opinion, this game is in the 'hard' category. You'll have to get on your feet and learn how things work, but thankfully, this is easy to do as the game will guide you with a tip every time you discover a new item or action for the first time. You really appreciate every item you find, because you're going to be very weak for a long time in the beginning, and your first desire will be to get rid of that crappy starter weapon. If you've already played Terraria, you'll know how to jump right in to Starbound. The game mechanics are practically identical when it comes to mining, taking items, building houses and fighting enemies. It's bascially ""another take on Terraria,"" as you'll see very quickly. Terraria's controls are simply better - jumping and curving in mid-air to reach a narrow platform is frustrating in this game, and you'll have to get used to how its ""gravity"" works, as it is far more unforgiving. Couple that with the fact that you'll get seriously hurt (or killed) from falling.Starbound has a bigger emphasis on food than Terraria. Food seemed nearly worthless after awhile in Terraria (except for pumpkin pies), but it is a necessity here -- especially on the harder tier, where you'll starve to death...this doesn't happen in the easiest mode, though. You'll start off finding and knowing about basic food, but different recipes will unlock as you discover other ingredients and make new items. Food not only increases health, but gives perks and stat boosts as well. Even on the easiest setting, food rots if you hold on to it for too long. +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: CombatCombat is highly simplistic in Starbound, it is nothing more than hack & slash for the most part. Some monsters attack by nature, some don't, but the majority of them will simply chase you down and slam into you when attacked, making combat predictable in this game. Unlike Terraria, you'll be able to access guns and other exotic items pretty quickly and not far after getting started, rather than in Terraria where you have to complete a good portion of the game to unlock certain NPCs. For the most part - one handed swords swing quicky and allow you to use a shield in the other hand, but they are weak and will require many 'hits' to kill an enemy. Two-handed swords are slow, but do far more damange than a one-handed. Other weapons like axes and hammers require you to pull back the weapon with your mouse, and release to swing. Guns allow ranged attacks but are extremely weak and will require many shots to take an enemy down, but will allow you to do it from a safe distance. In the beginning, you'll want to stay far, far away from any enemy that has a gun - especially if it's a sniper rifle.+++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Look & FeelStarbound has the look and feel of an early 90s PC or SNES game, kind of like something made by Ocean or Sierra, as opposed to Terraria's more pixellated NES feel. Starbound's music is more predictable and uniform - lots of quiet, soothing piano music. Starbound's ""monsters"" look like Pokemon rejects, which kind of gave the game its own characteristic. I personally like the huge range, style and diversity of Terraria's creatures way more. Landscapes are far more detailed then Terraria, especially backdrops, trees and other elements. Trees fall sideways when cut, and you'll be surprised when you see your first landslide when you're mining underground and hit a ceiling with loose rock or slime. This game has the same ""biome"" style regions as Terraria, where you'll venture from a forest to a jungle, or from a cavern to a slime pit, and eventually down to magma. From experience, it looks like digging too far down will result in an long drop that leads directly to an infinite ocean of lava - be careful when you're digging a Starbound ""hellevator"" as you won't get the same results as you did in Terraria...Terraria's building mechanic is more involved and intricate than Starbound for the simple reason of hammers: they allowed you to hit blocks into ""angles"" and make tons of different and unique designs, corners and slopes in Terraria. No such thing exists in Starbound, where you can only place items in square blocks. However, Starbound's graphics are more detailed and beautiful, and you'll still be able to create great looking structures. There's no ""corruption"" or ""crimson"" style event that you'll have to worry about in Starbound, so, create what you want and don't worry about what will happen to it mid-way through the game.For the most part, you take take or steal almost everything you see in Starbound, just like you can in Terraria, except on missions (for example, your first real mission, The Outpost, where all of the chairs/beds/consoles/etc are locked down and immobile). For items that you can't craft, you may come across blueprints which are one-use items that instantly add the item to your list of craftables, one you have the necessary tool to do so.When it comes to crafting, everything works pretty much the same between the two games. Craft a workbench-style item and it will allow you to create new items. In Starbound, you can upgrade these existing tool stations with specific materials to make better items. You'll find that in order to do this, better ore from outside your solar system is necessary.Negatives: you can't pause the game (WHY?!)+++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: My Favorite ThingsThere are a few things that set Starbound from Terraria in my mind - the game's universe seems bigger and more ""involved,"" because it simply is...you're no longer standed on a single game world of small/medium/large that's created from the main menu, but an entire 'universe' is created for you when you first start a Starbound quest. You'll get your own space ship, which can be decorated like a house, and will take you around the solar system without costing you any fuel. To see how big the game world is, zoom out of the solar system and take a look at the universe to see the other star systems and the planets in them. It's an exciting thing to figure out on your first playthrough.The game has objectives and a questline for you to go through, which makes the game interesting rather than Terraria's ""grind and get more powerful"", which becomes stale through time. While there are plenty of boilerplate ""fetch"" quests in Starbound, they'll force you to check out locations you haven't seen yet. I actually like the increase in difficulty that Starbound has vs. Terraria - it's easy to adjust to, and it makes you appreciate the simpler things more. Getting a better weapon is a gigantic milestone in this game, since they are far more difficult to find than in Terraria, and random chests don't usually mean uber weapons are in them...but, mediocre ones, or weapons that are only marginally better at one thing, but worse at another (damage vs. speed). You won't be crafting better weapons and armor for quite awhile - at least, until you get the courage to leave the solar system - so, you'll spend a lot of time mining and looking for abandoned outposts.Overall, if you loved Terraria but got tired of it, you won't want to miss this one - it's a bigger 'take' on Terraria with a lot of bonuses that keep the game interesting.

												*TL;DR at the bottom*Look at the most popular reviews for Starbound and 90% of them are negative even though the overall review is 89% positive. While many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game, I do not think they are giving Starbound enough credit.""Starbound is space Terraria""I do not think it is fair to compare Starbound and Terraria. Yes they are both 16-bit adventure/sandbox games, but each plays very differently. Terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun. Starbound is about the experience. This game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story. Each game is fun in its own way. (On a side note I actually like the combat in Starbound a bit better. Terraria's combat is too ""arcadey"" for me, but that is the appeal of the game for some people).""Progression is too fast""I got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed. I would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system. Now many people feel that progression is too easy. There is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time.""Interesting things have been removed""I agree with this to some extent. A while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger. I was sad because I really liked hunger, but they added hunger back. The devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it. Sure, a lot of cool content was removed, but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added? Ship upgrading, the outpost, new combat mechanics, etc. Yeah some cool things have been removed, but far more ccol things have been added. Most importantly there is something called modding. If you want temperature back, someone has made a mod for it. Chucklefish has a vision for their game. They felt like Starbound did not need temperature, so they removed it. If you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better, you can add it. Modding is not meant to fix the game, but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes. ----------------------------------------------------------------In the end I think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right, and Starbound doesn't deserve that. Does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16-bit graphics? Very few. Yes the game needs critizism, every game does. That is what allows a game to become better. Just remember that this game can be a great experience if you don't just focus on the bad.TL;DRThis game has issues but it also has many great things to offer. Look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game.*Edited to clarify my comments about modding.			"

Early Access Review
								Before reading this, I want you to keep in mind one thing, one core fact that drives this review: I LOVED Starbound to pieces, for the longest time.The first time I picked up this game (on the recommendation of a friend, I might add), I was exploring planets left and right, finding creatures that spit shadow, dragons that could one shot me, fish that looked like submarines, and dogs that vomit rainbows, on the surface of worlds made of purple eyeballs. It was the best thing I had ever seen. Then the updates came. I figured ""oh, they'll probably make it easier to find civilization"" (at the time I had only found 3 settlements, by my 30th hour of gameplay. I was still happy.) The game started to lag for me. I was used to it, I had a bad computer at the time.Shortly after, there was a wipe. I lost my character and my favorite server went down. I couldn't play with my friends anymore, the custom ship I was building (thanks to a lovely little mod bundle a friend and I assembled), the planet we were terraforming and the MASSIVE ice-world castle I was building...all gone. I saw what they did with the game and I said ""ok, I guess that's a reasonable update."" and began my base and ship anew.Then there was another...and another...Then yet another update came and I couldn't play anymore. I was looking at enough lag that creatures wouldn't move on my screen and I could walk right through hostile dungeons without firing a shot.For six months or more, I abandoned this game. A few weeks ago, I got a new computer. I immediately thought back to starbound, one of my favorite games of all time. I boot it up, all excited! Then I remember...oh, the server is gone now. Oh, my base is gone, my ship is gone, my loot is gone, my character is gone. I accept it and move on, perfectly content to start a new character and terraform everything from scratch.That's how amazing this game was.My first planet, I'm happy as a clam. I had a new bazooka that fired guided missiles and a nice sword that that spins around and massacres everything. Then I found a house! YAY! A neighbor! Then another one.....YAY! TWO NEIGHBORS!*next planet* oh hey, a village!*next planet* oh hey, 4 villages!*planet after that* Its the garden of Eden, holy crap!*fifty planets later* Jesus, another village? This whole place is filled with lava though...At this point, I've noticed that nearly every planet has a village on it. Most have several and most of the ones that have several, are completely covered in tiny little wooden villages. I didn't like that fact much, as it took away from the previous, unique feeling of awe and accomplishment that once accompanied the discovery of a settlement. Quickly becoming bored with that, I did something I had never done before. After just a few hours, I decided to run up a few levels on the main campaign (time was, I never needed to go beyond durasteel, I just explored and built). Even with all my goofing around and time wasting, I got the max tier of armor and weaponry, killed every boss using just my chakram (first weapon I ever found. It scales, but really badly...still the best weapon I have somehow) and I hit a wall...""what do I do now?""...""OHH! I KNOW! I'll capture a bunch of pets and start an illegal animal fighting ring!""...oh...wait. Nope, cant capture ""combat pets"" anymore. Only...you know I'm still not sure what you CAN capture...all I know is that its something not worth the effort...I threw those pods at literally everything interesting.""Ok, well, how about I do what my friend was doing and collect cool trees?"" Nope! None of the non-basic ones drop saplings anymore...ok...I had nowhere to really go, nothing to really do and all of a sudden I realized just how hollow the game had become.I considered building a base. I mean, every planet does have a massive cliff somewhere that I could just dig into now...Then again...that's every planet.I could go on an ice planet...but survival has been removed for a long time and all the upgrades make everything safe. (oh, minor note, I haven't found a single background that struck me as more than mildly interesting. They used to have some really gorgeous ones, like aurora backgrounds, particularly on ice planets. Now, at best, we get a mountain range. At worst, a bunch of mildly weird trees that really muck with your depth perception.)what about a lava planet? No...It takes eons to reach the floor and I'd probably just find another village.How about I settle on a planet with lots of those cool creatures the procedural generation always comes up with?...oh...wait. I haven't encountered a single procedural creature since I re-installed.It used to be hard to find a perfect planet, with a nice background and dangerous weather (seriously, meteors used to be everywhere, it was awesome!) and cool animals and a nice hillside to carve a castle into. And when you finally did, you WANTED to build there. You were COMPELLED, to build there! Now, every planet is...bland and identical. Everywhere, the same dopey rock throwing crab, the same weird, super annoying spider/rock hedgehog thing and the same...is that oddish from pokemon? ((0))_((0))This game used to be amazing. And I mean, AMAZING. It looked like terraria, granted, but it was in my top ten games of all time. Since the updates, I hesitate to say its even on par with terraria. The balance was lost. The devs left out most of the features that they were supposedly building (custom ships, being a big one. Wouldn't even be hard to do, its one file and a couple of tile types. ENTIRELY feasible and easy to make completely optional!), they increased chests, ore deposits and village areas to ridiculous levels and all but REMOVED procedural generation. Where are my shadow dogs? Where are my eyeball trees and strange giant, lightning spitting, barbarian hylotl? (I want to take a moment to impress upon you, the importance of this last bit here. The procedural generation was about 80% of what made this game amazing. Its gone now.)And where are those danged ship raiding pirates that we were promised? Congrats, you added a rail system...something that the community did for mods... in a few days...years ago.There wasn't a single second that I regretted purchasing this game before I reinstalled last week. Now, I'm not sure I'll ever play it again.So here I go, onto the next game that promises to be exactly what this game used to be.			"

												This game ended up being surprisingly stale, they cut a massive amount of functioning content that made the game more entertaining, leaving the game with little to stand on compared to it's predecessor or other games in it's genre.-The weapons are overbalanced and stratified (Magic is a joke, swords can attack in a combo but they get a huge delay afterwards if you do, all melee weapons are around the same level of slow etc.)-All the interesting flying and movement options are removed, the morphball is the only surviving relic of this stuff, but its useless and is never necessary out of dungeons, and because it lacks any special abilities all you do is move through tiny holes with it. Like how hard would it have been to make it drop a little energy bomb to solve switch puzzles or something? -The main questline requires you just running through same styled planets and clicking on furniture until you luck out enough to be able to play a dungeon. This could happen on your first try, or only be possible after around 5 hours of gameplay going through towns and planets per quest.The worst part of this is, the game USED to have interesting and fun content, there used to be more than one reason to go to a moon, there used to be fun flying techs and movement modifications. Weapons used to attack in reasonably diverse ways, and actually good ones used to exist. But all this functional and fun stuff that people enjoyed from early access was taken out.The only reason I could see, seeing as how all the stuff worked and was finished, is that they wanted these things to ""fit"" in the game. Like they wanted the morph ball to be useful, so they designed dungeons and levels with holes small enough to require it. But if say, someone had a jetpack, then any dungeon with a jumping puzzle would be trivialized. Thing is, they still have jumping techs in the game, because the ""meat"" of the game is still exploration, so you still can cheat at jumping puzzles, just not to the same extent. So in addition to failing there, this also means that you will never really be able to explore as easily as you want to, because the ""meat"" of the game is crippled by the devs inability to work around flight mechanics when designing pointless single item drop puzzle rooms.This game's skeleton is still a metroidvania, and do you know what metroidvania's AREN'T beloved for, platforming and balanced combat. Few people played Castlevania Symphony of the Night and then commented ""Wow I hate the crissaegrim, magic, and being a bat, climbing this tower while fighting the 800 medusa heads that spawned should have been WAY more tedious for me.""The changes made seem to reflect the dev's desire to make the game feel ""whole"" on release, no loose or frayed ends, and with mechanics at least ""loosely"" fitting in with what they've done, but the aspects of the gameplay they sought to preserve by removing content are the least palatable parts of the game, and now were stuck in a crippled snoozefest.In summary, the devs goofed with their decisionmaking and the game has suffered for it.Its a space game, throw in black hole guns, giant orbital beam cannons, jetpacks, lazer swords that can attack rapidly and in huge arcs, put in nukes that can unexist whole planets, either yielding huge mineral rewards or releashing eldritch terrors I need to fight with my ship. Throw in short range blink teleportation that doesnt suck. Make light not be an Issue for god sakes, I know the monster hunter logic of ""the more we cripple the player the more mechanics we can have to uncripple them"" and that makes sense for that game, but were in space for christ's sake, ALL suits would have A light on them, and there's enough other things going on that this wouldn't be missed. Put in high gravity planets, put in planets with poisonous food so you need to stock up. Throw in floating sky cities that hover on high density gas planets(real scientific possibilty for venus colonization). Or at the very least just put BACK in some of the fun that was removed. The game as it stands is you double jumping around samey rocks while swinging a sword one time a second and clicking alien pots to get to the next dungeon. All other content is either nigh pointless or removed, and what's left is boring.PS: This is reposted from a community discussion.			"

												I'm going to keep this short and sweet and get straight to the point.IF you're expecting terraria in space, or some form of a terraria clone in anyway, don't buy the game because you will be disappointed. Starbound is to Terraria as TF2 is to Overwatch. Meaning while they look very similar in visual style and gameplay, they're nothing alike. Stop comparing the two.If you're expecting something that's a bit more metroidvania styled in gameplay and looking for a game more focused on exploration, this game is for you.If you have grown bored of terraria and want a new 2D expereience, this game is for you. If you're not a fan of building and want a home right off the bat, this game is for you.Do note, the story is great but the scan quests suck. You can skip them via admin commands, there are several guides on how to skip the scanning quests.I do wish the developers would add more techs, especially ones that enable flight and unique movement boosts, same with vehicles.If you dislike certain aspects of the game, the workshop is your best friend and usually patches most of the problems you may have. While many vanillaists complain that the workshop shouldn't be responsible for ""fixing things the develeopers failed"", they're not really patches or fixes but more so useful tweaks and additions. Do note that anything that add blocks or recipes to the game will break your character once uninstalled.One thing i suggest is to disable vsync. Browse local files, go inside of the storage folder, in the file starbound.config, set it to false. It'll massively improve the FPS. There's definitly room for optimizations though (especially on windows).Overall, i love this game. I've enjoyed playing it so far and I do hope the devs improve certain aspects of this game. Given that they have an unstable branch for testing the game, and the newest patch is alright so far. I'd if i were going off the negative reviews alone, they're slowly getting back on the right track.			"

Early Access Review
								Update: Enjoyed toying arround with the community for a long time. That plaything got old and I moved on. Being a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to CF and the community was worth the 15 dollars. The game itself is not worth it though.Disclaimer:If you prefere a more objective, better written review give this guy a chance: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082557773/recommended/211820/Its far less vulgar then mine and he brings up proofs of CFs mistakes and censorship.Check him out.IMPORTANT: Going to do a full scale update completly revamping the review. You can call me whatever you want or create as many alts you want to disagree just because you want to defend your little ""poor innoncent indie development company"", I dont care. The forums are turning into a corrupted sinkhole and are de facto banning users for no reason. Its the 18th December 2015 now. This game has been in early access for... 3 years... 3 damn years. And not a single bit of decent progress. Instead people who were fans of the game get banned on their forums for saying that their combat ""update"" is bad. Instead they add useless furniture, tedious fetch quests and a useless colony system instead of propper content like a functioning, balanced combat system or the actually promised dark and mature content. Instead this game gets DF9'ed so they can forget it as fast as possible. What a waste of money and time...This review is outdatet. The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥now after certain ""updates"" (2 noteworthy updates changing the game objectivly to the worst.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alright after some serious thoughts on the game and recent posts of the devs calling negative criticism invalid I would like to disencourage from supporting Chucklefish and any titles they are developing. They called people with valid points trolls and idiots. Valid points are for instance that the game developement is by far too slow, alot of broken promises, no ETAs anymore just because 1 or 2 done by the devs backfired, ignoring the official community almost entirely (inofficial communities like Reddit get all the attention) and if they interact with the official community on the official forums it is just minimal and not saying anything.The game itself was suprisingly good for the way it was back 1,5 years ago and honestly I was hoping that devs would keep up the good work they had when initially starting the public <<Beta>> back in december. It had nice mechanics (all gone now), 6 interesting species which are quite original (except for humans maybe, because well thats us) (2 of them still not being fully implemented), a decent weather system which can blow away your mind at some point (which game offers nowadays weather with really destructiv abilities and forces you to think into your buildings, what materials you use and the whole design.), and most important ALOT procedurly generated things, mobs are random, weapons are random, blades are (almost) random, planets and envirements are random (partially, means dungeons and certain presets are there and selected on generating a planet) and pretty well done on the code you could think. Nope its a pile of garbage.But for the ignorance and sorta mean spirited comment on quite a few negativ feedbacks on the official forums done by a good chunk of the community I would not recomment supporting them just for the Devs to wake up. I got the impression that they are not providing anything good at the moment. What we got is a relativly good game whatsoever. But the Dev team is currently a, excuse my words, horrible cluster♥♥♥♥.If they intend to change that behavior at some point I will retract the negativ review of course and turn it into a positiv one, but that must be said, the current state of developing is not really satisfying and you are pretty much tipping in the dark of knowing what will be added at some point. If you just want to have a good sidescrolling survival game in space which allows you to build awesome 2d structures and some fairly interesting, very different alien species to choose from (which game has humanoid canivorous plants nowadays, again really good design decision by them) then its something for you. And if you are into weird tentacle porn/pr0n then there is also a whole biome you will like. Get a <<sexy>> female character (probaly alien species aswell for the extra weird guys) and have your wildest Phantasies on said biome ;). So its up to you: If you want a relativly good game now and dont care about future developments, consider this as thumbs up and go ahead and purchase it. If you are looking a bit more skeptical on things I would wait and see how things develope and not purchase... specially after the drama the past days the devs caused in the official community. Oh and mobs look like Pokemon sometimes, thats also a nice little plus. And you can actually catch those mobs aswell and use them as critters for your own purposes (the feature is still not fleshed out but still pretty cool). That should sum it up, thanks for bothering to read.Update 1:So apparently the dev team managed to move all together after roughly 4-5 months. They are now located in great britain and are feeding the official forums with news and on what they are working on... though after another ""rant surge"" of the official community of not being updated on the forums, and reddit again getting all the attention. They posted then a ""Status Update"" which involved nothing but an advertisement for a game they are publishing. That caused more trouble finally getting them to post on a daily base since monday. Lets see how long they continue and when we will see an actual patch... If they keep their word and ""big content patch"" is on its way then the game might have a chance to get better soon... getting better reputation wise.Update 2:CF is censoring now their steam subforum.Update 3: Mod who is censoring hard got removed, Finn is quite ok to be frank, other one ""Shoehead"" intruded steamforums, got turned into shredds within a few hours.Update 4:CF has a subforum on their official forum hidden from regular members. Its not a moderator forum.http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407014460583.pnghttp://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407016724018.png http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407016900953.pngThe people in that section are all hardcore defending people. All of them. And presumeable out of the rules posted by ""Sledra"" they are allowed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there. So why dont I get an unmoderated forum... like they got... why is steamforums not moderated by their mods so people could post whatever they want.			"

Early Access Review
								I have really enjoyed playing this game with my friends and family for 1000+ hours. It’s easy enough that my 5 year old son could understand the controls and play for hours. I like being able to play LAN with my with my family or on a private server with friends. The variety of planets, items, building materials and monsters is great. I do like all the updates the game developers have made. I wish there was more mission and story content but the developers are working on it. I'll have to wait till end of game development till I can truly evaluate the content amount. My favorite thing to do in this game is play with my young son and help him build houses, go looking for ""buried"" treasures and fight monsters. I think this is a great game for young families.What more could a little kid want, then roaming a galaxy is his spaceship, finding treasure and fighting bad guys. "

								No meaningful updates have been released for about two or three months. Developers ban people on their forums for expressing any kind of negative opinion about Starbound. While the core mechanics of the game are in need of serious work, Chucklefish is interested only in creating more useless different hats and reworking old characters models. The game is terrible and every single component of it requires a lot of tuning and balancing. Release date is being pushed forward again and again. When Starbound was released on Steam they promised they would release the game in 2013. After a few months they said ""well, maybe we will release it in 2014"". Now they say that it's impossible to release it earlier than 2015.			"

												I've been playing this game for a long time, a little too long. On and off.I was fascinated by the premise of the open-ended story, with each race's unique start-off.But now it's just some linear cheesy gobbledigook nonsense. Not to mention the changes they made, and the things they removed from the game simply made the game less intuitive and creativity driven.Now, you're not a Glitch that realized the futility of it's pre-programmed existance, a rebel Apex running away from it's totalitarian masters, an Avian that was shunned and ran from the fanatical cult life of his kinsmen, No.All of that is gone, those are the stories of NPCs you see every now and then. You're the CHOSEN ONE. You, and you alone were decidedly important enough to be sent to gather a new alliance of races to defeat an evil star entity that was sealed away by another star entity who now shattered in the process to produce the Novakids. I could go on, and on about how much worse this cheesy, one-directional story telling is, but the bottom line is,You've replaced one of the most interesting, intuitive and self-creating open ended sandbox adventures into a linear, boring, cheesy, and frankly quite childish futuristic fantasy game. Which there are countless numbers of out there that do a better job.And this is only mentioning the lore aspect of this game.Gameplay wise, yeah they added a lot of features and optimized the game a little better than what they had previously, the planet specific biomes, poison pools, light showers and volcanos are really nice to explore.But what grasped me on top of everything else, was the combination of that with the Interesting boss fights, there were no gimmicks other than the ones you could think of on your own, there weren't any railroaded fights, you fought the bosses if you had the technology or had a means to beat him on your own terms. Just like Terraria, only less exploitable.If I had to take an example, I had the most fun when I first called the penguin UFO to fight the first boss that would help me advance to the next technological stage. I panicked and died, but had the idea of building myself some cover, a bunker if you will. I was THRILLED when the UFO crashed down to try and kill me, only to take a chunk out of my bunker and I had to be careful his penguin soldiers didn't try to get in, while still chipping away at his health.All of that, gone.And replaced with some new instance - unbreakable arena that they pre set just so you can fight him and his cronies, in the open, relying solely on your weapon and armour - which you had to upgrade enough just to get through the boss. No reward for intuitive play, or creative flares. Just mindless gear grinding. Doing that, for all the bosses was a huge mistake.Not to mention the RPG-esque quest system. For the most part, it works out fine. But it really took a lot out of the original version when you feel so detached from the fight itself. Because the first penguine fight, which used to lead to your technological ""level up"" would happen on your first planet, your first base. Where everything you had could've been destroyed by the UFO body slam.Honestly, all of that, all the changed, removals, and needless editions added up to a game that was far sub-par to what it was before the ""final"" release.Seriously, way to drop the ball chuckle♥♥♥♥s.

												I liked this game back when it first came out on steam. When 1.0 came out, I figured I might enjoy it again. That wasn't the case. A lot of content was cut and even exploration feels much more bland and stale. -Temperature system has been removed. This was one of the nice features back during the beta. Most clothing had function (Snow Infantry set was very useful) and it felt very relaxing sitting by a fire on a snow planet so you could warm up.-Sectors have been removed. You used to only be limited in exploration by the temperature system and how warm or cool you could get. A forest planet in a sector would be just as dangerous as a lava planet on that same sector, and you would find the same resources on every planet in that sector until you moved on to the next one. This was a favorite feature of mine and really enhanced exploration because there was just as much incentive to going to the forest planet as the lava planet. -Most techs are gone. I remember all the vehicle and flying techs, and how you'd have to find them to actually use them. Now that I can't use my bubble tech, I have to build giant pillars to get on avian pirate ships. And this isn't all, there was also a mech and some other vehicles. The only surviving tech vehicle is the boat, only now you have to waste pixels buying it instead of being incentivized to explore to find it.-Randomly generated monsters and weapons have been removed. I enjoyed this because it added to exploration and had you wondering what kind of creatures and crazy weapons you'd find on a planet you'd land on. Every creature was unique and every weapon was unique, down to the name and function. This also added a lot of fun to exploration because of course, you wouldn't know what you're going to find.-Story isn't that great. I honestly had more fun back when you'd build the bosses yourself in order to advance to the next sector and unlock more equipment and crafting tables. I thought the beginning of the story was fine, but the rest felt repetative and boring. ""Find a ________ settlement and scan objects"" gets very annoying and I tend to just drift away from the story altogether. I have yet to face the final boss because of this. -Plenty of weapons and armor have been cut, and I don't mean the randomized ones you used to find on planets. I mean weapons and armor you crafted at tables. Copper and gold almost seem to have no use anymore, and I quite enjoyed those armors, as bad as they were, and copper armor and weapons were easily obtained in the early game, allowing you to take on more dangerous things. It felt like I was legitimately getting stronger and every ore had a use. Almost any type of weapon could be made from any type of ore. Feel like making daggers? No problem. Spears? Yep. Instead now, there are too few craftable armors and weapons, and it seems ores have gotten even more scarce.-Further cuts include certain dungeons (USCM bases are a prime example), and you can no longer attack NPCs unless you break all their stuff. If I want to be a murderous psychopath and purge xenos, just let me do it please. On top of all that, there's little reason to go to moons or asteroids anymore. Asteroids would be one of the most dangerous biomes in the game with the best resources, but now there's pretty much nothing. I will repeat, I LOVED this game in 2013. Telling people to mod it in is no excuse and it's the wrong mentality to show to developers.  I'll change my opinion if some of the good features are added back into the game or some of the many promises Chucklefish made are implemented. Starbound simply feels like half the game it was when it first came out on Early Access.			"

Early Access Review
This will be a bit different. Critical analysis of:======================================Starbound======================================Note: Positive recommendation due in large part to development starting to come together well. I do not think you should buy this game at this moment, but you should watch.TL;DR:Wait for release, and perhaps a little while after! See how the final stages of development goes! Make sure implementations of vital features and the way they intertwine are up to your par! Things have been improving, accelerating, and shaping up a lot lately...but you never know what one thing could ruin it all for you as an individual. As always, be wise with your money.Do I at this point think release (or a few big updates after) will be worth your money? Yes. Do I think that it could also potentially be held back by a poorly implemented feature or two? Quite possibly. So if you have already purchased starbound...maybe it will soon be time to give it another go! But if you haven't...hold on to your wallets for just a little longer.======================================In-depth Feature Critiques:The Beginning:You start out on a pretty planet, with a lush, colorful, friendly background. The terrain is usually mild in variation, making navigation fairly simple and quick. You are outright forced to dig down to the bottom of the planet--gathering ore along the way for gear--to acquire core fragments so you can fix your ship and go elsewhere.Now, this may sound pretty annoying--and it is, however, many steps have been taken to make it a relatively quick and easy process. There are more caves and tunnels, making digging down to the bottom easier, as well as ore deposits that can be broken up to get a decent amount of a certain ore type. Underground sub-dungeons can potentially provide interesting loot, or just a needed change of scenery or some pixels.The Planets and Exploration:Upon gaining the ability to venture further, you may wonder just how good the new sights will be. The answer to this question: a mixed bag. Many planets seem boring and pointless, just a new color or different dungeon/settlement type. Maybe a cool biome or two...maybe a bunch of annoying biomes. Maybe there's no good loot. Maybe ore generation makes your desired type hard to find. To make matters worse, certain planet types tied to getting through the later tier are by nature incapable of being fun and unique. Ocean planets, for example. Mostly water atm.On the other hand, it is very possible to stumble upon a planet with cool terrain, a cool settlement or dungeon with good loot, awesome looking background parallax and kickass trees, and an abundance of ore. Regardless, there needs to be more unique elements and reward/incentive to exploration. Things to make individual planets stand out and be special. Rare biome or dungeon variations, a strangely safe and beautiful planet of a dangerous harsh biome type, a different day/night cycle time, dangerous creatures and minibosses.The Combat and Creatures:Combat in starbound is fairly well setup. Weapons have unique properties and styles that generally enable you to fight however you want. Monsters now have better tells and more sensible windups, so blocking, dodging, parrying, and tanking are now all viable options. Since monsters are mostly generated off screen, and generally stay there, the end result is that combat often feels like a chore you do to get that one creature with that one annoying attack to stop impeding your horizontal progress around a planet.There is much room for improvement in that regard:Loot should be more rewarding, fun, or varied. Monsters should seek you out and display unique behaviors. Perhaps some herd up, or fight in small roaming packs, or try to avoid you. Even if nothing at all is done to make it more engaging and fun, rather than like a popup when trying to surf the net, the spawning needs to be tweaked. I would like to see hardcaps on the amount of creatures that can spawn within a set distance of each other, or while you are busy killing other mobs, or how quickly it will populate the area past your sight with new monsters when you've just slaughtered five so you can finally resume moving forward.The Functional Mechanics and Building:They actually nailed this one. The matter manipulator is not only a lore-friendly tool, but an essential one. It is a way to have an item bound to your character at all times, not taking up inventory or hotbar space, that offers a big improvement on the utility found in most sandboxes. Digging and placing blocks can be precise, with ugprades to speed and tiles covered, the size of which can be adjusted on the fly. You can remove and relocate liquids, and building is quick and easy as well, thanks to the handy ability for your matter manipulator to hightlight relevant blocks. As a protip: You can even use it to help search for buried ore in the dark!Building is quite good. There are many objects and styles of blocks to play around with, and you can now colonize planets and rent out rooms of your design to NPCs. The building materials chosen for this process directly effect what you will get. This gives more purpose to the various biomes, and the exploration of them, because there are tenant NPCs that are based specifically on certain biome types. This was also very well done. Unfortunately, the availability of unique and varied building blocks in terms of aesthetics is limited. Aside from stone, many can only be scavenged from settlements or dungeons, no less! There are plenty of blocks that will end up having 100 recolors, as well, due to the nature of their planet, like sand and dirt. So why is there not a similar change in color and style not found in wallpapers on settlements, the color of bricks used in temples, and so on? Maybe one day.The utility of the sci-fi exploration sandbox genre typing doesn't end there. A ship AI personal to your race is a clever way to dispense introductions to the game and quests, tips, and inform you if you try to do something like pay for an upgrade with too few materials. There are many other instances of starbound's mechanics being very well designed, so the foundation is strong.======================================I've maxed out on space to the point where I can't even finish the following section. For those who want to read the rest, I threw up a silly wordpress site: here[fakersrealreviews.wordpress.com]======================================The Sandbox, Progression, and Professions:This one is a bit more difficult to comment on, because it's in a pretty heavy state of flux lately, and especially going forward from here, so I'll cover the basics from where it has been to where it is going. Back in my day, when we had to walk to school uphill in the snow, 10 miles, both ways...you could simply load up your ship with coal and take off to the great unknown. This was pretty cool, but honestly, from a design standpoint it did allow you to exhaust content quickly and kill off the novelty of the sights to see. The starmap at this point branched out with similar planets, and you had to unlock the next tier to see new types. This was pretty lame, actually, and it conveyed an extreme feeling of artificial walls and progression.			"

												I dig this game way way more than Terraria.There's just way more roleplaying potential to a game where you explore the endless Universe, as opposed to a game where you go right or left.I just want to manspread my Galactic Empire.But fine i'll specify the finer points that tip the scales for me:- Artstyle is less chibi and more ""visible"". I know that sounds like not much of a differrence in a pixel game, but it's going to have a much bigger merit after hours of gameplay.- Size scaling. Everything in Starbound is visible and more up close, whereas Terraria seems ""tiny"" with a lot of ""wasted"" space. I don't know if Terra scales with monitors, but either way.- The flashlight. Sounds silly, but it makes exploring caves in Starbound much more fun. You no longer have to spend most of earlygame on putting torches around.- Varied races, but that's a given.- Varied worlds, but that's a given.- The main building tool in Starbound is much more convenient and versatile. But that might be a negative point for people who prefer heavier roleplaying.- Workshop- Weapons and animations are much better in my opinion. There is absolutely no stiffness to attacks.- Building is much better as well, you can freely choose between using the same material for either the foreground or the background. Not only more realistic, but more convenient as well.- The Starship HUB.Look at that. Points.			"

												Edit: Review Addendum for 1.0 release:It's official, for their grand finale, Chucklefish has totally ruined Starbound. They finally settled on one tedious game mechanic and a generic ""collect all the macguffins"" plotline for the ""1.0"" release. Then they took all the hit or miss content they had tested and either vetted or removed over the last 3 years, carelessly ground it all up, and poured the resultant slop over the bland shitcake base game. Kinda like a chef who mulches an entire thanksgiving dinner into a soup, bones and all.It seems like they couldn't decide how to properly implement all their old content in the face of the re-re-re-invented design, but rather than let it all go to waste, they just hastily rebranded and pasted bits of it everywhere. The slurry pulp that used to be sequential mission instances and technology unlocks is now an incomprehensible pile of broken gameplay chunks, haphazardly slapped everywhere without reason or direction. The result is a horrible, disjointed, unplayable cluster♥♥♥♥ overflowing with inexplicable changes, even when it's NOT suffering from game-breaking slowdowns and fatal glitches. Unfortunately, this is the mess they've decided to settle on, so this is the mess we're stuck with. Even a dozen brilliant 3rd party user mods aimed at mitigating the damage aren't enough to salvage this disaster. Good older content like the portable pixel printer are gone, while ridiculous, nonsensical additions were made, such as giant, unkillable ghosts that haunt every empty moon in the universe. Why??In fact, that's the question that best sums up this entire ""official non-beta release."" WHY.--Beta Version review follows:I fear Starbound will turn out less like Disneyland, which is a functional masterpiece that will never be finished but constantly improved, and more like the Winchester House, constructed haphazardly and proceeding aimlessly without direction until its owner's death. The game has a more than decent framework, but the developers keep changing the game's premise, leading to a circuitous lack of progress and wasted potential. It's gone from a Terraria-like 2d space exploration game with procedural worlds and craftable bosses, to a story-driven series of instance dungeons, all the while killing off promising older content while adding more and more unfinished (and/or unnecessary) features. This slash-and-burn development has left the game unfocused, long after the point where it should have been crystallizing. The initial hype has died down, releases are fewer and longer between, and content is stagnant for months at a time, leaving players wondering if there's any motivation or momentum left to see it completed.The playstarbound website seems to feature lots of regular updates, but most of it seems to be showing off graphical blandishment and experimental features, few if any of which have rolled down to gameplay or promise to offer much in the way of functional content. In their eagerness to demonstrate that they are still actively working on the game, they're offering a lot of gravy and not much meat. Players will quickly burn through all the existing gameplay content and acquire all the useful craftable equipment, leaving you with nothing to do but wander randomly generated worlds in search of treasure chests. Judging from the comments here and at other sites, many players have walked away due to the lack of content, and with them goes word-of-mouth support. After all, what good is an increasingly graphically refined game world if there's nothing new to do in it?			"

Early Access Review
								Not recommended. But it has potential, so it may – possibly – be good once it's finished.The biggest reasons why you shouldn't get it yet:– It's pretty boring. Yeah yeah, some fanboys say they've invested 500 hours into Starbound, but unless you're also a fanboy, you'll probably run out of interesting things to do pretty fast. – There is a pretty high risk that your worlds and/or characters will be wiped or corrupted in software updates, which is pretty disencouraging for investing time and effort into this game.There are some troubling aspects about Starbound. Some of those things have to do with the failed promises of the developer. Around 6 months after it was released as Early Access, it's still basically in alpha, and who knows when it's going to be released? With few major updates, it's also hard to know if the game is on the right track. Put simply, I don't think we should reward developers who can't live up to their promises.But I also have some deeper concerns about the concept of Starbound itself. Starbound is basically Terraria in space, and one reason it's taking so long to finish is because it's so damn ambitious. An endless amount of planets with lots of various biodomes, what's not to like? Even in the Early Access, there's a lot of variety, but unfortunately it seems to be rather superficial. And that is the problem: that despite the massive amount of content, most of it may ultimately feel rather generic and not especially meaningful. In other words, my concern is about quantity vs. quality. And furthermore, why invest time in building stuff on a planet, if you're going to move on to other planets anyways? As a result of these things, both exploration and building are hurt – arguably two of most fun things do to in games of this genre.Can they solve this, and create both quantity AND quality? I.e. create a good game? It should definitely be possible, but we can't know until they've gotten further into the development. As of now, they haven't solved it.			"

												Okay. We should be fair with Starbound. I will bs nobody.First off, I am a supporter from back when it was on Early Access.The game has been dramatically changed since then.I had to play through the whole game again, since my savegame was not compatible with V1 but who cares really?So, what IS Starbound?Well it started as an open world sandbox game. KEEP THAT IN MIND PLEASE.So, since then a lot of stuff were added.We got a great set of unlockable technology upgrades, so you can craft gradually stuff you are gonna need.The game introduces you gradually to its universe with a set of missions, to do some essential things.The whole tutorial is the lore of the game. Yup! A sandbox with lore as tutorial, how do you like that?One step before going against the final boss, you know you are ready to explore whatever you want.What a great idea! You also carry a codex, where you can collect a lot of wrriten stuff, like journals, stories etc etc, very rewarding for readers.You can collect various stuff, like bugs, fish, fossils, and make collections out of them.Randomly (?) generated quests occur all the time, with always interesting rewards and not useless stuff.Challenges are available and a lot of stuff to do.You can farm, you can have your own pets... what else can I say about this awesome game?Oh! The world!Well basically you start on a solar system. Then you go outside of it to another star. Stars are solar systems with planets inside them. Imagine that stars are generated gradually as you move through the universe map. And believe me, there are LOTS of stars, full of planets to explore.Favorite changes (for early access users that wanna see what's new):A] The pixel compressor has no penalty.B] The fuel gathering became an interesting challenge instead of a freaking boring process.C] Optimized not to lag. So let's see:Graphics: 90% Fantastic pixel art Sound: 90% Great music but too emotional for my taste. Still great.Gameplay: 90% It is very polished, the game seldom lags even on my old PCReplayability value: 90% With so many races, I bet this can be played many many times.Value for money: 90%  I played 300 hours already, including the time before V1 was released.Scenario: 70% Interesting scenario, but that's it. <<< This is considered an EXTRA on a sandbox game.Do I recommend this?Well yes. It is a great game, just don't take it for an RPG.It is a sandbox.			"

												Absolutely fun and lovely game. Very addictive and a lot of fun to play with friends. The soundtrack is amazing as well. The only real gripe I have with Starbound is that there aren't racial traits that effect gameplay. You would think with all these amazing different races to choose from, and the background they've given to them, there would have been special traits/abilities given to them that would add a bit more depth to gameplay.

												9/10Starbound is a procedurally generated universe where you can plunder endless amounts of dungeons, build colonies, and mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. It's a cute indie with co-operative multiplayer which makes up for its unassuming appearance with the sheer amount of content the developer provides, supports and continues to shell out.Both the pixel art and soundtrack are both easy on your senses, creating an immersive atmosphere and inspiring ambience for late night galactic voyages. Especially fun if you have some friends who want to build a settlement or tag along for an adventure. Prepare for a time-sink.			"

Early Access Review
								The good:-Great soundtrack and use of instrument items.-Randomly-generated enemies get amusing designs sometimes, with those in higher tiers gaining new abilities (curse you barb spray).-Backstory behind all the races can influence how they interact with eachother, though only in dialogue currently.-Randomly generated, but consistently so, allowing coordinates to be shared between players to find cool stuff.-Pokemon.The bad:-Bosses can be cheesed pretty easily, sometimes by accident.-In fact, the entire game can be cheesed, really. Between burrowing just under the surface, walling myself off from enemies, and using a movement tech to fly over stuff, I soloed the game all the way to the final tier, crafted endgame armor, and found a tier-ten legendary sword without ever crafting a chestpiece, which means I had 1/2 the armor and 1/5 the health I should have had for the entire game and still managed to complete it. Shouldn't something prevent that?-Gameplay gets repetitive. There are different planetary and underground biomes, but even the tentacle and heck biomes still play the same as the others, just with cosmetic changes, and any biome-specific loot is fairly inconsequential.-There are STILL dungeon/NPC instances I have yet to encounter, but I don't really need to, because they're all roughly the same (except the Portal-based one, that's pretty neat, but finding it without coordinates can be a chore, and it lags like hell even in singleplayer).-Lackluster tutorial only briefly mentions some critical gameplay elements without actually showing them to you (Cooking? Bed healing? Pickaxe? Anvil? Nah, you don't need any of those, you'll be fine).-Players in multiplayer can destroy your ship decorations and steal your locker items unless you build your base on an asteroid far above the planet's surface.Conclusion:If you like building stuff, play Minecraft.If you like fighting stuff, play Terraria.If you like exploring stuff, play Starbound.

Early Access Review
								Oh Starbound...I wish I could recommend you.This is going to be long, guys. Grab a Seat.I'm going to start with what Starbound was a while back. Starbound is something that I was so excited for, and was so hyped for. After playing So much Terraia, I flipped a♥♥♥♥♥♥when I heard about Starbound back in 2012. I constantly followed the Dev Logs and the Roadmap (We'll get back to this) to see how close the game was to their initial release of Summer 2012. Then...That didn't happen. Which is all fine and Dandy, I understand some games need more time to work on them, they can be overly ambitious and overestimate time. The Problem here however, is they Lied. Quiet a bit actually. Time to get back to that Roadmap, one of the biggest lies. The Interactive Roadmap they had posted, showing all their progress, was removed, and I realized this as soon as the game actually came out, that this was because they had such little actually functioning/complete. The Game that they called ""Beta"" was pretty much Alpha. Randomly Generated Planets, The Progression, The Weapon System...They were so very simple. Because of my initial excitement, I was able to pour over 90 hours into the game before I realized the universe of Starbound was really...Generic. None of the planets, monsters, or weapons felt unique. Sometimes It might be a desert planet. Sometimes It might have lots of trees, or sometimes It's purple. They were all ""Randomly Generated so they're all unique"" But that really tore away attachments to everything, Monsters Especially. When Combined with their small aresnal of abilities. They effectively became walking attacks with a randomly gen'd monster skin.This was early starbound, and it was honestly a total a complete mess. But Lets talk about Starbound Today, and why I still don't recommend it. A lof of issues I've stated, they are working on fixing, which is great. They've added more handrawn weapons, Monsters, Microdungeons, and unique planet atmostpheres. They've added Progression, Colony's and farming. They've honestly, added a good wealth of stuff!But honestly, I still can't recommend this, and here's why:. There's STILL an inherent feeling of incompletion, emptyness, and genericness you get when playing starbound. Sure there is more of a drive now with a early quest system finally added, and you have the initial explorative drive to push you into caves and microdungeons to sink some hours. But after a while, it still begings to feel very stale and incomplete. Which again, wouldn't be an issue, but this game has been in Early Access since 2012, which is well passed it's origional Release frame. With Developers as Untrustworthy as Chucklefish, this is a huge issue. The game verywell could get the Early Access sticker removed from it and sold as it is now. There would be nothing stopping them from claiming the next update to be the full version of this game, and have plenty of promised features still missing from the core. This is one of the main reasons I cannot recommend this. This game will have you left feeling empty, like something is just always missing.I of course do realize though, this may not be a problem for some of you. Some of you will look at starbound, ignore it's developers, and have tons of fun regaurdless. If you know for a fact that Starbound is a game you can enjoy at it's current state with the possibility of this being it's final release, by all means. Go ahead. I will say multiplayer does make the game much more enjoyable. But I personally, cannot recommend this game still. After following it's development very closely, and witnessing all the decietful behavior these dev's have exhibited, anything can happen. I've already seen some features like Hunger and Heat removed. Maybe they'll bring it back, maybe they'll remove something else. If they break something they can't fix/balance, they might just remove it.Overall, in combination of the game still feeling inherently empty, The Developers of starbound are untrustworthy and that is a very scary thing. I can't willingly recommend you a game that does not feel finished, might one day never even be finished.			"

Early Access Review
								Please.. please.. please for the love of glob don’t buy this game. This is another example of early access done badly, first of I was initially patient for the updates when I bought this. I mean I enjoyed the game but the lag was killing me, each time I entered a dungeon my framerate drops to the 10s and 20s and was either not fun or just unplayable. I asked a couple of times when will the game be stable I mean honestly never cared for the fluff like new items or biomes I just would like the game to be more stable. Those posts got ignored. So okay fine I’ll wait they did promise faster updates.. 3 months more or less and we didn’t get a stable update not one just broken builds not meant to be played. So I wondered what the hell happened.I checked the forums and apparently I wasn’t the only one worried and people voicing concern or resentment for what’s happening are getting banned. They apparently don’t take well to criticism and will ban anybody on whim. So yeah, unless you’re willing to play through this broken shell of a promising game spend that $14.99. But I hope you don’t because this is (for me) the worst Early Access Title I bought and I bought a few. Just wait and spend that $14.99 and buy a complete game and wait for this one to come out, from the looks of it that will be a couple of years or more.   "

Early Access Review
								At release, Starbound was promising. I was hyped. It seemed like a good purchase at the time, because I had been waiting for four months prior to purchasing the game.Upon the beta testing/release date, several things became completely evident to me - 1. The game is uninspired and lacked any of the features that were promised on the Roadmap.2. The game lacks features - it cannot be called a 'beta' by any means.3. While the engine is robust, stress testing the engine without using the 'mod' system is impossible anymore.Moreover, all of those things come in addition to multiple problems with both the developers and the way the developers act - that, unfortunately, is not going to be discussed here. What they say and do does not concern me, because I'm not going to give them any more of my money after this.The game is uninspired. All of the planets are palette swaps of prior planets with background changes and very little varied topography, ocean planets are not implemented, water does not work properly, combat is unaimed and very clunky, movement is slow and practically unresponsive until late game, the space game doesn't give you guns until 3/4ths of the way through...There's really more I can expand upon, but I don't want to spend all day pointing out every little flaw: while that my be what I signed up for, people tend to throw hissyfits whenever someone does that.The game also lacks many pivotal features and items that were told to be in the game. Now, before everyone tells me 'it's a beta!'...Tough luck. A beta is a game that is feature complete and does not have content added until post-release, this game is an alpha. Features are still being added and looked at, which means that the game is nowhere near ready for beta testing.Now, the third is a personal gripe. I do not want to modify and add content to this game because I did not pay to develop code for the developers, nor would I get paid for doing so. I paid to test a beta, which involves moving variables, creating events that lead to crashes (like the 8x8 matter manipulator that hit as fast as your FPS), and even manipulating drop tables so I can check and see if newly implemented items work as-intended. With the devs putting a 'beta' into a .pak file, it removes any and all ability for me to properly beta test the game. It has no reason to be within a .pak file, because it is not a release copy.Overall, the game is flawed, the developers have no idea what they're doing, and paying for this game is not worth it. Not until the game is released.Edit: It has been a year and a day since I have written this review. Happy Independence Day, America, and the game is still not out. Abandonware, do not buy.Edit 2: IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW. PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE HAD CHILDREN. THOSE CHILDREN ARE NOW OLD ENOUGH TO WALK. SOME OF THEM HAVE SAID WORDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I TAUGHT THEM TO SAY? ""STARBOUND ISN'T OUT YET.""HAPPY THIRD YEAR OF WAITING. ARE THERE MORE TECHLEVELS? HOW ABOUT DIRECTIONAL SPEARS YET? WHAT OF GUNS WITH AMMUNITION? WATER PHYSICS? REAL MOUNTS? A STORY? CHUCKLEFISH, GET IT TOGETHER. DO NOT BUY.			"

												ironically the game was way bigger when it was just starting off in early access. there weren't any missions or crewmembers or anything, but every single planet was a completely different adventure. now you just have a handful of biomes to explore that all have the exact same areas and loot in them. i've played about 20 hours of it since 1.0 came out and i'm already bored of it			"

								Basically abandonware at this point. Early access scam. The developers raked in 12 million and haven't put out any updates of substance since Febuary. One of the few devs who actually did work quit and the rest of the team used the money to relocated countries and explore life. Buggy game, animations are simplistic at best, enemy AIs leave much to be desited, bosses can all be bugged easily and have terrible AI. There isn't much of a sense of exloration as all the planets basically have the same things on them. Terrible letdown after all the hype that Chucklefish put behind it. Don't give Chucklefish your money. Stick with Terraria for your 2d sandbox fix (keep an eye on Edge of Space for a SciFi themed game, still shakey at this point, but could be amazing).			"

												I got 400+ hours out of a game I paid less than 15 dollars for, I've played it since Early Access, I have had my character wiped 4 times, If that is any indication on how long I've owned it. The game has a feel that not many other games have, the music is similar to the music of Morrowind, the weapons/combat remind me of Castlevania and the abilities are like the ones you get in Metroid or Mega Man. There is an endless galaxy to explore, a character to customize from various races, colonies to build, quests to complete, crops to grow, a ship to enhance and customize and monsters to capture. I think it is very worth the price. Oh, right. Hoverbikes.Edit: I didn't receive the game for free, I have no idea why it says that or how to remove it.Also, the modding community is extremely active and is on Steam Workshop/ Nexus Mods. I highly recommend Frackin' Universe and the XS Mech Mod. There are also mods that add in races and their communities/colonies which are really well done too.			"

								Incompetent Devs making an incompetent game.I bought a 4 pack of this when the game came out, I regret it. I wish I had never given them any money. My biggest reoccuring thought when it comes to starbound is that I wish I had gotten a refund when I had the chance. The gameplay in this is shallow and weak, the combat lacks impact, the movement controls are laggy and imprecise, the crafting system requires ridiculous grind, the game lacks content, the procedurally generated planets are all the same,  all of this the game promised to deliver through updates after the beta released, updates which never came. The devs squash any criticism of the game or their failure to deliver on their promises both here on the steam forum and at their own home base hugbox forums.If this game interests you I STRONGLY recommend you instead look at Terraria. It is quite clearly the better game made by a game developer who cares about the product they make.			"

								EDIT 2: I mean, I don't know what more to add. I'd qualify with ""it's not dead"" but I never thought it was truly dead, it was just taking it's sweet time and it would end up being nothing like promised.This remains true. Updates were a long time coming and have all but removed the USP for most people - the ability to explore. Sure you can run around a few planets and dig but it gives me nothing that other games don't, and they do it better. Sure there's quests but these come in 2 forms - the mandatory questline you have to follow to progress. This is long, monotonous and spoon fed whilst offering no challenge and the only reward is the game becomes playable. There's also procedurally generated quests but as expected it's ""Go x-planet, dig dirt, return"" ""Fetch x item"" ""Kill x Miniboss"".Can you mod this into decent game? Maybe. Probably. Solid 6/10 is acheivable with mods. For me that's not enough, I don't want to *have* to mod games for them to be enjoyable.Sure I'm bitter because I wasn't given what was sold to me, luckily new customers can't be. If, when all is said and done, you still want to buy this game then you should. Go for it, you will probably get your money's worth, but at the same time I wouldn't ""recommend"" it by a long shot.-EDIT: 4 months later, my review is still entirely accurate. For a game in development that should tell you all you need to know about the pace it's being ""developed"". No changes at all.-A very pretty game with a nice soundtrack and a lot of potential.Very little community interaction from anyone aside from the Community Manager who makes poor attempts to ""troll"" customers and is forever playing the ""victim card"".Development updates come in thick and fast, but entirely in the form of promises and gifs as opposed to any actual update to the game. There was a 5 month break in production, 1 month was a company vacation and 4 months was due to moving a few artists and the Community Manager to London. They also adopted a puppy and have used the backers money not to fund Starbound, but each take up work on individual projects and then publishing other's games.Should be good if/when it's finished. Slated for release in 2013 - that's officially moved to 2015 and will probably be moved again. If you like repetitive grinding you should buy this game, but do not buy it to support or follow development. Chucklefish has already made over $15 million from Starbound and owning the game doesn't give you any extra idea of how development is going.If you want to support this game not buying it is the better option - falling sales is the only thing that may get Chucklefish to buckle down.

Early Access Review
								I loved Starbound. Played for hours and hours. Then. Then game changed. There used to be beta, gamma and delta sector. The planets were fun to mine down into. There were outfits to find bird people to kill, apes to kill. Now...I like the missions they give a little bit of fun. I really don't like that the pickaxe is now so darned breakable. I don't like the way the biomes and different segments of the planets are set up. It isn't nearly as fun to mine the planets. I miss my planet that I was making into a really cool house and having rainbow, crystal, mushroom, flesh, etc rooms with all the blueprints and such that I was finding. I had planted the whole surface in different trees that I had collected. It was awesome. I didn't mind the losing it when the update happened, I would have loved making it again. But now there are no sectors, I really miss that. There are crystals in the bottom of the planet that you have to get 20 of, and then never need for anything ever again. but they are at the bottom of every planet. Mining isn't nearly as fun. digging to the core of the planet you don't discover a bunch of neat biomes. I keep trying to play the new starbound. I'll give it a Friday night every now and then, but I always end up sad, missing how it used to be. I find it to be boring now. It's no fun to go to a planet that is already lifeless to begin making a home. takes the fun out of taming my own planet. I miss the way the dungeons used to be, where you could accidentally come up on them while digging. I will probably keep trying, but please bring back the different sectors, and get rid of the stupid crystals at the bottom of the planets. make it more fun to find things. And back to repairable pickaxes. Right now I don't recommend this game. when people ask Terraria or Starbound I am forced to say Terraria.			"

Early Access Review
								The biggest dissapointment in 2013. I was so hyped for this game due my love for terraria but as i played it it turned out to be a bubble, looks really nice but is filled with air.I have never had a game where opening chests (those wooden things that usually contain awesomeness) is such a dissapointment to a point where i despised finding chests becaus i knew that it would just contain another bunch of useless crap.It looks really nice as said but if you dig in a planet you just find nothing its always the same crap its gets more dangerous to the core but you dont really have any reward of going deep (yay better ore for a forced armor tier system).You only have one active abilty slot so where in terraria you could triple jump, higher and even fly and sprint all at the same time, here you have decide wich one of them fits you and go with it. If you want another thing go in the menu and switch it out.The weapon system is rather boring and the random enemy generation is unneccessary.Also no contentupdates whatsoever. Terraria, the game that was said to have no updates anymore by the time this was ""released"" had since more updates than this.I know i compared it to terraria a lot but honestly this games has the same target audience and terraria does EVEYRTHING A LOT better.TLDR.: Dont get this overhyped piece of nothing and stick with terraria.EDIT: Played the recent version in coop: much better but always depends on your coop partner. As 2+ player game might worth the consideration but still cant think of playing it solo.EDIT2: Finished the game coop in 16 hours (means we got ourself the best armor in the game) nearly all bosses can be exploited thus no real challenge. after ~10 hours it was just a grinding for ore still wouldnt recommend overall under any circumstance.... honestly i cant understand how anyone can enjoy this over playing something else :/			"

								This was a great survival and exploration game. It had monsters that came out at night, weather that made you cold, and you needed to eat or you would starve. There were old ruins with traps that you could either deftly avoid with jumps or build bridges across or even dig around.Now dungeons are sectioned off and can't be tampered with so only the jumping option exists, all npc villages follow the same rule, you no longer need to eat, weather no longer affects you, and the monsters are almost nowhere to be found. So if it's not a survival game and it's not an exploration game, then what the hell is it?As my friend put it:It's a base building game where I have no need for a base. It's a survival game where the universe isn't trying to kill me. It's an exploration game where I can't swindle the natives blind. It's a problemsolving game where I can't use lava to smash my way through a dungeon. It's such a MESS now. And everyone is praising it for having so much more ""content"" now because they added one-line-of-dialogue NPCs and fetch quests.			"

								As a devoted player of terraria, I say this one is not there yet. If you haven't bought terraria, buy it. If you have,  don't buy this until v1.0.Comparing to terraria, starbound has more detailed graphics, but no soul. - Randomly generated monsters means no difference between monsters. A few different parts meshed together, they behave more or less the same. Loots are nothing to expect too.- Randomly generated worlds and dungens? It's fun to have a few of them, but when you've traveled a few planets in alpha sector you know there's nothing to surprise you anymore. The materials you dig up from different bioms can't be used for anything special either. - Dungens are boring. Guards either charges towards you or shoot at you, pretty much the same everywhere. There're no challenges, from the beginning to the end the dungen is the same. What's more, there's no loot in dungens.- Digging, digging, digging, and all you dig up is ore. Nothing surprise under the earth. There're a few micro bioms, but they offer nothing special.- There's NO story what so ever. Basically, you combine random things into bosses, and beat them one by one. That's all. The villages do nothing other than looking pretty and sell you something you barely need. So basically there's no ""meaning"" in anything you do, the entire world is terribly unified in every aspect. Unless the developers reshape half of it and put loads of content, it's nothing comparing to Terraria.			"

												I'll be honest here, if you've never heard of starbound before, and you like the idea of a sci-fi sandbox survival-ish game, then you'll probably enjoy starbound. I however am giving this a thumbs down, for reasons I shall go into.Long ago, in the early access days of starbound, players glimpsed what was a relatively complete game that was clearly a framework for something greater. Something complex. Hidden behind it's grid-based construction/mining engine was a surprisingly complex universe, complete with six unique races all of which had their own history, adversities, asthetic style and personality. For once it seemed like the character's species was actually going to matter, with even the descriptions of food items hinting that different species would have to eat different food, which is a very cool idea in a survival game. This type of complexity was, for me, what set starbound apart from other games in the genre, it wasn't just a sandbox, it was it's own world with conflicting cultures and people.The earliest sign was that racial bonuses (abilities unique to what species your character was) was planned to be in the next update. These bonuses were later changed to be tied to the race's armoursets, where wearing the full set (head, torso, leggings) of a race's armour would confer it's bonus. This was apparently done for the sake of balance, and keeping each of the races equal. Sure, I thought, but to this day racial bonuses are still not part of the game.Starbound's development has been slow. Very, very slow. I was ok with this, as it was the developer's first game, and after dabbling in game dev myself I am aware that it can be a very difficult thing to do. Things were fine at first, a slow creep of new assets and features, adding more content to the world's random-gen system, etc. Everything you'd expect from an early access title.However, somewhere during development, something changed.Everyone was hype for the next big update (as updates were incredibly rare) and it'd hit, sure there was all this cool new stuff they'd shown off in screenshots, but they would always come with a number of game-breaking bugs that would severely impact gameplay, and would sometimes take months to be fixed. But the most bizarre part to me was that CF would often just cut assets entirely from the game. Items, furniture, gone. no explanation given. Just gone, and for a game about exploration, collection and building, this seemed like a very odd move.The last few updates leading up to 1.0 were the worst offenders at this. The previous diversity and characterisation of the game's six races were severely stripped away, racial weapons, and ship AI were removed for seemingly no reason, which is very strange considering the racial AI often featured in the game's devblog. This, along with the removal/altercation of several other features (the game's UI being one of them) pushed things over the line for me. I had hope, I had patience, but I look upon the finished product that is the 1.0 build currently on sale here and can't help but feel utterly disappointed.In summary, what first appeared to be a surprisingly complex twist on the survival sandbox genre was dumbed down to rush it for release. Also, the game costs $5 less now. It's nice I paid extra to experience this disappointment.There are actually a number of other issues I could go into as to why I'm giving this a thumbs down, from reckless spending to the developer's reaction to criticism, but this review is already long enough.=================================================================EDIT: Since everyone seems to comment on this. Yes, I have 1600+ hours played. This is because the early access builds had a launcher that was very easy to leave open for long periods of time, also I did actually enjoy playing the game, however, now that 1.0 has been released, many of the things I enjoyed about it have been removed, and I am doubtful they will ever be restored, hence my negative review.

												Which one is better, Terraria or Starbound..? It's hard to say as both play out very different from one another. Where Terraria's main focus is on combat, Starbound is mostly about exploring and building. So just because you liked the former, doesn't mean you like the latter and vice versa. In the end it comes down to your personal preference and what you expect from them.So what sets Starbound aside and makes it unique.. For starters it offers a huge galaxy with thousands of planets. Each one with its own different themes and the possibility of a wide variety of cities and dungeons. This can be everything from underwater metropolises to small farming villages, ruins of forgotten civilizations, creepy dungeons and hightec research labs. Even beneth a planets surface there's strange settlements and secrets to uncover as well.These places will be populated with different races and animals. There are seven playable main races who all got their own lore and backstories. This is mostly presented in the form of different codices you can gather and read (some of which are pretty hilarious). Besides that there are numerous sub-races and factions running their own agenda. Some peaceful, others not so much. It's even possible to have some of them move in and offer unique supplies or serve as guards. This combined with some beautifully hand crafted metroidvania like missions where you undertake puzzles, dodge traps and fight bosses helps make Starbound a really interesting world to explore. All in all its a very colourful and diverse univers.Starbound also allows for very different playstyles and almost everything is optional in order to progress. You can build villages or huge farms for profit, explore for resources or mine them, become self sufficient or survive by trade, do quests and gather a crew or roll as a lone wolf.. All valid options in order to survive. This also means your expected to find your own path and as such, there's very limited handholding. Which might throw some people off as there won't be a clear indicator on what to do next besides the overall objective. It's sorta like a ""create your own adventure"" story wherein the missions only serve as stretch goals.Now combat ain't as streamlined as in most games of this genre. It's more a part of a whole, rather than the main focus. Building, farming crops, questing and exploring is as much a part of Starbound as combat is. So if your looking for a hack'n'slash combat focused experience, then you'll be disappointed and proberly find the game lacking as it can seem a little simplistic.Don't get me wrong, combat in Starbound ain't bad. It's just different. For example there's no ammunition to speak of, instead every weapon draws from a commen energy pool. Also most weapons come with a special attack and the ability to dual wield them in almost any way you see fit. There's a wide variety of awesome and crazy weapons to help make it interesting like swords, spears, hammers, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, 'nade launches, flamethrowes, rocket launchers etc etc..Starbound is a game suited for people that like to build, explore and create their own little adventures. If you take the time to enjoy its univers and all the different concepts it has to offer, then you'll get a plesant and enjoyable experience.Closing argument and metaphor..If Terraria is like a lego technic set, where you have to follow a specific schematic in order to achieve your goal. Then Starbound is a huge box of lego blocks that requires your imagination to reach it instead. It really only comes down to what you prefer.			"

								What can I say about starbound? It was meant to be the spiritual successor to Terraria, but I fear that at the time of writing this review it seems very much the other way around. The content is cool, but after you get past the slightly differentiated looks to a lot of it, it really is all the same. That's the issue with procedural generation; it's all new, but it's all pretty much just feature x paired with appearance y. Cool game, but I'd wait to see if it develops more. Anything else you want to know about can probably be found in the reviews below this one.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the worst scams I've gotten myself into. This is an early access review, so I might change this review in the future.I used to play a lot of Terraria back in the day, and when Starbound was announced, I was pretty much hyped already. Not only it promised more of everything that Terraria already had, but also better quality. When it went into the pre-order stage (have in mind that it was a pre-order for a beta access... which is hilarious in itself) I got convinced by a friend to get it. So I did.Once I started the game, everything looked much better than in Terraria, but really, once I got to the first enemy, I felt really put off. The starting gear you get deals almost no damage, so you spend minutes trying to slay an enemy IF the enemy is hostile. And that you never know, because all animals react differently. So you basically gamble.Getting your first gear is nice after some scavenging, but really not at all rewarding. You get some basic stuff, dying multiple times on the way because of the tedious and horrible combat, just to die some more with the new gear. Get used to the respawn animation, because you are going to see it a lot.I was also promised exploration. I hoped for more digging, well-built cave systems, like in Terraria. But I think they meant running across surfaces of various planets, because that's what you are going to be doing 90% of the time. Exploring caves? No point. You'll find better generated loot in abandoned laboratories, but it will also save you time grinding resources. This game offers you so many things, but without a Wikipedia open in another window you should forget about doing anything meaningful. It just looks like a flawed mod for Terraria, that keeps promising more of loot, better gameplay and expanding, generated universe, but lacks the polish and finish.Not to mention that the multiplayer requires 3rd party software like Hamachi or Tunngle to connect with friends, because a few months ago when I tried, I couldn't connect to any public server.The games is being continuously developed, yet I see few changes to the actual gameplay.Wish I could get my time back, if not the money, because it isn't likely that I'll go back to this game. It's plain boring, so unless you like long♥♥♥♥♥Minecraft-esque grinding, don't bother. Combat is tedious, exploration unrewarding. If anything, the artstyle helps this game, but if I want to look at nice things, I can just watch a good movie.			"

Early Access Review
								Remember the rather boring early-game grind of Terraria? Collecting ores for armor, getting boss items, and dying every so often got a bit stale before you finally unlocked the awesomeness that is hardmode, full of amazing enemies and items. Starbound is like the early game grind of Terraria the entire time, with nothing cool to look forward to. Tiered armor is boring- each set is incrementally better than the last, and that's it. Randomized weapons ensure that only a very small amount of them will be interesting- however, none of those randomly-generated weapons will be as interesting as weapons like the Golem's Fist in Terraria. The devs said they had a great story in the works, one for each faction, but that hasn't come through at all. Even the opening cutscenes for the races still aren't finished almost two years after release. I desperately wanted to enjoy this game, but it looks like I'll have to wait for Terraria Otherworld to satisfy my fighting/storying/building game itch.Edit: I wrote some stuff in response to comments on my review, so I'll add them here.First of all the game is not at all in an early stage of development. It's been a year and a half since the beta began, and the developers were aiming to release 1.0 last year: ""We’re going to be releasing a stable update once the tech tree can be progressed through from start to finish, after that we’re going to be focusing on finishing up this todo list for 1.0. Which we are aiming for this year, but could go into next."" from Tiyuri on September 19th. With that said, the game ""should"" be pretty close to done by now. We've had previews of the cutscenes from before the beta even came out. But whatever, story doesn't matter I guess.The gameplay is just bad in almost every way. Weapons are bad. In Terraria, every non-tiered weapon is made to be fun, so they're fun! In Starbound, they're created from an array of random parts. As far as I know, melee weapons have NOTHING to make them interesting- the only thing that matters about them is attack animation and DPS.Armor is bad. Each tier is better than the last, but only from a numbers standpoint. In Terraria, the armor's set effects make it more of a personal preference- you actually have a choice between which armor you want, because they're actually different! What a novel idea. For example, on one run through I used meteorite armor for a good while into hard mode as a challenge, almost exclusively using my space gun, and it was damn fun. If you use a different armor in Starbound, you'll just die faster. Also the racial armor bonuses are pretty dull.Building is bad. There's no real point to building anything other than decorating your ship since you need to hop planets pretty frequently. In Terraria, you have a reason to build houses (NPCs) and you even have more of a reason to decorate and care about your world because, well, it's the only world you have! Maybe colonization will help this a bit, but somehow I doubt it.Mining is bad. There isn't anything cool or dangerous about it. There's stuff underground, sure, but the novelty of poop monsters, useless frog merchants, and ruins with no story behind them wears off pretty quickly. In Terraria, there are whopping great enchanted swords and pig monsters coming through walls trying to kill you, and treasure rooms, underground mini biomes with unique enemies and drops- it's quite a bit into hardmode that mining becomes farm-status without much to worry about. Even then, because you can actually make interesting items with the stuff you mine, Terraria still wins out.Combat is bad. It's just really bad. Enemies have poor AI, are generally samey and boring (thanks again random generation!) and are weirdly balanced to either kill you in one or two hits or never even damage you even on the same world. There aren't any interesting drops either- meat, pixels, maybe a weapon, but that's it. Movement in combat is pretty boring, especially with the slow backwalking. The techs barely help in this respect because they're pretty clunky to use in combat.Exploring is bad. Once you've seen one of something, you've seen all of them. There's not enough variety for a game which has exploration as one of its main selling points. I can think of maybe 12 types of big explorey things (avian temple, apex obstacle course, human prison colony, etc.) off the top of my head, and you'll probably find all of them within the first 10 or so hours of play.Tech is the only interesting thing about the game, and even then it's because of their unrealized potential (which will probably remain unrealized in the future.) Accessories in Terraria have much cooler effects anyway.So tell me, why would I recommend this game when Terraria does everything better?			"

Early Access Review
								First a short clarification, this review is aimed upon the last stable version (Enraged Koala (Update 8)) released on 26.04.2014 and the current development. So don't expect this review to take a look at nightly builds or anything released after today ( 08.08.2014).In it's core concept Starbound is game aiming to combine the element of Metroivanias and resource gathering + building games like Minecraft. Because of an indie developer, the size of the team and naturally wanting to be a sides-scroller the game was developed as an pixel-art game. In these respects it's quite similar to Terraria, which isn't that suprising as the lead developer (Tiy) was an artist in the team behind Terraria.The premise of the game was to be that your character (which would be customizable and choosen out of 6 +1 races) would own a spaceship with which he'd be able to explore nearly infinite amounts of planets, which would be precedually generated and experience some sort of story. In this adventure you'd be able to expand your ship, gather a crew, get quests and generally  use things you found during exploring to tech-up.This premise would naturally allow quite a bit of freedom, making it somewhat of a sandbox style game, whereas builders could concentrate on building stuff, while adventurers could fight monsters...So if you dislike the premise, go and ignore Starbound.If you like this premise, keep on reading as i saddly can't advice to buy this game.Metroivainins life through well designed dungeons and interesting enemies, something Starbound isn't currently offering. The few dungeons in game look nice so far, but there are only a handful of them and they're not offering anything really valuabe, so there's no real reason to visit them.Also Metrovanias live from the fact that your character gains new abilities. And while there are few abilities to gain, they feel pretty weak, unbalanced yet and quite often very similar. Giving the player the ability to fly for a few seconds doesn't is the same, no matter if it's represented by leaving a trail of bubbles or butterflys behind.Overall the combat doesn't feel balanced at the moment. There are, for example, a few end bosses. But the best tactic against them is simply building a small shelter out of some hard material for oneself poking a hole in said shelter and than shooting upwards, till the boss is dead. You can gather resources and build stuff to get some progress. The problem with that progress is that it feels like a grindfest, so to build a better armor you not only have to mine some coloured ore (10 progression levels equal 10 or so differently coloured ores), but you've to gather pixels (which is some form of currency) which is mostly dropped by monsters, and only in small quantities.There are really a lot of nicely done items one can place in the backdrop if you want to build your own outpost and there are really lot of different of materials to build a house out of. But for builders the game suffers from to many monster spawns to get said materials in bigger quantities and the pixel costs for crafting some of these items. Also Chucklefish saddly added the possibility for a meteor shower, which bears down to one big meteor hitting your base and destroying large parts of it, while not adding any way to defend against that.I personally hoped, from the preset of vast procedually generated planets and media pictures shown from Chucklefish, that exploration was going to be really interesting. They implied that different planets have different weather. Some are warmer, some are colder, some have oxygen, other lack in it. There would be cities and dungeons scattered around in the universe. And while there are some bare bones of that, the planets really don't feel that different and exploration isn't really that rewarding. Instead of spending time to find a Apex laboratory (the laboratory of some planet of the ape like ape race), one can actually better use the time mindlessly mining for some ore or hitting some monster over the head with a stick.You can find techs (read special abilities) and some minor loot in some chests, but it's not really worth the whole thing. It only really is worth searching for such things, if you want to build a home out of that materials. Which again becomes a bit of a grindfest.Now as one can clearly read on the shop site, Starbound is an early access game.This means that a lot of my assessments might fall short in the future, as the game gets finished more and more. But that's just one possibility. And therefore it's important to take a look at the developers themselves.When i first read about Starbound in 2012 i got the feeling that behind Starbound where highly idealistic developers with just a few minor games under their belt. It was one of those typical indie-dev teams which a great vision. That Tiy himself worked on Terraria, which was allready a good game back then, lead me to believe that the team was knowing what it was doing with a 2d sidescroller with a pixel look. So the goals seemed achievable.Back than it was implied that Starbound might be released in 2012, which as you can see, it wasn't.The team developed a lot of precedual aspects of the game, saying by that it would become bigger than Terraria. Procedual weapons, planets, universe, monsters...Also it was often mentioned how the player could terrarform planets, use his ships to interact with the world, meet and even gather a diverse crew and live through something fascinating. They showed mock-ups (not really labled as such back than) showing huge ships, small drop-ships, sea planets, crews and whatnot.Then 2013 came and Chucklefish started taking money to speed-up development for the planned 2013 release. They gave some stretch goals, which got achieved within only a few days and kept on openly thinking about how one could be able to use mechs and other vehicles. Or how the player would influence the universe with his quests. In 2013, quite early as far as i remember, they added a roadmap to their homepage - which is still there. This roadmap, as far as i remember, wasn't labelled specifically as a beta road map and soon got filled to 50% finished in most of the areas. When Starbound still hadn't a real release date in summer of 2013 Chucklefish began hinting at a beta release in three phases before a full release - you can find the plans and phases for the beta on the starbound homepage - http://playstarbound.com/how-the-beta-is-going-to-work/ .In autumn they then opened up pre-ordering the game again, with the promise of an early beta access to the game, while still implying a 2013 release. While time went on the bars in the road map good filled and filled more but there was still no release date. Then in fall 2013 (only a few days before new years eve) chucklefish released the beta.I played this beta a few minutes and it felt like a somewhat solid base, which hopefully got expanded on soon. It had no quest, no terraforming, no real vehicles, no recruitable NPCs and no real balance.And it pretty much stayed that way until now. CF more or less announced the game as advertised wouldn't get released this year, but then their lead developer started to question what a 1.0 version really meant and how he was the one to decide what that means. And how people misread a lof of things as promised features, while it was only them thinking aloud.They're releasing (highly bugged) nightly builds and blog posts, but a lot of that isn't nearly reaching the advertised features. And given the leads questioning one has to wonder if they're still planning on adding such. Overall Starbound as concept might even suffer from the procedual monsters and such. Because it make the game feel stretched.So overall i'd say don't buy it, at least not yet. And really be critical of CF as they suffer from the same illness as Peter Molyneux does, overpromising and under-delivering(yet).			"

												It is a very sad day indeed when the people that play a game know more about what makes it fun than the people that made it.  I have played Starbound from the very beginning, before it was an early access game on Steam.  It was awesome!  The things they had planned for this game, the things they had already available for this game was very exiting indeed.  Every time you went to a planet, you got a different palette of trees, rocks, soil, water, monsters and food!  They had the promise of different abilities for each race.  At the very beginning they had a system where you had to build a fire to keep warm until you could muster enough resources to make yourself warm clothes!!!  Then the combat update came! The game they where designing then was very promising indeed.Sadly most of this stuff has been taken out.  Along the way they lost the vision of the game they had and 1.0 is what we got.  A very boring and empty game.  What the devs fail to understand is that the community was playing the last stable update, and loving it, look at the ratings!  All I wanted was a sort of story and lore to be created for the universe I was playing in and that would of been awesome!  But instead I got 1.0, a shallow, stripped down version of a game that I was promised.  To top it off, it’s full of awful bugs and optimization problems!  It’s funny when you think about it, the beta was more stable and more optimized.  I wish I could uninstall 1.0 and go back to the last stable version, I had more toys to play with in that version.  My sensei once told me that to be successful you need a posture in life.  When you do something, you have to believe in what your doing and stand by it, even when the waters come rushing against it and try to bring it down.  They should of kept their initial vision, the game would have been a lot better.  I can’t recommend this title in it’s current state.  I’m happy that you sold over 60 000 copies since 1.0’s release guys, but once the community has a taste of what they bought, I don’t think your gonna sell much more, just look at the new reviews coming in.

Early Access Review
								The game has progressed but not much. They've changed some systems around and added quests, but a lot of the game's core issues have not been addressed. I think the game is better but because they keep ignoring the glaring problems the game has, my opinion that people should wait if they've not bought it has not changed in any way. They've spent a very long time promising change and the amount of the game that has been fixed or updated is not substantial considering the time they've taken to get Upbeat Giraffe out to the public and into stable. In a year, one would expect most of the game to be done after having been released to the public for beta. Call it alpha all you want, it was a beta.-Before I get to my points, something needs to be said here. There are accusations going around Steam (because the people here refused to go to the official forums and learn anything and then just repeat what they read here in review comments) that Chucklefish has scammed and lied. Not once has this ever happened. They are a small indie company, they're not EA. They can't just puke out a game with 50-200 people working on it. The unstable updates were consistent. If you were not aware of that and that was why you thought no progress on the game could be found, then your ignorance is to blame for your opinion. Go to the official forums, educate yourself.-Here we go:Rain comes through off screen blocks and causes indoor flooding. Large quantities of water do not persist as it randomly drains both  off screen and on. These bugs have been around for a year and it is shameful that they're still there. I created a decent sized tub of water and the surface continued to drain over the course of 10 minutes despite my thorough placement of backdrop and border blocks.Game still suffers from crippling framerate problems. The more blocks and decorative entities in an area, the worse the framerate drops. It gets more severe over time until it is unplayable. Using the 64 bit experimental launcher helps but not entirely. They've stated that they're going to optimize the engine when they're done adding new systems but, with their reputation, I would not hold my breath. It's definitely better across the board (especially server side) but it still gets bad. Server latency issues from CPU and memory not releasing properly still exist. Fresh reboot -> Guy logs in right after that and moves sand or water -> 2,000 ms latency on high grade server hardware with fios connection.Mob spawning is extremely annoying. They spawn over and over even in areas where you've built lights and man-made materials. So, in towns you make, monsters spawn everywhere. I've not seen them spawn indoors but for them to spawn in such vast numbers right outside the door is unnecessary and irritating. Their behaviors were tweaked so fighting them is less annoying but that turns out to be a wash when they made up for that by increasing their spawn rate. Their behaviors are less annoying but they spawn way more frequently... no advancement made.Building is still useless. There is no reason beyond aesthetic and creative reasons to ever build anything or revisit planets. The only form of protection we have is /settileprotection which utilizes 2 different area IDs I've seen. The IDs are 65535 and 65532. One stops damage to naturally generated objects and the other stops damage to player-placed objects. It affects the entire planet you're on when you use it and can be sort of useful... but randomly feeds back a 'Failure' error in the chat log when used. The error stops after a reboot but randomly comes back. So, if you're staff on a server and you're not the host, you may not be able to issue a restart since there is no method for remotely doing that. Meaning, if you toggle the protection one way and you need it the other way, you might get it stuck that way til you can contact your host for a reboot. Which also means if you turn protection off for editing purposes, can't get it back on and can't get in touch with the host, your server could get attacked by griefers and you'll end up screwed. There is currently a massive outcry on the official forums for more attention to be shown to server-side systems. Hopefully more than Linux will see attention.We have to rely on thirdparty wrapper software made by fans like you and me in order to properly administrate servers. These wrappers often cause more problems than they solve. For example, StarryPy crashes users if they look inside of chests or other container objects on a planet that has protection enabled provided they are not on the planet protection list. These wrappers also cause latency issues because they use up more memory than the default server software. Having to rely on thirdparty software to fix problems that exist in the basic game is a problem gamers have had to deal with for decades. It, to me, is unacceptable for game developers to shoehorn in a multiplayer component to a game and then leave it up to shoddy thirdparty software to fix the problem. It never does fix those problems and, most of the time, the creators of the thirdparty software (Starrypy, Starrybound) end up abandoning the projects or not being able to keep up with demand for one reason or another; usually their personal lives prevent them from being able to find the time or motivation to work on the projects. The programs end up outdated and useless. If the developers themselves would just fix the server-side components to their games, we could avoid that problem ENTIRELY and a lot of frustration would evaporate. Anyone remember Tshock for Terraria? Getting support for that game meant dealing with extremely hostile community leaders and developers who literally said they'd be nicer to people if someone paid them more. Don't even get me started on Minecraft's Bukkit. Developers create the online component then forget it exists.Developers: fix your own damn games!NPC guards have this behavior where they will follow you and assist you which you can toggle with the interact key. But, this variable does not persist off-screen. They will say they'll follow you automatically (annoying) then when you tell them to stay, walk away and come back even a couple minutes later, they've forgotten you told them to stay and they follow you again.Novakids are very creative and the theme is interesting. Melding cowboy aesthetic into the 'Starpeople' race is pretty clever. Their weapons are revolvers and rifles. There is also a new delete button on the character screen, a welcome addition.The quest system offers a very refreshing take on progression. Now, you talk to your ship AI in a console on your ship and are given quests to complete. These quests help you progress through the game instead of you just digging for ore -> making object -> crafting item to summon boss -> killing boss for drop -> repeat X times as it was in the previous stable update. Quests change this up so it isn't nearly as linear. Though, there is no option to skip the tutorial and once you've done it one time, you'll be sick to death of having to do it on other characters.My previous review saw this game sitting at 5/10 and I suggested people wait it out even though the time it takes Chucklefish to do anything is questionable. The fact they have hired a group to sell Starbound T-shirts when we still have so much in the game that needs fixed shows that they have a problem with priorities. Liquid exists in the game but can't settle if there is too much of it, rain goes through blocks and hackers still make hosting a server a nightmare because files are still clientside... but we get t-shirts and some near useless outpost vendors. Fix the game, stop adding things. Focus your attention on making server hosting feasible without using a whitelist. THEN go add whatever you want to the game.Singleplayer ends.Multiplayer is your replayability. 5/10, no change. Wait it out.			"

												I've clocked 380+ hours in game.  I've played vanilla and modded versions.  I've played through every mission the developers put in the game, and all of the missions from Frackin' Universe.  And yet I keep coming back.  I keep putting time into this.  I have spent hours and hours amassing materials and creating multi-tier gardens with glowing glass walls, so I could plant and harvest day and night.  I've fought cultists and abominations, post-apocalyptic survivalists and primatives, and every other thing inbetween.  I've committed village massacres and protected stoic swamp-dwelling frogmen.  I've sailed seas of acid and alien juice, and drifted to the bottom of oceans of liquid nitrogen.And I'll do it all over again, in 1.0.  Just to see what's new.  And to start my dream of settling planets and creating thriving civilizations on them.  The haunting piano score calls to me.

								I have had this game for about 6 months (Around christmas when I got it), and never seen a difference or any updates for about when I got it, the developers completely lost interest in it, and those who protest against the developers, those people get banned and censored off the website. I'm dissapointed in the developers, it was extremely hyped up and the developers said it would come with many updates, as in being a beta game with a lot of hype for future things to come to make it even better, completely dissapointed. I would not recommend buying this game due to the fact it is unreliable that the developers will ever work on it again. There hasn't even been patches in the past 6 months. Completely the same game. I recommend you read the other negative reviews. Chuckefish would of been a good developer, if they ever showed dedication towards Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								This isn't even Beta. Pre-Alpha is more like it. Everything in this game is a placeholder until the ""real thing"" comes along. Main story quests, progression, exploration, etc. Everything's going to change. Selling items isn't even implemented into the game yet so it's difficult to make money. There are tons of biomes and monsters are randomly generated but they're literally all the same. The only difference is what the background is and what blocks generate. Everything becames stale after a while. We explored a magma planet, tundra planet, desert planet, and jungle planet, and the layout for all of them is basically the same. Nothing memorable. Monsters all have the same AI and therefore, not memorable. You'll fight the same things whether you're in deep caverns filled with magma or on an asteriod field.Developement on this game has slowed to a crawl which sucks because it's not even close to finished. Beta means that the game's mechanics are finished and just needs bug fixing, stat balancing, polishing, etc. This isn't even close. Half the features and mechanics are missing. This version of the game is just a mechanics test; everything else will come later. That's how it feels.EDIT AS OF 1-21-15I reviewed this game back in July '14 (haven't played since May '14). Steam says I played for over 600 hours, this is due to the launcher bug, actual playtime is about 180.Developement team has implemented an ""unstable build"" update system. So great, we get a beta of a beta (a beta that I still believe should be called an alpha). Selling items still not implemented. Still no story or quests beyond the first 4 or so tutorial quests. Races still don't have unique features implemented. Oh but the game has a new text font so there's that.			"

								I highly reccomend this game if you enjoy space travel, exploring, and creating your own story. While incomplete in its current state, the 1.0 update introduces a huge story line which took the devs 40 hours to complete without doing any of the side quests. You can play this game however you want (once the 1.0 update comes out you will have even more freedom) as of right now, you have the ability to explore countless planets and discover a myriad of unseen locations. There are custom monsters in specific biomes and the art is incretible. I started playing the day it came out and i have seen it develop over the years. I have to say that they are going in the right direction. Though i fiind that i am unable to play until the 1.0 update becasue of the features they are addeding (which is a good thing!) i dont want to play the game untill they add the story line, the new biomes, the new farm animals, new gadgets, new mechanics, and so much more. Though that is just my opinion because i have done everything that they game has to offer as of today. If you are looking to buy this game now, i can tell you that you will really enjoy it! This game has had my hyped since 2012 and im still super hyped to play it. i sometimes find that i get lost in the music as im walking through a planet and stop just to listen to it. Nothing comes close to the feelling you experience when you touch down on your first planet. The excitement, the wonder, and the enjoyment. There is nothing like it. This game can be played alone and dont get me wrong it is still a whole lot of fun. But it is way better if you play with a few friends. Ive looked at a number of the negative reviews and i have to say that a lot of their complantes are being addressed in the umpcoming update. Many of the survival aspects are being added back into the game. The 'incompleteness' is always going to be an aspect in a game that isnt finished i dont realy understnad why people get so heated about this. When 1.0 is released, all questions will be answered; all the secrets will be revealed. I am personaly waiting till 1.0 is relased to play again but the game is very playable and very fun in its current state. Hope this was helpful			"

Early Access Review
								Nothing I can say hasn't been said already, but I'll start by saying why Starbound is sorely-♥♥♥♥ing disappointing.In short, Starbound's embarassingly incomplete, and claiming that its Early-Access status is the cause of this is purposeful ignorance. As of the time I write this, Starbound has been available on Steam for over 7 months, and there hasn't been a worthwhile update in at least 3 months. No self-respecting individual, short of the impressively arrogant or willfully blind, would consider this a positive aspect of any game, and I find myself wondering how anyone involved can defend it as anything but a tragedy.Oh, right. But this is a GAME review, and I've only gone so far as to criticize the developers passively. The game itself, it's pretty fun for a while. Get some friends and enjoy the bloated sandbox environment offering 4 whole bosses, a bunch of randomly-generated monsters, and some admittedly fun mods. The development of a player relies entirely on a ""carrot-on-a-stick"" method of baiting that player into making equipment with higher numbers than they had, strictly so that the poor sod can beat enemies who deal bigger damage numbers than those previously encountered. It's like the worlds worst MMO, but with even less lore and far fewer people with whom to play.In short, don't buy this game. Don't consider buying this game. Don't even convince your friend James to buy the game for you. Convince James to buy KFC for two with that money, instead. Then you, too, can experience the crippling gut pain associated with paying for Starbound, except you'll be fed for a few hours instead of disappointed for a figurative eternity.			"

								If I was asked 4 months ago whether or not I would recommend this game,  I would tell you to buy it now if you enjoy games like Terraria. But now, I can't. The game is nowhere near finished, even after all this time that the developers claimed for daily updates, yadda yadda. Progress has all but halted (in order to facilitate the company coming together in one office to be more ""efficient""). They have forgotten on who's backs they were able to get their company together to begin with. On the backs of people who supported them when they promised a game that will be their labor of love. Now it seems they just got their hype money, and are sitting back enjoying the ride. Well it shows, and thanks to this game, I will never invest in another early access game. It breeds laziness and mediocrity among developers when they can promise whatever they want and not follow through. Maybe in time this game will become something great, but given the progress so far, I highly doubt it. I have gotten my money's worth in enjoyment, but a lot of enjoyment was seeing it grow. I can't in good faith recommend anyone buying this game now in it's current state. It has promise but feels totally dead in the water, and sinking.			"

								Dissapointing. I was hyped for this game for a solid year, and preordered it the second I could. It promised to be an exciting game much like terraria can be, but sen in the distant future, and on new worlds. While the latter is true, the former is not. This game, to put it bluntly, is boring. After I mess around for a few hours, it's just not as fun as a game like Terraria. You explore, walk around, explore some more upgrade your gear, just so you can explore more. But, its not exciting exploration, all you do is walk in one direction for a while untill you find something, then you loot it and move to the next planet. That's it. The balance of the game is horrible as well, things are either ridiculously hard or mind numbingly easy. This game has potential, but in its beta it is a waste of money.			"

												its basically a 2d version of no mans sky with no spaceship piloting, but far deeper gameplay elements thats inspired by terarria and minecraft. if youre not interested in sandbox survival games as such, you can also play the game as a story driven planet exploration game with light platform and rpg elements! i been playing the game since its early beta phase, im glad to see it got out of the beta hell. this is a fantastic game for the $15 price.

Early Access Review
								This is a game that I loved. I loved it. I was enamoured by everything that it promised, and I played and played and played back when it had been recently released into early access. Everything they promised sounded so cool, and everything the game already had was awesome. I played a very early version of it (which was still awesome) and had to deal with a few wipes, and it was reasonable. They were improving it all the time, but a lot of things were still broken, or didnt work. crashes happened, things got deleted, files were lost, but it was perfectly alright. After all, it was an early access game. So I decided, alright, I love this game. So let's wait for it to be released. And I waited... and waited... and waited...Almost three years later, it still hasnt been released. Now I am looking at what is being said of the changes that have been made in the time I have been away, and quite frankly I dont think I even want to bother with it anymore. I stop and wonder if this would have happened this way if this game hadnt been so successful on early access... and honestly I dont think it would have gone down this way. And that is the real problem.Early access allows small developers with good ideas to get the financial backing to complete their awesome and creative projects.orIt allows small developers to earn money, procrastinate, and prolong deadlines until they forget what the hell they were originally paid for.This was a ripoff. They sold me the promise of a game, and four years later it still hasnt been delivered. In fact the product that is now being offered is quite different to the original game that was sold to me. So, really, do yourself a favor and stay away from this and any early access game.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought two copies of this game before it even came out. I gave into the hype because I loved terraria so much and I loved space so much. I've learned the hard way to never buy a game that is not out yet. This game has many many small cool aesthetic features. There's already more furniture and different blocks in this game than all of terraria. The torches flicker. There's villages and the npcs talk to each other and say ""I'll get you for killing Billy"" and what not. There are monsters that make fart noises. All in all though, the game is just an amature mess. The real meat of the game is boring and incredibly uninspired and it makes me so sad to say that since I was probably hyped for this game for years. Pixels are the in game currency and pretty much used only for crafting and I do not understand why. Say you want to make iron armor. It takes like 10 iron armor and 500 pixels. Why? Why do you need money. It should be enough that you grinded the materials for it. Ontop of all that, you lose 25 percent of your pixels on death and can't get them back even if you go to where you died. There does not seem to be a sell feature either yet. (game has been out about 6 months now) and there is no way to trade pixels with friends either. The monsters and planets are all randomly generated which sounds like an amazing idea. till you get to a few different planets and realize everything is exactly the same as the other planet. sure the enemies look slightly different but they act almost completely the same. It's much more exciting to find the non-randomized enemies around but they're rare. The music is great and relaxing. That is until you come up upon a level 1 bird and suddenly you are assaulted with this strange epic boss fight music. It's unbelievably jarring and really takes away from the mood. When you actually find a cave and go underground there is just flat out no music at all. I found a nice flesh biome underground but it was made completely dull and uninteresting as there was no music no sounds or anything to make it sound like it was hell. There is also an unbelievable ungodly amount of grinding. I have already mentioned that with pixels before, but it actually does get worse. Even with a diamond pick axe, going down into say the heck/flesh biome? The blocks will take about 5 or 10 seconds to break. Sure in this game you break 9 blocks at a time but it feels so incredibly boring to sit there holding down left mouse button in complete silence while you break some flesh blocks that have copper ore in them. The second boss summon took about a total of 100 steel bars. (thats 200 iron ore and 100 coal ore.) Thats not even counting the thousands of pixels spent or the armor and weapons you absolutely need to progress. The boss itself was bland and took about 3 minutes to kill and had only 2 attacks. on its death, it dropped a key which let me progress to the ""harder"" levels. I went to the third galaxy set and just couldn't take it. Every planet is essentially the same. Gather the resources in complete silence, fight the random monsters that all do the same thing, and then summon a boss and repeat. Ah, I forgot to mention. Building in this game is great. It's well thought out and extremely easy to do. However, there is no reason to. It's incredibly depressing. In Terraria you build houses and homes for yourself and other villagers and you see your home flourish into a village depending on how you build it. In this game? There's no benefit to making a single house. You have a spaceship. You put your crafting materials and chests in it. Whats the point in building a home on a planet when you're just going to leave it and go exploring tons of other planets? You can spawn villagers and guards, but its all aesthetic and does nothing to benefit you besides being cute. It's actually a pain to go back to any home you make on a planet since you have to go to your ship and then use your precious fuel to return back. All for what? A chance to look at a shiny castle you made? A place to find all the different colors of dirt you stored? I just can't reccommend this game right now. I thought 6 months would be enough to make the game at least a little better but i guess its not. Maybe in 2-3 more years this game will be amazing. I really hope it is. But right now it's only good intentions that are not implemented well.  "

								Do not purchase, until the final release, which might be never.Chucklefish has grossed over 21+ million dollars with Starbound, and as a publishing company, they certainly are no longer indie. Their nightly build demonstrated that they have indeed accomplished nothing over the past 3 months.They have been completely disingenuous with their spending and funding of the project. Leaving their failed deadlines aside, all money pledged to the game promised that it would speed up development of the game. In fact, it has actually slowed development down, as one of their 3 coders spent time interviewing candidates for their new ""pirate game.""Instead of taking the time to actually hire the necessary personnel needed to finish their initial project in a timely manner, they instead chose to fund an entirely new game project.They are incredibly shady, as only a week ago, we found out that one of their three coders (Barwe) quit back in April, which is really huge news to keep hidden. (His twitter still said he was an employee, and their home page still lists him as an employee.) Chucklefish only came clean about it when the community really pressed them for answers. It is very likely that they had no intention of every saying anything about it.As a whole, they are very unprofessional. I'll list a short summary to make my point. One of their coders (Omni) went on a banning spree on their forums, reddit and steam page, lashing out on everyone due to ""stress."" He then made an apology post, and banned himself, claiming that he would be removing himself from the public outlet. Not three days later, he unbanned himself from their steam forum to say that a poster there was legitimately mentally handicapped. Then rebanned himself. Then, due to the massive conflict his idiocy stirred up, he unbanned himself to reply yet again, making any credence he could ever have evaporate in the wind like the promises of their unfinished mess.Molly, who is the community manager has almost zero community interaction. Often, we find out important news through Tiy, Omni, or Bart. Molly spends her time using her twitter account as a personal account, promoting ideology. As the coup de grace, their whole ""horse♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; fiasco was recently announced by her to be ""just a joke"" after a large portion of their community was banned just by being outspoken against the idea. (Which according to Molly was the point of the entire ""trolling."")Tiy, the lead developer is a very derogatory and snide individual, who belittles those who ask simple questions regarding the health of the game. Less than two weeks ago, he took to twitter in a self-proclaimed ""drugged"" state, belittling people and berating those who question their competence.All in all, I don't think these are the worst people in the world, but I would definitely say that they are easily the most unprofessional bunch of developers I've ever seen. Honestly, the biggest problem is their inexperience and lack of ability to accept criticism. The amount of cash flow they've seen has caused them to forget their humble origins, and the people who believed enough in them and their vision to part with their money on a promise.I'm sure I've missed some of their chicanery, and if you're interested, here's a bunch of helpful links that will verify all that I've said.http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHyhttps://docs.google.com/docume...http://i.imgur.com/bajxe4L.png***The above information was written by Billy T and not my own words. While I enjoy what the game already offers, I will not recommend another Steam Early Access game which is far behind schedule and may never be finished. Many of these ""indie-devs"" need less money and more accountability.			"

												A lot of people have been saying this game is like Terraria.Now, I'd like to clear up the misunderstanding here.Yes, maybe with some features, gameplay, pixel style and 2-D side scroller, it is like terria. But other than that, it doesn't FEEL like Terraria at all. In fact, it's better.Terarria fails to capture the subtle beauty of Starbound, with it's amazing sounndtract and the wonderlust that we all have for space. It's simplistic at first glance, but dives much deeper than you'd think.It has a story ark for those who like set missions and goals, and a certain path they have to follow. Explorations dominates the game, and the world of Starbound is ridden with lore. Each race is whimsical in nature, from robots being the ones the least technilogically advanced, and flower-people being the most carnivorous and ficious species alive.For those who like to let creativity soar, you can build whatvever your heart desires. From tall futuristic buildings scraping the sky, to a small wooden cavern laying behind a line of trees.And the best of all, if you'd just like to relax, you can always just grab your handy dandy manupilator module and chop some logs, or go mining and listen to the tic-tic-tic of ores ppopping out of foreground and background alike. Chill with some friends around a campfire jamming out to 12 days of christmas on your various instruments, or team up to find legendary (and curiously awesome and even more awesomely named) weopons, and battle tiny penguins who got their flippers on asault rifles and tanks.I don't think Starbound strives to be a spesific game. It doesn't strive to have an ending either. Not being able to call it quite a sandbox, I'll call it an adventure you have to play, and experiance for yourself. I can never tire of this game, and doubt I ever will. Billions of unique planets, creatures, species and collectables hover at your fingertips. All you have to do is try not to think about scary purple ghosts as you get the fuel to power your spaceship, and explores stars across the galaxy ;)Starbound is such an unique game, putting it into words is both a challenge, and an impossible feat I have attempted and failed. Just know that it is worth every penny and far more, and that it is, and always will be, one of my very favourite games.~Toodles, 2D-Bunnie			"

								Pre-ordered the game the first second that I was able to do so. The game looked very very promising. ""Terraria in Space"" is what everyone was saying. Few months later, few character/world wipes happened. I had even been paying for a Starbound server so that my viewers on YouTube and Twitch would be able to play around with. We had one last update in Feb 2014 and then all the updates completely stopped, literally right after the devs spoke of a daily update schedule. The devs decided to move themselves all into an office and that was pretty much the last we had heard from them. By April, I stopped paying for the server. No new content meant nobody wanted to play it, and I'm not paying for an empty server. The game is still in Alpha. It's barebones. There are bosses, there are planets, theres a way to cheaply duplicate thousands of sentry guns. Then there was an article talking about all these planned upcoming changes, like farming progression and an actual story. This game is garbage right now in it's current state. Don't buy into the hype. Don't give the devs another cent until they finish the game. Starbound is just another example of why Early Access games should be avoided at all costs, which is a shame because there are many Early Access games out there that are shining examples of what we want in an early access game, like Broforce and Hack n Slash and Contagion.

								When I originally bought this game, I thought I was buying something that'd improve on what Terraria and others did, that it'd use the ""space"" theme as a blank canvas to have plenty of randomly generated worlds for one character instead of having the two seperate. A good while from then, and as I play the game now it still feels the same. Nothing has changed. There has been plenty of talk and promises, and none of it has come to Fruition, whereas we're supplimented with filler and daily blogs like they were lets players playing their own game. What they're updating us with is nice, but I'd like to see some actual results, if you don't mind. The nighty build wans't the best idea in the world.			"

								Please don't give Chucklefish money.To expand, this studio has proven over time that they have no clear vision or direction in the development of this game. Useful, fun, quality of life improvements have been ignored (or even removed) in place of boring, tedious, repetitive tasks. For instance, the latest update made smelting ore take time instead of being instantaneous. There is absolutely no reason for this beyond a weird attempt at chasing ""immersion"" in the name of monotonous busywork. Many flocked to Starbound (myself included) because of how impressive Terraria was and the seemingly limitless potential of this game. That potential has been squandered with poor decision after poor decision. How many times has combat been reworked? The fact that the game has been in development for so long, and made the amount of money it has, and is in this shoddy and unfinished of a state speaks volumes. I really want this game to be good someday, but I think it will take new blood with a fresh eye coming in to save it.			"

												At this point I'm not really even sure why they give you swords or guns. I have so many shurikins, and javalins, and moltovs that I end up spending more time throwing things than your average Fed-ex employee.It took me a while to figure out why the game just wasn't working for me. I did like it to some extent, but it just didn't end up capturing me the same way something like Terraria did. First off, your base doesn't matter except for farming and building the packs that help you explore other worlds. I never had to craft a single weapon or peice of armor because I could always just buy something about as good off whatever vendor I happened to stumble across.Uprgrading your ship doesn't matter. ""So, you're saying I can spend $80,000 to put a couple more rooms in my ship instead of just spending five minutes building them on a planet somewhere? Sign me up!""The fighting is incredibly stale. And even most of the boss battles can be entirely broken by using the spike ball to stick to part of the wall where the boss can't do so much damage to you until the best opening presents itself.Actually doing the main quests is quite tedious, as it revolves around hitting world after world in hopes that this forest world or that ice world actually has the species your looking for.In the end it just felt repetitive. It felt like I was grinding for something that ultimately wouldn't be that rewarding anyway.			"

Worth the wait? Promised to be released all the way back in 2013, Starbound was a prime example of ""how you DON'T do early access"" for a long time. Did it change with the release? Now, don't get me wrong. It isn't a bad game - would you expect someone to play bad game for >400 hours? But it's... shallow. It doesn't have a decent amount of content that it had, but that was cut just for the sake of cutting. Example: tech system. Bubble field that negates fall damage and lets you bounce off the surfaces; badass rocket boots; on-demand teleportation to another point of the screen; health and energy regenerators; friggin power mech suits! Sounds sweet, right? Well, if you liked this assortment of power-ups then sucks to be you: all of that was in the game, it IS in the game's files even now - but it was cut right before the 1.0. Current available tech system consists of ""lower-your-size"" skill with some variations, ""jump-higher"" skill with some variations, and ""run faster"" skill with some variations. That's all. Before i could fly from the ground all the way to the board of Avian Airship with rocket boots alone, but now? None of these new techs will give you anything similar. That applies not only to techs - there are various codex entries, weapons and entire biomes traces of which still exist in the files, but you'll never find them - unless they're reimplemented with the later update, but then you'll wonder - what's the point of ""1.0 version"" anyway? (By the way, if anyone can confirm that Uzis, Tesla Spears and Lightning Coils still can be found legitimately, i would greatly appreciate that - those were my weapons of choice for the most part of my Starbound playtime) Next point is, they promise you ""7 playable races"", That's a lie. Game has 6 playable races and 1 playable character. If you play as any of the 6 vanilla species, you'll meet a lot of towns, camps and just stray folks of your kind while exploring stars, as well as some written pieces of history. That is not the case if you are to choose Novakid. I just want to point out that saying ""they are nomad race so they don't have any settlements and/or recorded history"" ISN'T the same as making them ""fully integrated into the lore!""[playstarbound.com] and it ISN'T a valid reasoning to the fact that player's character is literally one and only Novakid in the entire universe. And at the same time, developers really don't like to give players a choice in small things. Not always, yes, but when it happens, it is on the edge of stupidity. Community didn't like the hotbar change to less intuitive version? Well, we will implement new one anyway, although it could be easily selectable in settings. People liked need to warm them up through fire and clothes to survive on cold planets? Aw shucks, let's have this ""craft once and forget"" system. Don't like the onboard pet that just sits here, doing absolutely nothing? Too bad, beause you HAVE to hold this useless pile of pixels on your ship instead of acquiring one if you want to. And god forbid you to build a colony without taking into account the fact that NPCs can't close the doors after walking through them - one stray monster, and entire settlement could be wiped out. It could be easily changed with a few adjustments to the script. But it isn't. Why? Beause reasons. Honestly, after looking at main features of release version (storyline, fossils, backers' items) i can't help but think that the main vector of work for 1.0 was ""Finally put in all stretch goals and be done with it already"". I may be wrong, I WANT to be wrong, but simply can't shake the feeling. Also, some of those cut codex entries implied that storyline will be something more than ""find six keys and kill a monster"". This and Novakids' ""implementation"" busts immersion in the game's world for me REALLY hard.But if you have some friends to fool around with, or want to roleplay as your character with complete disregard to intended atmosphere of the game, then grab Starbound. Despite all negative parts, it is still a real deal for its price/content ratio. As to me, i'll wait until there's enough mods to restore and fix what was cut and broken.			"

												I paid for early access as soon as a working demo was released years ago. Over the years, they added and promised a lot of exciting features. I saw a lot of potential in this game, and I still do. This game is very feature and content rich, and the art is great quality. Unfortunately, a lot of the features are pretty disappointing, and a lot of things that were promised were never added or just not executed very well. Some survival features can be completely negated, such as heat, cold, and breathable air, all that's left is the hunger mechanic which is not balanced well in my opinion. Despite all of this, I would still recommend the game, because it's very fun with friends.However, this game is very poorly optomized. I believe it's the pathfinding of enemies and NPCs that cause severe FPS drops in crowded areas of the game. Weather also drops FPS, making me think it's the way ponds appear during rain. Nothing can be done about this. I'm confident that the graphics are not causing the low FPS, a beefy GPU won't help. It requires good CPU, which is not typical for most games. It runs poorly on my desktop with a 4.2MHz processor, and it causes my laptop to overheat and shut down. This makes the game completely unplayable in some cases.			"

The galaxy need saving and you're all we've got. Starbound is a 2D space/extraterrestrial sandbox game from Chucklefish that, after several years in Early Access, has been released as a full game. Earth and an organization made up of seven races, the Protectorate, have been destroyed by an ancient and powerful foe. As the last surviving member of the Protectorate, it is your responsibility to defeat this evil foe! Or you could completely ignore the main quest, go to a far away planet, build some houses and get rich from the rent payments. It's up to you really.  You see, when Chucklefish describe their game as a sandbox, they really mean it. Sure, there are limits to it, but there's a hell of a lot of stuff you can do. Starbound does have a story, and even if you want to focus on other stuff you're probably going through the story quests. The story is a tad bit ridiculous but then so are the Novakids, people made out of neon gas. These quests, the first few of them anyway, are also used to teach the player about core mechanics and they do a fairly good job of explaining the basics. You can focus on the story if you want to or you can do any number of things, perhaps you just want to build a house and a farm on a faraway planet, or maybe you want to create a colony of Avians, hell I've heard there's someone trying to recreate the Death Star so you could even do something crazy like that.  One of the most important parts of the game is your character's ship. You have the ship from the get go but its FTL drive is completely caput, you can travel within your starting system but that's it. Completing a few story quests will get your ship repaired and then the game gets interesting. Once you have your ship you can do whatever you want. Your ship is fueled with a resource called Erchius Crystals which can be found on natural satellites (you'll need special breathing equipment before you can survive on them). When fueled, the ship can be used to jump to different star systems and then can be moved to positions over whatever planet or satellite you wish to visit. The ship is quite small to begin with (still big enough to build all of the crafting stations) but you can increase the size of the ship by hiring new crew members and then using upgrade modules at certain numbers of crew. Your ship ends up being pretty big so if you want to go for the whole space nomad thing it's possible.  When it comes to the planets themselves, there's a reasonable amount of variety. There are quite a few different types of them, ranging from lush forest worlds to worlds so cold you'll freeze to death without the proper equipment. They all have risk factors, the safest worlds are classed as Low Risk but they also have the lowest tiers of ore (Copper, Silver and Gold). You'll be wanting to visit more challenging planets fairly quickly so you can upgrade all your different crafting stations to access new armour, weapons, tools etc.  From what I've seen so far, all planets have some wildlife, most of which will attack you but some animals don't pay much attention to you. Sometimes this is all you'll find on a planet apart from some random chests and the odd travelling vendor. However, some worlds will be home to some pretty cool stuff. Perhaps you'll get lucky on an ocean world and find an underwater Hylotl city or maybe you'll find a Floran settlement in the middle of a jungle (completing quests for NPCs in settlements is how you get new crew members in the vanilla game). Some worlds are home to Penal colonies full of prisoners armed to the teeth, others are home to long abandoned Apex Labs. There's no way to know what a planet will have before you get there (something I find a tad frustrating) so it can be tough to find what you're looking for but when you do find them whatever it is you want, it's very satisfying.  No matter what you decide to do in Starbound, you're going to spend a fair amount of time collecting resources with your Protectorate Matter Manipulator. The MM is basically a combination of the basic tools you usually find in this kind of game, it can be used for mining chopping down trees etc. It can also be upgraded with special upgrade modules that improve its effectiveness. Unfortunately, mining for ore is one of the weakest parts of the game. The mining itself isn't so bad (though the lack of a quick way back to the surface sucks), the problem is that you never find large deposits of ore, I've never seen more than seven or eight bits of ore together. Not a huge issue by itself but when you consider the fact that you've probably gone to that planet specifically to look for ore it can be aggravating to spend half an hour doing it and ending up with 30 or 40 ore, that’s not going to last long.  Another big issue with the game is its performance but it seems to be a case of luck of the draw as to whether or not you'll actually have any problems. Some people have had issues that make the game unplayable, other have had issues with the game simply not performing as well as it should. I've been pretty lucky and the only performance-related issue I've had is some trouble getting fullscreen to work but there's no guarantee that you won't have any performance trouble. The only way to know if you're going to run into trouble is to buy the game and see if it works, not particularly helpful I realize but worst case scenario you can just refund the game and wait for fixes.   A couple more things I'd like to mention. Firstly, Starbound has an awesome modding community. Starbound is definitely enjoyable if you're playing Vanilla but there are some fantastic quality of life mods as well as complete overhauls out there that make it even more fun to play. Secondly, the game's drop-in multiplayer works very well and while singleplayer is a lot of fun I find the game even more enjoyable when playing with a friend.  Verdict  Starbound is far from perfect but that doesn't stop it being a super enjoyable space sandbox game with plenty to do. It's well worth the price of admission.  Lone Ranger Reviews.  El K.			"

								First of all, yes this game looks similar to Teraria, and it has the same concept of 'Mine, survive, craft', but it improves on every single aspect of Terraria. 10 tiers, one boss per tier, extra other bosses scattered everywhere, and the selling point, an infinite number of procedurally generated worlds. With its own random ecosystem of plants, animals, fish and more. And you can travel the universe and also, its MULTIPLAYER! Please get it, even though its in beta, and bugs are bound to appear, it is worth the $15.			"

												Honestly, this is the best game of the 2D genre in my opinion. Are you able to make an orchestra with a huge amount of musical tools in any other game?PROS:1. A ridiculous amount of planets to explore.2. Musical tools. They are absolutely amusing. And there is so much of them!3. The crafting system is amazing, so much different stuff to craft. And as you craft something, you learn new recipes. In addition to a huge crafting system, you can find blueprints in chests and also learn new recipes.4. The planets aren't as big as I would like them to be, but they are still huge. You run around planets and you find buildings, ruins and stuff like that. It is so interesting to explore them!5. There are side quests. You find a village on one of the planets and the NPCs can give you quests, and they reward you with a bag with random stuff! In addition to that, you have a chance to recruit them!6. Different types of items. By that I mean common, uncommon, rare and legendary. Not sure if there is something between rare and legendary, but it makes the game so much fun for grinding.7. Fishing. You have a chance to catch each fish, from common to legendary. You can craft only two fishing poles, and that's a bit lame, but they might add it in the future. You have some upgrades to the fishing poles, but you can't craft them, only catch them from uncommon fish and higher. With a chance of course. Which again, pretty lame, but at least they have a fishing system that looks absolutely sweet!8. Vehicles. There is like, 4 ""cars"" and one boat, that you can purchase with pixels, but they look very cool.And more stuff that I probably forgot to mention.CONS:1. The main quest is the worst. You need to explore planets and scan random stuff to get points, and after like 50 points you complete the quest. You return - get a quest to beat a boss - you beat the boss - you get the same quest but for another race. ???2. Not hardcore. Why do I say ""not hardcore""? Because I've beaten two main story boses, and went grinding for the best equipment (second to best), got some legendary weapons, and then beat all of the following bosses without having a challenge at all. Even the last boss wasn't that hard. I did not die to any boss, except one time that I fell into a trap and died. Basically, what am I trying to say is that the main story bosses got no effect on your gameplay. They're just mobs with more damage and HP, similar to some you find on planets. They do not affect anything at all, except your progression throughout the story, which, in my opinion, could've been done better.Overall, the game is amazing. If you exclude the main quests, and look at the game without it, you can see a game that is better than Terraria by its design. 9/10.			"

								I can only hope, at some point in the distant future, that there will be an update to this game adding half of what we were promised. I purchased on day 1. I regret that immensely. It has been approximately 10 months since the last update to the main game. Just remember that.Edit: I am aware of the ""unstable"" and ""Nightly"" branches. The problem comes when the baseline game, the one people paid fifteen dollars for, is unchanged. They can update the other branches all they want, but until they update Starbound itself, with official, supported content that has been promised since day one, I feel as though I wasted my money.2nd Edit: Yes. I have played 166 hours. I feel like my money was wasted. I feel like this game has so much potential, but Chucklefish is just not a company that can bring out that potential with their current policies.3rd: Still not worth it. Buy 1.5 copies of Terraria instead. It got a full release and is STILL receiving massive updates.			"

												Pros-A huge universe, probably impossible to explore it all in a lifetime. There's a lot to explore. -Nice story. -Steam Workshop support. -Good pixel art style with a nice character creator (Which can be expanded further with mods from Steam Workshop.).-You'll sink hours into the game, not just by advancing the story, but also by upgrading your gear, building stuff etc. (Which can be expanded much further with mods.)Cons-Story progression is too linear and can sometimes be too frustrating. -Not much endgame content. You are just going to build more stuff and then that's it. -I personally don't like the ""Type the IP adress to join the multiplayer server"" thing. Something like a server browser would make the game's multiplayer much more active. Overall score:8/10It's a good game overall and worth buying. "

This game is an utter disgrace. To spend money on it would be an insult to yourself and the entire community. From misleading advertizing to devs censoring any and all criticism they can, this is the perfect example of everything wrong with Early Access.

By all means, if Chucklefish gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, I will remove this review.EDIT 2: http://i.imgur.com/uiFdrY5.jpgIt seems Chucklefish has decided that rather than actually fulfil their promises, they'd just astroturf the Steam reviews, posting literally tens of thousands of fake positive reviews, most 1-3 lines of nonsense and a thumbs up. Starbound went from Mostly Negative to Very Positive in a span of less a month. This results in the game having ""Very Positive"" reviews despite the entire first page and beyond of Most Helpful reviews being negative. I've purchased a few bad games in my time, but Starbound is my biggest buyer's remorse. I will never get my 15$ back. ♥♥♥♥ Tiy, ♥♥♥♥ Chucklefish, and ♥♥♥♥ Starbound. Starbound is a scam, and will likely never have even a quarter of the features that were promised. Maybe if they actually worked on the ♥♥♥♥ing game instead of throwing parties and writing up positive reviews to manipulate the store page they'd actually get♥♥♥♥♥♥done.With how nasty Chucklefish have been towards any and all criticism, I expect to be banned from the forums for this review if I haven't been already.

It's just that bad and the developers do not deserve to be supported for this project and how they have behaved toward their customers, and even on their own forums.I sadly purchased the game awhile ago when the project was still early in development, although you can't really call what they have been doing for the last 5 months development. For me, regardless of the progress they make or how good or bad this game turns out to be they have alienated their customers and deserve no support whatsoever.The only thing that has kept me from putting in a refund request is that I know nobody could have planned from the start to do this bad of a job. I do hope the creators of this game read all the negative comments and realize just how awful of a job they have done and hopefully make good changes in the future because of it. I personally will never buy another Chucklefish game again, at any stage... alpha, early access, beta, completed or otherwise. And not just the publisher, I will most likely avoid any future projects of the development team as well. Progress on this game has been abysmal.Starbound is THE lowest quality project on Steam I have come across. Hands down.			"

Early Access Review
This is a review of the current state of things.I, like everyone else, was super freaking excited for this game. I snagged it up the day early access became available. I was so excited for a game that would be terraria, only with new animations, awesome looking guns, tech, mechs, the whole nine yards! So what happened? I can't be bothered to play it for more than 30 minutes at a time, and even then, I only feel like playing once a month. Everything is there. Crafting, building, mining, fighting, even features that terraria doesn't have, like quests, NPC's that don't live with you, actually being able to aim your melee attack. Yet it still falls short. It lacks something Terraria just, has. The IT factor. Maybe when it's done I'll change my mind, but it just feels impossible at times, and by the time it doesn't feel impossible, it's just boring. I mean, at it's current state, it's gather resources, build beacon, fight boss, build map upgrade, go to new planet, gather resources, build beacon, fight boss- You get the point. It's repetitive, it's slow, and it's just boring. I get excited every single time Terraria gets a new update. I'm not even aware of the current dev state of Starbound anymore. Again, things could change, the promised finish project sounds really great, and if you've got 15 dollars just lying around, sure, pick it up, but I just can't recommend that you buy it unless you meet those parameters. Sorry Starbound, but until you pick up the pace on your updates, and give us something worth being excited over, I think you might be a dud.			"

												100% Recommend this game. You'll see as of the official 1.0 release, the majority of reviews are negative. I respectfully disagree with them. Did the devs make some shortsighted decisions while pushing the official release? They sure did. Are there things that used to be in the game that have been removed? Well yeah, you bet. Are there new mechanics that seem tedious and hold back the player, simple for the sake of holding back the player? Pretty much.But guess what? This game is still. Not. Finished.The 1.0 release isn't ""The End"" of Starbound, these devs have been with us since day one, the game has always been fun and has always been changing. Sometimes things get nerfed into oblivion, sometimes things are game-breakingly strong. It's a delicate task to balance something with so much content! AND THEY AREN'T DONE! I have faith that this game will only continue to improve, at WORST this is a rough patch and in no way do the devs deserve the amount of flak they have received these past few days. If you're a little worried about purchasing this game right now, then hold off until it's on sale or until the majority of recent reviews are positive - it's your call. But don't let all the nay-sayers scare you away, this game is phenomenal and provides many MANY hours of fun. I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this review but this is just the way I see it. I love Starbound through thick and thin, and I am deeply saddened that so many people turn their backs on it after being loyal for so long. The devs work hard and deserve praise, everyone makes mistakes. Now let's be positive and provide feedback, and see some changes for the better!Thank you for your time.			"

								When this game was in Early Access, i was single.When this game was in Early Access, i was unemployed.When this game was in Early Access, my garden was arid.When this game was in Early Access, my best friend had no plans to become father.When this game was in Early Access, noone could even presume how Pluto surface could look like.I have been promoted 2 times on my stable job.My girlfriend is lovely and i wonder how she still loves me after all this time together.My lemon trees are strong now, and their fruits are juicy!Sometimes i go visiting my best friend, and i find extermely funny to play with his 2 daugthers.Today i stared in awe looking at the incredibly 3,500 meter tall mountains of ice on the surface of Pluto, puzzling myself about the complete lack of planetary collision with meteors of any kind. And this game is still Early Access.			"

								The game is really not worth it in its current state. Yeah sure, its fun for a few hours or days but then you realise that theres not much to do. The devs havent updated the game in almost 4 months, the planet hopping gets moretedious and boring once you realize that the only major differences are that the planets  come in 4 presets and sizes, the dirt changes and the enemies change, not much else really. Games been out  for like almost 2 years now and they have barely got anywhere. This game is a perfect example as how Early Acess can go wrong, people pour thousands of dollars into a game they think will be the best only to receive scraps or nothing at all. At the rate the games going they wont even be out of beta in the next year. Hold your money on this one, it has potential but the devs dont seem to have an plans for the game, just adding random things. Like i said before the game isnt worth it in its current form.			"

												I just finished the game, must say the disappointment still sinking in pretty heavily.They went in so many directions during the development process and a lot of them had so much personality an flair, sad to see that in the end chucklefish ended up pretty much handpicking the most bland uninteresting pieces they had over all the years of development and called it the final product.I've played the very first version of starbound and came back to check on how it was doing from time to time. Ironically enough, the finished product looks like almost a full rollback to their very first early access version.Ultimately this is just a shadow of an absolutely amazing game that could have been.

								As many other players who pre-ordered Starbound, I was quite hyped and happy. ""Finally a Terraria in a sci-fi setting - just up my alley"" - I thought.The game itself has potential in many aspects (sandbox creation, roleplaying immersion etc). You get to create your own character with some basic customization - then you start on a broken spaceship and have to descend onto the planet below to gather resources to be able to continue on into the galaxy and other planets. A lot of exploration follows, but most planets are very generic and alike.Rince and repeat.Currently the gameplay and content is very limited. You will keep collecting resources like ore/wood, fighting monsters that pretty much do the same thing over and over again. The combat mechanics are pretty plain. There's not much point into making any houses on a planet with the ship being a viable storing and farm-option. The same thing repeats over several tiers until you hit the end-tier.What prompted me to not recommend this game to any one new to Starbound is the lack of updates from the developers. They've not been upfront or honest with the community and their backers - dates keep being pushed, updates not appearing for many months and a constant change of development strategies (like reworking basic core features, re-prioritizing content creation and contradicting earlier statements quite often). And there has also been a harsh censorship going on on their forums, where even people who aren't rude nor trolling - but raising valid questions and concerns are getting suspended. I shall also not mention how certain members of their staff have been rude towards the community, which is very unprofessional from a business perspective.There are many other examples of early access developers (be it indie or otherwise) that have handled their projects in a much more professional way.All in all, if the developers at Chucklefish get their thing together one beautiful day - this game might be worth investing in. Until then, do yourself a favor and do not buy this product.			"

								It's very good, a lot of planets to explore and a lot of customisation however..There is nothing to actually do, as in there is no purpose. Nearly all the items in the game are simply decorative sprites and since you have to visit other worlds to mine rarer resources there is no real reason to build a base anywhere with them.So while you might think ""Hey I want to build a huge space fortress"" you quickly realise that it will serve no purpose and you will end up abandoning it as you travel further into space.<<<UPDATE>>>Due to the comments below I should probably state that this review is based upon the last time I properly played the game which was in late 2014 so experiences of the game may be different now due to recent patches, I recommend reading the comments attached to this review to see the changes as there seems to be some recent developments which address the problems I stated.

								Let's be clear from the start - most of this review is going to be about poor business practices by Chucklefish. Having said that, the game itself isn't worth your money. The content is all extremely repetitive, and if you find yourself checking back for any reason after the initial 5-10 hours, it'll be to see if any updates have taken place. You'll be met with disappointment. Avoid leaving the launcher up when you leave the game, as that trumps up your playtime as well, and Tiy loves to run to Twitter citing higher playtimes as reasons his game must be better than it is.Now, on to why you REALLY shouldn't play this game:The company behind it, Chucklefish, is among the most unethical and dishonest companies around. They're setting themselves up to be a miniature Electronic Arts. They're just as greedy, except they produce less.They released nearly 7 months ago, and thus far have only produced two updates of questionable value, after taking in four million dollars in funding. From the moment of release it has been plagued with excuses for why development stopped, such as taking a month vacation after Steam release, then another 3-4 months so they could move a few members to London for communication purposes (which hasn't solved anything yet), to knocking off early for, ""Mario Kart"" sessions. Development remains in a state of limbo, and nobody is really sure what's going on.Luckily, they don't communicate with the Steam community either, so the ignorance is shared among their company and investors. I mean, sure, they make loads of money on the platform, but when it comes to updating the folks that supported their 7 month vacation, you have to paw through every social media site known to man to actually locate information, and when you do, it's usually about everything BUT ""Starbound."" Wondering when the next update will be? I hope not, because their site, Reddit, and Twitter - the places they direct you to for announcements - contains everything from their new office dog, to employees playing in trash cans, to excuses for ranting on Twitter, such as them being under the influence of surgical drugs following an operation, yet managing to spend the entire day on Twitter.Speaking of communication, unless it's blind praise, they don't want to hear it, and they WILL censor you. They'll claim they don't, and sure, you'll hear reports of their official websites being highly censored, and probably not think too much about it. ""Two sides to every story"" you'll tell yourself, until one of their developers comes through Reddit, Steam, and the Chucklefish forums and goes on a massive ban wave of critics, while allowing the harshest fanboys to remain, and you'll quickly learn it's true. The one responsible for the project, Tiyuri, even dedicates a significant portion of his day on Twitter calling all criticism ""trolling"" in an attempt to garner sympathy. If you head to their forums, they'll label ALL criticism - either done well or blatantly trolling - ""flamebait"" and lock it immediately... if you're lucky. Often enough, people have been banned for it, regardless of post quality.There's more, but what I'm trying to say is, no matter what goes on with this game, don't support it. We've already funded the vacations of some of the laziest, most condescending people imaginable. They make promises they can't fulfill, spend most of their free time Tweeting and blogging about wasting time between complaining about the investors critical of them, taking the development money and spending it on other publishing ventures, and generally treating those that supported them with disdain and contempt, whilst simultaneously running off to Tweet about how everyone is mean to them and they don't understand why.There are PLENTY of good indie companies out there, and Chucklefish is the exception to the rule. Give them your money instead.			"

								""A delayed game is good eventually, a rushed game is bad forever"" -Shigeru MiyamotoThe original release for this game was to be December 4, 2013. A bit late, eh?Sure, Chucklefish may not have been able to deliver on time, but look at Valve's record. They weren't bashed for being late because of Valve Time.  The game is getting much better, and is almost to it's official release (2 updates until) and is really good compared to what it may have been if it released when planned.So what I am saying is that putting this game off because of the heaps of negative reviews in the ""Most Helpful"" section isn't what this game deserves.Now that I got that out of the way, let's make an actual review, shall we?Overall: It's doing what it's set out to do.When the beta first came out, it was so much different, monsters actually need to do attacks to damage you, the snow infantry armor was overpowered, and you could die of hunger, and freezing.The Novakids didn't even exist in the game.Today, that's all changed: Questing, ship upgrades, colonies, and really smooth generation of planets. This game managed to keep me interested in mining, which for some reason, Minecraft couldn't get me interested in that.This game has done exactly what it aimed to do in the first place: let people explore.Although, it is still in beta, with many additions, bosses, quests and mechanics yet to be created in the universe. (with whips being planned in the next update, upon writing this.)However, this game is not flawless; the AI is quite stupid, with pathfinding that matches an acrobat missing their inner ear, and the game making some parts of itself feel unneccessary, and the framrate dying at certain buildings made by the devs (which is being fixed).Conclusion: You should try it, sometime, at the least.So, it's an 8?

								Short review: I liked it at first, and it definitely had potential once upon a time... but the repetition and a few other factors have taken away the fun. I don't think it will improve- wait until final release or until it goes on sale if you decide to buy it at all. It was a tough choice for me to mark Starbound as not recommended because I used to really enjoy this game. However now, taking a step back, some recent changes and underlying flaws have taken that enjoyment out of it. 1. My biggest issue: repetition. I was initially attracted to this game because of the exploration factor, but it doesn't take long before you see the same thing over and over, and the recent changes to the game have only made this worse. Each planet is almost a carbon copy of others of its type, down to the of monsters that spawn there. The dungeons and towns become tedious after encountering them time and time again. The unique charm of exploring different planets' surfaces is almost entirely gone. The over-abundance of microdungeons and rare items has made the feel of the game shift from exploring to grinding for loot. Even the dungeons themselves and the loot within eventually becomes mundane and useless (Oh boy, a new cool weapon! Just like the other ten thousand I found and won't ever need!).2. Further, the progression feels wrong. NPCs give quests that guide you through the different tiers of armor- but it winds up boiling down to finding some ore, making some armor so you can beat a boss, so that you can find different ore to make more armor so that you can beat another uninteresting boss... rinse and repeat. That's essentially the only progression system, which ends up feels very grind-y. Overall, the old boss system felt much more rewarding. (There is some progression to be had in upgrading the size of your ship, but this provides little to no real challenge at all other than more grinding planets.)3. Kind of goes along with the lack of the progression, but the game lacks any real point or purpose. Okay, so it's a sandbox game, maybe it can get away with no real substance, right? Not really, as exploring gets old fast and the sandbox aspect withers up fast.There are, of course, more issues (why was damage-on-touch added??) with this game, but these two stood out the most to me. Now, there are still plently of good things that made the game enjoyable. There are neat little easter eggs and plenty of cool things to find. I've enjoyed it for long enough to feel as though I've gotten my money's worth, but lately Starbound seems to have taken a turn for the worse. This game has been in early access for years (wasn't it supposed to come out in 2012 or something?) and somehow it doesn't feel much closer to a finished game. Overall, Starbound feels like a very poorly developed game- it could have been great but something went wrong along the way.Granted, this is still an early access game (which it has been for years since I bought the game...) so these things *could* be subject to change. However I don't think they will, and the game has lost some of its fun. If you are going to get this game I would strongly encourage you to wait until it is out of early access, although that may take a few more years at this rate :/  or wait until it goes on sale.			"

								Please don't give chucklefish any money.  This game is exceptionally incomplete, on the cube world update plan (i.e. almost never) and was originally to be released in 2013.  The lead developer has even said what is they are selling is a tech demo, not a beta.  The combat is horrible.  The worst part is that the developer is now actively removing and locking threads that meet the Steam guidelines but are critical of the game and developer.  Save your money and buy something that is actually finished or gets updated regularly and is developed by people who can take criticism.For the current gameplay I recommend this Let's play.

												Edit: added more fresh memes and minor text editsYou read the reviews of negativity, of all the old days of Starbound and old people ranting about how it used to be better back then.But if you're really new to Starbound, why should you care? You weren't there in the old days when you had to walk uphill and downhill in the snow, when the koalas were furious, and when everything was all cream and gravy.I'm not going to lie, I'm an old person too. I miss those days of temperatures being able to kill you.I miss the days of sectors and the map upgrades.I miss being able to cheese the bosses when you used their spawn items.I miss my bubble tech and my old characters.I miss when the toolbar only had one L and one R.But that's for the old people to mope about. Sure, I miss it, but that time has passed long ago. New things await ahead, and I can't complain about that. It'll never be Old Starbound, but it'll always be Starbound to me.I think if you started here, you'd find something you would enjoy. You wouldn't be dragged down by the good ol' days. You would be happy and free, like a child experiencing the world for the first time. Just sit down, relax, and try Starbound for yourself. Why let someone else tell you what the world is when you can see it for yourself?Go out there and explore Starbound. You might find something you could never imagine. There's also a race of Harambes. You can explore galaxies without pants. You can slaughter innocent people of towns you find. You can kill your friends. You can play pokemon and enslave small creatures. You can be a weeaboo fish man. You can get anime blades. You can hire hardcore penguin mercenaries to ""ice"" people. (BAHAHAHAHAHA) You can even download an absolute overabundance of mods you don't need.   YOU CAN EVEN BE A PRO GENJI LIKE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF WITH MODS TOO HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥JUST GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  "

								I am currently the owner of the biggest multiplayer community of starbound.And Gosh, since this game released, developers always acted like multiplayer didn't exist, no stability, crashes, exploits, ridiculous resource usages and more make a real challenge both run a server and play the game on multiplayer. However i recommend this game. I saw pretty dumb negative reviews, from complaining that the game crashes / lags and that they wiped saves on last update.... you are on the wrong steam section then.Development isn't fast, but this developers are committed to this game, i prefer them to take their time doing it right than rush it and end up on something poor for everybody to play. Side of them made the mistake of give dates, i believe you would agree with me on that.They need to focus more on make the core features they have solid enough and not fell into the temptation of add shiny new items/gear constantly it's pretty much what i would point at the current status of starbound. But i think this game still has a lot of potential for its future, even if it releases without all that firstly intended to have on, it's said to have a post-release team to maintain updates to the game, so the 1.0 doesn't mean it ends there.So just have patience and have good hopes for this game future, it isn't abandoned. :-)			"

								I love the concept of Starbound.  The promised features, the visuals, the music, even many of the functioning mechanics.I've been cautiously optimistic despite all the setbacks and drama and, frankly, horrible decisions on Chucklefish's part.  I've been hoping that deep down they want to see Starbound completed as much as any of the players who jumped in early.  Even if jumping in early was supposedly going to speed up the 2013 release of the game that was going to happen no matter what, which not only didn't happen but that particular FAQ item was removed from the site and Chucklefish seems to think no one noticed or remembers its wording.Still, I've held onto hope.  Then I read this.""I feel 1.0 is an arbitrary release number and it’s down to us to decide what 1.0 means in the context of our game.""That's Tiy, in a recent post to Starbound's website.  Stating his philosophy of what ""1.0"" means to a game release.  First they redefine what qualifies as a beta, which is apparently the state Starbound is in right now (it's alpha, very early alpha even).  Now they're redefining what qualifies as a 1.0 release.  Because it's down to them to decide these standards, since they've earned that privilege.This is exactly what everyone in my situation has been fearing.  That with Starbound being declared a beta when it was clearly not in any way close, it would be declared released when it was finally in a beta state, if even that far (it is still not in any way close).  And now Tiy has basically announced that Chucklefish will do just that.I can no longer in good faith recommend Starbound.  I recommended the game it was supposed to be, despite it being unfinished, because I had some faith that it would be completed.  And maybe if you cram it full of mods it can approximate that.  But Chucklefish may go down as the worst developer ever, if they keep this nonsense up.  They've redefined the industry standards for what qualifies as ""alpha"" and ""beta,"" and now they're doing it again with ""1.0.""Tiy mentioned all the good reviews Starbound has received.  It shouldn't be receiving any reviews.  It's not done.  Early access impressions, maybe, but any critic who reviews Starbound as if its complete should stop writing reviews because they've failed pretty hard (especially if they won't acknowledge how that incompleteness hurts the game).  And any critic who writes an early access impression that doesn't factor in Starbound's rough history is still failing pretty hard.They've made over $20 million on this game (over $4 million just through preorders on their site), and they couldn't be bothered to put that money towards a development team that could help them fulfill their promises, or at least make up for those they've broken.  This has to be a record for poor financial management by a game developer.  They not only didn't expand their team, they defended that decision by claiming it would actually make things harder.  And in some contexts that might be true, it's probably possible to have too large of a development team, but Chucklefish wasn't and isn't close to having that kind of problem.That money is also why I don't feel bad about giving a thumbs down.  They've probably made more money on this game pre-release than most indie devs can hope for after they release their games.  They've made EA-level money, and really don't need more of it.  They don't deserve more of it.  They need to start properly using what they've already made as they explicitely promised they would (before removing that promise, anyway).I am legitimately depressed by this development.  The reason Starbound brought in this kind of money is because so many people want what was promised, and those people hyped it to other people who also want that.  This is a game people want, it's very appealing, and they paid for it in an incomplete state because that's how much they wanted it.  But they also paid for it in that state because Chucklefish promised so hard that it was going to be completed last year no matter what.  It was so going to happen, just trust them.I want the game that was supposed to be released in 2013.  Any claims that we got what we paid for because this is early access, or because it's beta (it's not), are ridiculous.  And with this talk about what 1.0 means for Starbound, it's not clear if we'll ever get what we paid for.I'll write a more positive impression or review if and when I get it.Which I really hope happens.  It's just really, really hard to believe it will.			"

								Edit: Read the comments for some high comedy and amusing assumptions.TLDR: Great potential, abandoned by the devs. Sadly becoming the norm for Early Access.Bought a 4 pack for the family and then we waited months and months to actually play. A year ago we were having great fun with it, but the content was shallow, we put it aside to wait for the advancement stuff to come in...and we waited...and we waited......and we waited..........so far this game has been waiting, a teaser, and more waiting.Well now it looks like the wait is over, the game is dead. Sad.(disclaimer: statement that the game is dead based on _RUMORS_ (that I believe) that the Devs are going to ""Pull a Schafer"" and make the next stable release version 1.0 and exit early access. This would amount to releasing a game as complete as Towns and Spacebase DF-9, thus killing the game.)			"

The developers are incompetent and couldn't program a toaster without throwing out all the code 3 times.Notice how the changelog looks very impressive, but if you take a second and look at it no real gameplay has been added. Terraria is a much more compelling and rich experience and that game didn't need a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dollars. A possible Alternative to starbound is to slam your head against a wall while playing terraria, The best part about that is when (If) your concussion heals you will have an actually good game to play.An Entire Universe to explore, and yet every single planet feels the same.Water, Water, Everywhere, And yet not a drop to drink.

								It feels as if it were released to the public much too early.  Early access is one thing but this is another.  I've had it for quite a while and it is very far from complete.  If the developers don't forget about it(they already made money off it, so they might 'forget' about it if they haven't already) wait until it is fully completed before puchasing it.  At the rate that they've made updates and the progress of these updates, it'll be a few years at the very least before they finish it.  Appreciate it from a distance, at least for now.Update:  I've only begun to touch the winter update and so far it is a much better game then it was before.  It gives a good view of what they've got in mind for the game as a whole but its still something that should've been around much sooner then this.  At least, I'm no longer stuck wondering if they've abandoned the game or not.Update:  There hasn't been much of anything added in any decent amount of time.  Just more promises and ideas thrown out from devs.  It feels like the devolper has more ideas then follow through.  If you're considering buying it, be warned that it'll probably be in ""early access"" forever or close to it.			"

								Don't buy this game.Pros""1.scifi themed instead of generic fantasy.2.has potential if the devs would get off their duffs.Cons:1.no updates beyond trival things.2.grind.3.devs lie and nothing seems to have been updated since the last time I played this trainwreck. Having modderes do your work for you doesn't count as far as I' m concerned.4.linear.5. swords and other melee weapons beyond bayonets and combat knives have no place on the battlefield. 6. the devs are unprofessional and spit lies all the time.Go buy terraria and save your money.

Early Access Review
								I've played my fair share of minecraft, dabbled in terraria. this game takes the sense of exploration to a whole new level. in minecraft you have to remember your coordinates and pray you can make it back without dying unless you want to loose the whole reason you left your home to begin with. terraria you can go infinately in any direction but the problem is you will eventually need to turn back and i know ppl like myself...thats a really long treck back.starbound pretty much has given you the vehicle to your dreams. your spaceship can be your home, the universe is your sandbox. want an ice castle? build it. want a giant tree in a sea of tentacle monsters? build it. want a base at the center of the earth where only the monsters that dwell dare approach? do it man its your world(s).when you explore in this game you dont have to worry *oh man am i gonna get lost?* nope. not at all. planets loop back around giving you a sense of the finiteness of a true planet. there is a center to each planet. there are multiple biomes to each planet *though i feel the poison biome needs to back up a bit. its in every planet and the tiny pools are a pain to avoid* ive run into tentacle planets, ice planets, forrests, jungles. ive run into brain planets people, its pretty intense. mechanics? oh yeah.jumping in this game doesnt slow or speed you up but when you find a planet with low gravity it changes your perspective of movement. trust me the first time will take you for a ride. there are also things in this game called tech which of any other game would pretty much be special moves but they can open up whole new worlds for you. some techs can let you fly, some just let you move faster. some give you an awesome mechs and others give you the ability to make travel systems. fighting mechanics in this game play alot like terraria in the sense that your mouse controls where you shoot, your mouse controls the direction you face and swing and the weapons decide the type of attack you do.did i say its like terraria? oh my its such an upgrade in fighting mechanics. your weapons alone can be so many variations to speed, swing type and secondary abilities. ive played this game for a few weeks now and ive found lightning, fire, poison, knockback, explosions?! and thats just swords!! i havent even started on guns yet!guns. the backbone of range. currently there are no recepies to make guns in the game as it stands but the guns are hillariously different. your friend can find a gun that shoots bullets, pretty fast speed and all, you on the other hand may find a bazooka that shoots lazer missiles that light up the sky and explode in blue glowy goodness. each gun has the potential to have different colors to different abilities. the ammo types alone make guns rediculous. i found a gun just the other day that shot stick mines, they fire pretty fast, stuck to walls, and exploded on impact. it was rediculous. soundtrack.oh my the sound track in this game just makes you feel like you really are on an adventure. i will say that there isnt MUCH music as of yet but it is very appropriate when it does play. you get certain music at night, certain music in day. when youre underwanter the music muffles itself so you know, when youre to low in the world the music stops so you know just how deep  you are. battle music is intense, but needs more variation. considering this is only beta and they have this well orchestrated music im dying to see what they do with itnow on to dungeons.have you ever just walked around and thought *huh this place is pretty barren, i feel like the only person on this planet* starbound can do that, but with a reason. dungeons in this game can be as small as a little trapped apex hut all the way down to a subterranian military base. you can find tombs, bases, ruins, hell i found a dungeon after running into an outhouse all by itself in the field and noticed....is that a sewer down there? indeed it was explorers. packed with poo monsters and sewage blocks. i found that absolutely hillarious.npcs. as it stands now there arent that many things to do with npcs though you will find in later levels having a chef in your home will be useful since it can sometimes be hard to farm up the necessary food to make the items you need to survive. you cant sell right now but they intend to add that into the game *thank god* and make more functions for ncps. more personality, more function, more life. to put it bluntly i ran into an avian temple with friendly npcs and i climbed all the way to the top. at the top of this building there were two avian saying *im not ready for this* *i thought i had stealed myself for this* they were preparing to jump from the ledge in an act the lore explained simply as ""fly or die"" thats right. the lore in the game actualy is presented by the races that spawn. i found that little story in a book i found in a city of avians, read it, then ran into them afterwards and was astounded by the depth of these people. currently there arent really that many races cities finished but the ones that are are huge. races have their own dungeons as well which can be pretty fun to explore and understand more about them.bosses and enemies.the enemies in this game litterally are never the same. they can look similar but never the same. the fun part about this is not all monsters will come up to attack you, some are friendly. the actual fun part about this is that cute little squirrel looking creature over there will come to rip your eyes out but the giant spikey girrafe will leave you alone and go about its business. never judge monsters by their appearance, they will always surprise you and their attacks in some cases can be pretty devastating. flying monsters are a pain even with guns sometimes as they can move pretty fast and have pretty hard hitting attacks but little hp. the only thing about them that i find lacking is the attack functions compared to the variety of monsters. most will always charge, few have attacks other than that and they are usually pretty predictable.bosses. there are only a few bosses in this game and truely they dont pose much of a threat given the right amount of preperation. the problem i find with this is you spend ALL that time getting resources and then when that fight comes up its just like fighting any other monster just way bigger and harder hitting. i would like to see these bosses upgraded in some way or at least the ones implimented later add in some other features. and to my second point there arent enough boss monsters YET for the entire progression of the game. i suspect they plan to add in bosses for each teir of gear *currently stops at 10* which will be amazing but i hope they make the monsters a little harder to handle giving you a senese of progression. BUILDING!!!as many people who have played minecraft and terraria there is a certain time when you want to settle down and just build a home. fantastic idea. the building in this game is actualy very similar to that of terraria. you have foreground and background to play with. the only real gripe i have about this game so far in this aspect is you cant craft alot of materials to build. you are kinda stuck right now with cobblestone wood and sand for the most part and other terrain materials you pick up as you gather, but the other materials like castle blocks and tomb stones maybe even just some fancy bricks all come from cities and take a HUGE amount of time just to break. now i dont want to be able to make the special stones from dungeons, thats just giving me the game, but there needs to be more than you can make in the ways of craftable building blocks for a player, even if its just by schematic, im cool with this. the smal little decorations you can remake by adding to your 3d printer on your ship and to me, thats good. it keeps my crafting window clean and free of junk that i wanted to store but not see every day....

								Early progress lacks. The team may be lacking leadership or direction.I bought this game a while ago, enjoyed it enough to make my friends get it. We played it, got all the techs, beat the bosses and did a little planetary exploration. There was cool dungeons and random villages, but there was no unique loot or anything that made it original. nearly every planet has some village or dungeon, and they all had the same loot.Fast forward 10 months, I went to play and it is pretty much the same game. Except now I am experiencing more crashing issues and a slight lag/unstability. Hold off on the purchase until there is some direction and progress made, not concepts and ideas.			"

								As much as i love the idea of Starbound, in It's current state and with the current speed of development I just can't recommend it.Progression through the game is just a grind to make the next tier of weapons and armor, and then a easy bossfight to unlock the next tiers. Mining the planets is slow and unrewarding, which encourages the player to just run across the surface of the planets to find surface ores. Most of my time in the game ended up being spent on running, which got boring fast. The speed of development has been extremely slow, and several months has passed since the last stable update. And progress still seems to be slow.I don't recommend the game in it's current state, if the idea sounds interesting, check it out when it's been completed.			"

								Oh Starbound... The game of massive potential with nearly zero progress.I really want to like this game, but the developers make sure you can't. From the absolute awful forum management, to the abysmal updates, this game is going nowhere fast. It takes the development team a month to implement one update, and they are usually all the things you don't care about this early on, like Flickering Lights.The storyline is currently 1/10th complete, and it has been out for nearly two years. If that rate of progress doesn't scare you off, don't worry, it gets worse. The company has since moved offices (to a different country), expanded their team, and started over 5 new projects. I wonder where all the Kickstarter and Steam money is going?Nearly every patch will wipe your character and world. In the 50+ hours I have played, I have completed the game three times (and I wasn't rushing to end game). I strongly recommend you avoid this game. Terraria while older is still a million times better.			"

It seems that the devolopers have almost completely forggoten about this game. I checked for updates but few had arisen. In the span of 4 months that I waited for these updates I got minor bug fixes and a few in game""details"".My advice dont buy this game unless its on sale or if they complete it, not to mention if they ever do. I was looking for a game like terraria with a cool mix of space and endless word exploration but what I found was a abandoned game thats general gameplay at the moment is rather bland. "

Early Access Review
								Overall thoughts: There is no denying this game is extremely fun at the start. I easily played 4 hours a day for a straight week in the single player portion of this game. The game has enormous potential but the developers seem to have cashed in and hit the door running. There used to be a steady stream of updates for the game with more content monthly, but that has completely stopped. This has left me and others I am sure with a game that is boring to play because you have done everything that can be done with the game. I don't see the point of purchasing this game in its current state. Gameplay 7.5/10 - The game runs great and the combat is smooth and easy to master. Environment/Graphics 8.5/10 - The environment is beautiful in this game. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2D game, so there is nothing to say about them really.Length 5/10 - As I stated before, the developers have essentially given up on the game. The development of the game has basically ceased to exist. They try to make you believe they are honestly working on the next patch by releasing snapshots, similar to snapshots in Minecraft. There are mods, but I was never really motivated to try mods in this game for some reason. Overall 4/10 - The environment and gameplay is still not enough to give me reason to rate this game higher. The developers silence criticism on their forums and result to bully tactics. Funny enough, they started to post development blogs on the starbound homepage on their website daily to give the impression they are working on this game. Please do not fall for it! Do not buy until the development team actually starts developing more content (good content too!) and stops bullying customers that offer good, honest criticism.			"

								Buy the game at your own risk, at this point of ""Development"" it is not worth your money, it can be fun but that will get burnt out quite fast and with the lack of updates since months and drama it keeps having this seems more of a ""Stay out until it's safe situation"".If you are wanting to reflect complaints or constructive critisism towards the game I encourage you to avoid any official Chucklefish forum, as of now the Dev and Mod team seem to be on a rampage of banning users for speaking against the game, even with fair claims such as the previous mentioned lack of updates,critisism silencing and even trolling their own community(even if it was said to be a ""joke"" quite alot of people got banned because of a Staff member joke), most topics on forums are locked as the sight of any incomming bad view of the game or developer team.The development of the game has been quite poor as of lately with alot of shady non-transparent announcements,including the FAQ changing after people paid for the game removing the date of release(that has been delayed twice since 2 years already),""publishing"" games abusing of the game's hype and crowdfunding as their way of publishing is to make the users back the projects up instead of the normal business of their company backing them up, Tiy has also been accussed repeated times of ripping Final Fantasy sprites and selling them to Reddigit(that at the time had no clue about them and almost made Terraria get sued and shut down.) then leaving Terraria to advertise himself as ""Creator of Terraria making a game"",""Terraria in Space"" which was turned into the massive hype we got for Starbound.The Modding community has also been turned down quite alot of times as the mods themselves claim to be a really complicated game to mod quite ironically for the advertised support they would give mod creators, including that alot of times mods have been included to the game and released as ""updates"" even if they weren't done by the Devs themselves trying to sugar coat the lack of real updates the game has been having since months.""Thick and Fast updates"" where never released.This should also help to see the timeline of development: http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHyDon't believe the hype.

Early Access Review
								Short Version: A pile of wasted potential and shattered promises. A thoughtlessly-designed mess of features that all look great on screenshots but fall very short in execution. While the hope with Early Access titles is that they will be improved and the issues will be fixed, I have no hopes for this happening. Despite the claim of ""thick and fast"" updates, the last meaningful one was six months ago. To go into detail: Despite being a sci-fi title, most of your weapons will be swords or hammers. There are guns, but they're rare and impotent. If you want a mobile light source you can craft a candle-lantern-on-a-stick, rather than a shoulder-mounted LED or similar. These are examples of things that end up making the setting feel more like a fantasy setting with spaceships arbitrarily tacked on.Exploration, which should be the game's strong point, is ruined by the sheer vastness of the randomly generated planets, the tier system, and the coordinates system. Why should I build a house on this planet, over the one next to it? Why should I build a house on this tier-2 planet which only has iron on it, when I can wait and build it on a tier-5 planet with better materials? Why even explore at all, when I could just go on the forums and look up the coordinates of a planet with amazing weapons?Combat is weak, and floaty. Can best be described as two people on a trampoline hitting each other with pool noodles. Progression consists of mining ore (with a pickaxe, of course. What do you think this is, the future??) to get armor and weapons. When you first enter a new tier, enemies will be killing you in only a few hits. When you get the armor of that tier, you become very resistant to their attacks. It results in a game where you're never properly challenged: You are either fleeing helplessly from the sky demons, or crushing them in one hit.On top of all of this, the game is bizarrely resource-intensive for a 2d platformer. I have a fairly powerful system capable of playing full 3d games (Crysis 2, Max Payne 3), yet I have gotten consistently poor framerate.			"

								Games like Starbound are why I will never purchase an Early Access Game ever again. The developers did not deliver on their promises, have released little to no recent updates, and have seemingly just up and abandoned the game. I should have just set my $45.00 on fire because that would have at least provided me with a small amount of warmth for a short period of time; spending it on Starbound was a foolish mistake. Pre-ordering the Gold Tier, and giving these scammers even more money, was an especially foolish mistake.Do not buy Starbound. It's already like a year, if not moreso, behind schedule with no signs that the game will ever be finished. What the developers promised sounded pretty good but it's very apparent that they now have no interest in following through on those promises.Do not buy Starbound; it's a waste of money. I cannot stress that enough: do NOT buy Starbound.			"

								Had high hopes for the game when I first saw it. Played it the first time around and it was hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mobs would 2 shot you, you had to worry about freezing to death at night and on cold planets, hunger etc. But with recent updates the game is too casual 4 me. They give you an OP starting weapon, mobs are weak as ♥♥♥♥, the only thing that ever kills you is the environment. Even the bosses are easy. Planet temperatures are a useless gimmick since you get the suit for it anyway. You no longer starve since the hunger feature was removed and you can no longer freeze to death at night.Too linear gameplay. They guide you through a questline along with boring filler sidequests. The way you obtain gear is too linear also. The only things worth a ♥♥♥♥ that you find in the surprisingly bland planets are cosmetic items. All the weapons and armor you find are never as good as what you can craft.Building is useless because your ship provides everything you need.Devs only ever add ♥♥♥♥ing furniture in updates.Has absolutely no replay value at all.Would not buy again.Save yourself $5 and pick up Terraria instead.

Early Access Review
								I first bought this game when it became available. I played around 41 hours then. Recently came back and have put in about 44 hours now.Back when the game first came out, it involved many of the survival aspects that other games had. Such as hunger, being too hot/cold, certain creatures coming out at night, and so forth. To progress, you would mine down into the ground of the planet, gather materials you needed to craft a certain object, and summon a boss with said object which would give you an item to progress to the next ""tier"". The next tier would provide you with better crafting options in armor and weapons, which would require higher tiered ore, which in turn would usually require going to a more dangerous planet. All of this involved the survival mechanics as well. Dig too far down into a planet, and it would become so cold that it'd begin to affect you, so you may need heat to survive. If you died, you lose all your items... I think. It's been so lnog since I played back then.Now things have changed. Currently there are three difficulty levels. Casual, you lose 30% of your currency when you die, called pixels. That's it. The next up in difficulty makes you drop all your items when death comes for you. Then the last, Hardcore, makes it so that once you die... your character stays dead. Keep in mind, that many of the survival aspects were removed. You no longer get hungry, food slowly regens hp when eaten. There is no longer a hot/cold gauge when mining down into the depths. Day/Night doesn't matter creature wise, aside from being harder to see without sufficient light sources.Keep in mind, that the Devs have stated that the survival aspects will be returning in a ""Survival"" difficulty mode.Progression is now different. I hear they are going to change it further, but for now I prefer it this way instead of the old way. Instead of building an item to summon a boss. (And cheese the boss, by simply placing dirt in a way that makes you untouchable while being able to kill it), you are now given a mission in some form. These missions will bring you to a dungeon that's preset, and you aren't able to simply mine and tunnel your way through them. At the end of the mission, you fight a boss, and are usually given knowledge of some kind. Usually to reach the next tier of technology. Before any of this happens, of course, you have to repair your ship using the resources from the first planet you are stranded on. This serves as a way to ease someone who may have never played into the game, as it explains some of the mechanics through quests.Ther are some other things you can currently do. Like creating your own village/city and populating it with tenants, who will pay you with rent in some fashion. They also provide randomly generated quests, which at least gives something to do once you hit the final tier level... aside from ransacking outposts for materials and objects you want in order to expand your colony. Which reminds me, the ""mini-dungeons"" can't be ransacked and mined apart until you fight through their guards/puzzles and destroy the shield generator that's protecting it. This can add some variety when jumping around planets and searching for things you may want.In closing, I've read about the planned changes coming up in the release of Starbound with version 1.0. I'm honestly excited for it. Since the full story is going to be available, I'm probably going to delete my older character and start fresh. I hope you have as much fun in the stars as I have! Remember, the adventure is what you make of it.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is missing almost all of the promised features, so it's nowhere near beta. This is an alpha release advertised as a beta to increase sales. After months without any updates, and no significant updates at all since release, they're finally overhauling the game by making it more gated and linear than ever. Updates were still promised to be ""thick and fast"" until a month or two ago.Fans will tell you ""It's just in early access!"" to excuse the detestable behavior of the developers, which has been to lie. Two of the screenshots on this very store page are from mock-ups; the art assets exist but are unavailable. Notably, the depiction of an underwater Hylotl city simply does not exist, because, almost a year since release, the Hylotl race still does not have any cities or villages. This game really shouldn't be allowed on Steam, since it uses fake screenshots to advertise itself even on the store page. Earlier versions of the website also featured hand-made mock-ups instead of screenshots, to deceive readers into thinking the game was farther along than it really is.The procedurally generated enemies are boring to fight and the procedurally generated weapons are boring to find. Features announced as complete on the blog years ago, like the frozen ocean biome and the complex weapon generation system, are nowhere to be found, either having been simply removed during development or outright lied about. A system listed as ""50% finished"" on the Starbound Roadmap in December 2013 was only just being initially prototyped in September.This game is a mess, and the developers are dishonest fools who do their best to censor all dissent. Don't give them any more money.			"

								It's fun with friends, but after 40+ hours of gameplay it's really not all that memorable in its present state. Even for early access, the game itself is really buggy. There's no reason to ever set up a homebase on any planet since you're constantly moving around (the only really ""permanent"" location is your ship), really reducing how fun the building is. In addition, the whole game (even late game) just feels like a search for more fuel for your ship. This was really over-hyped and not worth it.The devs rarely, if ever, communicate with the players. Updates have virtually ceased.There is no reason to buy this game in the state it's in, and I'm not at all optimistic about its future. Terraria is still vastly better in every aspect.			"

Early Access Review
								3 years ago, heard a rumour of Terraria meets Borderlands in space type game. Devoured all the lovely material on the Chucklefish website. Got very excited. Very pretty roadmap released - game looks almost finished! Most things on there are at 90 percent. Woohoo! Early access, of course I will buy this game ahead of release, it promises to be amazing. Fast forward to release of beta.What a tragic waste of time. It's like someone modded Terraria badly. Nothing in terms of functionality is new, everything that was promised is missing and everything that is there is very very dull. Joylessly mash through the tech tiers. Wish I was playing Terraria.Weeks pass, no sign of updates. Voicing concerns on forums is met by a cloud of Chucklefish interns beratting you for asking when the thing you have paid for might be ready. The beta gets renamed. Apparently the beta was never a beta in the first place, it was an alpha. Chucklefish start implementing mods supplied by people desperate to make the game interesting. None make it to the actual playable game as it is never updated.Woefully and bitterly I resign to never pay for early access again. Chucklefish start working on other titles. Cobwebs start to grow over an angry dwindling community who had hoped for so much more.Let's not get fooled again.			"

								I pre-ordered this game for both me and a good friend.  I was so excited when I was reading up on it.  I was excited when I played it with my friends.  I was excited for great content updates to come out.And now I'm just incredibly disappointed.  Those big updates? Didn't come.  Features that the devs said they were going to put in? Not there. My good friend told me that the devs are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I said they just needed time.  I said that a good long time ago.  It's July 2014 now and this game is still just not going anywhere, and I feel a little bit like a dumbass for believing in them.On top of that, the mods of both Starbound steam discussion forum and the official forum seem to be a bunch of butthurt 14 year old kids who can't stomach the fact that they deserve all the negativity they're getting.  Censoring their community is their way of coping.Save yourself the disappointment.  Just get Terraria.			"

Now that starbound is 1.0 I gladly say what garbage this game is. Save your money for Otherworld. And the 250 hours was helping beta, sad my long suffering did not pay off.			"

								When you first start playing, I must admit it's pretty fun, and the possibilities seems endless, but you'll soon discover that the immense amount of pixel grinding and ore mining is too much to enjoy. On top of that, at a certain point the game stops giving you objectives, and simply throws you out into the worlds with nothing but some simple weapons and a handful of resources. While I don't want to be babysat through the entire game, I was barely able to begin to understand how everything worked before I was put completely on my own. It took internet research to discover that the next boss was acquired through the robotic crafting table, which previously was just some thing that I saw in the menus.Overall, I wouldn't recommend the game like it is. Should Chucklefish make the new-player experience much better, I may consider jumping in. While I say this, I was never able to play this game with friends, even with simple instructions on how to set up a 'server' for the game. It simply never worked. This is one of those games that you should buy if you can catch it for a couple of dollars on sale, and that's only if you feel confident that you will be able to understand the game with no help.

Maybe in beta or full-release it would have the sufficent features and tweeks so that I may find it fun, but for now it hasn't.You're welcome to try it out but I think it's not the best game on my pc by a long shot.Not Recommended!

If you go to there website they have a started to update it a ton the past few weeks. So just wait a few months or a year and I bet this game well be much better and be what its suppossed to be.			"

								Don't pay for an incomplete game.So many features were promised, as was a 2012 release. We have recieved very few of these features and the game still remains in beta (but admittedly it feels more like an alpha, due to how unplayable it is).Simply put, buying this game is like buying a pizza base and eating it uncooked with any toppings or sauce, but halfway through snacking upon the base, Chucklefish arrives and throws ice cream toppings in your face.Don't buy it.

								This game is not done. It is far from done. And it's not being updated. It hasn't received an update in half a year now. At most, it's gotten something cosmetic, but that's it. But that's still not all. When originally advertised for its closing in to early access release, the game was ""almost done.""Here's what you can do in Starbound currently: explore planets and find out how empty they are, dig up ore to make armor to go to new tiers of planets which are equally empty and dead, fight bosses that only have one attack each or are just generic enemies and are visually totally uninspired, enjoy the quality damage balancing as you're one shot in the highest tier armor by enemies on the final tier of planets, admire the diversity of Pokemon styled enemies that only run at you or jump at you and rarely stop moving entirely to try and shoot something at you.If Chucklefish asks to publish your game, tell them no. Many other games have and are now just seen as Chucklefish games, dev names lost in a limbo often.Avoid this game at all costs. Get a refund on your card if you've bought this by mistake if Steam won't give you a refund. This game is a confirmed scam and has been reported for fraud multiple times now.			"

								Judging the game on it's own merits and not bringing the developer's... Less than perfect PR and habits of only updating the broken Nightlies branch, I'm finding it hard to reccomend on it's own.Combat is boring, gameplay can pretty much be summed up with: Start on planet, mine for hours, realize you need pixels, kill monsters, get good armor and weapons, fight boss, go to new planet, realize you're just as weak as you were at the beginning, rinse and repeat. Weapons don't feel different unless you get a legendary, and even those are often just retextured versions of another. One legendary shoots bubbles when swung, another shoots poison. The only reason I have so much time on this game is because I'm a massochist and I tried to soak everything I could out of the game. Its fun factor pretty much only comes from shooting your way across the galaxy, but that also takes coal, so have fun digging more for those resources. From what the devs are saying, 1.0 will be much better. If you want to buy the game, do it then, or whenever the devs feel like actually updating this game like they promised on the store page with ""Thick and fast updates"".			"

												Hi guys! HappyDays here looking at Starbound 1.0!


YouTube™ Video: Starbound 1.0 Let's Play Part 1 | Full Release & Gameplay! 

			Views: 66,349		

			Starbound 1.0 has just been released! We explore the new gameplay and updates as a Floran, the flower race in the Starbound universe! ★Starbound 1.0 Release GIVEAWAY!★ Win your own copy of Starbound!		

Having played Starbound prior to the full release I was excited to see what the developers had changed moving in to a full version 1.0 release.Initial impressions seem positive, movement and combat seem more dynamic. The intro is enjoyable with a few hidden items along the way. The developers have introduced an enemy the player must hunt throughout their adventure which is a nice addition!One big thing I immediately noticed is that the initial healing item is now 'salve' instead of 'bandages.' I LOVE THIS as it gives a slower heal rate and makes combat more tactical rather than 'tank hits and spam bandages for massive healing. Salve heals 50hp over 10 seconds which means you cannot simply tank groups of enemies early on.I will update this review as I explore more of the content but initial impressions seem great!			"

												This game is essentially a really cool lego set with a rather poor story and some cool dungeons which you need to grind boring crap for hours to actually do. Many of the items that actually made it into the game are useless...Hoverbikes are practical, but awful. Boats.... why would you ever want one? There don't appear to be any oceans to traverse other than the ones on ocean planets. And on those everything worthwhile is underwater. By the time you can afford either you'll probably be sick of the game.Farming is too tedious and nothing can be automated. There's a cool wiring system, but not a lot useful you can actually do with it. Colonies are simply player made sources of the same crappy fetch and escort quests that non-player villages can do. Colonists won't farm for you.Your crew are more of a pain than a help and will constantly block crafting stations. This looks like an excellent game engine upon which a great game could be made using mods; but by itself it really isn't a great game. It's certainly not what we were sold in the kickstarter nor does it live up to the promise of what was in beta.			"

								Forum mods and game devs that dish out the hate, but can't take criticism. I've never been banned anywhere, ever, in my entire internet life--but I've been banned on the Chucklefish website, Starbound Reddit sub, and the Starbound forum here.Tens of millions of dollars in preorders for a 2D game, yet it's been getting worked on for over three years and is still hilariously feature-incomplete. If you're looking for a cheap knockoff of Terraria (with FAR less features), and a devloper base that takes your money and treats you like garbage, this is absolutely the game for you.And just a heads up, the massive Starbound play times you're seeing on most peoples' accounts is actually due to a bug with the game not completely closing down. The devs have known about the bug for a while, but have conveniently forgone trying to fix it...for obvious reasons.Three years for a cheap knockoff of a popular 2D game.Three.Years. YEARS.			"

								Starbound is pretty much the poster child for why I won't buy any Early Access games ever again. Stated as almost complete when it was first released the devs pushed out some big updates shortly afterwards ( like changing how the planet progression very drastically) so you were all like, 'wow, they seem to be able to change things pretty quickly!'. Then they decided to go underground for the next 6 months to a year. Imagine my shock when I came back to the game a year later and the promised ship upgrade system they were tweeting about ages ago still wasn't in.The game was released as a Very feature incomplete Alpha, and since then the devs seem to have no idea what they want the game to be. They seem to be randomly throwing ideas at the wall and Years later this game still isn't at a 1.0 state. Man what a scam.Even if this game does leave Early Access I'd stay far away. The Devs seem incompetent so I wouldn't expect anything like Terraria or Don't Starves ( now There's an EA game done right) post-release support. IMHO, stay away from Starbound and stay leary of any game Chuckfish developes in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								Hmmm what to say about starbound, well first off i'm going to make this clear. I don't mean in any way to insult the developers of this game, this review will only state my honest opinion about that game at  it's current state Now thats out of the way it's time to begin.This next part is kind of first experice and first thoughts, skip it if you want to get to my opinion as of nowSo, starbound, an early access game that I thought of as being ""Terraria in space."" I had played terraria a lot with friends before buying this game and loved terraria, so I assumed that this would be the next terraria. A friend of mine had bought the game and I had watched him play it a bit, everything looked awesome, from the tools he had to the things he did, I was convinced. I bought this game at its full price at the time, which was 15 dollars and started to install and play. The gameplay seemed odd and clunky and unfinished, but i convinced myself it was fine and played on with my friends. I then put the game down for probably 4 months. I finally started playing again around may.Ok now on to my opinion nowI came back to the game thinking it would be completely different in terms of new content, being away from and still growing game for 4 month you would expect that. I found the game nearly identical to how it last was, it felt odd and unfinished. Me and another friend had the same feeling towards the game and compared it to terraria. Now terraria has a fun, not very complicated feel to it, you can get into the game in minutes. Now starbound on the other hand I had a hard time getting used to, I knew about the game and how to play, just playing it wasn't enjoyable.I'm not sure how to explain it but it just was not fun to play at its current state, it was odd, seemingly unfinished and just overall weird. Because of that I can not recommend this game at its current state.Edit: So I wanna add some things that I forgot. This game has some potential, If we get updates more and with more content this game could live up to its ""Terraria in space"" image. I think this game could be salvaged but I feel due to the amount of negetive reviews, they have lost most of their current player base, unless it is slavaged, they lost me as well.			"

								My review is not completely negative, but for how much it costs it doesn't seem worth it..tl;dr - it's ok but seems like same content is repackaged in many different shapes without adding to game mechanics and complexity thus making game less interesting and fun :(Game is smooth for a beta.. but after playing for some time it gets boring..It seems like it's missing some fun elements..It would be cool if they added more machines for things like automatic mining and just to make bases more complex and fun to have.. We need something more complicated to craft.. Also adding maybe enemy waves that attack your base at some points and build more on that concept..Enemies seem a bit dull.. Combat gets too repetitive etc..Make it more important to have a main base, maybe have some setups that can give you abilities or something from your main base if you keep them powered..Make farming better, maybe animal herding etc (alien crossbreeding things like that :) )Maybe make it so you can have production facilities on some planets, that would be nice..I really hope they make this game more interesting..All in all it's an ok game, but it promised to be a very fun game with elements of games like minecraft, terraria etc..but improved and made more interesting, but at the end it's a nice looking (visually) and kinda boring game with little innovation..My view might change if they give us a nice big interesting update..EDIT: I have played this game for many hours because some of my friends bought it so it was more fun playing together.. also we added many mods that improve gameplay, add missions, quests, items etc.. but if we are talking about vanilla (unmodded version) then the text I wrote is still a very honest opinion.. Next update does promise huge improvments, but come on devs.. we have been waiting many months and will wait maybe a whole year until we get it.. I also don't like the fact that chuclefish and some employees were working on some other crappy games, I know they say they are only working on Starbound, but I find that a bit hard to believe.. I think they used the money aquired for Starbound to pay additional salaries, bonuses or whatever to their employees and team to make other smaller games.. (u know like the way that unprofit organizations make their salaries huge and take money from donations, but still say the company doesn't have profit, which is true, but doesn't mean they don't take any of the money you donated and put it in their own pockets..)

								A couple months ago I gave Starbound a thumb up.... can't do that anymore. The updates that were talked about never came and the game has little to no point to it. They have plenty excuses like  "" Moving "" the bussiness to a new location.... who does that right in the middle of designing the bulk of a game? There was supposed to be paths to follow, like being a builder or a farmer or adventurer. Ship upgrading and all kinds of stuff that would really complete this game. Instead they have worked on revamping the entire combat system for like the last 3 months... steam player base has went from like 20,000 concert player to 2,000. That should have been a really go sign that things are not moving along AT ALL.			"

Product received for free
												[EDIT; READ BEFORE COMMENTING ABOUT MY PLAY TIME] People are pointing out how I've spent 250 hours in this game, and therefore don't have the right to not recommend it. Most of those hours were spent in the pre-release builds, back in early access. Post-1.0, those hours were spent in a heavily modded version of the game, with me avoiding vanilla content because it just wasn't fun to me at all. I'm reviewing the game solely based on my experience with it in its current vanilla form. Right now, as the game stands, I do not recommend it. It is a completely different game from what it used to be. It is not the same game I poured 200+ hours into. [/done]I've followed the development of this game for a very long time. A friend bought me this game as a gift a long time ago, around the time the game was supposed to have been finished. I have played and enjoyed this game. I played the nightly unstable updates back in the day, I was there when we had nightly character wipes, and I watched this game grow and change. There have been some steps forward, but some steps back too. There are merits to this game, and it's not bad if you enjoy this game at all, but there are also many reasons why you should not buy this game at full price. I had high hopes for this game, but at the end of the day, I can't help but feel like they rushed towards a full release just because people were getting angry that it was taking way longer than they had initially said.If you want to understand why I feel this way, please keep reading. If you want to discuss with me, please remain civil. I don't want to cultivate a hostile environment. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. Anyway, on with the review, I guess.OH ALSO THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE PLOT SO PLEASE TURN AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT SPOILEDI've put about 300 hours into this game, if you combine my hours here with the hours put in the separate unstable release. I have played and enjoyed this game, but most of my enjoyment has come from using various mods to enrich my experience. That isn't good. I have tried and tried to go back to vanilla, to no avail. It isn't captivating or interesting for me at all.The main thing that's wrong with Starbound starts with the storyline. It's... generic and lacking. Nothing you do in regards to the storyline actually affects the universe in a meaningful way. In the beginning, the giant tentacle monster attacks the Protectorate. You flee. You're a sole survivor. But you never see the tentacle monster again until you hit certain points in the story missions. That's... a problem. If this malevolent space god is so hellbent on destruction, shouldn't you see more of it? Shouldn't the destruction of the Protectorate be the beginning? You should be attacked by minions of this thing. You should see invasions, you should see people fending these monsters off from their home colonies. You should see places destroyed and ravaged and taken over by tentacles. But you don't, really. In that regard, there's no real need to build colonies and defend them. There's nothing actually happening in the universe.While we're talking about the story, let's just say for the record that I do not like the story. They did away with the different racial origin stories and gave us Generic Starfleet. They didn't give us a chance to bond with the characters, get to know the organization, or familiarize ourselves with any of it. They just destroyed it all within the first five minutes of gameplay and expected us to care without giving us a real reason to care.In the description of the game they tell you that you can forego the story and just... colonize planets...? For what? Why? your options are to either follow a very narrow storyline without choices, or just aimlessly populate planets? What about giving us different factions to join, different starting scenarios, invasions, raids, an ability to gain reputation among people. Hell, maybe we could even join a cult whose aim is to serve the tentacle monster and spread its minions to other planets? There are a lot of possibilities here, but instead we get a very narrow storyline in a game that claims to be about choice. Why not, after so many years of development, give us more than one storyline to follow? Why just the one?It doesn't make any sense. You do not create your own story. You get forced into a storyline that you can't part from until after you fix your ship (which I hate because, like so many others, I have played that first ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission more than 50 times without exaggeration). And then afterwards you can go on and do what you want, but... y'know. There's nothing to do. It's just a vast lonely universe that has... a lot of stuff in it, but not much to /do/ with it.It has little substance. Abundance does not equate to substance.Another problem I have is with what happens after you escape the Protectorate. This might be a nitpick, but it would really go a long way in making the universe feel less cold and lonely. You're orbiting a planet that just happens to have a massive ancient gate on it...? Why not just mine to create parts to repair the communication system on your ship so you can send out a distress signal? Then someone comes along, tows you to the nearest civilization, and then you can find a way to pay for ship repairs? Why is it that we instead orbit a planet that's mostly barren, with the exception of a mine and some campers, with a Big Plot Device that happens to be sitting not too far from you. Why does it have to be so lonely? And so forced? Since a main focus of the game is building, why not have the player themselves create an outpost? With the option of rebuilding it in the Protectorate's image? Or theming it after another possible faction?I don't understand why you're the only person to survive the Protectorate attack, and I don't understand why you're TOLD the plot instead of being allowed to discover it through your own exploration. I don't understand why the people you pick up from the story missions just sit around at the Outpost instead of being crew members on your ship. I don't understand why the Plot Device Gate on the outpost is even on the outpost. Why not have it at one fixed point in the universe, that you find the co-ords for and eventually teleport to? Why not have the ruins be sprawling, vast, packed full of lore, maybe thick with the presence of the alien monster that destroyed everyone you loved and held dear? Why is everything just spoon-fed to you without any REAL need to explore?Also, all of the planets look the same. There's almost no variance. There aren't enough random structures to make planets fun to explore. Some of the structures are placed in places that don't make any sense. I miss the old planet generation where you'd get extremely crazy and weird variance.I'm sad about the lost potential of this game. I could go on for days about all of the problems I have with the way development has gone. I desperately want to love this game again, but I can't. It still feels unfinished even though it's said to be a full release. It's not in early access, but it feels like it is. I don't recommend this game at full price. I recommend this game for about $5. $10 is pushing it. $15 is just way over the line.I think Chucklefish has a great template here for a good game, but holy crap they have a lot of work to do before this game actually provides the adventure that it boasts about. For now, I'll just stick to heavily modded SB til the developers make progress and actually flesh out their skeleton. Or I'll just go play a game that has a more cohesive and satisfying experience.I really wanted to love this game. I used to be an apologist. I used to make excuses for the state of the game, but... yeah. No. I cannot recommend this game. I'm sorry.			"

								TL;DRCrafting Variety- BBase Constuction- BExploration- DCombat- FFor and older version: Really enjoyed the breif period of updates, but here we are 2 months after the devs promised almost daily updates and all is quiet. Since that point this game has stalled out, and random exploration is only so rewarding when the worlds lack character. Terraria managed to keep things feeling fresh even after hundreds of hours of playtime, but after spending a dozen hours hopping from planet to planet it feels like the game is really lacking in content. Pass on this one for nowUpdate: Nearly a full year later they finally update the game as promised, not the daily updates they promised mind you, but a significant update none the less. Unfortunaly it still feels devoid of soul, which i personally blame on the randomly generated enemies and lack of variety per world, as in, each individual world dosent have more then 5 or 6 different species, and almost all of them just drop meat. exploration per planet is pretty bland too, sure there a few temples, labs and the like, but most of the worlds just seem empty. Caves are uninteresting, the core of the planets are devoid of anything but some special ores and most planet surfaces are just one or two rather uninspired biomes. Sure there are funky trees and lots of species specific furniture to collect, but it just dosent connect with me for some reason. Combat is the worst, as it feels like there is really only a couple variations in creature abilities, and none of them particularly interesting. I really want to like this game, but as it stands its just enough to keep me checking back for updates and improvements.			"

								Starbound starts off feeling like it's going to be a great experience when you finish your tutorials and beam down to a planet to explore/build/fight Pokemon. An hour in and you're feeling pretty good about your decision to buy the game, you're feeling like this is a solid experience. A couple hours later, you've explored and seen quite a bit. Maybe you've built yourself a shantytown or a castle. However, you have noticed that the game can sometimes be very plain. Eventually, the idea that the game is rather plain becomes so persuasive that you feel you need to say so or recommend a great idea for new content on the forums. There is only a short time now before you realize why Starbound has so many negative reviews. Enter Chucklefish, the developers of Starbound, some of them came from an optimistic place like Terraria and even more of these devs came from parts unknown. At first we wanted to give Chucklefish our money for Starbound, we even practically threw it at them and told them to shutup and take it. They were more than happy to take our money from us, as any company would probably be.Days went by, months went by, we're very close to a year now, less than a month at the time of this review. There have been no updates to the game. Oh but wait, there are ""nightly builds"" which tout daily updates to the game, what you get when you opt into beta nightly builds is a mess that crashes so often that it should be a new meme. There are also Devblogs that advertise things that have already been in the game since it was added to Steam as something new they're adding to nightly builds. That's right, they're pretending old content is new content.I wanted Starbound to succeed, I pre-ordered it and couldn't wait for all the rewards with pre-order. We were promised a new class and fossils you could dig up, we still don't have the pre-order rewards after all this time. If you go to the official website you may see a different tale, but I assure you that's only because they delete any bit of criticism from the site, no matter how honest it is. The developers of Starbound also have a hallowed history of flaming and insulting customers they disagreed with. Couple all of this with what they're doing now (advertising old things in the game as new) and you're left feeling that Chucklefish is just a gang of con artists.I'm sorry my review is like this, but it's the truth. You would do well to stay away from this game until the developers in Chucklefish can be mature enough to deliver what they promised with no drama. If they don't deliver what they promised in this game, I will be buying nothing from them in the future. I might even do that anyways to make an example that it's not okay to do the things they did to your customers.			"

Also, devs barely update it (nightly builds dont count because most of the time they are unplayable) and have been really shady lately (firing a lot of the staff and forcing the others to move into ONE HOUSE TOGETHER)Overall, given the amount of hype this game generated, not impressed. Devs better step their ♥♥♥♥ing game up.EDIT JAN 28th: Game got updated, new content. Still thumbs down. If it's gonna take another year for another update, so be it.			"

								Bought this game as soon as it was possible to buy it. We were promised a definite release in 2013 as the game was apparently already 90% done!Right now the devs are working at the game, but it seems like they keep on remaking the base of the game, changing things that were 6 months old, reimagining the game every month. If it continues like this this game will stay stuck in limbo never to be finished.Be weary of early access games, and with that in mind i definetly cant reccomend this one, i had way more fun with terraria and even tough terraria is already a finished game they are still adding a lot more content than this game is getting.

								Why do you still have faith in this game? No really, why? Ever since the winter update, Chucklefish thinks that slapping on a bunch of unnecessary quests and systems counts as an ""update"" when in reality, it degrades the game. Tell me, who wants to do a bunch of pointless quests in order to actually play the game? Nobody. Why exactly do you want to make a colony? For pixels? Because you're honestly better off grinding for them. The winter update two years ago was the last step in the right direction for Starbound, because, shockingly, CF was trying to make an open universe sandbox game rather than some ungodly horrid hybrid of random features just stapled onto each other so CF can say ""We're making vidya gaems!""

Early Access Review
								***New info added based on ""Winter Update"" patch towards bottom*** This game and company is the perfect example of why we should all stop tossing our money away on the early access explosion.Seriously. Remember the days when we all purchased games that were released buggy, broken, and incomplete? Most of us complained. Some of us played the games anyways. Very few of us were not disappointed by the garbage we purchased.This game cured me of purchasing early access promises forever.While the game is playable and fun for a while, you really do get the feeling its over ambitious and will never be what you hoped for. I got my money out of it, but the disappointing updates tarnished that mild entertainment.Its a fanboy title, and don't let their message boards suck you in.Buy something complete and be warned very few developers of this stuff will give you quality titles like Terraria, SPAZ, and Dungeons of Dredmor.***  ""Winter Update""  addendum ***More stuff, fixes, but still bland. Read on.First I want to say I really want to like this game, but honestly, I can no longer stand the poor design choices and the incompetence of the people behind this company. They also like to delete posts created by people with legitiment complaints.The patch didn't change the core problem with this game. It has a incredibly large star map that does nothing to add to the gameplay. There is so little incentive to explore this massive universe, because each system has very little to offer. You seen one desert planet, you have seen them all. None of them feel unique. They are only different at a glance.The progression is also borked beyond all recognition. Progression is only artificial. Its just another color of ore to make a slight variant on the armor you just had. The weapons end up being the same, just diferent colors and graphics.Gameplay consists of landing on a planet, digging for the next ore, and then going to the next planet. Thats it. There are some minor adjustments to your equipment. For example, a tech that allows you to breathe on a planet without an atmosphere. Exciting as this all may sound, the ""yippee factor"" then dies off when you meet the next form of alien life that is pretty much the same as the last boring group of aliens you shot on the previous world.The inexplicable change to the star map baffles me on why this change was implimented. Sure, you want progression. But now, it made each star system bland. Why? Because there are few planet types in each system now. Why someone thought this was a wonderful idea seriously should question his own ability to make good decisions when it comes to game design.You can now have a ""Frozen"" star with eight ""Frozen"" planets in the system. There is also ""Eccentric"" stars, which is a new one on me that makes little sense. ""Radioactive"" stars are now present, which, well, is what stars are. Almost forgot the ""Firey"" star type. Gee. Imagine that...a star that is on fire. Did it really take a whole year to come up with these names and overall silly idea?The new food system is also a joke. Its got a ton of recipes, but they are all the same. This is the central theme to Starbound. That theme is ""mindless variety of tiny variations."" The buffs the food gives you are minor, and they don't last long. What makes it worse is that you can't even eat more food to replace the short buff because of a poorly implemented timer.I could go on and on about how poor and disappointing this title is for as long is it would take to discover every unremarkable planet in this botched attempt to create a universe.The ""Winter Update"" is just a mish mash of stuff thrown together in an attempt to possibly bring in more unearned income. Believe what you want, but this game is lacking quality design people.I will add on this this review when the next update comes along, which will probably be next winter.			"

Early Access Review
								So many things wrong with this and I don't even mean the actual game.- No actual updates to a game that is effectively in alpha and should see changes to its core frequently considering in how rough of a state even the engine is- The so-called ""Nightlies"", unstable versions of the most current code made available every evening, are either viewed as updates or not, depending on what is more convenient for the person that is talking to the community- Developers stated multiple times that anything currently in is just a placeholder when it was first released as an early acces game, yet none of the promised features have even been talked about again since then- Merely having the launcher (which serves no actual purpose) open counts as ""playing"" the game, thus resulting in plenty of inflated game times (I have not even spent half of the time Steam says I've spent on this game actually ingame and at least half of the actual time spent was me testing simple item modifications)- Moderators on the official forums, Reddit and Steam have engage multiple times in censoring of criticism, both regarding the behavior of developers and community managers towards the community as well as the current state of the game and the direction it is heading (if it even is going anywhere at this point)- Quite a lot of money was spent on trying to relocate everyone to a new office in London, which would be a good thing if it was even remotely required to have all your employees in the same location for a completely digital product. This move came with a multitude of problems, as not only was important equipment stuck on a ship(!) in the middle of the ocean for quite some time, but also the only seemingly competent coder on the team was stuck in visa limbo for an extended period These are just some of the problems surrounding the game, not even the game itself.Now the actual game... the only positive thing is that it is relatively bug-free in its current state. Mostly there's nothing that could have any bugs, as in, there is no content. If you are looking at this and thinking it will be Terraria in space, you're mistaken. There are currently three bosses, which are all heavily tiered and either impossible to beat if you don't have the appropriate gear and total pushovers if you do. Beating one rewards you with an item required to unlock the next tier of space, which you are forced to go to if you want to get anything new. And yes, it includes mining up tons of ores for every single tier. The ""space"" aspect, as in moving from planet to planet, discourages building permanent structures on planets, since you will be moving from one planet to another constantly. Since there is nothing on lower-tier planets that you can't also find on higher-tier ones, there's no reason to go back to them either. Even less so when you consider that you also don't need any of the previous resources for later items and blocks. Moving from tier to tier also plays out exactly the same every single time. You arrive at a new planet, beam down and probably get almost oneshot by the first enemy you encounter, as whatever armor you have from the last tier will provide effectively no damage reduction from your new foes. These enemies meanwhile take barely any damage from your old weapons. Thus you hole up and dig down, hoping to find enough of this tier's new ores to make new weapons and armor, at which point you will be god again. You kill the new boss, get the item required to move to the next tier, then return to my first sentence. This progression is supposedly going to be split up into three paths, which are essentially the usual tank/melee, ranged and mage archetypes, as seen in Terraria. However, this is not in the game yet and was last mentioned a couple months ago[playstarbound.com]. In fact the current development focus seems to be entirely on two things: terrain generation, which is the only thing that has been brought up multiple times in recent news posts, and decorative and vanity items. Both things that most definitely should be on the backburner at this point, as there is an already functional terrain generation, but barely any actual interesting content, be it progression-related items that would offer some choice instead of a forced path, well designed enemies and especially competent enemy AI, or a quest system that is more than just a glorified tutorial. The only thing Starbound currently has over its content-heavy predecessor Terraria is modability. Materials, blocks, weapons, enemies, biomes, effectively everything you see can be changed by you with minimal artistic effort and a basic understanding of LUA. However, this is also where it ends. A lot of core structures that would be interesting to mess with are hardcoded, like an enemy's body composition, world interactions, status effect hooks and, mind-boggingly enough, inventory access. This reflects in just what kind of mods are currently classified as containing new ""mechanics"": Minecraft-style tech mods, which deal with a basic power system and ore-processing machinery, as well as some defensive mechanisms. One of the few mods that managed to create something unique with some mind-bending codework, considering the limitations, added ""Bioshock Infinite""-style skyrails within the first month of the game's initial opening to the public - which were added as ""official content"" and the only new content in one of the few updates following that mod's release. Take that however you will.All in all Starbound is at best a promising proof-of-concept, if trying to copy a Metroidvania with building can be called that. It has potential which I firmly believe Chucklefish is not capable of realizing, considering they have failed to even manage a community without banning voices that were offering valid criticism. Avoid at all costs.			"

								Whoo boy, what can I say ? Don`t buy into this yet, possibly at all. Development has been downright glacial and halting. The game itself is, contrary to what is claimed, not in a Beta state. It`s not even in an Alpha state. It`s, and this comes straight from the project heads mouth, a tech demo.The actual gameplay, what is in place at the time of this review anyway, is shallow. So very shallow. Grind ores, grind money, get gear, kill boss. After the 4th boss even that`s gone. And that is more or less it. You can build a base, farm vegetables etc, but there`s little to no point in any of that. Racial differences ? Are going to be armour based in the future and non-existant in the now. Settlements for the majority of the races aren`t even implemented yet.Unless the idea of a much shallower, slightly prettier Terraria clone appeals to you, give this a berth the width of Australia.

								Not as of now. Not yet.There's hardly any significant content and at this pace it seems it might not live up to expectations.Why do people compare this to Terraria so much? Well it's because it fed off the success of Terraria and basically promised itself as Terraria in space with more customization and unique worlds. It still not there yet, far from it.Terraria occasionally released patches, with one guy doing most of it, that added content for free and pretty much added hours of longevity to the game. Seems like Starbound's updates are mostly cosmetic. I really want this to succeed, I really do. However, if you've played Terraria and expect a better experience you won't get it right now. Bosses, planets, systems, dungeons, weapons and items aren't all that interesting and you will quickly grow bored. Customization isn't that varied either.  Basically, if you played Terraria through and through then there's not much in this game that will keep you engaged or surprise you. Wait for the game to be officially released. Keep your cash for now. "

								Visually, Starbound is amazing. The animation is smooth, the lighting engine is GODLY.The problem is that Starbound is shallow and empty. Combat is awkward, the UI clumsy.For all its worth, Starbound feels like it was made by graphics designers. There's randomly 'made' moster sprites, lots of weapons and tilesets, but none of it does anything special. Starbound is COD. A looker, but it leaves you empty.If you want a deep, amazing adventure with excitement and action, play Terraria, or try Crea. Crea's also in Early Access, but the polar opposite of Starbound. It looks a lot less (but still pretty great) but has a lot more mechanical depth in it. EDIT:Let me add something else. Starbound doesn't change over time. Terraria gave you potions and weird weapons, but Starbound keeps being obsessed with mining and crafting. Crafting, however, is clumsy, and mining very boring (other than the pretty tileset). The worst part is that, despite its focus on cool monsters, being underground makes the floaty movement choke on itself. And unless you're hunting for dungeons, there's no reason to be surface-side.Starbound is a sightseeing tour (like I mentioned with COD). Once you've seen the sights, you lose a lot of luster. Destiny is better, because at LEAST Destiny's combat and core gameplay is enjoyable(?).			"

								Chucklefukks lies and broken promises. Do not buy unless you want to be dissapointed by a sub-par terrraria made by a sperglord who wears a fedora and codes ""le ebin may-mays xD"" into the game. Not to mention this game hasn't been updated for 4 months. I bought into this game by funding it $40 when it was still in concept and they have completely and utterly let me down. All my hopes for this game are dead and the cherry on top? I can't even get a refund for the product they didn't even deliver.			"

								Feels like just another crafting chore to me.The random worlds don't give me good environments to roam, but rather uninteresting terrain where I will always do the same mining, and enemies that I handle more or less the same way on every planet.Multiplayer works well, and I understand that this is in early access, but I would not recommend purchasing it at this point. I don't see how it could get better.			"

								I want to like this game. I played a good chunk of it and it was fun. I want to like this game so much. I am incredibly upset that I have to recommend against buying it. I don't want to dislike it, and I suppose I don't; What I dislike is the idea that the game is dead in the water and looks like its going to be that way for... Well... Forever.I got this game before it even came to steam. I bought the four pack straight from Chucklefish's main site. Played around in it, did all there was to do- I even have some hilarious screenshots of bugs that were fixed very early on. It was fun but eventually doing the same basic things over and over got very boring. The progression was basically broken past tier 2 (and there are 10 tiers) and if you wanted to make a nice base you had to luck out and find the right building materials on some planet. Which is fine, it was an alpha, I accepted it.Fast forward to now. Almost nothing has changed. There is a little bit of tweaking here, some touch-ups there, but nowhere NEAR the amount of progress you'd expect from this amount of time. So I went back to their website and a wave of dread washed over me as I saw what I knew was the death knell of this game:Several of the key developers advertising their personal pet project.I heavily suspect they are using Starbound as a financial springboard for these projects. There is literally no other reason to do them besides ignorance. A studio as small as chucklefish can't AFFORD side projects like that, because all they do is take away from their primary project. Either they know this, and we're all being swindled so they can fund their pet projects (which, by the way, will likely be DOA, if not DNF, as most one-man projects turn out to be) or they do not realize this and they need to get their act together and put their personal projects on hold until Starbound is ready for release.I am upset that I have to give this game a no-go. I wanted it to turn out good so much. The concept is here but the staff keeps side-tracking and delaying so they can work on petty dead-end distractions.			"

Early Access Review
								Game NOT recommended.This negative review is a placeholder, and is still in early access.*(*May be subject to change, and may change in any number of different directions. While this review may be a dry wall of text not recommending it now, it could change! Maybe into an exciting picture, an action adventure platformer game, dating sim, puzzle, VN, 3D shooter, blockbuster movie, critically acclaimed best selling epic trilogy of books, or even a positive review! Hype, hype, hype! Features may be added and removed. Such is Early Access. Better like it now, and like it even if it changes, 'cause your stuck with it.)When I got this game in 2013, it was little more than a planetary strip mining sim. Now, it's also an annoying tutorial fetch quest game, too. They had a great idea, but has never gone beyond ""meh"" level for me. The base game should be great alone. My only hope is that modding doesn't die off completely, and modders can make something good out of it. Shouldn't have to be that way on their flagship title. It has not lived up to it's potential or hype.A game is nothing with out its developers. So I don't recommend anything they touch, now, either.Everything in the game is a placeholder as said by the developers. Placeholders are a staple of tech-demos, early alphas, and alpha games, not so much for betas. Some betas may have placeholders, but not as every feature! And what beta game has everything been stated as a placeholder? Only Starbound. Some people paid to playtest, to help them out. What is the point if ""everything is a placeholder""? They can't make a commitment to what will be in the game, or what the game is supposed to be? Sure seems like it. So much for a design document. Keeping that 'secret' only gives them a great excuse to keep doing, well, whatever it is they do. They don't want to spoil the end? Is it going to be that bad? Why even sell it, then? Perhaps the rumors are true. There never was one. Would explain all the changes of story and game direction. Best they have shown is a flow chart. A simple flow chart is not a design document.One of the points of early access is to playtest, bug test, and give feedback. Note the absence of the developer presence on the only legal distributor of the game. The place that hosts the Early Access program that protects them. Everyone has to have Steam to get a legitimate copy, don't they? Don't forget this game had a pre-order, with no definite word if there would even be a beta release, or if there would be anything other than a finished game.(Or even be on Steam.) I'm scared to even think what little broken content there would have been had they released it back then. Good thing they found Early access! It is probably better that we'll never know what a they wanted to sell us originally. There is also is/was the launcher bug that tracks additional time NOT played. They knew about it, and did nothing. It is in the developers best interest to let other people think owners are playing far more than they really are. I only wish this game was fun enough to put 300+ hours into. Not even close. Steam game tracking is notorious for being wrong, but being a smart cookie, you already knew that. Or maybe you have a magic crystal ball of science magic? Then you also know what my other games real times are, too? I have many that have been played but haven't been tracked. I have games that should have even more time on them, too. You must also have that research paper/scientific study done on hours played equaling fun, too. Oh, that one doesn't exist. Sorry.Indie used to mean independent of a publisher. CF is now a 'publisher'. Don't worry, they like to redefine words a lot, as they are a special snowflake. They sold a tech demo/pre-alpha as a beta. One year is soon in chuckle-time. Almost done in 2012. A road map that showed far more completion of things not yet done. Mock-up of things that were never to be in game. A bit of honesty would have gone a long way! Seems more marketing and hype was done, rather than work on the game. One of the worst thing is really all the whiteknighting fans who have no understanding of the Early Access program. They are allowed to troll other fans and attack any feedback that could possibly be negative, even if it isn't. If someone has a problem or idea, they can expect to be attacked. These trolls don't even get a warning. Very poor moderation at best, even when they have their own moderators on the Steam forums, that is. They do come by and do forum cleanups, got to make the forums look 'clean' for a sale or update. Other developers have good and helpful Steam communities. Too bad they fostered the very toxic community they ignore. They must want it this way, as they have the power to change it, but don't.But hey, it's all a placeholder anyway. Wonder if we will ever get the REAL game? Maybe that will be good?Just remember, it's all your fault. Steam and Chucklefish have said so.Two good things did come from Starbound for me. 1) I met a lot of cool friends, (some who like the game, some that don't) many who I would not have met otherwise. Can't put a dollar value on that.2) Looked into the Steam Early Access policy. Learned that it's just some toothless guidelines that allow for developer misbehavior. Steam cares more for it's real customer, other game developers, than the consumer. Some developers have great work ethics and can deliver. The other bad developers are protected, and they get a golden parachute. Only the worst offenders get pulled from the store. Pity, the idea is good, but its implementation has no consumer protection. Perhaps Early Access is in early access, too. Regardless, I won't make another purchase for a 'maybe' game. Saved a bunch of money and disappointment by not buying many program failures. Like: The Stomping Lands, Spacebase DF-9, StarForge, among others. Sucks for the good developers who use the program as intended. If I cant trust Steam and VALVe to stand by the products they sell in early access, I just won't buy them. Simple.Still wonder when I'll get that game that was hyped. What I have now is not that game.TL;DR: For those who don't like to read, online forums tend to rely on the written word. Seems like all forums are filled with words. Why are you even here, then? As for walls of text, libraries and books must not be your thing, then, too? Are you such a vidiot that the presence of written or typed words make you angry? I don't disagree that the reliance on only one form of media is the best rout, as one should seek as many outlets as possible to make a truly informed decision. I don't personally put a lot of stock into youtubers that get free games to test and positively endorse. Nor does peoples monetizations of their YouTube accounts give me any confidence that the goal of the videos is simply to inform... only to entertain and make money. Take everything with a grain of salt, even this wall of text. Yet, information is power. Had I and others known all of the available information that was buried and hidden out there at the time, not listened to people who held only positive opinions, and not seen positively slanted 'lets plays'... many would not own the games now, myself included. Much info was found in hindsight looking for answers that few seemed to have at the time and the developers would not take the time to answer. But why does one even need to spend countless hours researching all of the internet, when a honest developer could lay out an informational bonanza of truth in one place? Seems odd over a game, down right shady, in fact.  "

								If you want to give your hard earned DOLLA BILLS to a comapny that uses them to go on vacations and buy property in london for a SO called office this is the game for you! Chucklefish is by far on par with the production team behind the famed TOWNS failure. taking your monies and then promising updates every month, but only 1 in the last 10 months? i have had this game for some time now and its a joke. you really cannot even progress through it without getting mods to componsate for the lack of a game that is starbound. Its a tragedy to say this game in the same sentance as Terraria when talking about anything besides how unlike and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is compared to Terraria. The chucklefish staff should pull a 180 and get to work, or simple divide thier scam earnings and give them to the hardworking modders who have made this game playable. seriously do not waste your monies, wait and see if they ever get to work. I know its hard to find games like Terraria and MInecraft, there is not many that are good, but do not be fooled by this scam.			"

								Here comes the negative review. Yes a review that has been about 3 months in the making now. Ok, let me start off by saying this game does in fact have a lot of potential. The graphics are really good in my opinion. The building and crafting is fun. The exploration and space travel is a good touch, and the over all feel of the game is great. The problem with all the really good stuff is there are a few things about this game that are currently ruining all the great things it could be.I’ll start out with the playability of the game. The game engine itself is system intense. So much so that even with the game settings set to low the game has a tendency to bog down, or freeze. Yes, this could be my system, so I’m not that upset about it. The problem is with the second and most game-breaking problem with this game. 5 months with no patching, no progress, and no updates as to what or were this game is going. An embarrassing amount of Nothing, I’m not just talking about content patches. I’m talking about anything that is bugged in the game. It’s as if this game has been tossed aside by the game company because it has already made its money. Worst thing is I sense a quick to finished product coming for this game. I’m not talking one that will have all the bells and whistles. I’m talking a game that will be released as done just the way it is currently. No switch character option, no delete character option, no achievements, no performance patches. Because it will be the convenient way of handling things for the company if they’re burned out on make the game, and have already made their money off of it.Truly I want them to prove me wrong. I want some content patches that will fix the bugs that pop up every so often in the game. I want the glitches fixed, and the needed menu options added. In short I want them to show that they’re working on this game. Months, and months, and months of nothing from them to the point of it being a blemish on their company.So please Chuckle Fish if you read this review I would beg you to rectify this situation by (yes I’m yelling) DO SOMETHING. I may change this review if anything worth calling a patch is done, but for now I would recommend people thinking about playing this game to stay clear. It is grossly starting to smell like a dead fish. "

Early Access Review
								I'd like to start out by saying this is a friendly ""Not recommended"". In a lot of ways this game is MUCH better than Terraria, but in a lot of ways it is MUCH worse. Pros:Conceptually nice graphical detail/graphic setting.Graphics and music really immerse you into that planet that you're onLots of content already to craft and findStructures are pretty nice on the planets, but do get repetitive after a while.Animations are great for the quality of everything else.Music is nice and immersiveCons:Painfully repetitive combat. The monsters are essentially the same on every planet, if not the same on two, the next will have identicle monsters. Combat is drastically haulted by the fact that every single monster jumps 45 feet into the air constantly.Depth lacking crafting system that hand-holds you through everything, and takes every bit of the fun out of crafting things. Take a note from minecraft and please revitalyze your crafting engine. It's basically ""Find this, find that, push this button"" where it could be ""Find all this stuff and see what you can make by trial and error!"" The second system would be much more rewarding survival/immersion-wise.Content lacking in comparison to terraria/any game like this. It's just the generic ""iron Shortsword"" or ""Silver pickaxe"" type content. The best thing about terraria was that you could always find something different, unique, and just plain awesome at almost any point in the game. Starbound really needs special tools/weapons/items to differentiate from every single other crafting game in existanceThere's no meaning to this game, no goals, no objectives, no epic loot to look forward to, no new mystifying planets that widely differentiate from the last to look forward to exploring, just a basic point and click crafter. I still really enjoy this game, and see that it has immense potential, but it needs a lot of work to ever match up with terraria or any crafter in the genre.			"

												I have to say, I'm amazed with Starbound.I bought it some years ago just out of duty because I started playing on an old version downloaded from somewhere. Let me clarify that the reason for me to do it was because at the time Chucklefish removed the hunger and environmental hazard factor from the game, which are two major points that would drive me towards a game, but I'm a guy of principles who buys the games he downloads and happens to like. The art was great, but the game heavily lacked direction, feeling a lot like a sci-fi terraria, hugely directionless where you just plopped on a planet, built a nice house, and ransacked other species for decor items and maybe some weapons. I was not impressed.Recently I decided to give it a try if anything because I  owned the game and hadn't taken a look at it since two years ago. And honestly, the game is great now. Not only there's a story, but there is a great sense of progression through quests aimed at improving your character, tech to unlock, and a plot that drives you to explore and push onward.The art is gorgeous, and now that there is a reason to explore the different planets meeting the gajillion of pokémon scattered throughout the game is both exciting and fun. The survival elements are back and although I can see why they took them out of the game, feeling like more of a nuisance than anything involving (there's food everywhere and you'll have no problem staying fed), the element of preparedness and routine gives another dimension to just going down every hole you'll see.The objectives are distinct, and the exploration is tense since you'll have to double back from whatever hole on the ground you dove into and death means losing a huge swathe of items. A lot of the equipment you'll find is more aesthetic than anything, and weapons are kinda meh, but it's super satisfying when you find that weapon combo that works. Action bars are somewhat small but you can switch between two bars, making the overall hotkey capacity alright. The techs are fun and meaningful, getting a morphball or a double jump that greatly helps with exploration, and weapon abilities are varied and useful most of the time.The only problems I really have with the game is that the controls could be a bit better for me, like for instance when jumping down a platform you'll keep on going down subsequent ones until you release the ""down"" button, making it possible to hurt or even kill yourself, or that double tapping in a direction can trigger Dash and send you careening down a hole to your demise. Sometimes you'll also find yourself in some really hard to win combat scenarios, but taking it slowly will help with that so it's not too bad.Overall though, I think it's  a great game and that it has improved leaps and bounds from its SEA phase. The sense of progression is tangible, the settlements are fun, the exploration is intense and the story is nicely told in great pixel art scenes. From an aimless Terraria in space to a proper metroidvania, Starbound has propelled itself to the stars of my library.9/10.			"

												The release of 1.0 has been met with both negative and positive responses; largely negative, as early-access players feel that the game lacks some of the content that previous builds promised. And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with this sentiment. Prior to 1.0, Chucklefish presented us with mechanics like racially exclusive weaponry, temperature variants and even space stations. There was a lot of great content that has since been removed. However, the game still has the potential to change, something that a lot of people fail to recognise.  PROS:- Visually speaking, this is one of the nicest looking pixel platformers I've ever seen. - The crafting system is rich and complex, but does take getting used to. You now have the ability to upgrade your crafting stations instead of building newer models. The scan function on your M.M now means you can craft any item you've scanned prior, which is handy. - Each species gets its own unique ship, armour sets, dialogue and lore (with the exception of the Novakid. Seriously. Where are my Novakid towns, Chucklefish?)- There is a lot to explore, both above and below ground. No two planets are alike. - If you have the incentive, building houses and buildings is a fun and rewarding experience. You can even summon settlers to occupy your builds for you.CONS:- The new HUD and item bar are difficult to use and look ugly. The old one worked fine, and wasn’t in need of a makeover. - Combat swings between being enjoyable and insufferable. The ‘damage on contact’ system is stupid, especially when coupled with the number of monsters that spawn; I’ve had ten of the things on screen, and died because of lag because I was crushed in the middle.- Five years and there’s still no ‘store all’ option for item containers. - The story is weak, flimsy and repetitive. As a sandbox survival game, Starbound is brilliant. There is a lot to see, millions of planets to explore and a great deal of depth to building and creating, as well as the reintroduced hunger mechanic. As an action game, however, Starbound falls short. Combat is weak and laggy (the game has trouble running when there’s a lot on screen) and the story falls flat. Personally, I love this game; I love it because building and creating and exploring is something I enjoy. I’m quite happy to spend an hour or two gathering materials to customise my ship or house with. However, this isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking for a more balanced experience regarding combat and plot, then there are other games which are much better suited!			"

								The lesson for me is to wait until game premiere next time before purchasing.Nothing happenes on the Early Access of Starbound and developers annouce several new games they are working on. I hope at least one of them they will decide to finish...I am sick and tired of listening to developers, who are only active and ""productive"" on their dev blog. Sure, they announce tons of new stuff ""in-progress"", but since February Starbound have not recieved ANY new content. And some features were announced even earlier.They tried to introduce nightly updates, but they are mostly unstable, unfinished and unplayable.I tried several times to ask them about any hint when the next stable update will be released. Its all about excuses: ""oh, we are currently moving"" ""watch! I was working on something today but I've just started this new idea and didn't finish previous ones!"". Ok, guys, but it's SIX MONTHS and nothing changed. Great effectiveness.Stay away from Starbound. They promised too much and didn't keep it. And now they work on new games. Soon they will announce they stopped working on Starbound improvements. Mark my words.3/10(it would be 8/10 if I've just bought it and had no idea nothing is happening on the game)			"

												So I see a lot of bad reviews since the new 1.0 patch. I get people are upset that things got wiped and things have changed. People must also remember that these games go through massive changes to make the game more polished and run/ work better. With that being said here is my review as a new player so far. I love everything this game has offered since the splash screen. My friend and I have completely lost all sense of time and direction while playing this(both of us came from terraria). Amazing soundtrack, gameplay, art style(yes I know it's old school but it's still pretty), crafting system(huge and tons of variation), weapons, clothing/armor. I could go on about all the great things we have seen in just the few hours we have played. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Terraria. I fought a penguin flying an UFO. Soooo yea play it and I promise you won't be let down if you are new to the title. A lot of the older players from early access(or w/e it's called) don't like some of the changes but coming in new you won't know those changes and it won't matter purely because the game is fresh to you. Do yourself a favor and try it.			"

								Not yet.It's fun for the first few hours, but like all games you eventually realise you're in it to finish it.Starbound forces this because it's linear.""But wait!"" I hear you cry, ""It's a sandbox game about space exploration!"".No. It's a linear game in a sandbox. They give you a huge world to explore, and very little to see. Some chests with free weapons (and it's almost always a case of it being a better-or-worse yes-or-no take-or-not absolute), villages where people spout repeated lines and give you stuff for pixels, random encounters where you kill people or people kill you with little to no variation or outcome.To progress, you have to beat the bosses. This requires upgraded armour and weapons, or you're stuck in a hole firing a terrible bow in the most tedious hour long battle ever... This gear in turn requires a lot of mining. Obviously you mine for better minerals, and make better mining gear too.You explore for free stuff, you mine for minerals to upgrade, you beat a boss, you do that 4 times, and then you upgrade a further 5 or so times without beating bosses, just so you can survive. Exploring serves as a nice break from the endless grind, until you know all the encounters, facilities, and villages and can see how meaningless and stale they are. All the planets are kind of the same. Sure, different monsters, different colours, different gravity, different weather... but a forest planet is a forest. The trees might have eyes, or they might look like candyfloss, but they function exactly the same. A desert is a desert. A tundra is just an endless expanse of depressing snow. You want some variety, you have to up and move. Not only that, the starmap interface is horrible, and there's no way of remembering where you were save writing coordinates down somewhere manually, which means that you're stuck with 2 places; your current planet and you home. If you accidentally fly away from somewhere forgetting you didn't have home set well... say bye-bye to your house.So, that's the exploration and progression side of it. What about the building and the decoration? Well a lot of the stuff isn't available to build. You have to ""steal"" it from places (read: dig up the lifeless sites) and scan it to get the recipe or, more often, the ability to pixel print. So in order to make what seems to be 90% of the building materials, you do not in fact craft them with raw materials, but instead refine all your raw materials to magic pixels and then use them to print out everything. Want to make some steel furniture but have no steel? No worries, refined copper will do! Yay for the I-Win Pixel Printer! (In case you missed my cynicism here, I see the pixel printer as nothing more than a device to reduce the number of interesting recipes needed in the game and make it easier and simpler...) Not only that, pixel compression loses you slightly over 30% of the pixels... but dying does too. So there's no reason to not compress all your pixels away and store them for when you want to do mass printing sprees!I understand it's Beta, but I'm concerned regardless. It all seems to be a show for the player. You're the focus of the entire universe. At this stage, it's a linear RPG where progression is enforced by starmap upgrades and later your gear choice. You have to get better to progress, and you have to progress to explore more interesting places and get more recipes. Pixels are a universe XP-like currency for limiting your upgrades if you haven't killed or mined enough. The entire design philosphy is centric around giving the player this final goal to get to (Impervium gear) and eventually, when you're there... there's not really anything to do. It's lost the sandbox, because you've been told to progress all along.Too many games of the last half a decade or so have been centric on surrounding the player and telling them to keep pushing forwards. My suspicion is that it's because if you keep pushing forwards through the forced progression, and then reach the end and treat it as ""done""... then you don't really notice how little of a game there was.So much potential. We'll see how this one rolls and I'll update as appropriate.A rating? I dunno. Probably a retrospective 4-to-6/10.-- Edit from 10th Feb 2014 --With the recent(ish) news of director mode, along with a total rehaul of the sector system/bosses on the eventual horizon, my interest in Starbound is beginning to build once more. It seems they wished to showcase the base features and engine, and the final game will in fact be structured very differently, which is what I was waiting to see. Pre-emptive review is probably out of the question, but once it's released I'll update once again.			"

								I've expected so much of this game. I think everyone did, and that is this game's biggest flaw. I wouldn't usually pin ""overhyping"" an indie game as the developer's fault, but boy did they make promises; and boy did we swallowed them all.However, development and forum's drama aside (there's quite plenty of it, for the gossip-fond people), I still wouldn't consider this game fun or challenging. The good The art direction: this game, if anything, is gorgeous eye-candy. I love the environments, the different races and their associated furniture and the building decoration; certainly the better aspects of the game.The farming and building: So relaxing. I could have just a game made out of building a farm from the ground up if it was anywhere near to Starbound's system. The farming might not be the most complex task and might not have a lot of variety to it, but I think that's where it's charm resides.The exploration: all the different buildings scattered around the planets are wonderful, and give you a nice sense of adventure whenever you break into a lab building or enter the depths of a pyramid. The badThe exploration, 1 hour later: After exploring for a while a few planets, you start to realize something. There's a certain pattern to what are you going to find in the world. Big structure or a city to the left, scattered people to the right, and the planet loops around (which would be in a different situation kinda neat). After visiting once an Apex's city, you already saw everything there is to them. The next one you find is going to have some ""randomization"" throw in, say adding a building or making it longer, but the cookie cutter feel is there.The AI, both NPC and enemies: from a wide range of idiotic to non-existant, the AI leaves a lot to be desired. The citizens in the cities you find have the charm, wits and usefulness of a paperweight, and the same is to be said of the enemies AND BOSSES. I really couldn't care about killing enemies in this game when you can easily outrun them, or just leave them trapped in dirt. The only reason you kill stuff is because the progression requires grinding, which brings me to...The ""progression"": kill mine kill > craft or buy stuff to go new place > repeat. There's not point to the currency in Starbound (pixels) when you can just kill everything and everyone to get new stuff. And getting to a new place/solar system/galaxy/sector just means the enemies absorb more bullets. Not a smarter AI, not a more challenging task, not even better finds: just a longer health bar for enemies. Hoo-♥♥♥♥ing-ray, I guess; that's what I've always wanted.The combat system: you click on things until they die. If you are using melee you need to get closer first, but that pretty much sums up all the combat. We are Terraria, except we are not: What's the point of having mining in this game? There's nothing to be found down there (nothing interesting at least), it's just another part of the elaborated grindfest that composes Starbound. The uglyThere's a lot of drama and finger-pointing in the community, but im not going to dwell into that or the Starbound mods might censore me. Wink wink nod nod.There hasn't been any updates for FIVE months. Why is it even in early access? HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥TEXT WALL Long story short: just buy Terraria. It might not look as beautiful as this game, but gameplay-wise Starbound is a dumbed down Terraria.			"

								Wow. I bought this game the second the beta was released, I had followed it's dev process prior to that for about half a year. It's now been out on beta for approximately half a year, and almost NOTHING has changed. There has been such a long list of promises by the devs, and there have been 0 deliveries. Just daily updates on their website listing what they did that day (Even though it is never implemented into the stable game). On the day I am writing this they added ""big flying creatures"". They promised 3 phases of beta, its been half a year of phase 1, at this rate the game will NEVER see full release, seeing as phase 1 has no end in sight. Chucklefish currently has been given 4 million USD to get this game made, and right now it looks like they just are keeping the money and working on their game at turtle pace with no apologies, or reason for why their progress has been insanely slow. I could write this review for HOURS listing every pointless update on their website and how little they did with their work day according to the update, but that would be a longer novel than every George RR Martin novel combined.Basically Chucklefish is a scam company. They've used their 4 million USD to publish indie titles for more motivated developers so they can sap their profits. They aren't even updating their own game, and I'm waiting for it to just disappear and their company to be rebranded as only a publisher. It's pitiful that Redigit of Terraria could accomplish more in a single day than these clowns can in a week. TL;DR Buy Terraria and avoid this game. It's a long list of broken and unheeded promises made by a company that does nothing all day except use their insane amount of cash from fanboys to play video games and screw around instead of working on their game.

								I can't reccomend this game at all. It has been all but abandoned. I followed this game for years, even before they had a working forum. It has been a total let down and i dont think it will be finished in the next two years. The devs got to exited by all the money they raked in for early access. Some of them moved to a new country and they spent 6 months opening an office.The entire time we hear ""OMG guys we are so sorry, moving and opening an office is hard work!!"". The entire time no progress is made on the game, yet they continue to publish other games and rake in money for that.As for the game iteself... Its buggy, unfinished and very linear for a ""sandbox"" game. Like i said earlier its at least two years out for a finished game to come out of this mess. The only additions to the game are from modders. Any good mod is quickly picked up by the leaching devs and put in the game. So instead of doing any actual work they let modders do it for them. I love Steam, LOVE IT! But this early access game crap should not be allowed unless the dev has a release date planned already.Early release is an easy out for companys for many reasons...1. They get money now.2. They can play the ""it's only a beta"" When it fails horribly.3. They can take as long as they want to work on it now because they are paid.4. You test the game for them AND YOU ARE PAYING FOR IT.The list goes on.In the mean time Terraria has blown full steam forward and is so much more awesome now. Each play through for that game is a pure joy. Use your money for a game were the Devs still care. And save your money for Terraria 2.			"

Game: It's a very basic game, there's nothing to do in the game but fight monsters and build housing. Every single world is the same, there's just pallete swaps.I don't reccommend getting the game in it's current state, as there's absolutely nothing to do in it.The Dev group, moderators, and community I tried to cover everything, but I'm not good with words, I HAVE covered the main aspects everyone has been having problems with in here, so now it shouldn't be as cluttered.Read this for all answers to mostly everything , it was NOT made by me, but I am getting the word out:https://imgur.com/a/QgkPtSide note: https://i.imgur.com/1aoVrb8.pngThis is just the best.I've only two questions:Why are you ignoring people? Where's the update explaining all the issues?I should point out to people ignorant towards what's going on that:They continually do shady♥♥♥♥♥♥ and controversial♥♥♥♥♥♥ then censor people with questions about said shady and controversial♥♥♥♥♥♥ Please, explain to me, if you want the ""trolling"" as you put it, to end, why do you continually do things like this? Someone leaves, nothing is said from you personally, you hire moderators that are/were ban happy and censorshippy as hell, you move to the most expensive place to live, England, you insult consumers and the community (lost my respect on that one, though you don't care.) There's a Laundry list In no way am I attacking, or insulting, being rude, so on. Just a worried customer. Although I don't feel safe putting this here, everytime someone has, you seem to be more ban happy than ever. (or warning happy, whatever.)Examples:~~~Long as hell, but no insults made, faulty ban given regardless of a second account.https://i.imgur.com/N3iDyft.png~~~~~~~~Just how legit are these bans? A coin toss:https://i.imgur.com/Ki8ezBP.png~~~~~~~~This is a legitimate response when you see what they've said:https://i.imgur.com/clXuOGR.pngResponses made:https://i.imgur.com/sIwB3Mu.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/EaEDNQb.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/7Dim04R.png~~~~Response to:https://i.imgur.com/UxoE4Xg.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/XQAw3CQ.pngSo a few toxic people got pissy at the lack of updates, and are now taking what you're saying out of context for their own, I guess, ""self gain.""So you're essentially ♥♥♥♥ing the consumer over because the lil bully on the play yard is spreading lies. You're kidding me right? This is a joke correct? Are you serious? I'm literally taking pauses just to process this, SOME ♥♥♥♥WIT IS BEING AN ASSHAT SO YOU ♥♥♥♥ THE CONSUMER OVER?Alright, just, I'm going to let this sink in to everyone reading this.The developer of the game doesn't want to work on the game or inform the consumer on what's happening because some lil♥♥♥♥♥♥is doing something he doesn't appreciate.Haha, it's almost as if he's making up a fake excuse.Oh wait, it is a fale excuse, nvm, can be safely ignored as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Listen, if you want all this to stop, then stop hiding the truth, stop hiding behind a ban or warning, stop abusing your powers, don't ignore the ♥♥♥♥ing questions at hand:Answer them. Make an update, say somewhere what the real reason is. Don't keep tip toeing around it, it's VERY obvious that's what you're doing, if the truth is that you're no longer working on the game, then just tell Steam you're no longer working on the game, they'll keep it up with no change to it at all, they allow scams anyways. Especially E.A. ones:Proof: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-early-access-games-may-never-be-finished-valve-warns/1100-6420151/But if this isn't just a really ♥♥♥♥ing lucky cashgrab, do the community a favor and put their worries at rest. If you have said something, I sure as ♥♥♥♥ haven't seen it anywhere, especially on steam. Get it at your own risk as Steam allows Scamming. Not just in the E.A. part, but in games in general, such as Towns, Day One Garry's Incident, War Z (Now known as infestation Stories.) and pretty much more than half of what's on Steam.			"

												As someone with a substantial amount of playtime and experience in this, it's morbidly entertaining to watch this get/have gotten progressively worse with each update.EDIT: Starbound 1.0 is out! Come back and do all the fetch quests all over again! This time there's removed content and still a large disparity in balance. There have been some improvements such as scanning objects to your 3D printer now, but they're immediately counterbalanced by setbacks such as needing to (nearly) max out your ship first before you can start custom decorating everything with 3D printed furniture.All variety between biomes and racial storylines have been completely consolidated and forced along linear progression now. The arid, deserted, ded landscape that was Starbound's ""endgame"" is now slightly more decorated, but to compensate, all the other biomes are now as empty as it used to be! Hooray!Oh and don't consider multiplayer until a few months after this when people may get third party multiplayer servers working, the official executable is currently a hot messy pile of insects and arachnids if you get what I mean.

												Game is finally out... but it seems to be rushed and incomplete.version 1.0 is extremely poorly optimized. Game drops to 15 fps and fluctuates wildly depending on your environment. An RX480 is just as good as a laptop GPU.Crafting wise, it seems to have a lot of ornamental things, but actual useful items... not that many. In some 12-15 hours you can upgrade everything you need, leaving you only to follow the main quest.NPC sidequests are rather stupid, take note/resources to some other NPC nearby (if you're lucky) or go to some area in the world and get some NPC back to town. Not sure why they thought ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO type quests will be fun.Given how long it took for the developers to actually release the game, justifying it as ""we don't want to rush it, we want the game to be great, we don't want to offer a half baked experience"", I can't help but think that chuckle when the game starts is a sort of "" you idiots paid us 3 years ago for this game, bet you feel smart now"".Very disappointed by what the game delivered vs what it promised (to be honest, I might have gone past the content if the game wasn't performing so awful).

												First, I recommend checking out Tystarchius' review here, since my thoughts are basically a continuation and elaboration:http://steamcommunity.com/id/tystarchius/recommended/211820Like him, I wish there was a third ""neutral"" option: I can't recommend the game in its current state, but that doesn't make it necessarily a *bad* game. I want to be able to come back to this review in a year and just replace the whole thing with ""edit: nvm"". As it stands, however, there are simply too many flawed design decisions and silly/stupid mechanical mistakes to enjoy it.There are numerous small missteps, so I'm going to just go for the big ones here:* The gameplay loop is broken.Quick definition: Gameplay loops describe the core set of repetitive actions that make a game fun, and are composed of multiple disparate elements. For example, in Doom, you're not JUST shooting monsters; you're also searching for secrets, which lead to treasure, which enhances your ability to shoot more monsters. Stardew Valley has a half-dozen systems that interweave - farming, fighting, socializing - that all positively influence and enhance one another; any given activity provides benefits to other activities, meaning time is never wasted and you're always making progress.In Starbound, this loop is broken, as all of the various systems are disconnected. You can complete the game without ever creating a single settlement, planting a single seed, or taking a single randomly-generated mission to gain a crew member. For some reason, Chucklefish thought this was a *selling point* instead of a massive design failure. Being able to skip entire elements, systems and game mechanics is not good game design! Not only that, but these extra systems are completely superfluous, as they are *less efficient* than the core element of planet exploration. You can just run around collecting the resources, which is usually a much faster method than farming or questing.The point of a gameplay loop is to give the players a break and let them focus on other activities before returning to the main progression. This keeps the game fresh longer and prevents burnout/fatigue, which is incredibly important in long-running games like this. Terraria's gameplay loop balanced this well: exploring (fighting, looting, digging) would lead naturally to the other elements, like farming (critically important buffs from potions) and building (new NPCs at a steady rate need housing), without forcing you to dump more time than strictly necessary if you didn't want to get fancy.* The survival mechanics aren't fun.First, hunger. This mechanic has never been fun for me, and its implementation in Starbound is no different. ""Use a consumable item every X minutes/hours"" is just an annoyance. Fortunately, food is generally abundant (defeating the whole purpose of the mechanic...), but more importantly, more complex and rare foods give you a ton of bonuses, which is pretty fun.However, the Environmental Protection Pack as a gate to planetary exploration is incredibly lazy. It's just an armor slot that unlocks a few more biomes at a time, which are all coincidentally around specific stars. There's nothing interesting about it, just ""oh, I can go to a jungle planet now, which was apparently radioactive before"". This is likely to make each new biome feel exciting and fresh, but instead it just makes them feel uninteresting. This is exacerbated by the fact most mini-biome and ""dungeons"" (including villages) can appear in *any* biome, leading to Floran villages perched between volcanoes, Avian villages set in frozen wastelands, and beautiful flower gardens springing up on eternally dark horror-planets.Speaking of randomization:* The procedural generation is lackluster.This is a doozy. I will grant that the planet terrain generation has improved *significantly* over the years since the first playable alpha, but it's still not as robust or interesting as Terraria's. Granted, Terraria has a few years' head start on Starbound, but it still needs a lot more work to be competitive.My main gripe is that all of the ""dungeon"" spawns are literally identical, down to creature spawns, aesthetic decorations, and even treasure loot tables. (I once found two underground abandoned Glitch dungeons with an EPP mod in the exact same ""random"" corner box.) This means that if you've seen one Hylotl town or Apex resistance base, you've literally seen all of them. There's no mystery or excitement; it's just ""oh, these guys again"". This is pretty much inexcusable, given the game prides itself on randomization and the nature of these changes are trivial. The game generates entire planets! Why are all the dungeons wholly static?! If you need some suggestions, Spelunky released an interactive tutorial that explains how their rooms are put together! Why is this a problem for Starbound?!* Progression and solar systems are goofy.As mentioned above, the EPP is a silly, lazy content gate to different solar systems. I should be able to see icy planets toward the outer edge of a system while those toward the center are hot, and find a mixture of biomes and challenges across them for me to discover if I can or can't handle on my own. Just a handwavey ""yeah you're good bro"" to the next color of star is boring.This also means the planets all feel samey, with some different art assets but the same gameplay. There's no difference between mining on a volcanic planet or a frozen planet, other than getting down from the surface initially. The progression of armor tiers is just basic stat increases, with a very uninspired range/damage/defense decision in endgame. It's the same process to collect ores from every planet with no differences in threat or difficulty once you've reached the appropriate gear tier. It's almost a microcosm of the game itself: dig past the shallow surface and underneath it's the same, over and over again, until you win or get bored.This is where the survival elements could tie in with the colony system, had you any reason to build one. Except colonists don't care if they're on a lava planet or tropical paradise; their quests don't change, they don't ask for structural protections from the elements or anything, they just stand around like every other NPC villager and do little cute things until they're either attacked or have a quest for you. No ""build a weather machine"" or ""help us set up a farm, but the soil sucks because it's a toxic planet"", just ""Billy got lost"" or ""there's a bunch of cultists out by that random lawn chair, can you go investigate?""This review has rambled on long enough, so I'm going to end it here. I critique because I care; I *want* Starbound to succeed and get better, and the only way to do that is to complain - at length - about the numerous problems in hopes someone notices and starts to fix it. Mods will help in the future, but right now there aren't any to address the deep and jarring issues with the base systems themselves. Maybe in a year, it'll be finally finished, but right now...tl;dr pls make game better tia			"

								I'm going to do what others are afraid to do. I recommend this game. Why? because afte reading the reviews I had thought that the game was going to be one of those games where the developers never update or work on that would quickly become stagnant.That may have been true, or it may have been a outright lie told by butthurt people who are mad its still early access, but in short time of playing the community and the developers have been very active on the forums and the game just got a massive update the night I choose to buy it. so you can see how my first impressions of the devs kinda debunks the negative reviews. I even researched to see how often they do these massive updates and its actually pretty often like once every other month.Pros+Huge updates at a good pace+Great modding community+Huge universe to explore+Space ships IN SPACE!!!!+Good but constantly evolving combat+Some of the best pixel art on the market.+Fun with a friend+Easy to RP+Makes you feel like a space rogue (screw han, I shoot first.)+as fun if not funner than over-rated counterpart -cough- Terraria -cough- -cough-Cons-Huge updates at a good pace makes your favorite mods obsolete-Mod community has to constantly update mods to stay relevant-Universe sometimes feels too big-Character creator has options you cant even see when selecting (Im looking at you Underwear Color and Belly button!!!)-Online play would be nice if you didnt have to go through so much to make it work (Port Fowarding!)

Early Access Review
								In a galaxy far far away... where technology can still only render 2D graphics...:::::Intro:::::Starbound has one of the most commited developers I have seen since warframe. They update content constantly and try as hard as possible to inform people of how they went about adding the new content. If you were to put all their posts together it could be the best dev diary of a game yet. :::::Updates and Building:::::The way you build in this game is very intuitive and easy to understand. The amount of content for a beta so far is very large from what I seen in-game and on their website when I was following along their posts. :::::Difference from Terraria:::::What I think sets this game apart from Terraria is the sheer amount of locations you are able to go to each with their own unique feel. So if you want to go to a desert planet or one inhibited by aliens you are free to do so and quite easily at that. Each planet in a sense has its own atmosphere as a result of different soundtracks and unique landscapes and items bound to them. This gives a player a greater sense of exploration on a wider scale seeing as how they will want to travel from planet to planet to see what kind of resources they can gather and use to create various different things!:::::Races:::::Every race has their own planet. Being able to beam to other players ships really encourages multiplayer seeing as how its a fun way to see what other races have constructed on their own unique planets. :::::Conclusion:::::If your looking for something like Terraria but on a much greater scale with NPCs, quests, and a hunger for exploration you should look no further than Starbound.Warning: Some people are referring to this game as Deathbound due to difficulty.

												I've waited 4 years for this game to come out.I was really devastated to find out they succumbed and released it out into the Early-Access, because it was around the timewhen Early-Access was getting a lot of love, and only so much hate. This was before stuff like Towns development stopped and stuff, people didn't yet see the trouble in it all.Well, it came out there, and I played it, along with others. I walked around, I killed things, I did the lame penguin boss fights.I was unimpressed - Rightly so I would think, it's not fully developed yet, it's not released, I couldn't judge it well in it's state.I noticed things were getting added by community requests, and this is where I started to shy away from it, I didn't want to see what was gonna be one of my dream games, altered and messed around with by the community - for good or worse.So I ignore the dev blog from there on out, and waited my extra, I guess two years.Lo and behold, right there on Steam, it's out.Let's give this a proper go.(ignore 30 hours of gameplay, that was with the betas, my actual playtime is no more than 17 hours, also, Steam didn't have enough space for my full review, I trimmed where I could)The intro to the game is very slow and sluggish, it gives you the basic tools you need to get started, and you start mining away at the surface for goodies and oddities, pretty classic compared to another game of this genre. I amassed my metals and my tools, made myself new weapons and armors, and got to more killing.Then your first real quest is to go really deep into the planet, get a certain type of material, and teleport to the ""hub"" of the game.Well god damn if that didn't take me forever, it didn't feel that exciting.After you find out about the hub, you find out you have to mine moons for fuel to jump tonew planets out of your reach. Might sound cool at first, but it gets annoying very fast.You tend to hop planet to planet mining the next tier of resources, and making stuff, but withinthis whole mess, you have to go around to certain planets, and find each of the six races and their civilizations, and go into SCAN mode, and start clickingaround for green highlighted objects, and talk to people, to learn more about them, and eventually get the next Mission to go on.The Missions are like adventure instances, a pre-made map with an objective and puzzles with monsters all over the place.They're fun, but after you do a few of em, you just want it to stop. They lose their interest quickly, when the bosses later turn into bullet sponges, few of them are unique with cool fights.The main storyline itself just felt, too forced. I thought this was sort of a primarily exploration and sandbox based game. Well, multiple aspects and shops etc. are blocked from you, until you progress enough in the storyline, so it feels forced and boring rightoff the bat. Normally to me, this would have been fine, but this felt unnecessary and everything else just gets flat because of it. (It gets really annoying trying to find the proper planets to just scan some more and more)Onto the gameplay aspects and mechanics, progression in the game is done by crafting. You craft the first tier of armor and weapons, and then you tend to go find new, randomly generated weapons to kick♥♥♥♥♥with, and crafting new toolbenches and armor to go along withthe new materials. It's a little sad, being that making your own weapons is a waste of time, because all the strong - and unique - ones are all out there in the universe, not on your crafting screen. There's only a few tiers of actual equipment as well, it's very short lived. By 8 hours into the game I had already acquired what seemed to be the best armor out of the materials you find in the game.Onto the UI of the game, it's just, annoying. I don't feel like it's presented very well, it could have been much cleaner. Opening your inventory always gave me a headache, as it opens right in the damn middle of your screen, blocking your character and things around them.You can move it around thankfully, but it doesn't maintain that position the next time you open it, so it's just a constant struggle trying to open it up in the field. There's a sort function for it thankfully, but not for chests, which gets very annoying, becausethere's simply so much♥♥♥♥♥♥you pick up in the game, that you need to constantly reorganize it all if you're picking it all up.With chests not being able to be sorted, it just causes you a whole hour of frustration, trying to reorganize it all.The difficulty of the game is modest. When you make your character, you have the choice of Casual, Survival or Hardcore.Casual has no real penalties for dying, you only drop a small percentage of pixels, and you can just walk on back and get right back to it.Survival seems to be the ""normal"" difficulty, you need to eat to survive, you drop certain items on death, and you drop more pixels.Hardcore is Survival, included that, when you die once, you're dead forever.In the end, I honestly just felt stupid for playing Survival, my other friends just chose casual because, having to keep up with food all the time just sounded like an annoying chore. It really was. I would constantly just be chowing down whatever I found to keep my meterhappy, and the drop items on death penalty just made it all the while more boring.There's a lot of other little attractions here and there, you can own a farm, and make shipments (homage to Harvest Moon I would assume), there'sa Pokemonlike capturing system for pets. Upgrades to your ship along with crew. Vehicles to ride around in (though, no promised mech sadly), little challenge rooms out in the world.They're neat, though ultimately, I never gave em a chance. I got my hotrod and rode around and that was that.Sadly, there's a lot of bugs in the game, more than I was betting on. Food sometimes became infinite, planets generated too slowly for me to traverse, and I've had the game crash on me and freeze several times when I'm just moving about.The FPS however, takes the cake. It would CONSTANTLY keep dropping and screwing up, I looked around and tried the fixes people suggested, andto no avail, and I typically don't have technical issues with games on my end, so this was a huge concern of mine. Dropping to 30 frames when just walking around, really sucks.Graphicly/Aesthetically, it's awesome, and the soundtrack is amazing along with it. Good listening in and out of game.All in all, at the end of the day, the game feels like it's just a bit of a repetitve cycle with no clear reward at the end. Hop from planet to planet, hoping to find something cool next time, and get annoyed that you have to keep mining fuel to continue on. I beat the game, and it just didn't feel satisfying in the least.I've felt like I haven't covered enough about the game, but at the same time, I can feel (and see) that I've written too much already.I don't feel like this game is a worthy spirtual successor to Terraria, as some would like to claim. I had that notion back when it was indevelopment, but no more. I just see this as another blotch on my game list that I want removed.If you read through and at one point just said ""but there's a mod for X"" or ""wait for an update"". Then no, and no.The player shouldn't have to resort to mods to fix an issue, and I've done plenty of waiting, I thought one of the points of the betawas so they COULD fix things, and polish it all up. Sadly, it still feels quite raw and buggy, and just not worth my investment. I don't want to wait around longer for things to get better - That was suppose to be now.I dunno if the wait was really worth it is what I'm getting at.tl;dr This is a one way trip out into space. Wether you want to stay up there, or land somewhere else, well, you might get displeased either way.			"

								Starbound is an excellent 2D exploration game.  It contains features from Terraria, Borderlands, as well as many original and unique attributes. You get to explore a vast galaxy of randomly generated planets.You can raid colonies and dungeons for their loot. You can quietly farm on a safe forest moon and explore the galaxy for crops.You can play as a cute pink flower person that eats people and shoot robotic knights on robot horses with a laser cannon.10/10			"

								With extremely uncommon updates that focus on adding more and more useless crap instead of improving gameplay, lackluster world generation that can't produce anything interesting aside from a few pre-made dungeons, poor optimization and devs who are dedicated to multiple projects at once, I currently cannot recommend this game to anyone but roleplayers - it sure is a pretty chat room. Starbound has a huge potential, but if you want a fun, randomized side scrolling adventure with building and crafting, better stick to Terraria for now.			"

								I'm gonna have to not recommend this game. On further note, it is early access and not finished. The game just doesn't really feel right to me, in my opinion its more of a clone of your standby games that say to be sandbox. Its feel is just ""weird."" Sorry to say, I just wouldn't recommend it for the price, I would say to buy it to support the developers. Other than that, the game is pretty solid for an early access, the game plays out a lot better with friends.			"

There are far larger and more complex games that have been developed in that timespan by fewer people. These people have taken the 2 million and run for the door. The game simply is no longer being developed and has been utterly abandoned by the development team. Bad investment. I will never do early access games again after this. What a scam.			"

A Brief History of Chucklefish and the CommunityFirst, people complain when the stable updates are too frequent to keep your save for very long.So, in response, they change their updating routine and create a nightly channel to see a snapshot of their progress every 24 hours.Nobody switches, ♥♥♥♥♥ing commences because they don't see any progress and assume the game is dead.In response, the dev team starts frequently blogging in order to show everything they've been working on, including the arduous task of refactoring code (which is very important, but you can't have snazzy screenshots to show for it)People don't read the blog, and proclaim that the game is dead.Those that do read the blog complain that the latest releases are buggy.Entitled gamers want everything now.Where is that picture of a triangular diagram showing fast, stable, and fun with the caption ""Pick Two""?Christ almighty people, you can't have frequent updates, have those updates include lots of features, and have them be stable. Either be patient, or help them bugtest by playing nightlies. Otherwise you'll leave them no choice but to halfass the content!What's that? The game? Oh, yeah, I think it's pretty good. I like the setting and character design, the procedurally generated content is impressive, and it's been getting better over time. If you're into voxel-like survival/design games, then this is a good choice. "

								The game looks much more amazing than it actually is. After the initial fascination you are quickly met with the very bland nature of this game. It's very barebones, similar to the first iterations of minecraft survival mode or the first release of terraria, if not less.Developing leaves much room for improvement, as the developers seem to spend more time tweeting and blogging about their COOL NEW AMAZING STUFF™ or whine about the upset customerbase instead of developing the game. When you see all the  ""previews"" they post daily in their blog you are excited at first and according to their roadmap the game should be about 90% finished. Yet there's not even half of the features implemented. Most of the screenshots are simply mockups, luring you with content that doesn't exist yet.This game sells solely on empty promises and mockup screenshots for now. I definitely don't recommend buying it yet and strongly advise you to hold off until Chucklefish actually has a plan on where they want to head with this game and it actually feels to become a game.UPDATE August 2015:It's been a year. They still haven't added anything significant, just more useless furniture. Meanwhile guns are still underpowered, mining yields no advancement past the first stage and planets are still shallow resprites with no interesting aspects. It still completely lacks mechanics, story, progression etc to make it a game, it's still a techdemo-stage sandbox without gameplay.			"

								I followed this game for a long while. Checking blog posts on their main sites daily. Squealing over every single update. It looked smexy. The music was smexy. The hype was real.Heck, I even remember when the devs posted this video claiming it was their actual official trailer.

It was wonderful And when I first played, I can fully say I enjoyed my time. However, it did lack something that kept me from getting really into it.And so I waited. and waited.Update after update.All I can say is, that feeling of emptiness... like an incomplete game... it is still there; if not more strongly than ever.I feel that the progress and development of this game stagnated and slowed a long time ago, despite the constant updates.Don't get me wrong, the art and the music is still fanhioaejgajfafFgnbAfOMG <3, but it's everything else that doesn't quite click.Things that make me cry They removed the survival elements, so it's pretty much just exploration with little consequences. There used to be food, temperature, but none of that anymore. Apparently they're adding it back in for 1.0 so that's really kewl. <3 They said you would be freeeeeeee to explore. But you are restricted by quests to pretty much unlock all the important stuff. So you have lots of boring fetch quests or otherwise combat quests to even bother to progress. It feels unnatural and forced; these quests feel like a wall between you and the super cool stuff like big ships and stuff. That might be alright, if the combat didn't feel dreadfully awful, and if the mining wasn't 'grindy'. Hitting and killing enemies doesn't feel as satisfying as Terraria. The combat update did little to address this, there is not a lot of feedpack or impact when you do hit things with your giant future sword or awesome space shotgun. Just a little crinkle which I presume is the monster dropping gold, and poosh, nothing. Every monster feels the same, and is it just me, but where are the procedually generated monsters? You could bring up the arguement that the system just created similar monsters with the same components, but surely that's at least a bit better than seeing the same 'unique' monsters that spawn?This probably explains it better than I do. Planets all feel the same, and besides, you're just there to mine anyways. The planets feel copy+pasted honestly, and exploration becomes repetitive; eventually, all you'll do is pop onto a planet and mine. And the underground is nowhere as near as interesting as Terraria's, no matter how many dungeons they implement... it just doesn't have that charm. Although modding for this game is clearly an awesome and redeeming feature, I don't think that modding should have to fix the game. Playing without mods soon gets bland, and without them, there are problems within the games that aren't addressed. Such as contact damage with enemies even though they have attack animations I don't even mrgrgr.The idea of building a base among the stars. A planet claimed to be yours. A fortress filled with every single cool lil' trinket you found on your stellar voyage! It excited me. But I soon came to realise that base building was ultimately useless. The universe is ultimately harmless, and you have a ♥♥♥♥ing spaceship to put stuff in.As this game is nearing release, my hope for this game ever fixing the problems that stick out like a sore thumb are slim. Despite all this time in early access, the glaring issues I saw since 'release' are still there. But it's not like this game is horribly bad or anything. As mentioned, the art and music are wonderful, and the environments feel immersive and beautiful! But the combat system, the lack of freedom due to quests, the repetitive and boring exploration, and the overall blandness of the mechanics weigh it down.In my eyes, the content of this game, that seems to be praised, is measured by lines of dialogue and fetch quests.If you're going to play it with a friend, go ahead, you'll have heaps of fun with the beautiful worlds that will be generated for your space shenanigan adventures. Just don't expect much when playing alone.In my personal opinion, I would give it a 6.5/10. But I know there are lots of people that love this game a helluva lot, it's just that I, as a long-time fan, felt really disappointed in the end.If anybody is going to criticise me for the lack of hours I have put in, do take note that I used to play this on another account and have clocked in more hours than just 15.

								Incomplete game that coasted to the top on hype and is now taking a long downward slide towards oblivion.  After years of promotion, promises, and stringing along, you still basically get a shell or an engine with little to do.  99% of worlds are empty and boring, villages and interaction with NPCs is weak and boring, combat is still glitchy.    The game is basically a short grind for resources followed by a boring end game of exploring mostly empty worlds.   Stick with Terraria or Minecraft if you're looking for a game like this. Never buying early access again.			"

												Played this game all the way from its inception and I have to say I am dissapointed with the final product in relation to the time they spent on it.The problems are not with what the game is, it is a good game. It is what it could have been and to me the final execution feels rushed. So many reworks, I think they tried to achieve perfection and got tired with it and in the end released a ill thought out rushed game. Ok here are my main problems.The questline and story they added is terribleThe main questline features a few basic starter tutorial like missions to get you into the game and then basically has you repeat the exact same quest 6 times before facing a final boss. It is always worrying when the tutorial missions are more interesting and fun to play then any other part of the game. It is also so crazy short. I completed the game in 2 days with little effort which links in to my second issue.It is very easyThis is basically down to progression not being linked to the questline. Once your out of the starter missions and  you have repaired your ship, you can basically get a a top tier weapon and armor before actually doing any of the main questline. Progression in starbound is not bound to the questline or story. I think this was a design flaw. Sure you can just pace it yourself, but the even bigger issue is this my next point.You can basically mine everything you need to progress to the next tech tier in one mining runSo for example, when I unlocked tech to let me visit the fiery or frozen stars, basically the stars that had everything but the final ore, I was able to mine enough of every single resource needed to completely max my tech out in one trip. I was able to get enough materials to get all three of the end game armor sets and crafting stations. From one run. Then when you unlock the final planet ore, again one run gives you all the solarium you need to finally max out your armor and anything else you need. Thats it game is pretty much done. You should have a god like weapon by now as they can literally spawn in the most basic of chests anywhere in the game. So if you havent already beaten all the bosses, go and jump about spamming fire and complete them. Thats pretty much it which leads me to my next issue.I dont see any reason to play on once completedYou may differ with me in opinion here, but I really couldnt see any point in going back to play any more. I mean the fun is in looting and exploring right? So once you have unlocked the hardest difficulty planet there is no point in going to any others as the reward is worthless to you at this point. The side missions and 'town/villages' they implemented with npc missions are utterly pointless. Very low reward for doing repitive tedious missions. So basically 90% of the games worlds are no longer worth visiting at this point. You already have godlike everything which you found in the first chest you encountered on one of these planets. What is the point? I really hope I am missing something here but this was my experience of it. Sure you can max your ship out, sure you can try to build a colony, it all just feels shallow and completely pointless. Like features people wanted which they just added without any thought in relating it to the rest of the gameplay.I played terraria for weeks and actually found bits of it tough, I dont think I ever saw everything and the final boss was difficult for me and took me quite a few attempts.I honestly finished starbounds final release in two days and never really had any problems dying.What could they have done?Make looting make sense. So rubbish loot on the surface, better loot for quest rewards, more rare items the deeper you go etc. Make an end game where early game planets are still relevant.Make other game features like ship and colony building relevant and necessary for the main game questline.Actually have a decent questline with variation in missions and a lot, lot, lot more of them.Increase overall difficulty of pretty much everything.The final 4 tiers of ore are basically split on 2 tiers, 3 of them having equal weighting on a lower tier and then one final ore which lets you upgrade each of these 3 tiers to a final tier (we are talking armor and weaponry here). This was a clear of sign of rushing to me. These should have been four seperate upgrades instead of two. And so much more I could write all night but I am not going to.I have to ask myself, what did they spend well over a year on? I played ti with my friend before and we actually spent a good week on it and I remember having a lot of fun. There were not any quests and maybe one or two bosses I cannot remember, but the progression made more sense and the game was tougher. I remember actually struggling against mobs at points, we actually had to do the old build a wall around us with a peep hole to shoot out of trick to actually get through some of the tougher areas. Loot made sense as well, like it was actually worth exploring and looting stuff. What happened guys? I thought this was gonna be the game that kept me amused for months when it was completed.I could have beat ruin with my eyes closed.TL:DR In summary this is a fun game and an enjoyable experience, its just too easy, too short with a lot of worthless features adding nothing to gameplay and most damaging for it it has no replay value at all once you have beaten all the bosses as the game design makes 90% of the game worthless after this point.

Early Access Review
								(UPDATED 1/22/2016)If you want to see my old review, feel free to scroll down until you see the word ""Wow.""So it seems that the folks at CF have [finally] did a bit of necessary tweaking to the game and -- since my curiosity was peaked -- I decided to revise my review.Like last time, let's go over the key features:•6 playable racesWe were promised 7 at the beginning of the fundraiser, they have finally touched up on that. Racial traits like they discussed still seem to be absent.•A procedurally generated universe with unlimited procedurally generated planets After a while, it feels as if it's a copy/paste of the last planet you were on.

And I really hate to say this, since the game has lots of potential, but it's going to be -VERY- repetitive after a while. My recommendation? Grab a few friends, fire up Hamachi or the starbound server, get a Skype call going, and just enjoy the vanilla version of the game. By no means am I saying this is a bad game, but it could be SO much better. Save your money, folks.--Wow.Two years and four million dollars well invested, CF.For the low, low price of $14.99, you can buy a barely finished game (and has been that way for about a year now) that has little to no updates!Let's look at the key features, shall we?•6 playable racesWe were promised 7, they still have yet to follow up on that, along with the racial traits still untouched•A procedurally generated universe with unlimited procedurally generated planets After a while, it feels as if it's a copy/paste of the last planet you were on.

Unless were talking PC/console/handheld multi-platform, then is that a key feature.On a final note: I get that this game is in development. It has been for a year, which really holds no excuse as to why this game is terrible. I remember pre-ordering this game and being REALLY excited. You can imagine how disappointed I was after sinking $60 for my pre-order. For $5 less, you can buy Terraria (Which is actually a complete game! Imagine that!). Kind of shocking what you can do when you're not taking the whole dev team vacation after you release a sad excuse for a beta, eh?But, as promised, I will revise this review once the game is out of beta. If and when.			"

								So this was kinda a waste, also killed my willingness to ""pledge early"" or anything of the like. Loads of potential, barely touched upon. Planets are tiny and repetitive, only way to progress is to move to a new planet every few levels(which kills any reason to build a base) and really it just kind of feels empty, or souless compared with Terraria. Maybe time will fix it though, who knows.			"

								While this game looked incredibly promising early on, the developer has not released much in the way of content or updates. Many of the initially promised features of the game have failed to materialize over the year that it has been in beta, and the game world feels very dry and uninteresting.  If you are under the impression that this game is ""Terraria in space"" as I was, it is a very long way from being anything like that. I still hold hope that in the future this game will live up to it's initial vision though I would suggest waiting until it is fully released before investing any more money in this developer.			"

								This review was posted by Vilos Cohaagen.Vilos Cohaagen cannot not recommend Starbound for several reasons1. Terrible communication: The developers are awful at telling people what to do and seem to ban people from their forums or the steam community threads for asking reasonable questions. Frankly at this stage I think Kuaato should be put in charge.2. No updates in months. Just like Quaid...3. Obvious that the developer Chucklefish has switched their attentions to other more exciting projects. As the exploitative mining overlord in control of all of Mar's Turbinium reserves I can understand that. 4. The game is unfinished in so many ways, but mainly it isn't fun yet - there just is not enough to do. Sure it looks promising, but promises are empty words to this steel-hearted Mars colonial administrator...5. All indications are that they are going to cut and run like Towns did. Just like that fool, Richter. Always screwing up my plans.Vilos Cohaagen regrets backing this game and has now sworn to only buy finished games.Time to kill some goldfish.Vilos CohaagenMars Colony Administator			"

								While it's not the worst game in the world, I have a hard time recommending it when the developers have been extremely unprofessional and have reneged on many features they promised during the initial funding drive. The game has also made little progress since the initial release last year.I'll change this if any progress does happen, but since the developers accept no criticism and the community has purged itself of all non-believers I have a hard time thinking anything significant will come of the ""1.0"" release set to happen on the next update.

								Fun at first, then it get's quite boring... ...and confusing. I mean, I know how to go to other planets but really, what's the point? I love the idea, but it feels pointless. It doesn't make it more appealing to play knowing the fact that it'll take ages to start. It barely gets any updates too.  I regret buying this, sadly. Hopefully it gets better when it's no longer a realy access game, but I can't recommend this one right now. I'll update this review later on when the game is no longer early access, probably some time after it happens though. 3/10, has potetial to get a lot better...honestly, I think we might have Half-Life 3 before this is out of early access.I wonder if Steam support would be nice and allow me to refund it, even after, uh, 2 years?

												Its Come a long way from early access. the process was a little drawn out in length, but the end product is by no means a bad game. If you are sold on the concept go for it, but... Its got its problems, and they need to be addressed because they take away ALOT of what the game could be. Meanwhile, theres a rather large Mod Workshop for what you probably deem annoying or bad. Just be sure you friends have them too. tl;dr: A review with high concentrations of salt and shattered hopes from the ages of early access. Mainly a giant checklist of problems or things that would have made the game alot more entertaining than it currently is now.Anyway, prepare for a VERY long list that im probably going to be updating pretty frequently. Poor Optimization aside... SHALLOW GAMEPLAY. Wiring is the most complex mechanic in the game. Gameplay outside of questing Is generally chalked up to 'mine X Ore to make X Gear'. When your gear gets outdated, you do it again with a different ore. The End-game consists almost entirely on building things since exploration doesn't mean much; and after awhile you're going to get tired of building. Easy End-game. With the exception of people, Nothing end-game poses a considerable threat to you. They are just a minor annoyance. you can heal at any time, almost instantly. Exploration isn't especially exciting.Same dungeon layouts, same swamps, same villages, and mostly the same terrain/biomes. part of what makes an open world game exciting is diversity. This game needs more. alot more. Or to atleast expand on the biomes that are already there. Mech's never saw refinement/rebalancing;they were REMOVED when they could have been implemented for higher level planets that required greater life support beyond an EPP. They are revamping mechs in a future update for more hostile planets. A planets danger level is linked Directly to its global biome. End-game adventuring is aimed at 'scorched' or 'volcanic' planet. Other planets will not be worth exploring. At all.This does cripple end-game quality, in addition to what already plagues it. EPP's require no power. EPP's do not require Oxygen. --- maybe its just a peeve of mine, but i don't necessarily think you should be able to go planet-side for an extended period of time without any need to manage your life suport. Would give an actual need for airlocks on airless planets, in addition to making standard gameplay more interesting. Minimal point in building a crew. They don't do much but stand in doorways, follow you and block your crafting stations.When Planetside, They hardly follow you a couple of yards without dying or getting snagged and needing to teleport to you. For the most part, they cant even keep pace.The only thing you will ever want are engineers, who raise your fuel efficiency to 100% and nullify the need for fuel... Which in in itself is a questionable mechanic to have. NO POINT AT ALL in building colonies or doing quests.  Colonists will give you a boring and mundane series of chores to complete and then reward you with somthing you probably just scraped off your boot and put in the trash 5 minutes ago- with the rare exception that you get somthing you actually could use. whole lotta dishes...But...They have a lot of food items, and i think thats cool, But there isn't hardly a point in making them. The buffs you get are pretty minor and last for a pretty short time. Because of the effort needed, you just end up sticking to canned food or rice. You can either buy fuel or obtain it from moons.  For some reason, fuel and *only* fuel can be found in massive abundance on these moons. They  added a mechanic to fuel gathering to make it more interesting, But it still feels a bit like a chore. 'Casual' players do not need to reach the surface in order to beam back to their ship. Maybe its just me, but I really hate that. You honestly might as well not even have the other character settings. At any time, another player in your party can warp to your ship and break or Steal anything they please.This one is kind of a big one. There are NO private containers except for your own pockets or whatever hidden planet stash you jealously guard. Nothing in your ship is safe.  No Race Diversity. One of my biggest problems with the game.The freaking FISH people can't breathe underwater.The Florans can't supplement their food/energy with a little photosynthesis.The Glitches- who are ROBOTS- Don't need electricity. They can suffocate and have to EAT.Novakids don't glow in the dark despite being made of glowing gas.they totally do.Races do not have different Diets or foods that they have to avoid eating.Honestly, everyone might as well just be  human. Novakid. Needs more creature diversity. in all the universe, why am I still encountering the same pre-made creatures? why can't I fight any giant creatures? Storyline is... meh.  im not spoiling much by saying that it's your standard 'only you can save the universe' story. Nothing in space to explore.No debris fields, no fuel stations, No ships, No research vessels, no space colonies, nothing.No, Outposts/asteroids don't really count. The only thing (that was added recently) that helps this were the vaults... Which really don't hold that much treasure and are filled to the brim with recycled mobs.As it turns out, they are adding more on the concept of space travel in a future update. No meaningful reason to Mine ore beyond crafting armor......Unless you are very desperate for money. Mostly Useless tech upgrades.  They actually REMOVED alot of useful Techs. Remember Bubble Boost? Energy Shields? Health Regen? Gravity Sphere? Not there anymore. and no matter how many times you skim over what remains of the tech upgrades, your standard techs are almost always going to be the spikey sphere, Blink Dash and the Multi-jump. Most other Dashes are nearly USELESS since the dashes don't move very far and grants no invulnerability frames.everything else has limited usability, both in concept and practice. Nearly all staffs except for staffs with 'Energy Restore' or 'Health Restore' are  USELESS . Staffs are hardly a vaild weapon choice seeing as you need to charge them for an uncomfortably lengthy period of time, during which you are slowed. The projectiles they shoot are rather unwieldly, being just as likely to crash into the terrain AROUND your target.Going back over staffs, ive actually found them to be my prefered weapon of choice. some spells are hard to aim reliably, but they just need a little more technique than the rest of the weapons. Somewhat uninteresting loot. Any loot you pick up just isn't too interesting. Theres Variety, sure, but its mostly cosmetic.Astoundingly more often than not, the alternate skill on a weapon is either impractical or has rather limited situational use. There are only three skills i found useful or fun to have: Rising Slash, Giant Sword (which can be used as a light source) and Flurry. HoverBikes Need work. Unless you took the time to flatten a good bit of the planet's surface (which is pointless unless you plan on building there), prepare for an uncomfortably bumpy ride where you have to step out of the vehicle every 24-yards or so and either carve out a path for yourself, or just pick it up and drop it on the other side of a mountain. Earth was the *only* protectorate planet? This is more of a nitpick with the story but...That was Seriously the only protectorate planet? There are no other outposts or colonies that protectorates were stationed? I thought that the protectorates were a big deal, why do they have no presence whatsoever in the universe?			"

Although I know they are still working on the game (At a snails pace) there is no excuse for this lack of support. The forums will shun you if you speak your mind and theres no way to really make suggestions without people ♥♥♥♥ing up your face. It was a great game at first, it started off how I thought it would, now greatly dissapointed I warn you about this game. It's not a shity game by any means, I loved this game at first. However, as it is, you will get bored very fast and you will regret your purchase. Perphaps in the future, when this game has many more updates, I will pick it up again and eat my words.			"

												All of my friends and my wife absolutely loved terreria. I didn't. By the time I decided to give it a go, everyone was so far ahead that I never got to experience that exploration, dicovering things for myself aspect of the game. Now, I am totally getting that from this game. I get to not only explore my own starting world (where I have built a pretty cool colony) but I also get to travel to other worlds and meet other civilizations and colonies. I am having a blast.Now a terreria vetran may still tell you that this game isn't as good or whatever but it certainly is special to me. I am really enjoying sinking time into it.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been enthusiastically following this game ever since they announced it with cool screenshots of Space Marines in a Space station boarding a dropship and pictures of planetside mechs and so on. The focus of the game has substantially changed ever since which is not necessarily bad - but a lot of design decisions since then disappointed me. When the game started as early access in December 2013, I was really looking forward to play it. However, I already had to stop trying it when it turned out that I couldn't reconfigure the keys. I opened a thread on the forum and it turned out that a lot of people asked for key rebinding as well. Some of the fanboys told us it would come with the next patch. Guess what, it didn't. Just like many other features promised, it was never realised. Almost ten months later they have not been able to implement a key rebinding interface even though they know a lot of their customers need it to play because they are not used to WASD. All you get is the usually pi**ed off hint that you can tweak some config file and practically reprogram the game yourself. So is this a negative recommendation just because of a missing keybinding interface? No. It still is an early access game and keybinding will probably even come in the final version (if there will be one ever). But the real problem here is an obviously incompetent team of programmers, who dont give a damn about their community. Instead they come up with lame excuses why they it takes them incredibly long to achieve minimal progress being employed by tons of money, the community paid them. One of my favourites was that they moved to a new office to another country to enlarge the chucklefish company. Yeah, wouldnt be surprised if the new office is on some nice beach and the staff extension was hiring a waiter for the cocktails. This is a deterring example for the risks of investing into early access software - you might like the idea, but you dont know if the team can accomplish it. In this case, it really looks like they cant and my money was wasted.			"

Early Access Review
								In the beginning this game had huge potential and upside and I played this game extensively when the beta was released. Not much has changed since then (gameplay wise) and the game lost its initial appeal. DO NOT waste your time and money on this. Planets and biomes are pretty much the same with nothing unique to them, the fight mechanics are stale, tier system is garbage and boring because of the constant grind to get materials, this game pretty much lacks alot of content. There is no point in building a home or base or anything for that matter since you just end up moving on to different planets. The developers promised to add many unique and special things to make this game stand out but those were pretty much empty promises. After a VERY long wait this game has gone nowhere with nothing new to make it better. Every now and then I check multiple forums to see how far this game has progressed and always end up disappointed as no progress has been made. There has been no substantial update since December. The developers moved to Europe to be near each other in order to work on the game efficiently and push updates faster. What a huge lie. They pretty much took all the money they got from supporters and ran with it. This game has no future and no hope of ever being finished. Like most people said, this game is forever stuck in beta (if you can even call it that it feels like an alpha) and will never finish. Initially the full game was expected to be released in 2013 but after a multitude of excuses and empty promises I gave up on this game and so should you. Starbound and its developers are a huge joke and scam and as I said before save your time and your hard earned money for something better.			"

								As someone who followed the game before it was even officially named and just a mystery side project Tiy was reported working on. I can say that this game was a massive letdown on many levels. Back when we first got access to the ""beta"" I was beyond hyped to begin actually playing, but I couldn't shake that slow sinking feeling as I went through bland dungeon after dungeon exploring in the vain hope I'd find something genuinely interesting, exploring worlds didn't help matters either, funny for a game claiming to have a near infinite amount of worlds, that 90% of the ones I explored felt so samey. Even though the game is still in early access, I feel little optimism for the future of Starbound with the dev's focus being so weak. I advise anyone interested in this game to just watch from the sidelines and to not consider a purchase until Chucklefish pulls themselves together and finishes this game, or rather reach a concluding point where they consider it ""finished"".

Early Access Review
								Starbound has a great concept: copy ""Terraria"" but do it in space, with multiple character races plus more of a story. Unfortunately, we're now at around 4 1/2 months without a stable update. I expect there eventually will be a fairly complete version of the game, and it'll probably be good, but stay away until that happens. I mistakenly convinced three of my friends to chip in for a 4-pack of the game because of the devs' promise of a ""Beta"" in ""2013"". That promise turned out to mean ""a very incomplete alpha in 2013 December, followed by getting so wrapped up in moving offices to England that we go from stable updates, to rare unstable updates, to nightly builds that we literally said might blow up your computer and kill your dog"". What's really annoying is that the company has devoted repeated effort to advertising other games instead of putting full effort into this one. (Admittedly some of those don't involve the same dev team members, but it's still bad form.)In short, what you're getting if you buy now is a very incomplete ""Terraria"" prototype and a vague promise that you'll have a complete game whenever the devs can be bothered to finish it.2014.12.4: We're now at nearly a year past the first ""beta"" with no noteworthy stable updates since February. Basic features like quests remain very incomplete even in the nightly builds that are the devs' excuse for not producing a professional quality release (they had millions of dollars of initial funding) in nearly a year.

												The game, frankly, was a hell of a lot better when I thought it was ""bare bones"" but now I see it had more to offer before. It felt like an exploration sandbox where you set your own goals and did whatever you wanted on your own time with no one to nag you.Now?Well, theres this insanely half-baked and arbitrary ""story"" you have to put up with and its basically demanded of you to go out and scan enough things to fight a stupid boss repeated 6 times over untill you get to one of the most lazily named bosses I have EVER seen in a video game.Some more problems i have with the game include but are not limited to:Crafting has had roughly half of the racial items completely culled from the tables, making it boring.Un-needed crafting times of 0.5 to 10 seconds have been added since early access, which begs the question. Why even have them?No longer feels like an exploration sandbox.Race spesific ship AI was removed. (why?)It also got a lot more annoying.Guns STILL suck colossal dong.Game feels like it has less than when I considered it ""bare bones"".Start feels like it was there just to add roughly 2 minutes of play time for whatever reason.If they decide they want to actually improve their game, I'll change my reveiw as I have done with other things in the past but for now. This game is just flaming garbage compaired to what it was in early access.			"

								I've had this game for years now, and it's always been one of my favorites. I find that it's much more fun to play with friends, but it's also a really fun/calming game to play by yourself. I love the exploration most of all, and I like the fact that there's been missions and a bit of a storyline added into the game. I think this game is a good one to have to play every now and again, but it's not one that I sit and play at every opportunity. So if you're looking for a bit more of a casual game to just calm down and have fun I'd totally recommend this one.			"

								I cannot bring myself to recommend Starbound. It is extremely repetitive and usually pretty boring. I was super excited for this game because I like Terraria so much, but this game isn't even close to the same level as it. The bright side to this game is the weapons, but while a cool idea, the random animals seem pretty dull. Sorry, but this is either a 5 or 6 out of 10.			"

								BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. After a string of missed promises, mismanagement and spending of the long invested money of both Steam customers and Kickstarter backers, Starbound development is effecitvely dead in the water. There is little to no hope of significant updates in the near future due to the total fracas of bad business decisions made by the developing firm Chucklefish. The details of such events can be found with a few rudimentary searches.In its current state the game has a very low level of progression or content, you have a small variety of biomes with pre-generated dungeons scattered and recycled through them, arbitrary grinding walls that simulate game progression but are really just time sinks to give you the illusion of gameplay. There is little to do with the items you collect and few items or avenues to explore in game. Combat is somehow more simplistic and blase then Minecraft or Terraria given SNES style AI of walk towards the player and attack and mininmal sprite based hit detection. As far as matching to the promised scope of the game the current iteration is no where close and has little hope of ever reaching there. It is doubtful it will ever lose its ""Early Access"" moniker.You are better off purchasing Terraria or some other sandbox game as this project has unfortunately fell victim to a classic case of business failiure, I can only stress my empathy for those who unlike a traditional investment model, must watch their money be wasted. I hope any dissatisfied customers find proper avenues to retain their 15$ or more after such a mess caused by incompetence and marketing hype.			"

												I loved this game, and I can't recommend it now. Now, before this gets written off as just another♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off reviewer because ""they broke my game,"" I just wanna point out some things that were better before and for some reason are gone:-Planets: Oh. My. God. Why did they make planets boring now? There used to be a randomizer for planets so you had a reason to explore and try to find the planet type you wanted with the weather you wanted in order to settle down for fun. Now you just run through the same few planet archetypes and be done with it. There's no fun in discovering a new planet now. Each one is the same as the last with minor variations.-Monsters: Monster variety is gone. They did away with the randomizer and instead added biome specific mobs and kept in a couple of random monster parts, but not many.-Crafting: Not a lot changed with crafting, except that they reduced what you could craft. Every crafting tier has only 2 weapons now. To make matters worse, everyone crafts the same weapons with endgame materials.-The story: It's not so much epic as just a thing you do. It's not even needed to progress through planets of different difficulty. You could play the game and do anything you want without ever needing to touch the quests past the beginning ones (which are necessary to fix your ship). There's just no point to it.-Random quests: Not. Random. Have fun running back and forth random locations looking for an NPC that the questgiver lost. Or you have to go deliver a thing. There's no actual randomness it's just those 2. At least as far as I saw and I've gone through like 100 planets.And apparently there was a thing with pets but I have no experience so I can't comment on whether good or bad.TL; DR: The game has a bunch of things that were gutted and are no longer fun. Because of this I can't recommend it as is. There are fun elements, but you'll soon be bored of planet exploration, which was the point of the game to begin with.  I recommend people on the fence just wait for more updates to add more stuff, and maybe even revamp some (looking at you planets. So disappointed). Otherwise it's just a normal sandbox. Dig, craft, build, fight. There used to be a great game and I believe there's one still.			"

								As many others have said here, I cannot recommend this game since it has been 8 months without an update. The dev team is run by artists alone and appears to not actually have someone managing development, and with the series of unprofessional and childish responses to community threads made by many of the devs, I consider the game a lost cause. A real shame, but once they got their money the dev team stopped working on the product. Terraria is a much better and complete version of this game with many free content-filled updates being adding even now, well after release, give that game your money instead.			"

								I've clocked in something like 30 hours at the time of this review. This is because I was really stoked about all the cool features I heard were going to be implemented in the future and I wanted to have a good character to experience them with. I was hoping this game would be more space-oriented, but space is just used as a transition between planets and, by extent, the caves you'll be spending 70% of your time in, tediously grinding for resources to achieve the next armour/weapon tier. But hey, maybe this will become a good game. In the meantime, though, steer clear.			"

								I've been playing this game on and off since it launched. Before that I was patiently waiting for it, keeping myself busy with Minecraft and Terraria. Games like these aren't for everyone, and I know there's been a war with the fans of these games claiming that they're knockoffs of eachother. Honestly, I don't really think that's fair. That's pretty much declaring all games of a certain genre to be knockoffs of one another. Starbound's got a lot of things that other sandbox's don't have, but it's also got a lot of things that they do have. Basically, Starbound plays like Terraria; a side-scrolling/do whatever you want type of game. It has RPG elements, crafting, etc. It has a pretty solid OST, but in my opinion it doesn't really feel Sci-fi. The sprites are gorgeous. The environments are gorgeous. And the creatures.... The creatures range anywhere from downright disgusting in appearance to cute as a button. The kicker is that the cute ones are often the nastiest, and will attack you relentlessly. I've not found two planets that were exactly the same. I'm the type of gamer that rotates from game to game out of boredom, but there are some games that are very special to me that I consistently play. Starbound is among them. I only recommend this game to gamers who have played Terraria or Minecraft and have an open mind. The updates can be a bit sluggish at times, but the changes I've seen have been glorious. And please for the love of Talos, opt into the nightly builds before you claim no changes have been made. Right click on the game, go to properties and from there it's pretty much self-explanatory. Happy travels, Starbounders. ヽ( ★ω★)ノ			"

He and a few others from CF have got some seriously bad press and quite frankly I think alot of people will not be buying from chuckle fish in the future because of the way they and others in the community have been treated if he handled complaints better I wouldn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ when the game comes out but they abuse people cop when they whine is ridiculous there the people buying♥♥♥♥♥♥from you... If they want to be rude so be it... Suck it up be polite to them and there attitude will change and they will join your side and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing...

								With the 1.0 update aproaching(or its already here when you are reading this) i decided to give this game some love.First: Is it worth the money? Yes, the content you get is not only excellent but huge.What is this content?: A whole galaxy(no seriously a. whole. galaxy.) whith different planets like: Jungle, Forest, Ocean and more. You got your own spaceship to explore this galaxy(you can even upgrade it) also you can build your own settlements(Preston Garvy approved) with tons of materials, furniture and decorations wich will have impact on the settlers(example: build a castle and a knight will live there).You like weapons? no problem they got weapons, loads of them and they all have unique abilities like a laser beam or a flashlight. But you dont want to have weapons? You want someone to fight for you? Dont see a problem catch a creature with a ball and throw it(this seems familiar) .The creatures on every planet are unique in combat and looks, some arent cute and kill you others are cute and kill you.You get quests, you can explore, fight, build, eat, sleep and even the stars arent the limit(ignore the name, it lies).

												I wish I could be kinder to this game, but Starbound (a.k.a. Feature Creep: The Official Game Of The Movie) just isn't that great.Setting aside the farcically protracted development time, the long chain of broken promises from the developers, and the frustrating apologist community that refuses to entertain ANY criticism, the game never rises above being ""pretty neat, but impossible to recommend"". Planet-hopping in concept is really cool, and as block building-style games go, you have a lot of latitude to create some nice stuff, but much of the rest of the content is fairly vapid, and often only serves as an obstacle or chore that restricts you from exploration unless you participate in it to the game's satisfaction. Once you burn through all of the possible biomes and settlements the game can generate, and maybe build a thing or two, there's very little motivation to continue playing.The changes from beta feel very much like one step forward and two steps back in terms of tooling the game for fun and player convenience. For example, instead of making mining more enjoyable, ore has just been made more easily available through other avenues for players who want to bypass it, essentially mooting one of the primary gameplay modes. No such luck, though, if you hate the game's combat, because Space Farmin' ain't gonna kill the story bosses for you. In that sense, Starbound is more like a mediocre platformer with a huge amount of padding between levels and an excessive amount of optional sandbox side content. Most of my 200+ hours of playtime are ""unearned"", in the sense that the majority of them were spent planet-crawling or grinding for resources. In other words, sifting through randomly generated content just trying to find the one thing I needed. So maybe it's more like a sandbox that arms you with a plastic sieve and tells you someone dropped a quarter in it a week ago.The story itself might charitably be described as ""serviceable"", but the story missions are garbage. You can't build or dig anywhere to stop you from ""cheating"", but Starbound's combat and platforming are too shallow and unrefined to stand on their own, not to mention the fact that the mission maps are SO poorly optimized that I consistently crash out unless I run the game in a tiny window, despite exceeding the minimum requirements. In fact, I have to regularly save & quit every hour or so because there seems to be a memory leak issue where my graphics get corrupted. Did I mention you can sometimes irretrievably lose all of your teleporter bookmarks for no reason, a bug that has persisted for over a year? Seems like something you'd probably want to prioritize for release.A game like this lives and dies on novelty, which is fine, but the path to that novelty is gated by tedious, uninventive resource grinding and weak action platforming that runs contrary to the developers' insistent sandbox rhetoric. Copy on the official website claims that Starbound allows you to ""create your own story"" (unless you're playing a Novakid, who are completely excluded from the main storyline and still have no settlements, OOPS) and that there is ""no wrong way to play!"", both of which are patently untrue with the way the player is constantly shackled to tutorials and story quests that only have one ""right answer"" and staunchly refuse to let you think outside the box. There is no story or win state outside of playing the game exactly the way the developers intended, and for a game like this that promised so much and delivered on so little of it, that is quite unfortunate. Not only is the decision to make platforming and combat the ""core"" gameplay experience misguided, it seems totally arbitrary, considering planet generation is clearly what had the most work put into it.At this point, the game cannot be ""fixed"" with more content, balance tweaks or fan mods. What it needed was a more focused and unified development cycle, and a team that actually listened to player feedback instead of insisting that being able to play a flute in space was more important than releasing on time, and that ship has sailed.

								Not worth the $15This game has a lot of potential, but at this time the game hasn't had an update in months. Possibly one of the most generic games you could play. There is no real unique planets, once you visit one, you've literally seen them all. NPC interaction is minimal. Enemies are essentially cheap recolours of each other with a few swapped body parts, fight one and you've fought them all. Boss battles are uninteresting and unchallenging. Weapons are mostly dull and uninspired, dungeons can be fun once or twice before you realize hardly any of them have any real loot aside from the useless aesthetics you can plunder. Each of the playable races are statistically the same, esentially reskins of each other. They do have some unique stats on their racial armour, but that's just stupid and not an actual racial ability.Minibosses (ones you don't summon, they appear on most planets) are the same copy/paste generated monsters, except enlarged and given some more health. They don't even try to make the minibosses look good or fit in, they don't use the same resolution on them as other enemies. Instead it simply looks as though someone used the magnify tool on MS Paint and called it a day.I realize it's early access, but it's unacceptable for a game in beta that promised ""thick and fast"" updates to go months and months without any sort of update to the game. They do have nightlies, but they specifically say those aren't meant to be played.Don't give Chuckle♥♥♥♥ your money. Unless they deliver no less than what was promised, this game isn't worth your money.			"

												I purchased this game for my brother and I, an almost 30$ investent. I had played the game in the unstable betas a while back, and it had loads of potential. When I bought it, I fantasized about what amazing boss battles would be added, what new quests would be added to the outpost, how would they revamp the weapons, crafting, planets, ships. How amazing a central story arc would be. The game trailer had my hype levels through the interstellar roof. My main thought was: Could it even be better than before? The answer, my friends, appears to be no. In fact, the overall quality of the game has fallen drastically from what was there previously.-The weapons have become less amazing, random, and awesome than before. It has a lack of rare weapons (the cool ones being nearly impossible to obtain,) daggers and hammers are practically useless, and class armor is generic at best. I, along with some other gaing friends, were expecting some awesome end-game set boosts like gliding for avians or endless energy during the day for florans. However these never came true, and armor found in chests is next to useless before even leaving your starter world. Not only that, but all low-teir (copper, iron, gold) weapons were completely removed from the game. Character tech has also recieved a downgrade, with a very small amount of upgrades, and only one in each of the now 3 categories that is worthwhile (spike ball, sprint, and triple jump.) The bubble tech no longer exists.-The planet system no longer has difficulty sectors, but different teired stars, leading only to a mad dash to the glosest fiery planet for endgame loot. The temperature system has been replaced by the EPP, a barely-augmentable pack that is far too easy and relatively boring to make. Many of the RNG creatures have also become thngs of the past. The mechs, and amzing and fun planetary exploration machine, has been replaced by speeders so expensive that they become obsolete by the time you save enough pixels for them. The crew system, although beneficial, is a real hassle when it comes to upgrading your ship. Also the Erchius Ghost is a pain. Enough said.The story had amazing potential. I loved every second of the tutorial (grabbing both the flower and the cape,) and I couldnt wait to see what the outpost had. After finally reaching it, I was met with three quests. Three. One for the techs, one for the ore mart, and one for dreadwing. Remember all of those fun personal quests? Gone. Remember spending a hour on mazebound to cash in both a quest and an enormous sense of achievemnt? Pointless. Then we get to the ark. The scan quests? Tedious and annoying. That eigth race everyone was speculating about? Never happened. I remembered being so hyped for the new story quests after beating the Hunting Caverns. But it turned out that every single on of these was a glorified trapped puzzle labyrinth, each with its own theme, and each boss chamber was just a rectangular room. No variation, no truly unique battles. Just hit until you die or it dies, staying in the same room. In fact, the planetary exploration system makes it so you can have end-game gear before you even do the Floran mission, leading to really a broken system. Even after beating it, the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth.What Starbound desperately needs:-More inventive Boss Missions-A better exploration and teir system-More weapons and unique armors.-Better Techs and Mechs-A larger variation of creatures-The Outpost quests to returnA novel idea would be to have space pirates (a very realistic thing in a univese like Starbound's) that scales up in occurance and difficulty as you travel to better planets. When ""attacked,"" you could either pay a fine or choose to board their Randomly generated ship of hostile enemies (of any race, even the non-playable ones.) Once you beat the underlings and possibly a mini-boss ""captain,"" you could have a loot chest that also scales with the solar teir. Much like challenge dimensions, there would also be a hidden loot chest somehere in the ship. Once defeated, you would just go on your merry way.As much as I love Starbound, until it gets some serious updates, I wont be playing it again. "

								I've played this game entirely as a multiplayer experience.This is the most linear sandbox I've played.  After the first couple of upgrades and planet moves, I found myself on cycle of new sector> new planet> mine the one important ore> make the next tier of gear> make the tech upgrade> repeat.  The endless planets concept is interesting, but I felt like I was constantly on the move.  That almost entirely eliminates the building part of the game.Battling monsters is a joke at this point.  The AI needs to refined, and the monsters need variety, and hitboxes shaped like the sprite would be nice.Exploring is cool.  Planet surfaces usually have at least one unique structure or town but there is 0 satisfaction for visting towns or for exploring the more dangerous areas.If the game is truely still in Alpha, I would say the creators are on the right path.  If there is any consideration towards releasing this as a full game in the near future - my suggestion is to look elsewhere. "

								This was a great game, it was one of my favorites before the character wipe update that took out the hunger/cold system.  It's still a good game in my opinion, but it has fallen aways from where it came.  It's still fun to an extent and I hope that Chucklefish stops driving the game in the direction it's going.  Taking out hunger/cold completely, damage on contact, common monsters, and some other things are what really put the game down for me.  I still recommend it to anybody looking for an interesting sidescroller/building game, but it's not nearly as good as it used to be.  In my opinion I'd give it a 7/10.			"

								Terraria is an all-time favorite and I really wanted to like Starbound but.. I can't.There's a bit of bugginess and missing gameplay which is understandable at its current beta state so I'm not even going to touch on those. What really gets me is that absolutely nothing in the starbound universe is truly memorable. You can explore a planet (which takes entirely too long for how much there is to do on them) then leave and you rarely find anything worth looking at. The randomized monsters are boring. There's a lot of cool vanity objects but since there's really no point in creating a permanent base you never get to really mess with them. Digging is brutally slow, especially in the beginning.On the plus side, some of the names that can be generated for characters are pretty entertaining..			"

								If you're considering getting this game.  Wait.  Wait, till it is finished and released.The current gear scaling is pretty steep.  It's very easy to make your own gear that quicly removes any challenge what-so-ever.Each new planet you can travel to, is basicly the same and offers very little different from the planet you just left.PVE is either encredibly easy or very hard with little reward.Broken promises, horrible PR, and some outright lies, leave me with a bad taste in my mouth from this developer.It even seems that the publisher is trying to wash their hands of this.There's potential there, but will it ever come to fruition?

												The early access was brilliant, better than this stable version.Currently the game (1.0 release) has scaling issues and is quite imbalanced, underpowered towards the beginning and overpowered towards the end, with a middle game that barely exists as you try to power through planets to get to the next set of upgrades. It used to be a fun type of grind, but with the general need for more items (volume, as well as different type) to upgrade things it becomes gradually more frustrating. Although the pace for upgrading your MM and Tech feels a bit better.The change to equipping items feels terrible, initially I thought I'd get used to it like a person normally would, but it feels too unnatural. You need to equip many items in general: melee weapon, ranged weapon, torches, rope, trash blocks, flashlight, health kits. That's mainly for exploring, even then more items can be added. And for some reason many items that you think would be single-handed are actually two-handed. Great! Even more switching to do!The need for food to restore your hunger significantly adds to the monotony. Go out into that vast universe - and become a farmer! It does get better, but takes away from the experience nonetheless.The array of items and scenery is great; planets are much more interesting. Playing with friends has never been easier also!It's got a lot of potential, it always had. They're holding it back with trivial design and incessant chores.EDIT: I've deleted the comments that commented on my hours, I have at least 60 hours in total and that's a very conservative estimate.

								Update 10/01/15 -I tried the new unstable 'upbeat giraffe' beta mode and there are a lot of improvements:- Questing and instances have been added, giving direction and proper goals to gameplay- Fueling your ship is more fun now as you know exactly which planets(moons) to go to in order to gain the fuel itself, making you explore a bit while silmountaneously getting rid of the old 'chuck a load of coal in your ship' method of fueling. The new system is generally less tedious and faster, while still making you work for it.- New biomes- More dangers on planets (heat, cold, radiation, lack of oxygen etc) and tech to survive such planets- Greater variety of random dungeons/building/loot to make exploring more worthwhile- Boss encounters kind of fixed, making it harder to abuse the game and use the old cheap methods of effortlessly killing bosses.The game is heading towards a point where I will reccommend it, but because all of the benefits I listed above (and some others i've forgot) are currently in an unstable beta of a beta, I cannot bring myself to change the nature of my review just yet.OLD REVIEW:<I looked forward to this game and bought it close to release, and had a bit of fun running about in a fairly beautiful (but kind of laggy/glitchy) world.With little to work towards I found myself getting quickly bored of Starbound, and I eagerly awaited some form of meaningful patch to add some content / fix bugs. However, said meaningful patch never really came and I was left disappointed because despite this review being negative, I really wanted Starbound to succeed.In it's current state I simply don't think Starbound is worth your cash. Theres a lot of stigma and negativity flying around lately where devs are claming they 100% ARE working to finish starbound and members of the community are strongly disagreeing with that claim.tl;dr : wait it out. If you insist on buying, do your research first to make sure you won't be disappointed.>			"

It's been pushed back to 2015. Combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥with no differences except damage. Guns are♥♥♥♥♥♥ and any weapons you find on planets are drastically inferior to anything you can craft at the time.There is barely any tech to be found.Tiy says that people like the game because 'people have a lot of ours in it' not including the fact that running a starbound server via the launcher counts as playing too. Giving you 2 hours of 1 hour playtime if you're on your server while hosting it. Don't bother hosting a server overnight or else you'll get 12 hours of extra playtime added to your profile.♥♥♥♥ this game, Tiy left terraria to make terraria in space, something 'Edge of Space' does 4 times better. This game is overhyped and it ended up as a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥Developers call everyone who complains about the lack of actual content self centered and accused people of having mental disorder (Narcissistic personality disorder) i swear to god they linked the wikipedia article and told people to check themselves for it.It doesn't help that they run the starbound reddit and forums, banning every single hair of opposition. The reason Redigit doesn't do this is because he actually takes the time to talk it out with people who dislike the game and ask what they'd like to see in it. Something Tiy doesn't do, nope, he sits back and watch as his 'community' (fanboys) yell at you, then he gets his moderators to ban you with no reason attached.Tiy and co do not work properly, taking time out of their day to play street fighter and to get in a trash can and pretend to be a robot.3/10, developers won't refund when you preorder it even though you preordered the full game, and early access wasn't even mentioned.

All races are the same except for looks, and things like the race unique ship AI have all been removed.

								Starbound is a game about traveling galaxies and has terraria influenced gameplay. Whats not to love? You start by choosing 1 of 7 races and customize it. You start on your ship and than the game will tell you how to progress for the first half. The boss battles are challenging to complete. You have thousands of planets to explore. This game has flaws like slow progression which impacts my opinion as I like games more fast paced. In the end though I rate this game as 9/10. It is a must-play for enthusiast of the genre.			"

								I really don't know what to think.It started as a good game but maybe they're trying to make it a little too user friendly.I mean, this game is fun (still not very much to do but still) but it's extremely easy if played with a little prudence. Like REALLY easy. Mostly because: -you can ""encage"" enemies during fights by building blocks around them (even bosses);-the fights are too simple AI-wise, enemies just run towards you fearlessly;-you can make water, poison, acid and lava disappear just by throwing dirt on it;Furthermore...there's ABSOLUTELY no reason to build houses since you can store your stuff on your ship and just warp from there to the planet and back (there's no way yet to spawn in different points of a planet so it's not like you would use your house more than once in a playthrough)Moreover, i know we're in beta but i think that challenge should be the first thing to think about when you're developing a game. I really appreciate your work but at the end, what i'm doing is taking walksReally, good job, the good ideas are there but at the end you just walk, dig and dodge sweet blood-thirsty bunnies.			"

Starbound got me hooked after playing just a few hours:- The exploration is great- The controls feel nice- The artwork and music is absolutely amazing- The storyline is interesting and doesn't bore you like most storylines in games- The game has cool things like hiring crew members for your spaceship or creating your own colonies on planets with city's you build yourselfPlayed 100+ hours in this game and have almost played every race since every race has his own unique spaceship and can honestly say that this game is amazing and worth every cent!You won't regret getting starbound!

								This is more of a neutral review than anything. Starbound aka Sci-Fi Terraria is supposed to be a 'action and adventure' game, well all that lasts about 4 hours until you have finished basically the first half of the game. After defeating the first boss there isn't really much to do. You gather materials to build a house, then it either ends up destroyed or you kill the boss and that's it, Game Over. This is still an Early Access Game but you will get more enjoyment from playing Terraria than this. Starbound is not worth the money you pay for it and is only playable for a few hours before it becomes rather boring. If for whatever reason you are interested in this game just wait until they do further work on it or it goes on sale because there isn't much to the game as it stands right now.			"

								Perhaps I just hyped about this game too much. Ultimately it disappointed me a lot. I am a MASSIVE Terraria fan and although this was not meant to be the next Terraria by any means, it's just missing a lot of what makes a game like Terraria fun. Exploring wasn't necessarily the fun thing about these kind of games (in my opinion), however it's become the core of Starbound. Exploring and finding chests that contain rare **** that you can use to become more powerful than your mates isn't the same as exploring and finding a building filled with intelligent walking monkeys filled with items that do nothing but look pretty or perhaps heal a little health/prevent hunger. It's nice at first but then I just feel like it looses it's joy.To be fair, I preordered the beta so perhaps when the game is fleshed out a bit (a lot) more it will be more fun. I'll stick to Terraria for now.			"

												It's nice that you added a decent story, but all the quests now just feel like filler, including the sidequests.I want to love this game, but I really can't anymore.I remember when campfires were used as heat, and there was actually a point in moving to other planets other than just making a b-line to the nearest fiery star or frozen star, just to click on some objects to complete the quest, and then defeat a dungeon and then move onto the next star.This game used to be great. There was actually a reason to go to some random♥♥♥♥♥planet in the middle of no where, but now there's literally no point other than to make a colony, which I don't even see how it's useful in anyway.If you like a very short main story, this is a great game for you. If you like a game with a good long story that actual feels like an achievement doing stuff, don't get this game, or maybe you should have back a few updates ago.I have to say, it's a fun game, and it's a change from Minecraft or Terraria, or any other sandbox games, but until the devs fix the problems many others have stated, it's not worth buying.In the current state that this game is in, I do not recommend it, but if Chucklefish were to ever fix these problems, definitely get this game.Please Chucklefish, fix this game.

												Starbound at first looked like a regular 2D Survival game like Terraria. It didn't show me much information for me to be interrested. ""But hey, it does look like a pretty good game to play online with some friends"", and oh boy! I was sure right!This game combines everything that Terraria missed and combined with Minecraft's ""hugeness"" and multiplayer. It may be a bit harsh at first, but as you progress it gets only funnier and funnier. Small details that bring people together, just like instruments! You can play certain instruments in this game, and it even has a function to play as a band! It may seem small but its a huge thing to bring friends closer. The usual laugh mid-game of someone's desgrace and the excitement when someone gets an ""OP Weapon"". The mining adventures and get you lost deep inside a planet. The adventures on the surface battling through monsters and discovering villages of a friendly race. Not to mention the breaks to play a music as a band.This is a true game to play with friends. I recommend 100% this game. Yes, it does has its flaws like wipes and character's deletion. But it's in beta. What did you expected? A Bug-free beta game?Starbound is a great game and it's worth all the money I gave for it.Best of luck to the developers!			"

												A game too ambitious for its own good.That's the tragic story of Starbound in a nutshell. I've played it numerous times since the early access, hoping that each iteration would bring forth new content - but in the end, none of those times felt like it was something worth revisiting. Even the fabled 1.0 update, where the game is now fully-fledged and no longer in early game access after three years doesn't feel anything like it should.Starbound has a lot of great things going for it. The artstyle and presentation of the graphics, while slightly shoddy at times, is well animated and distinct. None of it feels muddied and it has a lot of charm with some of the non-random enemies. The music, while repetitive at times, is relaxing and comfy to listen to. Building your own ship, gathering up crew, making little colonies on planets stocked with people you've hired for the task, Starbound is keen on letting you explore the universe at your own pace.But therein lies the biggest problem. Starbound is not just a sandbox game, but a sandbox game that is generated across an entire universe. There is only so much you can do before you start running into the same biomes, the same structures, the same villages, the same enemies and their attack patterns. This same problem feels eerily reminiscient of another game, No Man's Sky.I will say this. Starbound, compared to when I last binged on it two to three years ago, has changed both for better and worse. There is a more streamlined story, more items to grab, more villages and towns you can visit, but with it, the unique quests you get from the Outpost has been virtually made obsolete, barring a handful of them. The crew you take on might as well be robots - they don't say much of anything and rather, their only flavor text is their name and mood. Even the main side characters get maybe a whole page of dialogue altogether outside of their recruitment missions. They don't say anything memorable. In fact, Starbound as a whole doesn't feel memorable. Why is it that its precursor and competition, Terraria, is that much better?Because Terraria doesn't rely on random generation beyond its overworld. The enemies, items, and whatnot are all mostly going to stay the same in every world generated. Some might appear, some might vanish, but it is a far more static game than Starbound. In fact, Terraria doesn't even have that much of a plot. And yet, it's by far, the superior game due to the amount of unique items, enemies, armors, strategies, and so on and so forth. On the other hand, Starbound enemies, items, armors, and even the main playing strategy are pretty much the same. There are some neat abilities, but due to their random nature, your Beastmode Billywhacker will eventually be replaced by a Junky Moleseeker. In fact, a lot of it got downgraded from the last time I played. I remember when even the most random of enemies had some sort of special move that would force you to adapt. That's all been given to the unique monsters, which are just as dumb. Starbound's progression is extremely weak and the only thing that changes is that the numbers get higher as you go up the ranks. Terraria's difficult combines that with smarter and more varied enemies. Even the NPCs in Terraria are far more talkative than the ones in Starbound. In fact, if Terraria's graphics were better, there would almost be no reason to play Starbound.All in all, Starbound is only fun if you wish to build and explore with friends. The game, much like our own universe, feels too sparse and dead to warrant anything other than a curious playthrough. It's very much just mining from world to world, running into the same structures and biomes, with little variation in between.I can only recommend it if it's heavily discounted on sale and you got friends who can tag along. It's nowhere near being the total package that was promised all those years ago. Buy Terraria instead, since not only will you be saving five bucks or so, but you'll have way more fun than going through a developer's tired, broken dreams.4/10. "

												This is a pretty honest review that I can give after playing through the story and going up until end-game.To note, it took me 3 days of playing to do this.In all honesty...I get the impression that work was put into areas that were not that important compared to others.Progression is linear and simple, like so:- Get Thing- Use Thing to get to New Planets- Get New Thing on New Planets to make New New Thing- Use New New Thing to get to New New Planets to get New New New ThingThis rinses and repeats for up to 4 times.Pros:- Pretty, lots of variety in some worlds, interesting concepts, nice dialogue- Plenty of vanity items to collect and display- Ship can be upgraded, which wasn't a thing back in Beta, which is great- There's actually a story now- Plenty of cool weaponsCons:- There are only 4 rarities (White, Green, Blue, Purple) with no legendary weapons- Years in development yet feels incredibly basic still- Bugs and loading issues that cause you to stick in the air like a Minecraft Sever (Gross)- The Story is♥♥♥♥♥♥and short- The only 'truly legendary' weapon is♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- There are only 6 tiers of armor- There are only 5 mounts- Crew are useless- Very little 'rare' or 'exciting' content that requires you to grind to be satisfied- Up until end-game it's difficult to farm up resources for specific armor, and it ends up being easier to loot weapons, sell them to vendors, and buy the armor- Various 'gates' throughout the galaxy around various stars yet they all lead back to The Ark (even though you have a permanent teleport to there)- Very little missions outside of the Main Story- No reason to build houses other than for purely cosmetic reasons simply because you ship can hold everything- All workshops have roughly 3 tiers of upgrading and don't unlock anything interesting- You have to farm around planets for days to find theme-based equipment- Pets are useless, but admittedly cute, so that's not all bad- No 'large' or legendary monsters. There used to be some in beta that dropped epic gear.- Challenge areas are no challenge and the loot is terrible- Mystery bags are just horrible. Literally horrible. There's no point doing quests for the measly pixels and all of 1 matter manipulator core- No epic rewards for finish the main story, admittedly the most you get is, literally, a thank you card.All in all, it's not worth it at the moment, even with it's official release. It just feels very lackluster and bare-bones for what was meant to be a long time coming. Terraria made it's way in less time and had WAY more content than this.			"

												Starbound is a game in which you can lose hours upon hours having so much fun that you can barely sleep without thinking about it.edit: Now that the game has fully released, I feel I need to add some more things to my review. This game has evolved in many ways, and still is. For a game that is so simple, it really has a certain depth that you can't help but get hooked onto. Singleplayer and multiplayer are both really fun to do and I hope that all that start playing this game enjoy everything that is has to offer along with the mods that community members have worked hard to share with us. Enjoy the ride.			"

												Starbound holds  a special place in my heart. I've had the game since 0.1, and on multiple steam accounts. The game has always had the best oppurtunities to become one of the greatest games around, but it never QUITE made it.All of that changed with the recent 1.0 update, marking the full release of the game.You know have a fully pledged story, with interesting and deep characters, insane ammounts of lore and backstory and over 8+ bosses.Talking about bosses, they range from everything between a spider made of flesh, to a penguin in a futuristic war machine. Every boss is very unique, and their attacks never cease to suprise me.There are 6 classes to choose from; A robot, A fish, A plant, A collection of gas, An ape and of course human. This sounds very bazare, but as soon as you create your character, you can already read a simple recap of the races backstory.Starbound is a sandbox gme, and it is a prime example of what a sandbox game should be. You can choose to never mine a single peice of ore, never craft a single peice of armor and wether you want to live on your ship, or on one of the unique procedurally generated worlds. There is thousands and thousands of different blocks and furniture, which comes in great use with the colony system.The colony system consists of you creating a house, and putting a colony deed inside. The colony deeds cost 750 pixels (the ingame currency). You can choose who will live in the house by either decorating it with old chandeliers and bookshelves, or weapons and armor. You can get everything from a merchant to a guard, and they all come together with the procedural quest system.Quests (That arent outpost or story related) are always procedually generated, yet they're still all very unique and fun to do. The people who will give them to you are either random NPC's or inhabitants of your colony.If you so happen to complete a lot of quests for a specific NPC, will he request to join you on your adventure, as a companion. It is only possible to have to companions with you at all times, but it can range verything from a penguin to one of the many races of starbound. The sandbox aspect comes in very real here aswell, as you can either get companions by making colonies, ore buying your way to illegal penguin mecenaries.If you get enough companions on your ship (You can have as many as you want, just only two with you) your ship will get bigger, leaving you with more room.There is an infinite universe to explore with many weird and funny biomes, and deep and interesting dungeons.The weapons of Starbound; The weapons come in many shapes and forms, some silly and some deadly. They, like so much else in this game, have prodcedurally generated stats and looks, which means you will find something cool about almost every weapon you find.Verdict:If you want a game with litterally endless things to do and create, and many unique enemies and weapons, you're at the right place. Starbound is huge, and for the gamer that likes to read, there is huge amounts of lore to dive in to. There are plenty of easter eggs and references scattered around the massive diverse planets, just waiting for you to find them.9/10			"

												Ok, so Starbound, it's fun! I mean, you can build, craft, fight, etc. Like Terraria, but in SPAAAAAAAAAACE! Or that's what people say, that Starbound is just Terraria in space. Which is false, to me anyway. Starbound is so much more open-ended, expansive, etc. than Terraria (In my opinion anyway). Anyway, now for my reasons as to why you should get the game. Just Came out of Early Access.A lot of people before were whining about how little there was to do, but now that it updated to 1.0, you can expect a buttload of stuff! I have reached the endgame, and I still haven't discovered everything myself. So there will be no shortage of content. Easy ModdingAnd if you hypothetically do discover everything in the game, there is a very active community just pumping out mods which are as simple to download as a click of a button! Hell, you can even modify and make your own weapons/items with a program like StarCheat which is so easy to do, even I managed to do it! In-depth ExplorationMany people complain that all the planets are very similar, and I think that's because they just skim the surface of the planet and then claim it's not original enough. I'm sure if they took the time to look the planet over, you'll discover so many cool places and strangely unique NPCS. Just give it a chance before you hop onto the next Radioactive Star.Story/CharactersOk, so serious talk here, shame on anyone who says the story is too simple, like seriously screw you. You should not be expecting Oscar worthy writing from a game based on exploration, and adventure. It's a wise decision by the Devs to allow the game's story to be simple, and allow it promote exploration. I won't spoil the story here, but honestly get the game and experience it yourself. The story and characters, simple as they may be, are extremely colourful and fun, trust me. Better than TerrariaIt's better than Terraria.Oh and another point, stop comparing Starbound to Terraria. ""But waah they're both games with pixel graphics and crafting and-"" No shut up. You should never compare games together unless if they are extremely similar, and Starbound and Terraria are two totally different experiences. Yes, so what if they both have pixel graphics and crafting? Just because they share just those two aspects is so ground to start comparing the two. Next, you'll be telling me Terraria is just 2D Minecraft, seriously, stop it.Well, that was my first review. A few final words. Honestly, just get Starbound now, even if you like it just a little. It's a wonderful, and colourful experience unlike any other which really deserves more attention, And c'mon, it's only 10 bucks.(PS, that last point about Starbound being better than Terraria was meant to be a joke, not an actual point as to why you should get the game.)EDIT: BTW Thanks to the guy who pointed out some grammatical mistakes I made.

Early Access Review
								If Starbound was a Simulation game, it would be called ""False Promises: The Experience""At first the game was very promising. It had quite a bit of content to start with, and there was more coming.Then the promised content got delayed. Then it got delayed again. Any updates we got were just filler to make it look like the game was actually going somewhere. On top of that, those updates constantly killed mods, servers, and save files. I revisited the game recently, and I can safely say that it is not any better than it was when it originally launched, in some ways it's even worse than it was originally.The game falls under the same problem that a lot of Early Access games have, where the devs say ""Hey we aren't going to be like all the other Early Access people, we care about who buys the game and will make a lot of updates!""In short, they are exactly like those people. Games like Starbound are the exact reason that the Steam refund feature exist. If I could refund the game now, I would do so without any regrets.			"

Early Access Review
								I have 300 hrs on Terraria playing w/friends and family. We enjoyed it so much I bought 2 4-packs to play w/my family. Once we finished expert mode on Terraria, we were excited about Starbound because one of the devs on Terraria created Starbound. I bought 2 4-packs of Starbound to play w/my family. We haven't installed them all. The game is just boring, the combat is repetitive and pointless, the bosses are not worth fighting once, much less more than once. Worst of all are the mobs. They could all be the same. It doesn't matter if you procedurally generate many more things if they are all essentially the same boring thing underneath. Oh look a rat pig bird. Hey an eyeball dinosaur. You fight every single mob the same way and they fight essentially the same way. It just doesn't much matter.Infinite is not better. A well planned out, designed, crafted finite world with finite monster types with well designed and balanced mechanics is MUCH better than inifnite, procedurally generated junk. I don't want to play Starbound anymore, it's no fun. It doesn't matter that the universe is infinite. If it's boring, it doesn't matter. Can't wait for Terraria: Otherworld and Terraria 2. Hope someday Starbound gets better, it has potential, but right now it is just boring. I regret my purchase.			"

												Starbound is essentially Terraria... if Terraria were a mediocre amalgamation of 15 genres at once. The best word to describe Starbound is tedious. Everything you do in this game is tedious:Mining takes forever, and one misstep can get you killed. This wouldn't be a problem if the controls worked well, but they are extremely awkward. Also, in survival mode you lose money and drop all your important items on death, so if you die somewhere where you can't get them you're basically screwed.Farming is absolutely pointless. The plants take way too long to grow, planting the seeds and watering them take forever, and it makes almost no money. Not to mention the fact that inventory management is incredibly awkward and frustrating. Exploration is boring as hell.  Planets are all just generic biomes like desert and forest and plains. Also, there's really no point to building a base on a planet because it's just a waste of resources and you can just put all your things on your ship. Speaking of the ship, it is very minimalistic. There's no deep customization, just (exteremely expensive) size upgrades. Also, it is incredibly slow. The way you travel between planets is just clicking on it and then waiting. There's no interesting gameplay of any description. The space travel is nothing but a gimmick.The story really has no place in this game. There is absolutely zero orignality to it. Just the standard find all the things to kill the giant monster. I'd say the character interactions are pointless, but you can barely even call them interactions. You have no choices, and the text always goes by too fast or too slow. Also, the dialogue is dull as dishwater.Gear is horribly implemented. It works similarly to something like Borderlands or Diablo, so you'll be getting tons of useless items that clutter your inventory. And the combat is basic as hell. Every enemy functions more or less the same.In conclusion, this game is just a lesser Terraria which is more expensive for no reason. Please don't waste your time and money, and play Terraria instead.			"

Early Access Review
								Short update 9/10/2015:Seems Chucklefish has no idea where they are taking this game... They just keep adding filler content, ignoring the core, whilst making game easier and easier (hunger and environment hazard removed, ship expansion added) which makes doing certain things pointless (hunting monsters, building bases)... I honestly see no reason to go full-on back to this game, and if this headless direction continues, I see no reason to recommend this game neither... pre 9/10/2015:I bought this game when it was new, and it starts to be over 6 months ago. First month or so this game saw two to three updates that included character wipes and somewhat new content. Ever since that third and ""last"" wipe according to devs, there have been no real patches.About 3 months after release of this game, devs said slow updates were due to their studio being relocated. Okay, seems they got some dosh from starbound, maybe they´ll be now productive in their new studio, I tought.Now, last month after 5 months of no patches, this game saw ""nightly"" mode update, which is supposed to be sandbox mode that players can mess with and get latest content updates while devs actively update it. I have to concur with many critics, this is HIGHLY lazy way to patch and update your game, instead of feature patches they give us sandbox where you get your weapons with console codes if you dont want to grind. Well, this ""update"" truly is ""Nightly"", as it now every time I log into steam downloads and updates itself, but for some reason, they just don´t get it to stable. It crashes for me on launch, and as far as I have read community hub, I have not read a single comment that says it works and launches the game properly.I don´t really have any faith in this game anymore. It was quite fun-ish grind-a-thon 20 hours I played with few friends who I had been waiting with drool on our mouths for starbound all hyped up. But at it´s current state, this game really is nothing but grind-a-thon. It´s like terraria in space, except worlds feel empty and bosses dull.With starbound, I think this is slowly turning out to be second Early Access game that I actually had faith in, but just wont be really finished and promises fullfilled. I´m not surprised if this game gets in all silence 1.0 update next 6 months or so, and then starbound devs will pull what stardrive dev did and announce that they are working on bigger and better starbound 2.

								Still clunky as hell, progression is terrible, 1.0 update out of the blue from an Alpha (Schafer is probably a great role model for Tiy), no stable update for several months.For now, don't spend your money on this.UPDATE:Wow, Tiy pushed an update! I wanted to celebrate a patchless 1 year anniversary, but oh well.Now, this update actually added a LOT of balance stuff to the game. The game is no longer unplayably clunky, for one! There's now a storyline which, so far, adds absolutely NOTHING to the game, other than boring fetch quests. FUN! It goes something like this: Get MM, craft table, bow, cook meat, dig to the ♥♥♥♥ing center of the planet for core fragments, go to outpost, get more boring fetch quests, and after completing 4 of these, I stopped playing. Although Liy and Co. are getting closer to nailing the formula with upgradable matter manipulator and such. it's still very, very, very, very far from a game I'd recommend to people. Hey, you like boring digging? Dig in.			"

												Starbound is now out and I have completed the story so I can give a proper review of it. I will be covering what I consider to be the main aspects of the game.Story-8/10The story of the game is that a big monster blew up Earth and you escaped so you now have to find 6 artifacts that open the gate to the monster. (You find this out in the first hour.) The story has that Bethesda feel, where the game is like ""oh no, this thing happened and you have to do something!,"" but you can just ignore it and do your own thing. The story is an interesting aspect, and actually takes you to the different planet types so you have time to upgrade your armor and weapons. I think that story isn't completely necessary, but it works well with the concepts already established.Combat-9/10The sword-and-gunplay is fun and focuses on dodging enemies. Your ""Matter Manipulator,"" which is a building tool, can be useful for creating cover and such, but some enemies can go through walls. Each 2-handed weapon has a special ability, like grenade launchers and flashlights on guns or spin slashes and warp slashes on swords. There is a variety of weapons, allowing a ton of different playstyles. The bosses in the game are also very well designed and offer up a challenge when you first fight them. These bosses are located in developer-designed dungeons that have many secrets located in them. The combat never gets stale and fights are always interesting in one way or another.Exploration-5/10This aspect isn't the best part of the game. You usually see the same biomes and monsters over and over and while some monsters are randomly generated, by the end of the story you've seen all of the environments in the game already. It is fun at the start of the game, but it quickly gets stale and boring. Randomly generated dungeons are cool, but you often find the same style of dungeon as well.Building-9/10Building in the game is surprisingly deep and interesting. The colony system offers up an interesting thing to do after the story. The foreground and background building is similar to Terraria, but the game actually offers a good reason to build decorated houses so different tenants move in. This is one of my favorite parts of the game and I have spent hours searching for the right materials for my houses, which leads me to find new things in the game as well.Soundtrack-10/10The soundtrack in this game is beautiful and the main theme is one of the most memorable tracks that I have ever heard in games. I cannot stress enough that the soundtrack is worth buying and it adds a layer of charm to the game that I rarely see.Overall-8/10Starbound is not the best game ever made, but it definitely has a large amount of content that makes the game interesting for hours. It seems that this game was a board that ideas were thrown at, and some of those ideas stuck and mixed really well. The game also has a kind of charm to it that you don't see in AAA games. Starbound has been a great project to watch as it grew from alpha to beta, and finally to 1.0. Starbound has, in fact, left orbit and hopefully will go interstellar in further updates.			"

								Don't buy this game untill it is fully released, and even then with caution. Devs released to beta and claimed the updating schedule would be ""hot and heavy"". What we instead got was SIX MONTHS+ without updates, all they have done with the 20mil the raked up was buy office space and start publishing other peoples games. Any negative criticism of their game results in a ban on any forums they administer. Extremely shady business practices beware!As for the positives, this game can be very fun, upon release I was satisfied as I played with the assumption there would be regular updates to the game. The modding community is amazing, and they are hard at work salvaging gameplay from what sometimes feels like an abandoned game. If we do finally get updates again I will probably reccomend this game wholeheartedly. This is an early access review and as such I can only say I wouldn't ever trust buying a chucklefish early access game again.TLDR: Don't buy early access, wait for the full release (Late 2015 if we are lucky) "

Early Access Review
								I remember when this game was first announced. I was super hyped for it. And then the pre order dropped. Dropped fifteen bucks on it a week later. And then the wait. Finally the beta came out. And for awhile it was pretty alright. Played this game with a number of friends online and then we just stopped because there was nothing to do. Planets get repetitive really quick. Once you find a bone hammer or a legendary gun you are pretty much unstoppable. Ive gone from copper to impervium three times over in coop and twice solo. I was really hoping the developers would have stuck to the schedule they laid out a year ago but it doesnt seem like they give much of a care anymore. The game was supposed to have gone full release six months ago and its  still in beta with a majority of content still missing. Developer has also since rescinded on their refund option for dissatisfied customers so I am stuck with what amounts to a not even half finished game with no full release in sight. More disappointed than angry that the developers couldn't or wouldn't deliver on their promises. I got a good amount of time out of this game but I would get a refund if I could.			"

								I bought this game back when it was released on early access in December 2013, it's now 9 months later and the game has only been updated 3 or 4 times, and none of those updates have made much difference to the game as it was at release.They have nightly updates apparently, but since the lead dev has stated that nightlies aren't intended to be played or tested, and indeed that they don't want any feedback on them at all, they are just there to show progress being made on the game.  I don't think these count as actual updates.All in all, I'd recommend waiting for the game to be released (whenever that may be) before buying it.			"

 My Experiences With Starbound  Starbound has changed so much since the 1.0 Update and has changed the game into a great way! Starbound offers a lot to explore, find, craft, and kill to gain better equipment for your next mission! However Before You Go Buying... Please do note that Starbound is growing and morphing, there are cons to it.  There will not be much after you have ""completed"" the game. However the game does not prevent you from building to your hearts content on what ever planet you want to build on Collecting ores may be a task for some  Durasteel  .  Proformance may be an issue on low end computers, however you can look up some good guides on how to improve FPS, such as disabling Vsync, Resolution, Brightness, etc My Experience With Mutliplayer Multiplayer will go 2 ways, it will be the best, and most entertaining time with your friends as you ride your hoverbikes into the sunset, however as how my friends and myself have noticed is that there are occasional lag spikes with and without a dedicated server which may cause issues for some. Overall 8.5/10	 "

								Lets see where to start. Ah yeah, i have bought this game from external site after totally forgeting that it even exist, now what i expected was finished/close to finished game because i have heard about it like year ago. Obviously its far from that and i do understand that its still early access and that its my own fault for not informing my self better before spending money but yeah...So the best way to describe starbound would be unfinished. It really does have everything that is promised, wast space to explore but there isn't enough variety so things get boring fast. There are different sprites for monsters but most of them share same AI while some lack any so they will just jump around till you hack them down.Crafting works fine its menu are not complicated and its easy to understand + you can drop 4 or 1 block at once so over all its far supperior to lets say terraria, however there is one thing that i didn't like and that is progression lock tied to certain events. Simply to say usually you have to kill some boss to unlock more advanced stuff and this works fine in aspect that it prevents you from skiping parts and just going for end game stuff without much pentalty. But it translates into rather boring grind till you hit gear milestone only to unlock more grind add to that rather boring exploration and yeah...Ofc this all can change in final version and i will update this according to that.Still with all that best aspect of game is that it supports modding and with mods you can tweak the game how you like it. So even in this unfinished state i had fun with it.As many said the game have potential how ever i cant recommend the game in state as it is now. I'd say come back and check it again in year or two as development was rather slow up till now.Unless you are not bothered by stuff said above or just have extra money to waste.			"

												Starbound started off promising and somehow got worse instead of better over the course of its dev cycle. The game has fully released now but still feels virtually identical to the earliest builds. The interface is clunky and terrible, the progression system and balancing are all over the place, the combat feels imprecise and every planet is basically a palette swap of the last. At the end of the day, it hasn't lived up to any of the promises Chucklefish made during development and the final version is just boring. Save your money and get Terraria instead.			"

								This game isn't all that great and it has left a permanent scar with my relationship with Chucklefish due to their childish upset against the people who didn't enjoy it. Even though the game was in development for many years and people were desperately waiting for a terraria in space to finally come out. Only to be disappointed with it's lack of polish and content. Even through this games many updates it still has a very big flaw. You can do all of its content in about 2 hours. Sure if you spend a majority of your time going through the different planets and exploring you can rack up more hours. That gets boring extremely quickly when you learn that the planets have little variety and just look a little different. I cannot suggest this game to anyone willing to find a replacement for the amount of hours you spent in Terraria. If you don't like how Terraria worked you might enjoy this game.			"

												Do not buy this, the developers are very rude and bans anyone who gives negative feedback on their forums.EDIT 07/08/2016;Update to this; The game is still incredibly bug-riddled despite being ""Released from beta"", and there are massive FPS drops at seemingly random times. I'm running a pretty high-mid end gaming PC, and most of the time it averages 20 FPS in this game, despite being able to run pretty much any other game on very high settings at >72 FPS.If you want to buy it, wait a little. Don't put your money down for it if you haven't already done so.This is not at all a full 1.0 version. Don't be fooled.To add to it; You make 15 trading cards, but there's not a single Novakid card, despite there only being 7 races, yet you can still manage to add a human game developer card? That's even dafter than I am.Don't make a promise if you never want to do anything with it. Considering how many promises they've made and failed to deliver on, I'm starting to not be very surprised at all by them failing to deliver anything competent.Chucklefish was a mistake.			"

								Like a lot of people, I jumped into Starbound hoping for the next Terraria.  Sadly, I get the feeling we'll never really see all the promise of Starbound.  The game as it stands is in an okay state but far from what is promised on the Steam page.  And sadly, it's been that way for the past 6 months now.  No quests, repetetive planets, weak progression, villages full of aliens that don't do anything besides a few little jokes, simple combat, and a team of seemingly incompetent devs who don't seem able to deliver content or interact with the community in any meaningful way have ruined a lot of my excitement for this game.  Starbound is a game that makes me rethink supporting Early Access indie games.  Save your money.			"

								Starbound, hailed as Terraria 2.0 or Terraria in Space. Edit: To the people downvoting this review; read my review before you judge it. I share the same issues most ""negative reviewers"" do, but I have had more than 200+ hours of gameplay from this game, and so have most of the ""negative reviewers"" as well, and for an Early Access game, that is pretty good, is it not? Despite it's flaws. So before you blindly judge it based off slow development, read the following:I have waited with reviewing this game until they posted more updates, but have owned it since it was released to the public - and had 200+ hours within the first 2-3 months of the game being released, a lot of those due to mods, but the game is coming around now on its own as well, adding a lot of the features mods used to.If you loved Terraria, you will love this, no questions asked, just get Starbound and play it. If you never played Terraria, well ask yourself this:Does exploring space in your own spaceship, in a 2D pixelated universe sound amazing? Does building cool space-bases throughout various random planets sound fun? Does exploring the universe and digging to the planets cores sound daring enough for ya'? If that is the case, then Starbound might just  be for you.While I will recommend this game, I do have some minor (and I STRESS ""minor"", because I do love Starbound) issues that I am not fond of. The developer of the game promised large updates frequently, however, since it released 1 year and 2 months ago, there has been approximately 4 ""decent"" updates to the game - which have added a proper amount of content to the game. Starbound still has quite a ways to go before it should be considered a full game. And while I understand the quarrels of coding and programming, the actual design part of adding new blocks, biomes, monsters (although monsters are plenty as it is), items, weapons, etc. is not that hard in a 2D pixel game, and some of the updates focused heavily on adding only these (a lot of cosmetic stuff like hats), with minor additions to other parts of the game.And just to make a note, if that previous paragraph bummed anyone out too much - I will repeat, I do recommend this game, and in the first 2-3 months of the game being out I played 200+ hours with plenty of fun and shenanigans. And I am eagerly awaiting the day Starbound is released as a full game. Starbound has a great future, and definitely has a lot of hours worth of content now (which is more than most Early Access games), and additionally there is a plethora of mods that will give you even more play-time.So yes, I would recommend Starbound in a heartbeat.Plus, the Winter Update just added Llamas in Space!

Early Access Review
								This game is awful in every sense of the word.Best way to describe it? A contentless Terraria. I really cannot think of many positive things to say about this game. It has terrible bosses (both looks and difficulty wise). Who thought it would be oh so funny to make the first boss be a penguin in a flying saucer? Whos humour is so bad that they actually found that funny? Why wasn't the boss simply an alien in the flying saucer, that spawns more aliens on the surface instead of penguins?Then we have the second boss, which is a robot that you build yourself. You build it, just to kill it. This boss also looks idiotic too. How hard can it be to make a threatening looking robot? That's one of the main problems with the few bosses in this game. They don't look threatening at all. They're also way too easy.At least the dragon is somewhat decent.Anyway, the game has been casualized to hell and back too. At first we had threat levels for each sector. For example, in the alpha sector, the threat level went from 1-10, beta sector 10-20, and so on upto threat level 100. You could immediately see the difference in difficulty between a threat level 1 planet, to a threat level 4+.Now we have 10 threat levels maximum. Alpha sector has nothing but threat level 1 planets, beta nothing but threat level 2. Chucklefish claim that the difficulty is still just the same, but that is a flat out lie. The monsters apparently get stronger the further you dig down into the planet, but I never noticed any difference, even when I reached the planets core. Speaking of which, you have next to no reason to dig past the surface in this game. Terraria was filled with sprawling caves which had many neat things to find. Starbound caves are devoid of anything besides a few enemies. You might as well stay on the surface.Oh and once you reach a certain depth, the music cuts off. Some may argue that this creates atmosphere, but since the caves are so dull I don't see how it adds to anything. Instead it comes across as lazy. There could have easily been some cave themes that actually added to the ""creepy"" atmosphere that they were trying to go for.Now onto the monsters. They look awful. They sound awful. Seriously, half of them make horse sounds, the other half make sheep sounds. It's so irritating to listen too. What's the matter? Couldn't even take some time out to give the enemies some decent, unique sound effects? Again, lazy.I think it was advertised at some point ""never see the same enemy twice!"". Well I have seen the same exact enemy multiple times over. I've also seen that same enemy, except coloured green, instead of purple.Do chucklefish not know how to make things look threatening? Well, they sort of do since I have seen a few enemies that actually look good, but most of the time the enemies look goofy as ♥♥♥♥. Why must chucklefish insist on taking the goofy route? Is that their plan? To make the games comedy be aimed at morons that find an enemy with a mohawk funny?I could go on and on about this games shortcomings, but I'm going to cut it short here.The bottom line is, Terraria, which took a few months to create (granted it was still a little rough around the edges when it first came out too) is a far and away better game than Starbound which has taken years and is still in alpha, which the devs are calling beta. The updates are few and far between. It's been like what? 4 months now without an update?Talk about taking the money and running. I had the game bought for me thankfully, or I'd actually be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off if I payed money for this crap.So remember kids, don't buy incomplete games, because this happens. The devs have no incentive to work on it now that you gave them 3 million for a barebone skeleton of a game.			"

								What can I complain about that already hasn't been stated? It's been gone over that the developers are lazy, blame the community, and have decided that one screenshot and half a paragraph of nothing in particular counts as an ;update'. It's made over 2 million in it's kickstarter, and over 15 in the first MONTH, so it's not like they should have ANY excuse not to get cracking, besides the fact they're just lazy.Oh, and apparently none of that massive budget got put towards a QA department. The last content update was in March. For a VALENTINES update. And it was almost all vanity items. And during that time, they released a patch with one of the WORST POSSIBLE bugs in this time of game; about half your chests, or ANY storage unit would crash the game if you simply CLICKED on it.For a game that needs you to hoard a lot of stuff for crafting and building, this was INSANE. The ""hotfix"" (aka a patch that  is supposed to come out ASAP) didn't come out until a couple DAYS later. And guess what? ALL those bugged chests were deleted. Gone, vanished, no way to get your stuff back.What did the devs say to this? Basically ""Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ you should have made a backup of your world before our patches? You didn't? Well, you're a retard, aren't you?""Don't buy this. It's an empty shell of a game, and I'd bet hard money that Terraria 2 will probably be out and finished before this game is.			"

And I do mean months. The developers of the game censor every single bit of criticism wherever they can, and the rabid fanboys dismiss that criticism as some kind of conspiracy. The community is toxic and the developers seem to be either a bunch of children or simply conmen abusing the stupidity of the aforementioned fanboys. Don't buy it, don't give it attention, just forget all about it. I hope that, one day, this game will be forgotten by every single human being on this planet so it could be like it never existed.

Gameplay wise it is basically Terraria, in terms of difficulty it is fairly harder and there is a heap more to do in my own opinion. My reasons for not reccommending this game?. I can't remember the last time we had an update, this and DayZ prove my reasoning for disliking early access. The developers get all the money they need and then seem to slow down or abandon the game. Cubeworld 2.0****edit coming soon 4/07/2015****			"

								First off I know that this is in alpha and not at all finished and will completly change, but I am reviewing it in its current state.The gameplay is very minimal and repetitive. You gather materials, fight a boss. Gather new materials, fight a new boss. Repeat. Its fun for a little bit but quickly gets boring. As for the development, I have seen none. Its almost as if they stopped working on this game completly. I would HIGHLY recommend not buying it at this time. In its current state the game is terrible, and this is not going to change quickly. Either wait till substantial updates are made, or simply purchase a different game such as edge of space or terraria.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really did. But the problem was it gets really boring after about 15-18 hours. Once you get to the top teir armours and weapons (not a long time) there really isn't much to do. The story is very repetitive and finding the villages is just boring. I played this with a friend so I may have gotten a few more hours if I played by myself, but the only reason we bought the game was to play together, so that's wouldn't have happened. If you're looking for a short game to play then sure, go ahead and buy it, but personally, unless it's a story only game, I wouldn't recommend a game with less than 50 hours play time + still enjoying it after. I was dissapointed with the play time I got out of it. I liked the time I did play but it just gets so boring.			"

												Starbound is a very enjoyable and quite expansive Sandbox/Adventure game with both single-player and multiplayer modes. In Starbound, you start out on a planet where you need to gather resources to fix your spaceship in order to explore further. Eventually, you'll be free to fly anywhere you'd like, and there are a ton of different planet biomes and places to see. There so much to explore! Each planet and star system will have a vast array of planet types, terrain colors, ore, creatures, and structures, and the planets in Starbound are procedurally generated, so as you're playing as different characters, likely no galaxy will be the same as another.There are seven races in Starbound: The Humans, the Avians, the Floran, the Glitch, the Hylotl, and the Novakids. Each race has different armor sets, decor, furniture, and spaceship differences. As you explore planets, you will likely find structures of a certain race's theme, finding NPCs of that race and seeing their unique styles and appearances. You will also come across lore for each of these races, and their backstories, throughout the game. Each of the races seems to be inspired real-life cultures around the world, for example, the Glitch and their Medieval-themed motif, and the Florans with their primitive, prehistoric-type furniture and clothing. The variation in these items is quite pleasing, and fun to explore.Starbound's crafting, resource collection, and building can be quite satisfying, as well, and there are all kinds of blocks, furniture items, decorations, costumes, and objects that you can use to flesh out your structures, homes, bases, and any kinds of buildings that you make.Starbound is also a mod-friendly game, and it has all kinds of awesome mods on the Workshop, and on the Chucklefish forums alike. Everything from more technology, more items, more furniture, more player colors, and all kinds of things!Starbound's visuals and soundtrack are very nice, as well, and its lighting and the different effects on different types of planets make the variation of each area all the more charming. The sound ambiance in Starbound is also quite immersive as well, and there are plenty of nice details in the environments and in the game.I would recommend Starbound to anyone and everyone who loves RPG adventure games, and sandbox games! It can be such a joy to play and so much fun, and it also has multiplayer, so that you can share your adventure with your friends. I have no complaints about the game, and I think it's a pleasure to play! ^.^			"

												Time to rewrite this old thing now since it's out of EA.  Let's start with an admittedly bad metaphor.Imagine you see a food stand that makes sandwiches.  They have only one kind of sandwich, the 'Mystery Sub,' but it's promised to have the ingredients you like on it.  Specifically, pickles, butter, and white american cheese, with just a little bit of mayo.  It's also pretty cheap, so you order a sandwich.  You're told it'll be ready in five minutes.Those five minutes go by, but still no sandwich.  So you go up and ask about it and the guy at the stand says he just started in the food service industry yesterday, and he misjudged how long it would take.  Since he's just starting out and he says it'll be the best sandwich ever, you decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a little while.After half an hour of waiting, he finally gives you your sandwich.  You decide to open it to see what's in the 'best sandwich ever,' and you take a look at it.Mayo.  Lots of mayo.  With one pickle, a big glob of butter, and half a piece of that awesome cheese you like all placed in different corners on the bread, covered in that white goop.  In other words, it's technically what you ordered, but it's not half as good as you expected it to be, and was given to you in much more time than you were told it was going to take originally.Starbound is that sandwich.  It has everything they said it would have; exploration, building, even a few dark themes.  So technically everything they said it would be.  But there isn't nearly enough of that stuff, and mostly samey fetch quests and grinding.  The all-important story is shallow and derivative, with every quest pretty much being 'scan random crap, go though dungeon, kill boss.'  Rinse and repeat.Over all, it's not a bad game.  It has plenty of stuff to keep you busy for a while, with tons of cosmetics and building items.  I would even say the building system is better and more fun than Terraria.  But there just isn't enough of everything else that would make it fun and unique; as the old saying goes, it's as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle.There's plenty of bad stuff that happened in development; with the devs, with the missed release dates, and plenty of other problems.  I'm not going to go into it here; if you haven't heard of all the problems with the development and the devs themselves and are interested, you can look it up yourself.  God knows you'd get a better explanation from anyone other than me.So I'll judge it on what it has in it now, not what happened in development in the past.  And for me, in it's current state it's a resounding 'meh.'  Good for one or two playthoughs, but you'll probably get bored of it before you even get to experience most of the main features.  I still haven't even tried the colony stuff, and I did very little farming after 1.0.  It's only fifteen bucks though, so if you think thirty or so hours is enough for that price, then go for it I guess.  Will you get as much play out of it as, say, Terraria though?  No, probably not.I'm sure I've 'gotten my money's worth' out of it while it was in EA, but I still don't like the game much, so I'm giving it a negative review.  Maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 for me.			"

								Terraria in space? Not even close! This is a good example of what happens when a game gets too much hype, ( like DayZ ) gets overrated and exaggerated,( like DayZ) and the company  takes too much advantage of the so called ""Early Access Game"" feature (like DayZ again!) it's like game companies use it as something to fall back on nowdays!  It's been a couple of years and I feel as if Stabound hasn't progressed that much at all, it's still somewha bland, boring, and most of it still has no replay value at all. It just ends up feeling very generic and repetitive after you play for a while.  (Progression still feels unsatisfying) I wouldn't be expecting this game to be better in the near future since Chucklefish would rather use the time to make another game like Waywardtide or publish other games instead of finishing this one at all. Who knows? Maybe at the time Starbound gets finished they would already be releasing 10 more games.Sure, we can all be optimistic and say Starbound has potential, but after seeing how much has  progressed since 2013, I still can't recommend it to others.At least it was only 15$			"

												In regards to the 1.0 update:If you don't already have the game and were hoping that the big 1.0 update would add a new world of content that would change things forever, you're probably going to be let down. To summarize what the update does; the early-access version of the game essentially involved Chucklefish cramming a bunch of content in the game to make it bigger. They added single-player missions, bosses, and a certain level of progression, but it was all kind of shallow and these elements were purely added just to have more things to do.So finally what this big update does is gives these missions and the game proper plot and progression. There are now lengthier, more plot-involved quests that make more sense than just ""I'm doing this quest because an NPC told me to for the hell of it,"" (which is pretty much how quests were in early-access). The story is actually something that develops as you play rather than being explained in a dialogue box at the start like previous versions.For the most part, that's all this update does. Yes, they DID add some new stuff, but the main purpose of this update was to refine and complete the game so that it no longer has that early-access appearance and feel. If you enjoyed/think you'd enjoy the content that was in previous versions of the game, then you might consider Starbound worth a playthrough/replaythrough. On the other hand, if you weren't previously impressed, then there's probably not a whole lot added in this latest update that will change your mind.Regardless, Starbound as a whole is a really good game. It may seem a bit lacking compared to Terraria, but it's very easy to enjoy its unique elements such as exploration, looting, and colonization.			"

								Update  (March 2016)So, I wrote this review over a year ago now and...yep...game is still in ""early access"". Loaded it up briefly today (but it crashed on load, good start) while i had a read of some of my fellow players reviews,  and well....it seems like it's just gone even further downhill from where it was when I posted the earlier review below.Still doesn't seem like we have ship customisation/upgrading? That was one of the early promises they made for content.I actually enjoyed going through the different regions (Alpha/Beta/Delta) back in the day, but they've removed these which makes the universe feel a bit more generic and limited.Once again, the fact it's still in EA a year after my last review, and was initially ""released"" a further year before that...that's not a good sign for a game.My recommendation is still as it was before: Don't get this game until they finish it, if they ever do.Original Review (Dec 2014)So much has been promised with this game, but so much hasn't been delivered- various dates for release stages have been pushed back (often repeatedly), much hyped content (ship upgrades, etc) has never been implemented.It's easy to get pretty much high-end gear and have a huge fortress of your own built *full* of scavenged/crafted furniture/chests/etc without much game time- the number of hours I've spent on this game is including several times where patches broke save files, so I had to start again, and a lot of time leaving the game running while I go and do other things.As of currently, there hasn't been a proper content update in quite a while (not counting the ""night"" updates, which are sort of unstable unofficial patches/updates. So it's beginning to seem like this game will never be truely completed, and therefore never follow up on all it's promise, which makes me sad as it started off seeming awesome.			"

No unique features past the level gravity-Monster design just rips off pokemon, im suprised they dont say their name over and over like a broken record-Lack of secondary items beyond temporary potions, so no +2 def or +1 attack like in terraria-Insultingly easy, you need to go to a planet thats not recommened for your character just to have a slight amount of challnege-No mods worth talking about-Guns are basiclly airsoft-No depth in the combat (whack whack whack)-Unlike what the devs said prerelease, robots can eat human food, monkies can eat bird food, etc etc. Your character is essentially just a reskin. Do you want to be the bird one, the chimp, the human, or the robot (glitch master race)-Decent music but a real ear sore after several hours of play-Ships are clostrophobic, and you cannot edit their size without a buggy mod-NPC ai is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it will kill itself trying to reach you (jump off cliffs, fall into lava/poison)The only good things i see in this game are-Character animations (only for movement, everything else is generic swatting)-World design (although like i said earlier, it looses its charm after you find out its just a reskin)-Space travel (as dull and lifeless as it may be, its fun for a bit to explore in your space ship while playing Space oddity-Soundtrack, but as stated, it gets on your nerves after a bit due to the lack of variety for each world type. Lots of tracks in general, but not enough for each areaDecent concept, executed poorly.

Early Access Review
								It's been a while since I wrote a review on Starbound and I'm going to do another because my attitude has changed and I feel that my previous recommendation isn't correct anymore and might lead some people unexpectantly into buying it.So I will start with my recommendation. Do not buy the game right now. I'll say it again do not buy this game while it is in development. Now you may be asking yourself well why would I say that with having played 80 hours of it and I'm going to explain why my stance is what it is now. I'll try to keep it in bullet format and simple to read so you can pick out the pros and cons and decide more easily for yourself. Also I apologize for my grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Firstly I want to say that Starbound as it is right now is playable and enjoyable to a point, but the reason that I believe you shouldn't purchase it at this time isn't because of the game itself rather the developers and PR behind it which I will get into later.ProsExtremely playable, simplistic and fun for short bursts of playing time.Not necessarily a unique take on the genre, but if you played Terraria I'd argue that you would like this game.Interesting race concepts and art styleDecent crafting though a bit lacking has it's momentsA variety of biomes to run in and Dungeons to play through keeping some of the worlds you visit fresh and interesting driving you to continue exploring at least for a while.ConsFor the cons section I'll follow each bullet with my belief on the validity of the con and whether it should influence your purchase. I am no means a video game expert and all of this is my opinion I'm simply trying to help you understand why my recommendation is what it is.Though it's marketed as a Beta in this writers opinion it is an Alpha with Beta stability. I'll go in depth with this a bit more to make my reasoning clear, I believe a Beta should be feature complete and be testing for bugs. Some may not agree, but as I stated this is my opinion not a fact. One avenue where I believe this shows itself best is that most if not all of the content dealing with progression, npc interaction, and questing is garbage and it's been this way for coming up a few months shy of a year now. This isn't permenant just current state now.  ""In my opinion this is a decent sized con, but I don't believe it should be what you determine your purchase on. Though it does suck a bit now it will get better, but it takes time and work to get through this.""As I mentioned above the game is playable and enjoyable in short play sessions, but it ends at about 2 hours if that. Now you can play and build entire cities if you'd like which isn't bad, but when it comes to enjoyability I like progression and steady game play through to the ""end"" of the game. ""This shouldn't effect your purchase unless you are kind of like me and enjoy progression, questing and npc interaction."" Though there are different biomes after about an hour or so they all blend together, I love their heating system for colder planets don't get me wrong, but the driving force of the game is to gather x ore from x lvl planet and make x lvl armor and ship upgrade to go to the next level. There is no drive to build a base, no drive to colonize anything, and no drive to try to discover anything at all other than dig straight down get your ore then go back to your ship/base to build the next upgrade. ""To sum it up these last three cons can all be placed within the Alpha vs Beta con. Just understand that getting into this there are parts missing entire sections that seem boring and will be that way for several more months if not a year more. which brings me to my last con.""The biggest con and the reason that I'm recommending you to not buy this game until it is finished is Developer/company interaction, PR, and feedback to customers. I want to go into detail about this one because it is the damning factor in a lot of the arguments about whether the game is a worth while investment. When I first purchased Starbound the promises from Chucklefish were actually quite different than they are now which brings me to my first complaint. Chucklefish has the worst time with release dates and due to this they change what they say. For instance when I purchased the game there was a quote stating that all funds would go directly to the game and that the more money they got towards it the faster the game would be released. This was followed by a company move and publishing multiple titles for other companies on top of starting another game without having finished their first game. This wouldn't have been so bad had they explained that with the money from Starbound they were in fact not going to hire more programmers and increase the release speed, but rather promote and further their company. Not so bad, but a form of false advertisement on top of a pile of them. Quick releases went to slow releases then releases on a nightly possibly broken status exc. I'll sum this up by when I read what the developers have to say now as they ask for your purchase on steam only a few shards of it are the same as they were when I bought into this and when you argue this point it will get thrown back in your face stating that it is an early release, but I would argue an early release is still promising certain things in the effort to get you to invest in a product so most if not all promises made by a company need to be held accountable no matter the status of the promise. This isn't a kickstarter this is a product being sold on future content or development practices you are promising your customer.When confronted with the lack of communication back when updates were slow and given between three to four websites developers responded angrily with customers. Through passive aggressive hints or even out right blaming customers for lack of production in certain areas because they were ""complaining too much."" Let me rephrase I say developers, but TiY is actually the only developer I remember with this. There might have been more, but TiY stands out as having done it the most. ""These two points though terrible when talking about a company and a consumer are not so bad, but lead into my final con which is the one that truly drives my recommendation.""Over the past few months when I've visited the forums I've watched as some of the most overzealous moderators delete, censor and close any forum dealing with negative feedback with no other reasoning than ""everyone should know better"" quote from Izzabelle (The one who locks) < guessing self made title. When questioned about it the moderators continue to delete, censor and act irresponsibly to customers due to the anonymity of their interaction. This behavior though rude and obnoxious can't all be placed on the developer except that it's been happening for months and anyone watching the forums for a length of time know that speaking ill of the game comes with the chance of being banned anywhere from 2 weeks to permanently because ""they said so"". This would bring one to assume that this type of interaction is not only acceptable to Chucklefish, but applauded by the frequency of these types of responses. Customer censorship is shameful.  Though the game and what it's shaping up to one day be look amazing, Terrible customer interaction, Terrible forum moderation, Lies, Misscommunication and Blaming have ultimately turned me off of this company and any/all of it's future games. My recommendation is to buy the game when it's finished or don't buy it at all, because the moment you have something negative to say you no longer really matter. They got what they needed from you after all.  When the game is out I will switch the recommendation and rewrite the review to explain why in it's finished version it's worth buying, but that any looking to buy need be wary of early access from Chuckle.https://imgur.com/a/DPVRP "

												The game is terrible. They ripped all meaningful content out of the game and all that is left is a husk. They probably did this to hit 1.0 ""release"".The devs don't take criticism well. I don't recommend buying this game.Oh, and the storyline is pretty much Star Wars but with a giant orb with tentacles instead of an orb of laser cannons.Hero has home wrecked, older wiser teacher gives purpose, older wiser teacher had student who turned dark side, hero goes on journey to gain strength, hero fights evil student, hero defeats big evil thing saving the galaxy/universe.

								I think I've had this game for about a year and it's still in early access. The updates are not as ""fast and furious"" as the consumer may have been led to believe. For this reason I can not recommend this until it's release properly. Otherwise it has a lot of potential as a creative sandbox.			"

								The hype is over, and so are the updates. The devs made alot of money off of the people, and left us with a shell of a game. The launcher was bugged so if you see people with high amounts of playtime be aware it was because of a launcher glitch. This game is not recommended. Maybe check on it in 2 years or so, and see if Chucklefish actually puts together the game they led us all to believe they were making.			"

								Terraria rip-off. Not only that but there's no more updates being planned anymore, so basically you end up with an eternally-unfinished clone of another game that's CHEAPER on the market. Early Access is still a new thing but games such as these really show it in a negative light, so if you ever wanted to play some 2D Minecraft (don't know why you would), just get Terraria.			"

								The developers constantly silence people on their steam forums, and forums.And if it isn't their developers, it is the fourm mods, which have banned people for even critique.Usually ends up like this: 'I think X is bad, because Y' ( BANNED. Reason: 'bad'. )Before a wild fanboy appears, you can literally google this. I will not hold your hand, do it yourself.Game is not going anywhere, they're already working on another game too.( Apparently it's another team in the same company, as if there even was anyone working on it in Starbound in the first place. )EDIT2.0: It's been a LONG time and yet still none of the promises were expanded upon, and the game's current population are fanboys or people who are angry, still waiting for a product.-REVIEW-Starbound is very linear, with no real goals on what to do other than: 'Collect stuff, make better stuff.'There is no real incentive to play beyond that, as building is mostly pointless as you will leave worlds behind, as you should be travelling across the whole galaxy of space and whatever.The quest system is very under-utilized ( as of which, they have stated that they will add more for 1.0 )and even if they do add more quests, the question changes to: 'Will it ever be worked on far enough to be interesting and add value to the game?'Outside of it's initial charm, which comes from the 'immersive' part of the game, the game can get old rather quickly, as there currently isn't enough material to keep you interested in the lore of the game, and there isn't enough quests/dialogue to keep you wanting to stay around the towns/villages/airships, which again, comes down to lack of content. There are plenty of descriptions, which are a nice touch to the 'immersion' factor, and the player will actually move as if they were talking. There's also a ton of references, which will entertain some. Some references are VERY obvious, while others are a bit more subtle, however, still obvious.But that isn't enough to keep players interested for long.There's survival elements into this game that require you to eat, be warm, and of course, remain in good health ( so nothing completely ruins your day ).However, this adds to the linear part of the game.You make armor, it protects you, you make better armor, it protects you better, and now you are a bit more warm. As for food, you can get food almost anywhere, making it more of a annoyance than an actual survival element. And I do mean anywhere, you can kill animals on the moon if you needed to.The combat works in a good concept, it's actually better than Skyrim. You'll need to actually attempt to stay alive, as enemies are dangerous enough to overwhelm you, until you are geared.There are various types of weapons in Starbound.Spears - Good for pokingSwords - Good for stabbingGuns - Good for shootingBows - Good for Huntingand various other tools of violence, all at your disposal.Currently, the enemy isn't programmed far enough to actually require tactical use of the weapons.The best use is simply to get a ranged weapon and kite the opponent.If an opponent could require certain use of weapons, ( perhaps teamwork )then this would be very interesting.Shooting a monster, while it turns to deflect you, while an ally stabs it in the back with a spear, avoiding it's protruding spikes and toxic clouds.There is the standard mining. Not much to explain there.Cutting down trees actually falls over. Rather than combusting. +1 Immersion.Items; they are everywhere.There are plenty of items and upgrades within Starbound that really change the game.However, your luck is based on whether you go to the right planet or not.Whether you got lucky with the RNG, or maybe you looked for a good planet on the internet, there will still be many pointless planets in which you do nothing but look for a giant monster that has red particles near it. Then you kill it and get a weapon with special properties, which are pretty fun to use. My personal favorite was the bonehammer, which let you slam with a melee attack, while at the same time, launching bones at the enemy.Speaking of items and upgrades( called techs ); there are some pretty cool finds that let you do certain things.Using a quick dash, or maybe creating a bubble to help you levitate, those help with the game's combat, adding a bit of excitement. But, again, there simply isn't enough to use, losing out on any potential diversity.The game's modding scene is extremely good, but, as this is a review of the base game, we will not discuss mods as part of the game. The modders of Starbound have done some excellent work and have added many things that players have wanted. If you did pick up Starbound and regret it, you may have a chance using the player created mods, which would help you gather some value out of the game.Now, you have all of those cool stuff in a sci-fi world. 'What more do I need?' - No one, ever.There's the giant problem of the game not being finished, and not currently having enough meta-game. The lack of content really strains the game, a moment where dynamic missions would be very influential. Right now, the only real content there is, is based on the sole existance of player creativity, and mechanics. Once a player has exhausted either, ( which they will, unless you have a never-ending supply of drugs. ) they will then have nothing to do. Yes, there are quests, but how long will those really last the player? Will they be lengthy enough to continue playing, and will they successfully hook the player? The lack of a true meta-game really shows after just beating the first boss, and is very evident after you get to the last sector.'Oh, you can uh-uh-uh build a b-b-base!'But what purpose does it serve me, other than for more storage?Other than searching for dungeons ( then raiding them after hopefully finding one )and beating all of the bosses in the game and crafting the linear-upgrades of items, what more can you REALLY do?

Sure, you can hop from planet to planet, collecting rescources, fighting native wildlife, etc., but the smoothness of the game itsself is why I don't recommend this game. Chucklefish has promised hard and fast updates, yet where are they? When was the last time the game got a stable update anyway? The lag of poor coding, the frustration it causes when you eneter a village, it's just too much. You're better off sticking with Terrarria.			"

								Do NOT buy this game, unless you're perfectly fine with burning $15. While it is playable in its current state, it has been effectively abandoned by the devs. It has been EIGHT MONTHS since the last official update. The only thing they do now is their 'Nightly' updates, which both do not come every night and are riddled with bugs and crashes to the point of unplayability. They also tend to corrupt your worlds and characters. They promised a finished product by the end of 2013. It's currently 8 months into 2014, and we're still in the first stage of Beta. Not to mention all the trigger-happy mods who lock and delete any thread that doesn't suggest the game is perfect.			"

												It had seemed to have potential... and maybe one day might realise it.  Trouble is it already started looking 'dated', by the time it's out...As stands, dislike extreme lag on complex screens, screentearing at high rate of travel, a general lack of anything past the first few planets, and going by the nightly, extreme feature creep causing identity dissassociation of story.Would not recommend in current incarnation or near incarnation.Curious though of all the positive reviews' age.  While 90% positive is impressive, how many are since the near-year-long hiatus in development?  Maybe at one point I'll revisit this and change the review, but for now.. no.UPDATE: Years LaterThe CM is a toxic snowflake, the game is tailchasing drek, and any potential was beaten black and blue then live-streamed being made to drink from the toilet.  No --> Hell NoGo play Terraria instead if you want your 2d minecraft nostalgia.			"

								When I first bought the game, I thought it was amazing, infact I spent all of the game time I have now for this game in the first week or so. However, updates started to rapidly come slower and slower and slower and I lost interest. I hope they start updating again because I actually enjoyed the game a lot. However, for right now, I would not recommend the game in the state that it's in. The combat is the same most of the time, the weapon tiers are kind of bad, and there's a lot of grinding to be done. I really do hope that they continue to update the game because I feel like if they keep going they'll have something definately playable.			"

								I am still optimistic that Starbound will be a great game, but I am starting to feel that I will not see that day for AT LEAST a year.  The current state of the game is not broken, but very far from feeling complete.  There are bits and pieces of brilliance and fun to be found while playing the game, but the game becomes a repetitive bore after exploring past the first couple of sectors.  ""Bland randomness"" is the phrase I would use to describe most aspects of this game that rely on the procedural generation.  The planets are randomly bland, the weapons are randomly bland, the monsters and NPCs are randomly bland, the unique structures and dungeons are randomly bland, etc.       The game seems to have spiraled into some kind of development hell for almost six months, with few updates, suspiciously vague promises of future content, and a fair deal of excuses to why development is going slowly.  Furthermore, I am appalled to see the overkill level of censorship that this company is now pushing against their fanbase: a justifiably angry fanbase that gave THEIR money to Chucklefish in order to help them expedite the development of this game.  At this point, I just I feel like I've been flim-flammed by a dubious indie game developer and payed far too much for far too little of actual substance.    Update (7/31/14): Tried the nightly build after a bit of messing with the files to stop the game from crashing... It's nice to actually see some of the features put into effect that they have been showcasing on their website, even if the gameplay is a buggy, discheveled mess.			"

Early Access Review
								If you plan on buying this game, or have any interest in playing at all, PLEASE HOLD OFF.(Note that this is a review for the current state the game is in)When I originally heard news of Starbound, my hype boner extended into the stars above and could not be held down. It was basically Terraria. In Space. With promises of being much more. Hell, the game was developed by ex-Terraria developers. That lead me to thinking: How could developers of Terraria mess up their game by simply putting the damn game in space? At that point it didn't matter to me. Numerous friends already bought the game and bombarded me with ""WHY DONT YOU HAVE THIS GAME YET????"", and, ""PLAY WITH ME!!!!!"" They never seemed to run out of things to rave about the game. So I bit the bullet. I bought the game, immediately installed, and dove into the universe of Space Terraria. What could possibly go wrong?Now, onto the gameplay.Diving head-first into singleplayer, the game introduces you to the quest system by having you retrieve your first item in the game from a storage compartment on your spaceship. Simple enough. The controls seemed nothing out-of-the-ordinary. WASD to move around, spacebar to jump (even if jumping momentum seemed clunky), clicking to interact with various ""blocks"" and items, yadda yadda. Already the game seemed like SpaceTerraria. After beeming down to my starting planet's surface and completing the remaining ""tutorial"" quests, I had a cozy little camp with a fire and a crafting bench. I made myself a pickaxe and mined some of the obviously low-quality starting ores (copper, iron, and some coal). Using coal to power my spaceship, I had already travelled to a few planets, and scavenged enough resources to create a distress beacon: the item required to summon the game's first boss. A penguin piloting a giant UFO dropped from the sky, and my first boss battle had begun. It ended just as quick. As it turns out, the boss was extremely easy to ""cheese,"" as a trapped myself in a small dirt box with a one-block opening to swing a weapon out from. The battle was done and over with as quickly as it started. I climbed through the various tiers of armor and weaponry with extreme ease, and had ""beaten"" the game faster than I imagined.The controls, as I stated were nothing bizzare: WASD movement, click on things to interact. No complaints in the controls department aside from extremely wonky jumping mechanics. The gravity on a planet's surface varied with different planets, but none of that seemed to matter. Jumping sends you in the same, awkward arc that is extremely hard to control. Getting the right trajectory and angle of a jump is tedious and waaaay harder than it needs to be.Combat is simple. VERY simple. Like, boringly unsatisfying. Swords, spears, axes, it doesn't matter. You click when a monster is within the weapons reach, and repeat. No RNG (besides criticals) to spice things up, you click. Click, click, click. Guns are no better. All the guns seem identical. Oh, and did i mention you click? Click to win!Being a Terraria-esque game, being able to build a house or base is to be expected. This is where the game shines, in my eyes. Having thousands of different planets to explore means having a diverse selection of landscapes and atmospheres to contruct an ideal spaceport or cozy cottage. Along with diverse landscapes comes diverse building blocks. Want to build a tropical-themed, thatched-roof hut on a frozen, desolate moon? Knock yourself out! A intimidating and looming stone castle on a world of cotton candy trees and talking birdmen? I dont see why not! Even after I ""beat the game"" and reached the highest tiers of tools and armor, building a giant fishbowl for my geisha fish girl and defending it from sphincter-headed dinosaurs was a gaming experience like no other. Make sure to bring your creativity and roleplaying mindsets with you if you venture into Starbound.Multiplayer was a different story entirely. The game was oodles more entertaining and replayable with a crew of friends to join up and plunder the universe together with. I could write an entire book of the crazy-fun times I had with my buds in Starbound, but that almost feels like another game entirely, and I'm here to focus on Starbound.Unfortunately, I'm starting to run out of good things to say about poor Starbound.Being an early-access game, paying for and playing an unfinished game is to be expected. However, even for an early access game, the whole thing seemed rather...underwhelming. While it might just be the dying-down of my hype, the game was not what I expected it to be at all. It seemed very unfinished and empty. Even a group of good friends couldn't fix the empty gameplay. But the advantage of an early-access game is seeing the addition of new, exciting content before your very eyes, right?Starbound didn't get that memo.Call me cynical, or whatever you will, but I feel lied to. Cheated. Scammed. The developers over at Chucklefish were on an incredible streak of fixing and patching the game tailored to the findings of the community and playerbase. This streak continued for months. Then♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan.Developers started leaving, including one of the big-men-on-top. The developers took their patches and fixes with them. Progress on the game seemed to come to a standstill. However, the development website promised and displayed what content was being worked on and would ""soon"" (my definition of soon =/= Chucklefish's definition) be added to the game. Every day, the website showcased new features being worked on. Features that never seem to see the light of day. The website is a catalog of broken promises and wasted potential. The last ""update"" posted to the site is a collection of GIFs of monsters with promises of ""...updates soon!"" These no longer mean anything to me, and are just the developers' way of waving my money in my face.In summary...Starbound is a sandbox, Terraria-esque game that takes place in outer space. Immersive exploration is plagued with lackluster gameplay backed with broken promises of updates and constant new content. Playing with friends makes things a bit more bearable, but feels like you're bringing an umbrella to protect yourself against a rain of flaming dookie.As much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥I've taken on this game, I sure had a hell of a time eploring and building. Who knows? Maybe the developers will but away their hashpipes for a bit and work on the game. It might have a brighter future ahead of it, but for now, spend your money elsewhere. I truly await better times for this game :(			"

												So close, yet so far.Short: Terraria > StarboundLong:The quests are really boring (MMO style). Scan this fight the boss get the artifact come back repeat. Or, find this dude kill the hostage takers bring him back. Or, bring me 4 Silver ore, make Silver bars, make the equipment and bring it to my friend. I'd be fine with that but the rewards are totally not worth it, most of the time you get a ""suprise bag"" wich contains either a M.M. Upgrade Module or a Tech Card, that would be cool and all but you get a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of these if you just explore the surface of a planet. I wouldn't mind that too much but you need to complete the main Story to unlock all Shops in the Outpost (Hub like area)The boss fights are really, really, really boring. They're not hard, they just take a long long time to complete. Especially the last boss fight took me about 10 minutes but I didn't take much damage at all.  Compared to Terraria the boss fights are unsatisfying and boring. Building a colony on a planet has no real use. You can upgrade your ship upto five (?) times and at that point you have way too much spare space already. Yes building a colony is cool and all but there is no real point to it since all you really get from it is pixels (the currency) and in the endgame you'll already have enough of them.  If you enjoyed Terraria you'll mostlikley enjoy Starbound too because the gample is pretty much the same. If you haven't bought Terraria yet, buy it over Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is supposed to be Terraria in Space. It looks like Terraria in Space. It is not Terraria in Space.Starbound is clearly an early access game, yet it's been on sale for over half a year. There has been little progress made in the development, even though the developers have received $4 million on Kickstarter and countless sales on Steam.Whatever. The game itself is what matters. It's very boring. There are fundamental issues with the movement, combat, and progression. Movement is clunky, and getting around on planets never gets particularly fast. Combat is incredibly bland. There are only 2 boring enemy types, and some ridiculously overpowered bosses. Progression is bizarrely linear for what is supposed to be a sandbox game. It essentially boils down to : grind for way too many resources, cheese a boss to death, craft a new workbench, fly to next area, repeat. Every tier is not much different than the last, and there's very little reason to revisit previous areas. You'll spend most of your time gathering some resources, then quickly checking lots of random planets for their dungeon loot. Sometimes the dungeons are interesting, at least. Too bad finding them is a huge chore.Yes, these concerns could be resolved in due time. However, these are fundamental gameplay issues. Starbound looks great, and it has lots of toys. The problem is that the devs keep focusing on superficial elements, instead of fixing the game itself.Don't waste your money or time. I doubt this game will get any better. The developers have clammed up, and now they refuse to listen to any criticism. That's a sure sign this game won't see any real changes.			"

								All in all this would be a great game, if they got around to finishing it. As is I have had this game a long while excited to see the story and what the finished product looks like. Just for it to seem to be in a contious state of beta. I am not saying don't buy this once it's out of early acess once they get a story going and all the items fully made it will be a wonderful game. But for the moment I sugest waiting and not grabbing this till it is actully done.			"

Early Access Review
								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! DO NOT SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPERS! This game is stuck in early access Limbo. It will never be released. *edited*Ok, first of all, i played this game for about ~30-50 hours. The lead developer has his head up in the sky and cannot admit that his ambitions are WAY over the top of what he (and his dev team) is capeable of. The game was promised to be released in 2013, then it was postponed to early 2014 and now it is ""sure to come out on 2015"" Yeah, fool me once... No refunds And then they post about ""releasing game from 0.98 to 1.0 - it's just a number"" and yet somehow they are trying to hide away from all the critique by saying ""hey, but it's just an early access""This game is not finished, and it probably never will. And even IF it will be released, it won't live up to what they promised from the beginning. Not to mention all the 13 y/o fanbase that is always trying to protect the game by saying ""you had your hours of fun"" <- yeah this is the generation that has grown up on minecraft. No, i paid for what they promised me, not what has been delivered.The most important thing is -> THERE IS NO UPDATES FOR THIS GAME.Please re-read it out loud several times.BUT before you are trying to protect this game by ""but heeeeeey, there is the nightly builds, play them they are fun and daily"" <- No! No no no! As a software tester myself i can assure you, releasing games with nightly builds is NOT a solution. Sure first they have to go trough nightly, then to unstable branch then to stable... but wait... has there been any updates on a stable brunch? NO there has been none (for about a year)  so choke on that solution chucklefish. (and yeah, adding hats in nightly build... sure... ""progress and development"") Also before the so called ""beta"" release. Tyi promised (as he often do, and then NOT delivering) that there will be 3 beta stages. There is none. Forget about pets, pokedex-ish items, fossils, etc etc (insert here all the billion things they promised) Don't waste your time. Buy something that has already been released. Learn from my mistake. Please.From now on Chucklefish is the new Phil Fish of the gaming industry. Are they thinking about getting more money? YesDo they care about the community? F*CK no!			"

								Starbound does for me what Minecraft couldn't.  Instead of taking forever to explore one island I can take forever to explore a few solar systems.  But then I can travel to any of the thousand other systems and explore them as well.  The different material types are as varied as Minecraft and then some.  You can grow food, build buildings, create better materials, hunt creatures, get into shootouts with the locals, etc.in the latest version you can expand your ship.  You don't even have to develope planet-side buildings anymore if you don't want to.  You can literally live off your ship and expand it as you go.  There are now also more fuel types (fuel is needed to move between star systems), some more ceocentrated than others.With the outpost you now have access to more quests, which means more adventures.  They can be as random as ""Find me a stone USMC sign"".  Do you remember what planet on what system you found that USMC prison colony?  You don't?  Time to go exploring and find another to get that sign!There are ""dungeons"" on pretty much every planet.  You can dig down into the planet and find gnomish villages.  You can dig through several different layers of the planet and find everything from mushrooms to buried laboratories to underground lakes full of acid, all of which you can break down with your tool and use for yourself, either in a crafting recipe or as a decoration for your home(s).If you like open-world construction games of a blocky nature, then this one is definitely worth trying out.  There are many to choose from these days and eveyone likes one more than the others.  If you're still searching for ""the one"" then play this one.  You search will be over.			"

												The game is like space Terraria but much less to do.You know the saying? The journey is more important than the destination. Well the journey sucks in this game and there is no destinationPros:•	Space.•	So many interesting worlds and sets.•	Missions and story have great aesthetic.•	Ships are cool•	Decent variety of planets.•	Building is easy and the variety of building materials allows for a lot of creativity.•	Building your ship can be super cool•	There are some very neat random dungeons•	The races are very creative•	The game is fun with friendsCons:•	Very VERY limited things you can craft compared to a game like terraria.•	Hunger is stupid•	Crew system is super underwhelming•	A lot of things in the game that feel worthless such as pets, crafting weapons, buying basically anything from merchants.•	Way, way, WAY too easy to find everything in the game. Every tear of ores can be found in around 30 minutes of being on your first planet with the ore, and then you never need to mine for it again.•	The game has a very short cap. You finish everything you can do in the game after hardly any work. •	Quests that aren't in the main story are abysmal. There are like 3 different quests and they all suck. Go get this, kill this, or bring this to this person. They terrible payout so there is no incentive to do them at all.•	Money is super easy to come by and not used for like anything, making it virtually worthless•	The character customization options are actually very disappointing both at the character creation and throughout the game•	The game is extremely linear for a sandbox, you have very specific paths to take until the end where is seems like they thought, “Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ we need to give players multiple options for armor in a sandbox game”Summary:In the end, a lot of the gameplay mechanics seem not thought through and kind of worthless. The game is very incoherent at times, and worst of all, when you get to final tier of armor it is the most disappointing and unsatisfying thing in the game. The only way I'd recommend this game is if you really REALLY liked building and making a town, even then there are better games for that. Because that is the only thing in this game that requires any effort, but that has no payout besides being able to see a ton of people in your town. It’s very disappointing, because the beginning of the game is so fun and new, but as that feeling goes away, you get a very big disappointment. I hope for the game to improve as I’m sure the developers will continue to add to it. But until then, it is a no from me.			"

Early Access Review
								At first, this game was great. I funded this game during it's Kickstarter days with enthuisasm and such blind faith in the development team without learning their history of making games. Let me tell you this, the Developers are very shady. Not the shady kind of scheming but the kind that seem to hardly do anything in terms of game content. This game has been in Early Access for a very long time now, and there hasn't been a single patch in four months to improve content. They aren't great with decision making either; considering they made mining gratutitous and repetitive, you used to be able to farm ore from sand blocks and get them quicker than spending a few more seconds on a mineral chunk, but now it disappears for some reason because screw logic.There's no real difference between planets, every planet pretty much as the same sub-biomes and there's not much difference in monsters per planet either. They're all the same pretty much.Oh and you have to progressively mine now; stone picks to mine copper then use that copper to make copper picks and then mine iron with it, etc. Honestly I really liked this game before the developers decided to start working on a whole new game. Tiy, who is one of the developers began working on some Voxel game instead of helping finishing this. They used a large sum of money to buy a studio than invest in the game. Should you buy the game? Not yet. Wait until they actually finish it, when's that? I have no idea.			"

								would not recommend and heres why.  first the game play is slow moving, the upgrades are fast and leave you wondering what else there is to do and there is exactly that nothing to do. there is no greater goal in mind.  build a city alright now what?the bosses from what i remember were dissapointing  all of them are weak against blocks, block yourself in and shoot them rebuild blocks when nessicary.weapons dont make you feel special at all guns have a few shots before your enegry is depleted and cant shoot,  melee is fun but weapon selection is minscule.techs are the best thing about this game they make for interesting possibilties but run on energy,  so having fun and shooting things is a bad idea.if your looking for a fast paced game like terraria that makes you feel awesome with variety and hard bosses, special events, and things to do look elsewhere.id look for a refund on this game but i know it wont happen.3/10 stars			"

												I think that it is a honestly great game. I like the mechanics in it and like how there is not a set path. An example would be in Terreria which is also another great game but has a very set path with items that you know you show get  everthime you restart. Though with Starbound there is not a set path is which you can just find new weapons and armor. You don't have to focus on collceting materials as often to create weapons. Though you still have to make armor.It is also very easy to create mods and obtain them without having to go into the code or anything else. Which makes it a very mod friendly game that has many great mods from many different creators. One of these such are Fracking Universe which changes the game a lot and alows you to play the game again after finishing it once and allowing you to find a whole new feel. There are also just other mods that don't change the game as much but just improve the experience.In summary it is a very immersive game that has led me into many hours of gameplay. It is also Co-Op so you can easily play the game with your friends and have a great time.			"

Early Access Review
TL;DR: This game is the spiritual successor to the steam hit Terraria, promising a lot but fulfilling very little of its promises.When I started playing this game, I loved it. It was like a 2D minecraft with a lot of possibilities, and an actual progressing ""plot"", that gave you boss monsters and better armor that gave you cool little bonuses. You could modify your characters and while some parts were more boring than others, it was a fun game.But this isn't a review for Terraria, so I'll stop there.Starbound takes a lot of inspiration from Terraria, almost as directly as Terraria takes from Starbound.However, it doesn't follow through on a lot of its concepts. It attempts to make a Skinner box of leveling progression, except there's no real ""fulfillment"". In Terraria, finding a chest early on was a cool thing, generally significant, and especially significant if you got an item worth using for a good amount of time.Starbound relegates that strategy to one or two chests, and a ""maybe"". You're better off scouring the topside of the world and moving on to the next one directly after. You become less of a Starbound Traveler, and more of a Tourist, flicking through snapshots.The worlds are lively enough, but there's no soul or character growth behind them. The plot is piecemeal and unsatisfying, giant chunks of it are missing, and the chunks that are there are disconnected and uncooperative. In Terraria, the mystery served them well. You didn't know what the corruption was, and it was spreading. You could destroy parts of it, and parts of it would come after you. The eventual path to power gave you more and more interesting paths. It was a magical little experience that sent you from the ends of the world to hell and back. Starbound splits up the worlds into randomly generated pieces, which end up feeling generic and lacking a lot of the charm as a result of the lack of a common 'goal'. I would not recommend this game based upon its virtues, because it doesn't overcome its severe weaknesses as a game. As a sandbox simulator, it's fun enough. As a story, it's bad. The promised features for the game are not in the game, and that's what honestly brings it down. It's a damn shame, and I think it's a symptom of the ""Kickstarter Game"". 5/10, was fun for a bit, then lost interest when the unfinished nature of the game revealed itself like the pretty tablecloth ripped off to reveal that the table only had one and a half legs, and no actual centerpiece. And used to be a chair.			"

Product received for free
												With over 60 hours played, I can guarantee you ten of those hours sloughing through the decievingly short main campaign and grinding for resources, while the rest of the time I was playing an okay vertical Stardew Valley. Aside from accompanying a friend's mission with a Banjo loadout or trying out the newer mods that weren't fortunate enough to be merged with the final game, the base game leaves much to be desired.One of the biggest complaints is how badly the framerates could get fudged in a 2D platformer. You typically see a good 20-30 frame loss every time there are particle effects on screen, a large sprite is rendered, or, god forbid, witness a large sprite with alpha channels while hovering over it with the research tool. To put it into perspective, the credit sequence which is crawling text with a slideshow beside it amounts to a whopping 14 fps. That's impressive. It was also a fitting finale that summed up how this game shipped: through massive incompotence, yet kept afloat by a passionate community that has just the right amount of obnoxiousness to be unappealing yet get work done.If you are a fan of platformers with an expansive sandbox building system, this is very likely a purchase. As it is now, I could not personally recommend this to anyone else until they revisit the main campaign, post-game content, and what is most likely the most shameful resource hog I have seen in a while. Kudos to the first patch that landed, however, as it effectively kept our server from crashing every two hours from a memory leak. These kinds of changes along with what the modding community has been able to accomplish within the last week could mean good things later this year.Special thanks to Nutmeg, shoutout to simpleflips, love you mom			"

								Two years into development and you still cannot remap the key bindings within the user interface.Reportedly, this game has made over $20 million dollars and its still in 'early release.'This is an example of why Steam shouldn't host pay-to-develop games like this: because once the developers have made enough money, they no longer have any motivation whatsoever to actually continue to work on the game. The ""quests"" are exactly 5, and you finish them in about 30 minutes - and then you're all on your own.This will be my final purchase of an 'early access' title because I dont want to be left with an abandoned, half finished game that languishes for over two years with very little updates.

								With all those devs screwing over the customers, incessant shilling by the delusional userbase and the lack of content, I can not with a good conscience recommend this game to anyone. Now, people might complain about how I can give a negative review after having ""played"" so many hours (Don't forget that Steam considers having an opened launcher as being in game) while I've  bought this product for just 15 dollars.It's simple: This isn't about money spent/time played. It's about what was promised to me as a customer and what they provided. If I wanted the most bang for my buck I'd go play outside or enjoy some torrented movies, both of which come for free and are way more fulfilling than playing a game just to get spit in the face by the devs, while they ""apologize"" for my inconvenience by calling the development ""Weird"" and losing a third of their coding department.Tiy, if you read this: Hiring more artists won't fix ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Early Access Review
								[EDIT JAN 24, 2014]I keep looking back to this game in my library, desperately hoping that it's received some love from the devs and am constantly disappointed. Since my last review, which was already months after no updates, there has still been no real updates to the game. Not only that, but they've apparently removed things from the game, such as temperature function, that really detract from the survival aspect. The devs apparently feel the game has been good enough to be considered done for a while already and there's talk that the next update will be the 1.0 release.In that case, I'm going to remove the caveat from my original review and say don't buy this game at all because the game that was promised is now non-existant rather than a long time away.[END EDIT]I had a lot of fun playing this game when I bought it. I stopped playing after my character was wiped. I'm not upset about the wipe, I knew that was coming, I just stopped playing because the devs promised streamlined, weekly updates (their words, not mine) and I wanted to make sure characters would no longer be wiped. 4 months later, there hasn't been a single update of any significance and the devs put out a steady stream of excuses and blame (if they spent half as much time coding as they do making excuses and blaming fans, the game would be done by now).Any attempt to address the game's shortcomings is met by obnoxious fanboys spouting months old excuses and mods banning you for posting a negative opinion or asking a question.I liked the game when I bought it, honestly I still kinda do. Problem is, I bought it for what it promised to be not what it was and now I am disappointed in the state of things (especially with the endgame the devs have proposed which is seriously balls-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).I would recommend this game with the caveat that you only buy it for exactly what you see because anything more is potentially years away, otherwise just save your money.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR Not gonna lie, Starbound has a lot of potential, but the state that it's been in for the past >6 months is disgusting. I know that the company has had a lot of issues and they recently decided to actually have  HQ and they're still settling in or whatever. I also know that Early Access is kind of expected to be an unpolished game, but there have been so few updates it's really upsetting. I can't recommend this game due to the fact that it's just not getting enough done. I am totally willing to change this review whenever they decide to update it (last big update was in February and it's July now)Keep in mind that this game is in Early Access (for better or for worse) and this review is based on playing time up until July 2, 2014. Starbound is an open world exploration/adventure/sandbox type game, basically Terraria in space. The appeal to these games, of course, is gathering materials and just basically playing with legos that you never have to clean up. I personally enjoy this. It's a nice break from being super competitive in every other game I play. I mean, there's a pvp type thing in this game in that you can totally kill other players, but it's pretty broken. This game surprised me. In Minecraft I was really into redstone and just playing with circuitry and just seeing how much I can automate. While you can't automate as much in Starbound, there's defintely potential to automate more. I rigged up something to automate lighting in my planet so that whenever you enter my base, lights follow you on and turn off when you leave the room. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I have to rewire it every time I boot the game up because wires disappear for no reason. Now, this is to be expected, I mean, this is an Early Access game after all, but it's been an issue since day one and they still haven't fixed it. That alone is certainly a reason why I haven't booted up the game in forever.Combat is kind of wonky. There's no real way to know what type of enemy you're going to fight. I personally thought that was kind of for the lore because you're traveling to unknown planets so you wouldn't know how threatening anything is on that planet, but I've heard other people say that they really don't like that approach. I personally just tried to avoid fighting because the goal of the game isn't to fight things and they're really easy to avoid. A friend of mind was telling me about how she really doesn't like the fact that armor doesn't really make you super overpowered against mobs even at the highest tier, and sure, I can understand that being an issue. I personally am of the belief that this is the survival aspect of the game and you can't be expected to actually fight everything in the game; that's just impractical for actually surviving. Instead, I picked my battles and only fought when I was out of blocks to bridge over enemies. Resource gathering is pretty normal, just mine out blocks and hope for ores. The more advanced you get in the tier, the easier of a time you'll have finding ores from lower tiers. At the highest tier, you can mine asteroids which are super rich in ores and kind of break the game since you don't have to actually scavenge for resources, but, instead, just head to the nearest asteroid for a half hour and have all the resources you'll need for a while. Something that was kind of off-putting early on was that the basic tools performed better than the fancy matter manipulator item you have. I mean, I totally get specialization of items and how that contributes for better gameplay, but it didn't make sense to me that an item clearly more advanced than a pickaxe or a regular axe is outperformed by both. I mean, you can totally get drills later, and those do way better, but it's still weird that this space traveler is reduced to using what I would think is archaic, uncharacteristic items.The drops in this game are kind of weird too. You can totally have a friend take you to a high level planet and just loot surface chests for gear you can use and it'll carry you forever. There's also a chance that you find actual literal trash in the surface chests and then you're kind of upset. Even at high level planets, you have a good chance at finding super bad weapons. It's kind of irritating. At least building is pretty easy. I didn't really play Terraria, so it had to be explained to me that you have to actually fill in the background for stuff to not spawn (I thought it was a lighting thing like minecraft). After a bit it all makes sense and it's pretty intuitive - Select a block, press the mouse to put the block, repeat until done. There's also a pretty large variety of blocks and colors of blocks. That's pretty cool, but, in my opinion, the best blocks that can be used for building are generally hard to find and also uncraftable in vanilla. That's pretty upsetting. There are mods that allows you to purchase them with the otherwise pretty worthless pixel currency and that's totally cool.Progression in the game relies on you to find a certain amount of an ore and or it's additive to make it into a new refined ore to make a new tool thing or armor so that you can progress to the next area. That's totally cool, but it does feel kind of unrewarding. Sure you unlock a bunch of new things to build, but I really don't see a reason to limit a player on what they're able to build based on how far they've progressed like that. I do, however, see the need that some materials need special resources to create. I mean, you have to basically jump through 10 hoops to finally be able to craft everything. Some issues I personally have with the game are the fact that the pixel currency is virtually worthless; the cosmetics sold by some vendors aren't really appealing and the machine that lets you scan/reprint decorative blocks is cool, but I really wish the mod that allows you to print blocks made it to vanilla. The idea is that it's a super advanced 3d printer anyway, who is to say that it shouldn't allow you to recreate ANYTHING you've previously seen rather than just a handful of things you'll just place around for looks.Chests are also kind of a big deal. They don't really upgrade in capacity. I mean, and I bet you're maybe getting tired of hearing me say this, there is a mod that lets you have higher upgrade capacity in specialized chests, but these types of things, especially considering there's a forced progression, makes me think that there isn't enough thought being put into the game.I've already mentioned wiring. I don't know the cause of it, but it's always the same combination of 5 wires that I have to reconnect each time. That effectively makes building with wiring in mind irrelevant because it's going to break. It WILL break. Maybe not all of it, but just enough to make you irritated. Fortunately, despite all the bugs, the modding community is excellent. A lot of really cool mods have been added that give existing game mechanics a boost. Starfoundry comes to mind as something exceptional that really increases the game's playability. Overall, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. As I've mentioned, I'm totally willing to adjust whenever they're comfortable saying that they're actually gonna release the game in full as they see fit. It's tragic, though, because I really want to like this game. It's got a lot of potential, but just isn't there yet.			"

								The game could have had promise once upon a time, but the company ran it into the ground along with the community. Its deplorable how they have gone about this really, but I do not see them actually getting themselves collected and actually delivering the promises they have went with, which were retracted restated and rehashed along the course of its existance. Even now the game is but a framework being toted as an almost complete product with hundreds of unique and exicting features, but its really not. You would be much better off spending any money you thought to purchase this with in another direction.			"

Didn't think I'd ever get around to reviewing Starbound, but I suppose now's the time. The beginning is a bit ranty, and I apologize for it.While I haven't played Starbound in ages, I can certainly say that this game had a lot of potenial when it first went into early access. Those intial days of those first updates were fun and brought us new features. I thought this game was going to be a rival of Terraria and I was honeslty surprised in the differences that I saw in the early stages, but then...Chucklefish went MIA for a long time. The game got stale, bugs weren't getting fixed, and now almost three years later it's getting released. While I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game and what I've played, and I loved it every bit of it, I can't recommend this game only for the the devs. I've been with the community almost since the beginning and I had a lot of hopes for this game like a lot of the community. While I can't speak for everyone I'm displeased at how Chucklefish worked on this game and how they treated the community, I'm not going to throw and shade but I need to be careful of what I say because of acts they've done in the past to people talking about Starbound. I am however going to make a pro and con list of the games feautes and what's made it the experience that is it.Pros:-Large variety of blocks to build with -Fun and inviting landscapes-Wide variety of weapons to kill, maim, and destroy with-Seven playable races-Soothing OST-Easy to pick up combat system-Game's Purpose: Building is fun if you're creative.Cons:-Beginning is boring, mid-game is boring, everything just tends to be ""boring."" The game tends to just be a huge collect-a-thon-Boss fights. Let me expand on this first: The boss fights just aren't interesting. The first boss you fight is just bland and not enjoyable, the rest of the bosses are slighltly different, but not as fun.-Optimization (I still don't understand HOW this game isn't optimized. It still gets lag spikes even though my computer runs hardware that's a lot faster than the recommended specs. I know not every game is perfect, but I shouldn't lag everytime I enter my ship or go into a menu. This game honeslty is just poorly optimized and Chucklefish should have fixed that a long time ago.)-Quests and NPCs aren't fun to do or interact with; most quests are fetch quests or a ""Do this to complete a query so I can give you an item that's already out classed by experience."" While there are a lot of quests in Starbound, most of them are needed to progress in the ""story,"" and just take too much time to do. NPCs are still basic and uninteresting. Nothing has changed since the first update, they still just say a few lines and walk around.-The ""Story:"" There's a forced story in this game and while some say it's a good way to teach players, it's just so slow paced that it hinders the experience. When I started playing Starbound it was just ""Build and survive,"" but now that there's a story that is REQUIRED TO ADVANCE IN ANY TECHNOLOGICAL WAY it honestly just makes the game more of a chore.-Game's Purpose: If you aren't a creative person, this game just lacks much of anything for you.-Planets: They're all just color swaps with different environments. The generation is lacking, and in some cases is down right unfair, I.E. Huge death pit that you won't find until your mining durasteel or slime biomes that just make you bounce into enemiesIN CLOSING:I can't hate this game. I liked it for what it was when it was a lot more basic, but with all these additions Chucklefish keeps bringing in, it's honestly making the game more of a chore. I can't recommend this game only because of how slow development was and how the devs treated the community, especially during the hiatus. While it is getting released, FINALLY, in a few days (Or is released if you're reading this review on release day,) it's not worth the money. While I don't hate this game, I just wish that the whole development cycle would have gone differently and I hope that the release changes how the devs produce for the community and interact with the community.Until these changes, please don't get this game.

												So after a 5 year wait, it's finally released. After all that time, with content updates and changing basically everything in the game, Chucklefish has managed to deliver something truly dull and uninspiring. Starbound is a fabulous premise, a universe full of potential. After spending some time with the final release, I am left with one question:That's it?The quests and story that I've been waiting for the biggest let down. The main quest consists of 2 types of mission: 1. Find a settlement of the specified race and scan their furniture.2. Travel to a pre-made level and fight a boss at the end.The side quests consist of 3 types of missions:1. Deliver an object or escort a person to another person on the planet. Often times this second person is right next to the first person.2. Kill an enemy for someone.3. Collect ore or some other item for someone.The rest of the game, as best as I can tell, is collecting stuff and building other stuff. You can set up a colony, but why would you? So you can get more tedious and boring quests? So you can have a farm? A universe of endless possibilities and farming is the most creative thing you could come up with?One other thing I noticed is that the monsters seem to have gotten less unique. There are some that still seem to be randomly generated per planet, but there are a few that are on every planet. I don't know if that's a bug or not, but it wasn't like this before.So after a 5+ year wait, I'm left with a game that has redefined blandness and squandered potential. No, I still can't recommend this game. I don't even want to bother finishing it just to finish it.At least the soundtrack is still good. But that's it.			"

												edit: fixed some grammar here and thereDuring the Early Alpha I was like ""This is good. There's lot of potential!"". Had fun for a few days, especially in multi with a friend. But still it seemed too much unfinished, and so we decided to wait for the final version.A year or so later, when the final launched, we tried it again. It seemed fun at the beginning, they fixed something here and there, balanced it out. It was engaging again for a few more days.I now have played I think a dozen hours on the final version, between single and multiplayer, and finally decided to write this review. (steam reports more hours because I forgot it open a couple of times)The dev team sadly fell in the old procedural development rabbit hole, and understandably couldn't get out of it. The content seems a lot, but it's really not. The whole mass of the content is in the graphic assets, but for the rest there's almost nothing. Let me get in detail:1) There are like 3 quests repeated over and over the whole galaxy, including the main questline. The superficiality of the sidequests is evident when you find different villages and you always get the same quest, literally the same one on every planet, from 10 cramped up npcs. This is also apparent with the main questline, that consists of those 4-5 ad hoc maps (unreachable otherwise) where at the end you get to kill a boss (and boy they are all easy to beat).2) Another major turn-off is the main story. I really think that making the main questline obbligatory for the player goes against everything that a sandbox game is.3) The sub-biomes are another big problem, they are very superficial too. You basically find always the same 2-3 ones (gnomes, slime, small houses underground, etc). These sub-biomes never give you anything special, nor they have any background story or anything. The crates you find, and you always find them by the dozens, have always the same loot, because each of the few different star types has the same exact loot for all its planets.4) And then we have the colonies system. You find a planet, build a house, and a random guy teleports in. He does nothing. He will rarely give you one of the same 2-3 quests (they are exactly the same as the sidequests in the game) and then, when he wants, he'll give you finally the chance to hire him (but you don't actually need a crew in the game, and it has no utility whatsoever).I don't recommend this game.Maybe only discounted and if you plan to play in multiplayer with a friend.Otherwise don't waste money.

Early Access Review
								I used to want to recommend this game to everyone, as the game is fun, challenging, and ultra fun in multiplayer. HOWEVER, i quote what the developers say, ""Updates will come thick and fast, though, as we listen to your feedback, push fixes and add new content.”   What updates?... the game is pretty much the same since Dec 4, 13  with a few minor fixes... i cant recall the last huge juicy update.      With that being said, once you get to the wierd part of the game which you can call ""the end""  you can farm overpowerd weapons easily making everything die in the blink of an eye, then there really isnt much to do in the game after that. To me it feels like taking a nice peacful journey that feels like it couldnt end, then BOOM right as it was getting good, dead end....  the game is fun up to that point... but that point is really easy to reach once you get the hang of things, there are also a ton of useless things in the game, useless mechanics, useless weapons and armor, useless ores, they can take that crap out and add more content please.  This game has soooo much potential, yet, they arent doing anything with it, makes me wonder what they are actually doing.			"

								If you're on the fence about this; hold off until full release and even then maybe you shouldn't.How to win at starbound:create pickmine some oresmake better pickfly to better planetgoto 1.That is if the game doesn't bug out and halt progresson entirely.Combat is hilariously easy(but hey, we got omni-directional sword swings now; counts for something right?) and even 'bosses' can be killed without taking damage easily.Content updates are minimal, if any at all, with most 'updates' being attempts at fixing world gen/render lag which apparently don't work for a lot of people.No, bugfixes arn't updates. Those are patches.The nightlies exist but arn't nightly and are really broken(they did warn us I guess)Crafting is decent but is hindered by tiered progression (refer to 'how to win at starbound', above)In short: Hold off on buying until they decide to slap 1.0 on it (Be warned that starbound does not follow the standard program version numeration)			"

Early Access Review
								Loaded with awkward 'features' that make gameplay unbearable such as the stale, randomly generated enemies that all manage to feel and act about the same way have ruined this experience. Speaking from playing this game and watching its development from its early days up until now, I can tell you that the more finished this game gets, the more vile it becomes. Possibly because the charm has all worn off, or maybe because the development team keeps making the -dumbest- decisions. Now, I don't really know the dev team so I don't know what their vision is, but trying to patch up this game by having forced mission sequences when the core of the game is about exploration, building, and player-driven advancement is more than a little wrong. Instead of finding new, awesome, and cool things on planets, you find that every single place you go to is exactly the same with a different coat of paint. It's the same -everywhere-. The hazards feel like background noise, the enemies all look and feel the same, the combat is dull, and no matter what you do or what you run into, it's always -disappointing- in the end. That's what this game is summed up in one word: Disappointment.How a game that started out with such crass graphics and such a small development team as Terraria could far surpass this particular endeavour in every way, that started with a -modest- goal, and as more or less a 2D minecraft clone is beyond baffling. Terraria doesn't boast multiple worlds, and the only thing that's randomly generated is the terrain, but I'd still rather waste my time in the world of Terraria than this game. Why? Because when you explore you find things that -matter-. It feels like you're in control. Everything -- even building -- has a point to it. So basically, Starbound managed to completely ruin itself by being the exact opposite of Terraria. You're not in control of anything, everything is pointed out to you, exploration renders nothing satisfying, and there's so much randomly generated content that it all blends together into one static mess.Understandably, this game is early access which means that the developers are constantly working on fixing it, and at some point in the future, say, maybe 2020, they might have all of the bugs and quirks in this game fixed, but until then, it's not going to be fun for anyone.If you like disappointment, this is the game for you. Otherwise, just leave it alone, buy and/or play Terraria, and save yourself the grief.Post August '15 Update Edit: This review might've been written with more venom than what was intended, but I stick to my guns on this: You're better off playing Terraria or Minecraft. The update I've noticed has added a lot of features that seemed interesting, but ended up, again, not adding much to the actual meat of the game. You can dress a mess up however you want and even throw some neon lights on there to attract the rave kids, but at the end of the day, it's still a mess.			"

So the the graduation day has arrived and you're going late to the ceremony, you get there and witness the octopus alien violent invation, so you grab the Mater Manipulator and flee the planet in your damaged space ship  just right on time. and now you have to explore a BIG MAP of galaxies and stars with hundreds of randomized worlds inhabited with randomized enemies, randomized allies, loot, weapons, gear, tools, shotguns, armor, blocks, furniture, and more and more. while terraria create and randomized an island, Starbound create and randomized  7 planets in one of the many other solar systems available, AND also randomizing the solar systems so you can explore hundreds of STARS with hundreds of PLANETS.I did played terraria in ps vita A LOT, and i did like it, but Starbound feels more stimulating in terms of exploration and variety of weapons and armor, loot etc. "

								At first i think this game was alsome, well...here's are few reasons why i won't recommend this game any more:*The game radomly gernrates almost every thing... but after you play the game for a little while, everything feels same, for eg a planet will almost always have same number of monsters and a durgon, etc...*The guns in the game are more of a blowpipe with a high ""blow"" rate, and they are super weak.*Every thing, almost everything uses energy(guns, bows, etc...), like they don't even have ammo and the energy goes down too fast...*Even they say, oh everything is radom so you can play it over and over, but no if you think about it every game is same! Start in a planet, make stuff, kill a boss, goes to another sector, and repeat..*The boss in the game are so easy to kill, basically block + rage weapons(Just cage the boss with blocks!), some boss like UFO does crash block but if you put blocks all around it it would just stay there and can't do a thing.*Not enough crafting objects, well right now you can only craft a few blocks, witch means that your buliding materials are super limted, yes you can take from durgons but that's just board.*Lame animations, ok starbounds animation is just well ugly i guess, the bullets won't create lights, lame death animation, fake looking explodsion, etc...Right now i won't recommend this game.

Early Access Review
								As it stands right now, I cannot reccomend this game.Starbound is a game that originally caught my eye with what seemed to be limitless potential and a dedicated design team that had already worked on some products I enjoy. Unfortunately you can't buy groceries with potential, and even a broken clock is right twice a day.That said, there are some good things about the game.- Potential. I can't stress enough that this game looks like it COULD be super good once it's finished and it IS still in beta, so you never know.- Sci-Fi...sort of. You can argue this for sure, but it's nice to see an exploration game that uses at least some space and sci-fi elements instead of the standard gantasy game tropes.- Addictive gameplay. If you're a fan of Minecraft or Terraria, you know what I'm talking about. In the beginning you could easily lose hours and hours to this game as you explore and build.- Neat Bosses: All of the bosses I've encountered have been fun and interesting. I won't spoil them for you here, but check out some gameplay footage if you want to see them.Of course, with there being good stuff, there's always bad stuff to go along with it:- Update frequency, there isn't any. For a game that was promised to be full of ""thick and fast"" updates and a constantly growing list of features, there has been extremely little delivered on. At the time of writing I think the last update was six months ago, and the most recent dev blog update is pathetic: A screenshot of a single mob, no context and ""I don't feel like writing much right now.""- Stale Progression: One of the things that initially attracted me to this game was the idea that you'd progress through research, learning to build new things through maybe trial and error or exposure...and the game has utterly failed to deliver on that idea. So far all you do is craft a new set of armour, fight the new boss, and then move onto the next section to repeat. There's no quests beyond the starter ones, no story and overall nothing to do except the same thing ad nauseum.- Uninteresting Worldscapes: When I first loaded into Starbound my loading screen showed a black planet surrounded by tentacles. I COULD NOT WAIT to go find a planet like that and explore the heck out of it. Sure the planets I was on right now were boring, but I could deal...until I found one. I found one of those tentacles...only to discover it was just a reskinned tree. It was chopped down like a tree, fell like a tree, and produced wood like a tree. And unfortunately that's all there is. Each planet is just a reskin of the ones before, with the same landscapes, dungeons and cities. Even the cool enviromental stuff you see at the beginning of the game becomes stale and samey after it's repeated dozens of times.There's some pretty ugly stuff that goes on in the forums for this game as well that paint some pretty unflattering pictures of the Dev team and the Mod Team for their forums.

I hope I'm wrong, but wait for release if you MUST give it a try, otherwise I recommend giving Starbound a pass.			"

								As it stands right now, I cannot reccomend this game.Starbound is a game that originally caught my eye with what seemed to be limitless potential and a dedicated design team that had already worked on some products I enjoy. Unfortunately you can't buy groceries with potential, and even a broken clock is right twice a day.That said, there are some good things about the game.- Potential. I can't stress enough that this game looks like it COULD be super good once it's finished and it IS still in beta, so you never know.- Sci-Fi...sort of. You can argue this for sure, but it's nice to see an exploration game that uses at least some space and sci-fi elements instead of the standard gantasy game tropes.- Addictive gameplay. If you're a fan of Minecraft or Terraria, you know what I'm talking about. In the beginning you could easily lose hours and hours to this game as you explore and build.- Neat Bosses: All of the bosses I've encountered have been fun and interesting. I won't spoil them for you here, but check out some gameplay footage if you want to see them.Of course, with there being good stuff, there's always bad stuff to go along with it:- Update frequency, there isn't any. For a game that was promised to be full of ""thick and fast"" updates and a constantly growing list of features, there has been extremely little delivered on. At the time of writing I think the last update was six months ago, and the most recent dev blog update is pathetic: A screenshot of a single mob, no context and ""I don't feel like writing much right now.""- Stale Progression: One of the things that initially attracted me to this game was the idea that you'd progress through research, learning to build new things through maybe trial and error or exposure...and the game has utterly failed to deliver on that idea. So far all you do is craft a new set of armour, fight the new boss, and then move onto the next section to repeat. There's no quests beyond the starter ones, no story and overall nothing to do except the same thing ad nauseum.- Uninteresting Worldscapes: When I first loaded into Starbound my loading screen showed a black planet surrounded by tentacles. I COULD NOT WAIT to go find a planet like that and explore the heck out of it. Sure the planets I was on right now were boring, but I could deal...until I found one. I found one of those tentacles...only to discover it was just a reskinned tree. It was chopped down like a tree, fell like a tree, and produced wood like a tree. And unfortunately that's all there is. Each planet is just a reskin of the ones before, with the same landscapes, dungeons and cities. Even the cool enviromental stuff you see at the beginning of the game becomes stale and samey after it's repeated dozens of times.There's some pretty ugly stuff that goes on in the forums for this game as well that paint some pretty unflattering pictures of the Dev team and the Mod Team for their forums. I'm not going to get into it here becayse you can easily find accounts of it all over, but this is a Company i have come to mistrust, and that can sink a lot of enthusiasm.At this point I doubt Starbound will be released, and if it is, I suspect it will be a shadow of it's own potential.

								this game in its current state is not worth buying in my opinion, it took me only a day or two to get to the last sector of the game and get all the armor types, i find myself getting board from nothing to do except explore the same old planets and build ever bigger houses.the bosses were all easy to beat you just use the same tactic over and over again and the monster all act roughly the same no variations between them.and for updates the last real update was in april, and no i dont count reworking old block as an updateand the fact that the develiper atacking and banning people that ask why none of the things they promised were in the game a year on ( now 2 years on)  what every one says to play are a buggy as hell and broken nightlys. you know  you have a bad development team when modder have done more work since the april update then the develpores in 2 yearsupdaterecently cf mods have been deleating post and banning anyone that bring up fail promises of anything negitive abou the game. i believe this is to remove all negative post from the forums so new people that have not bought the game do not see thembe aware this is not the only shade / illegal thing they have done in the past so if anyone that has not bought the game reads this do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!edit so as of the new stable update (aka unstable relabled ) most of the buggs that have been in the game since launch have not been fixed. the new patchs have broke the game so bad that lenux and window xp player weren't able to play the game at all for almost 2 weeksupdateso ya he terrible quest system is still there and is still the only way to progessstill no point to biulding a base, food is still mostly useless, the f up farming in the nightlysthey fu metalurgy coppe + iron =  steal????  i like the longer this game goe on the crappr it gets it does not even resemble what it was origioly sold as so ............ still not a buy recomedation			"

								Honestly, I saw this game being released a year ago, but wasn't really following it. I thought the whole idea of Starbound was quite interesting, but I wasn't really playing games that much so it wasn't until recently that I decided to check it out again.When I bought the game, I thought I was going to be getting a close to finished/complete game since it has been ""Early Access"" for god knows how long now, but that simply wasn't the case.While the gameplay is actually fun, and I was able to sink in a few hours of enjoyment, the game rapidly stagnated for me, which while disappointing, was something I should have known.I neglected to read the reviews on this game, and now I see that the studio behind this game is incredibly disorganized and inept, especially the lead devs. When I asked on the forums about the lack of updates in nearly 5 months, I was swiftly banned, but I'm not alone it seems, hundreds of others have been banned on the forums regarding inqueries to the games stall in development.I would not recommend buying this game at this time, the staff doesn't really seem to know what they are doing, the game is unfinished, and while you may have some fun for a bit, the game is not worth the $15 as it stands.Overall, disappointing with how this whole thing has turned out.

												I've given this game three years and finally came back and finished the final release with a buddy of mine, and at the end of this glorious storyline he summed it up perfectly. ""This game feels like it was completed by a couple of high schoolers, NONE of which have ANY creativity."" Literally, nothing but fetch quests. Like a single player MMO. It gets repetitive really fast.If you've already played Terraria and beat it, this game scratches that itch. That sandbox 2D itch. If you haven't, don't waste your time and money on this one. Go play Terraria.			"

								A warning against buying early access games, Chucklefish dropped the ball by releasing Starbound in it's current state. Do not be fooled by the early game, the upgrading of your space ship, the collection of gear and treasure or the seemingly sensible progression of upgrades. All these positives are fleeting. It won't be long until you've completed all the actual content; obtaining the endgame armors, beating all the bosses and sampling each type of planet, which gets old very fast, given that each planet has copy pasted dungeons you'll be sick of seeing. Afterwards all that's left is to sit and wait for Chucklefish to release more.I've tried time and time again to like this game and whilst it has features that I do enjoy (dual wielding and dynamic lighting) it just doesn't get updated frequently enough. Months can pass without an update to their stable client. When updates are released they are underwhelming. Quite frankly I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Perhaps it'll be a late bloomer like Terraria was. Chucklefish did not deserve my money nor do they deserve yours.			"

								The devs have repeated lied about the devolpment of this game. The store page features false advertisements in both the pictures and description, claiming updates come thick and fast. An update hasnt been released in over 4 months. The lead dev is a known liar, he used to work on terraria before starbound but was let go after stealing sprites from final fantasy and lying to the community about updates, and doing other things that both hurt the community and devs, The lead dev also promised that this game would be fully released by 2013 as well as MANY other promises that he has not fulfilled. Any criticism towards the game on any official starbound forum is instantly deleted for being ""A jerk"" or ""Mean"" (Yes, these are actual reasons stated by the mods and their PR manager.) Honestly, there are so many more things I can say about this game but I dont have the time or patience to do so. Please do not purchase this game or any game that Chuckle Fish endorses. If you dont believe me just google this stuff, im sure you can find more than enough reasons on your own on why you should not purchase this game.			"

								This is one of those games I felt had potential, perhaps it still does but at the moment the game feels the same. There hasn't been anything exciting to pull me back in. After I lost my first charecter to an update, I started anew hoping that there would be more to the game than: mine ore then move to next planet. But I found myself doing just that and it grew stale. Once the quest update came around while I wasn't excited I had hoped it might make the game more interesting. Unfortunatly the quests feel boring and fairly pointless. After a long while of waiting the exciting update I have waited for still hasn't shown up, and it makes me sad because I feel like this game is missing out on being great.The only other game I can compare this to is Terraria which was recently updated to 1.3. I thought I had played enough terraria but then the update was big, exciting, had tons of new of cool things to do, more interesting things to learn/discover and an epic end boss. This game just doesn't come close to Terraria and until a worthwhile update comes out it never will. I have 197 hours on terraria and want to play even more. I don't think I want to play Starbound at all now.			"

												Okie, After playing this game for a solid of 100hrs and more.I've decided that I should give my thoughts about it.It's... Amazingly fun!When I first saw the game clip, my first impression was.. okay, maybe this game is the grindy and more of a farm-base kind of game? But trust me, it's not.If you are looking for a game that is grindy or heavily dependant on questing and leveling, then StarBound is not the game for you. StarBound is a exploration game.The game focus a lot in immersing the player into the StarBound universe.Not to mention the developers did a brilliant job with the multiplayer option that make the game ten times more enjoyable to play with. StarBound has everything.If your feeling adventurous, tag one of your friends to go universe hunting with you, fend off monsters, save the villagers, earn friendship or even recuit a crew. If you are a builder, Starbound offer over a hundred different types / race of furnitures. From high tech to medival and more. Build your own coloney, expand it, rent it and make new friends!If you don't like to play with human or AIs. No problem, StarBound also offer a pet system for pet lovers.Traveling to all the different universe and capture awesome monsters, make them your companion and trusty mission partners.There's so many varity of things to do in there, you can choose to do them or don't have to. It's entirely optional. It's your own StarBound story to tell.Overall experience, highly recommended. StarBound definitely earned its 10/10 at ease.			"

												tl;dr: I wouldn't buy it unless you have a friend that has it but even then I duno. Pretty much mod the crap out of the game to make it worth while cause I duno what the developers were doing over the last few years :(Oh after editing a bit I figured out what i'm exactly feeling about this game. It feels like this should have been the beta and now we are waiting on the real game. So this review is my first and probably terrible but it is mine and if anything I hope the 5 people on my friends list that have this in their wishlist are a bit more informed and hopefull avoid this shallow game.Cool Stuff--First couple of story missions-Space ship upgrading (granted its only room sizes w.e still cool)-Multpile races-Different planet typesTrying to think of more-Procedural weapons maybe-Cool special moves on weapons-Underwater and Outerspace bases-Crew recruting-Colony/Tenants-Building in this game is a breeze and beautiful so it has that going for it I guess ill give it that-Hand created enemies-Boring but rewarding random fetch quests ( you kill some cool units sometimes and i've mostly gotten cool things as rewards)-Rainbow knightNot Cool Stuff--Story missions after first couple-Space magic is really dumb ( i wanted to like it but they should have left that to terraria )God theres a lot-No novakid npcs or tenants ( i feel like they don't even exist, i guess i could play one )-Crafting is like straight up trash as far as weapons are concerned-Magma, Ocean, and Poison worlds ( no reason to explore except for ore and only place to really use the useless boat )-I felt like the techs were cooler in the betas back a couple years ago-Hoverbike ( to many giant hills to really take advantage of it and it takes tons of damage )-The crew recruiting is cool the crew members themselves are useless-Omega super god aweful boring enemies-Stupid enemy ai that just runs into you over and over, really boring-Not so random random enemy generation ( cool concept but ive seen the same face on the same body type 100 time but this time he has spikes on his back )-Pets are about as dumb and usless as the crew sadly ( once again cool concept )-Unique weapons or legendaries are boring and usually really weak ( i did like the magna orb though )This is going to be to long maybe?-Moons are dumb ( go to moon with nothing on it except for fuel, that is just plain old fluff content )-Asteroids are meh ( less boring then moons but no real reason to go there )-Everything about the UI sucks especially for chests ( you need mods )-Basically a lot of stuff is just bland except for all the things that were once previously mods of some sort that got inject into the official game like railing was really cool and the novakid stuff which I found out was really a original idea but evolved from a much cool race call the umm Anyemods or something AnodynesYa I don't know. I'm going to keep playing it because i'm seeing some interesting mods that change things to better fit how I want to play but I don't think I can recommend this game to anyone. Mods seem to be the only way i'm going to make it through my first playthrough because it is just so boring. I played this thing a bit around the time of the initial release and then kept tabs on the dev blog ( like had it as my home page ) for a while and I felt like what they were showing was really cool and then it just took them forever to make. I am not a developer so I don't know what it takes to develope a game like this but when like right out of the gate they were like it's going to be out ""blah blah"" or wait no ""later blah"" I grew a bit skeptical of the game really coming out so after a few years this game was a complete distant memory.So where are we? I'm what a week or more after the release of 1.0 after not playing this game since pretty much 3 -4 years ago and it still feels like it has no idea what it wants to be.The long of it for as long as this has become is that I guess I was expecting more from a game that seemed to have so much going for it. This games just regular? Bland maybe I duno. Maybe I was expectin personalized quests for each race or something. I mean so far the quest system that I was looking forward to is just really really bad. I liked the space station mission and was like this is cool, then there was the floran one and was like woah I really like this and by the hylotl and avian or w.e the birds were called again I was pretty much like ""ya this is just boring now"". Oh and jesus that looking for artifact things with the manipulator that was just bad...ya just bad... really bad.I really wanted to love this game. A game shouldn't make you feel sorry for it ya know, like woah this and this is kinda cool but I don't know what happened with the rest of you sorta feeling?			"

Early Access Review
								Ugh, why can't Steam have a 'mixed' review option? It's a good game, it just has a lot of growing pains and i wish I could say ""wait til it develops more"" instead of just ""Yes or no"". Anyway... there's a lot to like and dislike about Starbound. I won't drone on and on about it though, and try to sum it up.It's got a good style, good polish, tons and tons of items, content, enemies, the map and word system generates procedurally and with a surprising amount of interest. There's quests and ship progression, item and skill upgrades... there's no shortage of content in the beginning. However, once you're through with the quests, have a big ship, and are free to explore the universe, it kind of... falls flat at the moment. I feel there should be, at some point, either more interesting quests, bosses, things to find and explore at the end game. Before the questing, this was more free-form and fun, experimenting and discovering. Now with quests it's a bit too restricted, but.. if they want to go that way, fine, just develop them more. The other part is the ship, making no reason to build on planets. While I like the ship upgrades and progression, I think it goes a bit too far and too much, as one other review said; you can put everything in your ship, so what's the point of building on planets?The progression is alright, except I personally found the bosses to be INSANELY difficult solo. When you die, too, you re-navigate the entire level. Extremely frustrating and annoying... but customization is extremely high, music and visuals, polish and controls, all very high. I think the biggest problem is just later game content and some balancing, but it's a good game overall, I'd just still say wait on it.			"

												The plot is weak and doesn't have strong enough characters to support it. The game is unstable and leaks memory seemingly at random. The gameplay is decent but repetitive and strangely balanced, such as eng-game materials costing a measly 600 pixels.I like this game. I like it a lot. But it was given a full release that's not worth the money. I bought this game in beta thinking it would be good, something special. I am sorry to announce I was disappointed.But hey, other people might like the story and find the programming issues tolerable. I'm not content with the mediocrity presented to me as a game, however. A full release of a game shouldn't have so many technical issues, and if those weren't present I might pass it off as acceptable. They are here, however, and given the game in it's current state I can't recommend it.			"

								Early Access should have some kind of user feedback feature, where you can vote if Steam should block these guys from using this system again. This is one of the cases where a block would be good to teach them not to mess with their customers.I can't express how disappointed I am at this game. They just kept the unfinished game there for what should be around 2 years now, releasing an upgrade once every 8 months or so just to claim that they're not abandoning the game (wich, believe me, they ARE) and that's it. This game had such potential, but all wasted. At this rhythm, the game gets 5-10% better every 8 months... and it still has A LOT to do before it can be labeled as a complete game. They keep changing the already existant stuff instead of implementing the stuff missing in the game to finish and release it already, and change existant stuff with further patches if needed. It's almost like they're stalling, winning some time just to keep sucking from our wallets with the ""work in progress, we need your money to continue"" excuse. Do NOT buy this. Teach them a lesson.			"

It's just sitting there in my library after I made the mistake of purchasing it for both my brother and I.Then I realize it's gone four whole months without an update? And there's still nothing to do? ♥♥♥♥ this 'game', never giving money to Chucklefish or anyone associated with it again. This 'game' is the main reason I have so little faith in Early Access programs.			"

												User interface is clunky and barely useable. Lacks hotkeys to properly manage windows and respond to game. Horrible default placement of UI windows blocking the center of the screen (ie. the player) and no quick way to close them means fast death of something sneaks up on you. Good idea. Poor execution.

								Really wanted this game to be good. Heard they were going selling a Beta, decided to jump onboard. The Beta claim was a lie, this game in 2013 was a barely started alpha. Where I expected a nearly finished game (As is warrented when playing a BETA) I got a game that was not even close to a finished state. This was clearly an Alpha that I was playing, and ChuckleFish clearly lied about it. But, I liked the concept and I had fun with my friends for a short while, so I was willing to overlook that detail. I would give them the benefit of the doubt. They promissed consistant updates and quick development.That was about seven months ago.I have what is essentially the same alpha that I had when I first purchased this game. No changes worth speaking about. I'm not overstating that either, nothing as far as updates go. I'm not one to get mad at developers for being slow, either. I also did the DayZ early access programs. DayZ may be slow, but at least they done SOMETHING. They've fixed combat logging, they've fixed zombies, they added physics, they added a bunch of guns. Actual progress. Starbound, NOTHING.Top this all off with creepy amount of censorship that ChuckleFish has on its forums and Reddit and its easy to see why there are so many negative reviews of this game. Honestly STAY AWAY, this game is not worth your money and ChuckleFish is not worth your time.			"

												While I really enjoy this game, There are a few issues that need to be adressed.Pros--A fun sandbox game, sort of like Terraria, in space.-There are something around 4 millions or so planets to explore (that was the number I read when I got it, there are probably more now.)-There are many different things to do, like farming, building colonies, and so forth.-The planets add many different challenges.-There is a pet-like system, sort of like pokemon in a sense.-You can get crewmembers, that do various things for the ship. Like the engineer can increase how much fuel the ship can take on.Cons--There is almost no point to do any of the extra features. Farming isn't all that necessary, even with the hunger system.-To upgrade your ship, you have to actually build a colony, and get crewmembers to upgrade it. However, due to the new ""upgrade station"" system, there is almost no point to do that since you can live fine without upgrading your ship once.-A very, VERY, bad storyline. You start off in this group, called the ""protectorate"", and basically you have to go through the entire game to  beat the thing that destroyed earth, but there is almost no incentive to do so. You are in the protectorate for around two minutes before Earth gets shrekt, so there is almost no incentive to go through the game, and beat the final boss, since it never really did anything to you in the first place.-The storyline is the same almost everytime, you basically get a debrief from a protectorate lady, that basically says you have to go to any random planet of your choosing, find this ""specific"" race, and scan certain items. Whether the items the race has in their home are useful to scan or not, though, is a completely different matter entirely. This happens six times, everytime ending in a boss battle. Basically, becoming very reptitive.-Some of the crew members, like the janitor, seem to be completely useless, basically bringing no upgrades at all to the table, or even giving your character any sort of buff.-Crew members were, when 1.0 came out, almost completely useless in a fight on account of them doing two damage. -They are still completely useless, it seems, unless you use mods.-You won't even get to use the pet system effectivly, until much later.-I probably should also mention the fact that several features they introduced, whether it was a year or two ago, were removed. As a result, they spent valuable time in early access and removed half the good crap that was actually in it. As a result, many older players aren't all that happy with some of the new features that kind of replaced the old. It sucked out some of the fun of the game.Basically, once you beat the endgame, there isn't much left to do, besides build. I still enjoy this game, however, due to the great hours of enjoyment it did give me. And, I would recommend it, as you will probably get your money's worth for around 150-300 hours of fun.			"

								There is really no use in buying it in this state, or at all really. Dev's are utterly horrible people who cannot take criticism, even if it's logical. And I really wish I could get my money back but lucky for me they are money grubbing fiends as well. But on the bright sid- Who am I kidding there is no bright side. Them making promises they cannot fufill, the devs treating the people who gave them their hard earned money for a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game like trash, and A PENGUIN IN A SPACESHIP, WHO CLEARLY CANNOT PILOT IT WELL, GETTING STUCK IN EVERY CREVAS THERE IS, and many, MANY other technical issues. Actually who am I kidding I can still go on.-There is diversity in the LOOKS of the aliens you fight, but they all move and do the same things.-Many Items and little things that should lead to something, but don't-The story was written by a bunch of 7 year old children, they have all these races and nothing to show for it.-The dungeons and randomized areas are fairly worthless due to the fact that they have one useful thing that might not even be needed for the longest time. and nothing else. No mini bosses, not alot of diversity in the traps and the way they are used.-and as I stated before, NO UPDATES, only some stupid night builds that don't change very much.-And last but not least, They promised us the moon and back, and we should of got it considering it was in development in 2012, They had time, they had people. They just wanted to give us a horrible game for a price that is higher than actual good games. If you really want a good game go buy Binding of Isaac, or better yet wait for rebirth. Unlike this utter crap the devs care about the people and communicate properly with the people, and the updates actually matter.-The only real saving grace of this game is the modders who make it worth about 30 more minutes in the game.So all in all if you want to waste your money on a watered down, broken, horrible, repulsive, disgusting, you get my point, version of terraria. All the power to you. But it won't be my head if you read this and do it anyways.I rate this game a -10/10. They should be paying me to play this trash, and I hope enough people make a ruckus so we can get refunds.			"

								The game is in late Alpha stages currently but it's already showing real potential.Some call it the spiritual Successor to the famed indy game ""Terraria"".Starbound has some good points, some bad, and most of the bad should be fixed over the next few months.Keep an eye on this one, it'll be worth it. ""when it's done"".I don't recommend playing it in the current state, as you'll ruin the game experience when the final version is released.For now, you'd have to deal with:- Currently gear scaling is awful - you can skip whole tiers, and each tier doubles your damage if not more.- Bosses can be boxed in and beaten with a pole or gun alone. They are stupid like a rock.- Some mobs are way too powerful- No save points except your ship.- Multiplayer on public servers is not recommended.- There are many mods that add features the game devs should have added to begin with.- Pixels are a horrible system - you need to farm kills to be able to craft anything useful. Not just metal/ore. Plus, when you die, you lose an X% of what you saved up. (quite unlike coins in terraria)- Guns are poorly available, and poorly available for crafting.- Gear progression is stale, just copies of the same thing with higher dps.- No point in making a permanent settlement anywhere, since your ship does everything and more. Except it lacks storage space.- Shields lack information / descriptions still. It's unclear whether one shield is an upgrade to the next one you may find.- Hunger is a kind of redundant system later on.- Healing yourself is slowwwww and frustrating. You can set up a tent and dig yourself in, but again slowww, bandages barely heal you at all, and farming plant parts gets frustrating due to lack of inventory space.Someone remind me to update this review later.

								I think the biggest issue with Starbound is the existence of Terraria. Starbound was Tiyuri's vision of ""what could have been"" with Terraria, but it wasn't necessarily ""what SHOULD have been"".It explores a lot of mechanics and ideas that Terraria doesn't, but almost every place where they overlap Terraria is the better game. The only things they both have that Starbound does better are building and character creation.If Terraria didn't exist and somehow Starbound did, it would actually stand on its own pretty solidly. At least in terms of exploration and building.  Even without Terraria to compare the combat and collecting aspects would still be hollow and boring.The game is certainly worth a try, especially with friends.  But if you've already played Terraria, it's hardly worth getting excited over.Overall, I'd say the game is maybe a 7/10.  Like I said, it stands on its own but Terraria just obliterates it in every department.Edit:  Yes, the game is early access.  However, early access doesn't excuse fundamental flaws in the gameplay.  If the developer cannot even get the basics correctly, then how can you expect the game to magically be better when it's ""completed""?Also before you criticize me before comparing this game to Terraria, please do some research.  Tiyuri--the lead developer of this game--played a significant role in the development of that game.  The two games are connected in more ways than just similar gameplay.			"

								Logistically, a lot of this game is like Terraria, in space. If you really liked Terraria, but found the biggest barriers to your enjoyment were limited build space, and not being a large green plant person. I've got the game for you. The building system was nicer, but the storage systems were unsightly. In our early games, we had an entire planet devoted to storing materials, and harvesting plants. I've had a lot of fun in this game, it's significantly better with a friend or two. At the point of writing this, I believe they're still in the early access, and making large balancing adjustments. I look forward to exploring it again, when it's fully finished- and seeing how drastically the gameplay has shifted. It was good back in the earliest builds, I imagine as time passes, it will only get better.			"

								In the current state of this game I would have to say don't bother. Not every update they do wipes your characters clean, but the one right after that will. This game can be fun, but not ideal for LAN parties. Servers are almost always needed to keep everyone running smoothly and happily. If you put something on the planet it will disappear after the next update, same goes for your ship. Then at that point you might as well start a new character. The Community behind this game is vicious, but sometimes friendly. The mods for this game can be frustrating to install, but can be worth it for cosmetic looks, or even cheating to get the best items.			"

								I pre-ordered this game (As in I did NOT buy it through steam, and long before it was early access).Coming from that position, it has been a big disappointment thus far. I bought a game that was slated to be finished in 2013 and remains in Alpha state to this day...No, it isn't a Beta yet, people who say otherwise seem to not care that words have meanings.Currently it's a buggy, broken, and thoroughly less fun Terraria which is still going through major game mechanics overhauls after 2+ years of development. If you love love loved Terraria you will probably like this...when it's finished...I hope.Personally I'm not going to touch it again until it comes out of EA, at which point I will update this review. The developer has a LOT to live up to with the next patch and I am not optimistic. It's a shame.Lesson learned kids, be careful what you pre-order 'cause it might suddenly end up in the depressing graveyard that (currently) is Steam EA. Fingers crossed that the Dev's most recent open (and ambiguous) letter about ""what makes a game a finished product"" doesn't speak to how feature-complete this will be as a full release. Really, it's not the money spent that is upsetting, it's the breach of trust and shoddy game that has got me down. I HOPE my intuition is wrong.Until then, buyer beware.			"

												October 13, 2016 - I prefer Terraria more than Starbound in almost every way at this point in time. The price for Starbound, 14.99 USD is probably the correct max price.As I understand it, the game has been available in early access since December 2013, and spent time being developed before that. It got a full release on July 22, 2016.I'm gonna explain what I liked about vanilla Terraria so I can compare that to Starbound.You started off in a procedurally generated world with basic tools, a weapon, and the Guide npc. You then explore, collect basic resources like wood and stone, and fend off various monsters at night. Eventually you'll end up fighting the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. You'll start mining resources underground to further build infrastructure and to craft more weapons and items. You'll fight different bosses and various world events like falling meteorites will happen, offering rare and more useful materials.Eventually, you will be prepared to traverse the bottom on the world, the hell biome, in order to craft the (vanilla) end-game armor made from hellstone. Around that time, you could challenge the Skeletor boss by talking to the npc outside of the dungeon.This vanilla journey was fantastic to experience the first time. The game only became better each time the game got updated, adding tougher bosses, better weapons, combinable accessories, extra biomes (Hallowed, more content for the Corruption, the Crimson biome, etc.), more things to craft, fishing, the Pyramid, Alien Invasions, etc.Now, for vanilla Starbound. I have to say, I hate everything about the movement. Everything.- The movemnt is extremely floaty. It's impossible to calmy step down a 1x1 block incline. Jumping onto a 1x1 block is also far too difficult without double or triple jump.-It's not possible to chain movement abilities fluidly: I can't use the sprint tech and double jump. Using the dash removes the ability to jump for a moment. Air dash removes the ground dash. Blink dash cancels the charge of heavy 2 handed weapons.The Freedom of Movement mod on the steam workshop fixes and sidesteps some of the problems with ability movement, but the weird floatyness is still present.The combat and monster variety is awful.- What's the difference between one flying bird monster and another flying monster? There isn't. What's the difference between a plant monster and a murderous robot? There really isn't. Occasionally a monster is capable of a ranged attack and some of those ranged attackers move slowly. Unfortunately, most monsters sort of just aggro on to you and charge at you. Your options are to dodge, block, or attack it for every enemy.You might argue, ""Terraria was the same."" Not really. Flying eye monsters would sort of fly in an eliptical path to you. This meant you could save yourself effort by not changing what you're doing if they were not going to hit you on their immeadiate flight path. Corrupters would sort of position themselves in a set radius around you and spit projectiles that turn regular blocks into corrupted blocks, which if left unchecked could spread corruption much farther. Zombies would mindlessly aggro to you, but that makes sense for them. Imps in hell would teleport somewhere on your screen and attack you with a projectile that could travel throgh blocks, so you could dodge or destroy the projectile until you could kill them.The bosses in Starbound are boring, take too long to beat, and aren't fun to play against. If you think the bosses in general are acceptable or fun, I'm glad you enjoy this part of the game more than me.- Dreadwing shoots at you while it strafes left and right: You can dodge most of those shots by strafing in the same direction and you only need to react when it changes direction. Dreadwing smashes its body to ground when you're under it: Use a jump or sprint or dash before it gets to hit you.- The Erchius Horror boss requires that you hit four buttons that charge up a laser. You need use the laser three times. You avoid its own damaging laser beams by staying in safe zones by jumping on platforms, waiting for a safe chance to hit those buttons.- It's my opinion that the rest of the bosses aren't fun either.The weapons are mostly boring. Slightly more interesting weapons are usually inconvenient or bad.- Most random loot weapons are awful.- Most snipers don't have a real purpose since they don't typically one-shot enemies who will just start charging at you.- Most two handed weapons are worse in various ways than the Violium Broadsword which you make from a fully upgraded anvil.- The Magnet Orbs are interesting as you can shoot multiple projectiles and can be used as a shield, but does low damage on the harder planets.The npcs in Starbound are empty and without purpose for the most part.- Quest npcs give quests. What else? They give you more quests until they run out of quests. Do they have any meaningful dialogue if you interact with them outiside of quests? No, not really.- Most npc merchants sell bad random weapons and random pieces of armor sets.- The only villan npc you interact with has nothing interesting to say and adds nothing of interest. If you read the extra codex entries, you find some backstory which doesn't change how unneccesary her inclusion in the game is. A generic hooded cultist would have been more appropriate.- Colonists don't really matter outside of Steam achievements- Colonists give fetch quests which are go from point a to point b, do x, come back to a, do y, go to c, etc.The story might as well not exist.- The story is that you need to collect five macguffins which are guarded by boss fights in indestructable, predetermined areas which are only accessable after you look at alien furniture so that you can fight the hentai monster that was sealed away by the space god emperor who sacrificed himself for your sins. Jokes asides, that description is actually far too accurate.I remember seeing this game and thinking, ""I'll wait until it's out of early access, I've already wasted money on Planet Explorers when it went on sale, so I don't wanna make that mistake again."" Well, It's still a fun 2d sandbox game and I've put a lot of time into it but I can't recommend this game. It's not a good product when you consider that this was for sale almost 3 years ago.I'm gonna build some more buildings for fun and I like collectathons, but I'm probably gonna stop playing when I feel that the rng deems me unworthy of seeing the last bugs to catch and the last fossils to unearth.

Early Access Review
								As an ‘early access game’ you might expect to be provided regular content updates and progress through milestones towards a future full game release. This is not the case; the developers’ website is full of deceit, falsified updates and broken promises of updates and ideas. You have been warned, this game is no longer in development - and don’t go believing the lies about unstable 'nightly' updates. This game has lost focus and the developer has moved on to their new Kick Starter campaigns and new game ideas. Putting all this aside, the game is average; it lacks much of the character and charm of Terraria - the game it attempts to copy. Rather than a focus on developing and exploring a random world, the game focuses on a repetitive grind consisting of warp to planet, see if anything good, warp to next planet, repeat. There is no sense of achievement, and the tirelessly repeated 'dungeons' can be overcome with simple block placements around enemies. There is no feeling of adventure and there is no reason to 'dig' deep into any planets, the easiest way to get rare ores is to just run over the surface and then move onto the next planet. If the developer actually puts some effort into this game they might be able to salvage it, but I implore you to take some time to look over the comments, reviews and forums; you'll notice that the developer has taken the money and run. Please don't support this money grabbing developer, wait for games to be fully developed before handing over your hard earned cash – no matter how small the amount - if the industry keeps going down this route it's going to be bad for all of us.

												This game... Oh boy. This game. It's a beautiful thing.You have the ability to do whatever you want in true sandbox style. Build your own colonies, go mining, explore, do missions, explore the virtually infinite universe and virtually anything else you could think of.Starbound has come a long long way since early access, and even from the last update. The jump to the full release is very significant. I still notice odd framerate drops and inconsistencies in performance though. I don't feel it makes the game unplayable, though I strongly urge the devs to work even more on that. ESPECIALLY on the server software. PLEASE. It's my major gripe with this game.Bottom line: The game is exactly what I wanted from the start: A sandbox in space with endless possibilities and some guidance in form of a main quest line to tie it together.  It's the most fun I've had since Terraria.It's been a rocky early access, but it's finally here. Definitely now one of my favourite games of all time. <3 ^_^			"

Theres little bits of lore found in your races journal that hints there is direction, that your character would want to defeat one species, or defeat the strange alien planets... but no, its just craft and mine until you made everything.

Early Access Review
								Starbound can be a very deceptive game.First of all, it looks great. The sprites are very detailed and their animations quite fluid. The environments are all unique and visually distinct from each other, the monsters all look different and weird (as far as I understand it, they're created by mixing various different sprites and messing with their colors, so you'll always find new weird creatures to kill) and you can build some really good looking structures because there are tons and tons of furniture that all look really good. The music is not bad either.But here's the thing: it all looks different, but it plays the same. You'll meet a thousand different looking monsters, but they don't change much. They can fly, walk, be passive, aggresive and that's it. The environments looks distinct, but apart from some instances where the game messes with the gravity or the temperature, they're all the same.My first hour playing Starbound and my fortieth were basically exactly the same. Starbound changes its visuals, but the mechanics never reflect that; you'll always be doing the same thing: mining, maybe chopping up trees, maybe building another house if you're bored. You'll be grinding (mining different minerals) so you can defeat the lackluster bosses so you can mine some more. The name of the minerals will change after that. It's not enough.It isn't that Starbound isn't worth your money, it just isn't worth your time. It's way too time consuming for the limited experience it offers.			"

												[Note: At the time of this writing, Starbound is at v1.0.]I have been told once or twice in my life not to let perfect be the enemy of good. If you allow yourself to get too bogged down with what could be better, you blind yourself to the things you should appreciate. With Starbound, Chucklefish have taken this a step further and not allowed good to be the enemy of passable.While managing to do competently everything a game in the sandbox builder genre needs to do, Starbound still lacks the organic progression from goal to goal that makes such a game stand out. The game does little to draw a player into the crafting system or compel exploration. There are plenty of hints of an entertaining fiction, though they are inconsistently delivered. Starbound frequently feels like a game where development of various aspects ceased when they reached a certain baseline of quality so as to avoid having any one thing stand out enough to contrast the weaker elements. The game has modding support through Steam Workshop, though at this point it would be pure speculation to say whether mods can complete the game experience.To their credit, Chucklefish walked back more than a few questionable design choices that were met with player antipathy, but at the end of the day the bottom line is that there is little to capture and engross an audience. If you are a fan of the genre and want to play a new game that does more of the same, Starbound is certainly that. If you are new to the genre and want to play the best it has to offer, other options exist, most notably Terraria.			"

												I initially gave Starbound a positive review when it was first launched on early access almost three years ago. While it was a poorly optimized mess in some regards it offered a fun and atmospheric exploration survival with a space travel twist, a nice soundtrack and a nice amount of cool bosses.On launch it's just as poorly optimized, exploration has been shifted clearly out of focus and almost all the bosses have been axed. Starbound is a poster boy example of a cool premise for a game turning into something different and lesser over the course of development.			"

												It literally felt like the ""story"" missions were put together in a single week if not a few days.Comes across as they ""finished"" and did their 1.0 so they wouldn't get harassed by their community anymore.5 years for 5 missions of ""scan this race's furniture"" ...extremely uninspired...other content is decent, weapons give you a nice mix of stuff to try out and upgrade, unfortunately later there isn't much use for them.Bosses are kind of fun when your fighting them, but they go quick and there isn't much to rave about until they add some more enemies.There is no point mining apparently, to get all my ores I just planet jumped a couple times each tier, in the cities you can loot every box and chest and get the ores from that, the people don't mind, only if you break their pots...? lolthe NPC cities make it a pointless risk to mine if you are playing the mode where you drop stuff on death.They should be less frequent in my opinion, and the world and digging should be more interesting somehow.The block set is very nice, there is many blocks, furniture, and colors to use if you treat it as a casual building game or are interested in it in that regard.Overall a decent builder, other aspect leave a bit to be desired. I can't help but be dissapointed since I've been waiting since the game was announced and wanted so much more from it. "

Early Access Review
								I've had never been a huge Minecraft fan and I've never played Terraria....like ever.  So I bought this game based entirely on the fact that, ""everyone else is doing it so it must be good.""  I know, dad always said just because everyone else is jumping off a cliff doesn't mean I have to do it too....... But sometimes it's fun to jump off the cliff with everyone else.  With that known, this review will be from a non-Minecraft/Terraria fan and what my impressions are.My first game play into Starbound was solo.  After all, I didn't want to look like a complete n00b when I start playing with friends.  I think I was expecting some sort of 2D Minecraft, to which I wasn't let down in that aspect.  There was mining, crafting, building your home/base all those things that make Minecraft interesting.  Then I see one of those cute little aliens and I'm like, ""oh cool, hopefully it won't attack me at a snail’s pace like the monsters in Minecraft.........ohh, oohh.. WTF it's spraying some sort of fire barf all over me and jumping at me.  Good gods get it off... I'm dead.""  It would take me another few fights similar to that to get the hang of the combat system which thankfully is much more active than Minecrafts.  Being one who likes challenging game play, (my favorite game series is Monster Hunter after all,) this was the first thing in Starbound that made me want to play more.  Hanging out more in the game, discovering that different mobs do have different attacks and there are boss monsters, I've not been let down in this area.  After reading a bit online about how to get a good start, (if you’re a game player that likes to be lead by the nose to everything you need to do in a game then you may not enjoy this game as much...) I felt I was ready for multi-player.  A friend of mine asked if I'd like to join him and off we went.  After playing a bit I've seen that multiplayer is certainly where it’s at in this game.  Don’t' get me wrong, solo was fun but there's just something about teaming up and traveling to other planets, building fancy bases, exploring random dungeons, it's all much more fun when you've got a friend to hang out with.  Throw in some Skype so you can hear each other panic as some monster from hell rips though your group and your set for some very fun times.Overall I enjoy the game a lot.  Even in early access there's a ton of content and things to do and well worth the money spent to buy it.  I eagerly look forward to what the future holds for this game.Pros:  Minecraft style gathering, building, and craftingHundreds of sandbox worlds in one gameChallenging monster and boss fightsTons of content in terms of places to explore, an entire universe full of planetsEach planet has a different feel to itSurvival feels like survival since you actually have to eat and watch that you don't get too coldMultiplayer is tons of funReplay value is super highGreat musicShould only get better with ageCons:Very little guidance.  You will need out of game resources to figure out the game entirelySome monster fights can feel repetitive as they have similar combat modesPlanets can start to feel similar in terms of graphicsDifferent races seem to be only cosmetically different at the moment2D pixel graphics may turn some offStill in beta/early access so there are some crashes, glitches (tee hee) and maximization things that happenPlease note that many of the cons are things that will/may go away or be changed as the game leaves beta and gets more fleshed out.  Overall though the game is already well worth the listed price of $14.99us and if it's a game style you think you'd enjoy it will be money well spent. "

								Did you like Terraria? You might like this game too! I would hold off for now though, its got some content to keep you busy for a while but it seems like such a hollow experience because at the end of the day you havent made any actual progress in the game. Grind, beat the bosses, get the armor sets, then look at your screen because youve just seen the whole game.In most cases I'm the first person to defend developers who take their time and really perfect their game. CF has really dropped the ball on this one. They do release frequent unstable builds, nearly every few days, but in all honesty that feels cheesy. Havent seen a legitimate update for months. I follow their blog, its clear they arent abandoning the game, as so many trolls are so quick to say, but they certainly dont seem to be anywhere near being able to actually add any of this new content to the game in a stable way.Final verdict, pass on this game for now, check in every few months on their blog and see what theyve accomplished. It isnt worth the money right now.			"

								While the concepts and foundation are there, unfortunately the development team is not. Many promised features are either lacking or totally absent. I do not feel like the game is worth anything near it's current value, nor has increased towards it since I was first able to purchase it; regardless of people trying to use the ""Early Access"" and ""Beta"" excuses. The game's blog has continued trying to drum up support with new features and pictures, but a big release has yet to be seen. This game has almost exclusively turned me off Early Access purchases unless the current product is worth the price. This is not. This is also ignoring a lot of the drama due to the behavior of the development team and their attitude towards the community.Save your money until they actually own up to more promises.- August 5th, 2014			"

												I'll start off by saying that Starbound isn't a terrible game. It certainly has some positive qualities. It looks fairly nice; it's a very colorful game with some very well-designed sprites. The mechanics are pretty solid, it feels good to play the game for the most part. It also has the potential to provide hours upon hours of entertainment.But, despite some of these positive aspects to the game, there are huge problems with the game, and with the developer. I'll list some of these below.1. The first of these issues is that Starbound has been released as 1.0. This is a problem because Starbound is not a complete game, there are still changes to the game's features that the developers plan to make in the future, and in fact, some features have been removed from the game so that the 1.0 release wouldn't be delayed, with uncertain statements by the devs that they may consider re-adding them in the future, post-1.0.This is unacceptable in my opinion, because they're marketing this game as complete, and yet they may still end up making huge modifications that some players will be unhappy with, players who spent money on what they assumed was a final product.2. As I mentioned above, Chucklefish have removed content from their game, and this has happened on multiple occasions. I would not normally condemn a developer for something like this, but much of the stuff they've removed have been things they've shown off in multiple dev blogs, content they've spent many hours working on, content that had no realistic reason to be removed. Dozens of racial weapons, racial SAIL AI, local chat, a number of vanity item sets, and much more. No reason has been given for this removal of content, content that was interesting and, in many people's opinions, contributed to a game that was originally very complex in design.This further leads me to believe that this game is an unfinished product, and one that I fear may be subject to additional content removal in the future.3. The third issue I have with Starbound is not so much directed at the game as it is directed at the developers, but it's an issue that affects all consumers of their product; Chucklefish's unreliability. Throughout the development of Starbound, its five year development of which half was early access, Chucklefish have made promises that they've failed to deliver on and yet have made no attempts to apologize for or acknowledge. Several release dates have been given in the past over the course of these five years, and Chucklefish failed to meet all of them. On several occasions, Chucklefish promised there would be no more universe or player wipes, and yet time and time again they forcibly wiped universe and player files thanks to seemingly arbitrary changes to file structure which have never been explained.These would not be such concerning issues if Chucklefish had actually taken the time to explain to their players why these things were happening. Not once did we receive a blog post explaining why a release date had been missed, or why another universe/player wipe was forced.4. And then the storyline. Admittedly, this is more of a personal feeling of disappointment than a glaring, objective issue, but the storyline is so incredibly generic. It follows the most basic formula possible; I'll do my best not to spoil anything, but you, the main character and thus the center of the universe, are one of the few survivors of a catastophe. You escape on your own and have to find your way to the hub world, where you meet the plot device meant to drive the story further. You're buried in exposition and sent off on your quest to defeat the ultimate evil, which had been sealed away ages ago and is finally breaking free. Eventually you face off against it after working with a crew of unique individuals and destroy the evil once and for all.There was once a pretty interesting concept behind Starbound; you were a nobody trying to survive on your own after escaping certain doom, making do with what you could forage and build from the wild. They ended up trashing that idea and focusing time and effort on a boring story mission when their efforts should have been focused on the sandbox elements for their sandbox game.I could likely rant on about this, but I've rambled long enough. Starbound isn't a terrible game, but because of the issues it's had in development, I cannot in my right mind rate it positively. It wouldn't be fair to the people who are expecting to buy a complete title. As far as I'm concerned, until Chucklefish is satisfied with Starbound's features and has no intentions to change them further, it's still an early access game.TL;DR: Chucklefish spent five years on a game that they constantly removed assets from, dumbed down the story, broke promises for, and still can't decide whether their game should have new features added or not. Buyer beware, what you purchase now might very well be entirely different from what you own a year from now. "

Early Access Review
								I severely advise against buying this game. Don't be fooled by my listed hours of disinterestedly trying to get my money's worth, I regret the purchase still. Starbound is, by developer admission, molded in the likes of Minecraft and Terraria. However, Minecraft is all about the vast world where you can create whatever you want. Terraria more focuses on allowing the player to create a home worth defending and then sending challenging and enjoyable enemies after it to be fought with a smooth and complex combat system... Starbound seems to be about the developers showing off.Starbound promises so much and delivers so little. The enemies are supposed to be endlessly varied, but they're all mishmashes of a few parts with ridiculous colors and functionally identical programming. There are different races, each with their own background and collectible bonus text; but nothing can ever come from any of it, and the limits of what it means for you the player is the occasional bit of racism from NPCs. The supposed vast galaxy of more complexly generated planets feels very small nonetheless: every planet of the same biome is basically the same but with everything palette swapped. Planets have hidden sub biomes which are supposed to be treats to find, but you can't make anything useful from the supplies of just one and looking for more is incredibly tedious. There is a massive variety of items, but a sparse handful of purposes between them... and an absolutely HORRIBLE inventory system to manage them. NPCs have really nice villages and dungeons... TOO nice, it feels rather futile to try and build your own stuff when the NPCs are handed vast structures of perfectly coordinated furniture with 20 different kinds of blending blocks and a massive variety of decorations. There are powerful bosses and minibosses, but generally 'powerful' just means with all the stats jacked up rather than cleverness, since basically all of them can be foiled by making a tiny shelter of dirt blocks. There are vast dungeons to explore, but they seem to have an alarming tendency to contain absolutely nothing worthwhile. The game pretty much fails at EVERYTHING it does. Aside from merely not having actual content of merit, the engine where all the effort seems to have gone has problems too. The ability to explore different planets is mostly just a nuisance... since you HAVE to go to different planets and flying is slow and tedious. Gathering fuel is a pain and does very little to enrich the experience as well. Though able to run much more complex games well, I found there are severe lag issues as well. My absolute least favorite aspect of the experience is the fact that when trying to explore planets I repeatedly run into enormous squares of nothing that I have to wait several flow breaking seconds to see load. But more than anything I take issue with that idea of blurring the line between developer and player. Because you can't, for one very important reason. The developer is the one getting paid, and the player is the one who lost money. If Starbound was free, I'd be much kinder to it. It's bright and entrancing for the first few minutes, and there ARE some good mods. However, virtually nothing about this game is something I want to encourage or support. Were I to describe Starbound in one word, it would be this: Unfulfilling. It is a miserably unfulfilling, unimmersive mess of a game that feels like it does not need nor want players.			"

												Ah, Starbound.I feel like a disappointed parent. A parent that's watched over a child (or maybe a niece or something) for a good few years, watching it grow, watching it learn - all for it to come crashing down in a car accident that paralyzes the kid for the rest of it's life.Okay, admittedly, that's a bit dark. Allow me to explain.I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Starbound. (Read: Loved. Past tense. Very important.) The wonder of exploring a beautifully created universe and finding out neat little snippets of lore from random books you find in kitchen cabinets and secret USCM bases sounded got me to fall in love. The pixel art’s utterly eye candy  (trust me, that’s not a good thing, I’ll get to that later) and the combat system was - read, /was/ - pretty fun. I had a few complaints with it (lack of content, difficulty comparing weapons, lack of content, occasional bugs, lack of content, lack of content--)For a while, I had a review up that essentially just said that the game wasn’t done, and thus I couldn’t judge it properly. Now, uh...To put it simply, the game still feels unfinished. You agonisingly slowly inch around the maybe 12 different planet types, praying to god it’s just a really long lag spike or something. Could just very well be my computer, but Starbound used to run perfectly fine, and now it’s like trying to race snails through honey. But I digress- that’s likely just personal nitpicking. However. The severe lack of content for what can be called a “finished” game really does genuinely bug me. There’s so many useless little trinkets and pieces of furniture, but at the same time, there’s so little to do- as many will tell you, the story feels like it was thrown together in a few weeks, or, hell, a few days. Some other points to note:-The game’s still uncomfortably buggy.So, there’s this thing where you use a teleporter on your ship to poof around everywhere. Alright, alright, nothing wrong with that- until your game nearly ♥♥♥♥ing crashes trying to process that you’re teleporting somewhere. What.There’s also a lot of grievance I have with the matter manipulator. It feels like I hope that the item I want to place gets placed most of the time, whiiich shouldn’t be happening.-The food system ‘revamp’ or whatever.Food now rots, Don’t Starve style, except it doesn’t fit the game at all and just causes an inconvenience. As far as I can tell, food doesn’t give any more bonuses like boosted speed (I could very well be wrong on this) and instead you’re given a system where all food counts as an individual entity and rots on it’s own. No stacking. This basically just renders food completely ♥♥♥♥ing pointless. For one, you can’t check how rotted something is - which is what Don’t Starve does, by giving it a little bar of rotted-ness. Instead, you just kind of have to hope that the vague ‘will stay fresh for a while’ description means /something/, rather than just a generic term slapped on to 70% of the food items in the game. For another: food does not stack. I’ve said this only a few sentences ago, but I don’t think I’ve stressed this enough. Because of how much random♥♥♥♥♥♥you’ll be carrying around, even having an entire grid of inventory slots for carrying food is not nearly enough.Speaking of the inventory:-It’s incredibly inconvenient.It expects you to carry around an even amount of every type of item (that being: generic things, blocks, furniture, and food). Except it doesn’t work. You can’t transfer one kind of item to another inventory tab, so you just have to suffer carrying 50 weapons even though your inventory is ¾ empty. -Lack of… things.For whatever reason, the item drop rate has decreased dramatically. Now, when you spend 20 minutes wrecking hell on a temple, you’re rewarded but nothing but a few hundred pixels. Which, also, for some reason, are now much more uncommon than before. Everything either drops pixels or some other thing very very very very /very/ rarely, and it’s frustrating. I remember, when I would leave an Avian temple, I’d have a dozen or so new weapons to toy around with. Now, I’m lucky to find a chest with a single tech card in it.As I’ve said before, there’s a ton of useless objects, but at the same time not nearly enough content to find. There’s about 30 different dungeon and village layouts at /best/, and though that may not sound too bad, you’ll get sick of it very, very, veeeeeeeeery quickly. Plus, there’s so little reward for exploring. Finding loot is incredibly difficult, rather than a satisfying, base game mechanic. Really, is it that hard to drop a few more chests here and there? Or maybe give boss monsters actual rare weapon drops rather than pointless achievements? Apparently.You want a good weapon? TOO BAD. Here, have 20 pixels. ♥♥♥♥ you. -The plot.Allow me to summarize:Earth gets rekt.♥♥♥♥♥♥around on a planet for a while. Find a gate. Walk through a building.Talk to old lady (WHO, by the way, has the most ♥♥♥♥ugly gremlin of a talksprite I’ve ever seen) that constantly bothers you over some non existent messaging system that’s never explained. Get a crappy unskippable exposition dumpabout some massive forces beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of eachother and a Cthulhu ripoff that apparently destroyed Earth. Go to some planet. Click on furniture. Listen to her vague generic comments. Walk for 5 minutes past a bunch of ruins, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reward bag. Sometimes do side quests or kill things or do disgustingly difficult boss battles with weapons that are way too weak for that point in the game. Repeat. Not fun.It used to be simple and easy to take in: you’re a fugitive of some kind. Your ship broke down. You’re orbiting an uninhabited planet. Good luck.There was a plot, but rather than dumping it on you with crappy exposition dumps, it was subtle. Instead of it being explicitly obvious what happened with Earth, all you know is that Earth was destroyed an undetermined amount of time ago. It feels like a far off, historical event that has little bearing on today. Instead of having to listen to some ugly sprite condescendingly teach you about some otherwordly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. you read codexes to find out about the world and lore, or just talk to NPCs you find on your journey. Everything felt like it had more personality, but now it’s all soulless and empty and depressing like a suburban neighborhood.They ruined the wonder of exploring an unfamiliar universe. It felt enormous, fantastic, even.Now, you get to click on things.Gameplay!I have a good few other complaints, but most of them are nitpicks that don’t really matter all that much on their own. Combined, though, all these little things - for example, the removal of SAIL’s racial AIs - just add to make the game less than what it could’ve.Oh yeah. And they got rid of racial armor boosts. Fish people can no longer breathe underwater. Bird people can’t glide. And they cut a bunch of other perfectly good bits of content, like apple pie. Come on.That’s dumb.As a good friend of mine put it, it’s a game by pixel artists, not game designers. It’s boring, it’s dull, and most of all, /empty/. It looks pretty, but that's about it. There was potential, here, but they just threw it all out so people would quit whining about them taking a while to build a game.I wanted it to succeed.But now, all I can say is that it’s become a disappointment. I can’t expect there to be many more updates, now, since it’s “complete”, and it sort of feels like the game was shoved out the door so Chucklefish could say they finished a game.I’m genuinely kinda sad about this.

Posted: January 2
												I will preface this review by stating that I have played this game on and off for about three years now.I purchased the game December 2013, merely days after it was released in beta.I have experienced this game from its public infancy to its now-grown-adult life.Nutritionist Robert Atkins is quoted as having contributed to the popularization of the very well-known and very commonly applied quote ""don't fix what's not broken."" Atkins' quote can most undeniably be used to explain 'went wrong' in the developmental cycle of Starbound--that is, the rise and fall of an incredibly promising pixel-sidescroller-adventure-multiplayer-procedurally generated RPG that once held the hearts of thousands of dedicated and passionate tester-players and yet has at once severed from itself those elements which had made it so special in the first place.To not beat around the bush, the biggest problem with this game is that it turned from leaving the whole experience of the gameplay and setting up to the players' own interpretation to a game throughout which the player is handheld in a linear progression of gear and gameplay environments, following a story which is forced down the player's throat and so contextually inappropriate that it literally shows itself detrimental to the game. Indeed, I am asserting now that Starbound 1.0+ would actually be a better game if it didn't have a story. I hearken now back to the days following my purchase of Starbound--as I said, December, 2013: the earliest of the beta releases. The player was greeted with a small, minimalistic message making it known to said player that their home planet was destroyed and that they were now in their spaceship, looking for a new home (or something to that effect). This opening is quick, easy, and shoots the player straight into the 'actual game'--that is, based on a spaceship and beaming up and down from planets. The player is given the creative freedom to imagine exactly what might have happened to their home planet and why specifically they had a spaceship in the first place. Not to mention that there is no lengthy, limiting tutorial section. You are immediately granted the same basic freedom you will exercise throughout the game all from the first moment after you begin a new save. Oppositely, upon starting a game in Starbound 1.0+, the player is forced to play through a confining, linear tutorial level providing a backstory for the destruction of Earth which takes anywhere from ten to forty-five minutes depending on how thorough the given player is in their exploration of the environment. The real issue with the tutorial and game introduction is not at all in the quality per se of level, but rather the existence of a lengthy, linear, limiting tutorial level itself...one which paints a picture of who the player's character is instead of following in precedence of the greatest role-playing games of the past by handing the player the canvas and brush to choose who their character is themselves.In Fallout: New Vegas, the player is informed that their character is a courier whose delivery was violently intercepted and then is let to make whatever else they want of their character as they are nearly immediately let loose in the Mojave wasteland.In World of Warcraft, no matter what race or faction one chooses, the player is let known that their character is destined to be a participant in the worldwide struggle for power over the opposite faction and races and then is let to make whatever else they want of their character as they are immediately let loose in the wide world of Azeroth.In Dark Souls, the player discovers that their character is the chosen undead who is destined to discover the fate of the undead and rekindle the First Flame and is then let to make whatever else they want of their character as they are nearly immediately let loose in the kingdom of Lordran.In Starbound's early beta, the player was let known that their character is on the search for a new home and then was let to make whatever else they wanted to of their character as they were immediately let loose in the universe. However, the case with 1.0+ is that the character's past is very clearly defined within the tutorial. One is not playing a role one creates, but rather one that the developers have created for them. It may seem ridiculous that I have spent so much time criticizing the tutorial level, but the truth is that the problems in the tutorial which I have described are actually the same problems which plague the entire rest of the game.There was a time in Starbound's development during which the only objective of the player was truly to do what they want. Maybe there were incentives to upgrade one's gear and spaceship, but, at heart, the point of the game was to do what one pleases. It was driven by freedom. But with the faultily linear story now present in Starbound, a player is not let to develop their character and write their story as they please. Instead, they are made to follow the path as painted by the developers, only let to progress by undergoing the same line of quests for any character one ever makes. In any of the games I mentioned earlier, one can develop one's character and exercise one's freedom in any way one pleases. In Starbound 1.0+, if one wants to even leave the lowest-tier solar system in which they start upon making a new character, one must complete several quests, the final of which contains the game's first boss fight out of seven. Yes, to even start exploring space in this space-exploration adventure RPG, you have to progress through almost 15% of the main questline.The player is not encouraged to find their own way like they were in the hugely open-ended beta version, but to follow the path created for them.This circles back to my original point. Somehow, Chucklefish Studios, in attempting to move even farther forward with their already excellent prototype, ended up releasing a game that smothers the role-playing element of freedom that was once present in it. The game regressed from a sphere to a line; a role-playing universe sandbox to a series of quests.They really did, in Atkins' words, attempt to fix what was, indeed, not broken.I obviously have spent quite a bit of time playing this game--maybe not as much as some other more devoted gamers--but still a considerable amount of time. This is because, simply, I loved the beta release. I really was immersed in the universe Starbound procedurally generated. However, no matter how hard I tried--and I tried hard--I could not become immersed in this totally unprecedented story that had taken the place of the game I loved. It is not at all the game I spent hours upon hours enjoying years ago.Ultimately, this brings me to my most exigent point to make: I do not recommend this game at this time simply because I am not being allowed to play the Starbound I know and love. The incredible saving grace of Minecraft's controversial 1.0 release five years ago at the time of writing this was the version-selector feature that was eventually implemented, allowing a player to run any version of Minecraft they wanted from the latest version all the way back to the earliest alpha builds. With this in mind, it is also sensible that all the legacy builds of Starbound be made available by Chucklefish to people who have purchased Starbound, as they would only be providing the consumer with exactly what they wanted by doing so.At this point in time, my purchase of Starbound does not directly allow me to experience the promising game I once played and, as a result, I cannot recommend the purchase to anyone else. If legacy versions are ever made accessible by the launcher in the future, I will change this review, for it is only then that the purchase would actually be providing me with the game I was under the impression I paid for three years ago.

												Before the 1.0 Update, my review would've been positive.Allow me to elaborate.The last update before 1.0 would've been great to add all of this 1.0 stuff to. Not take away some of the other content, although maybe they kept some content in, but I just got so bored looking for villages to scan some items in that would lead to some sort of door key somehow. I haven't beaten it since.My point is, the game isn't the same as it once was, and I just haven't gotten used to it, and i don't think I will.Sorry Chucklefish, but you sort of dropped the ball just as you got it spinning of your finger.

												I kinda get what people now mean with having nothing to do post game, I kinda wish there was no story to begin with since it kinda ruined the game for me I feel or forced the team to make certain deciscions so it would fit the story better.-Biggest issue is probably that only a certain kind of planet can appear at certain tiers which kills the ""forever exploring"" thing a lot. I don't really see everyone-Every dungeon feels the same since every dungeon has to include enough furniture for the main quest which also kills the exploring part or wanting to explore more.-Story seemed to have killed a lot of the lore it's all bundled in one galaxy federation thing.-And just a lot of features seem to have gotten removed and not sure why...I played some hours and technically got my money's worth (the many hourse I have are from beta which I enjoyed more than the 1.0 release, in the 1.0 release I spend 15-20 hours but I don't know I just expected more, it feels like they went around a lot in circles during development and couldn't decide on some aspects of the game. I don't know thats just me felt a bit stale in the end, is all.			"

								One huge grind. Get tier armor, fight bland boss that can be exploited with ease, go to next teir planets, GET YOUR A-- KICKED, Finaly get ore from THE SURFACE, Fight another bland boss, rinse and repeat (Bosses end after teir 4). The only good weapons are the swords, which are all bland. The guns are useless. You cant prepare yourself for the next teir, because your armor becomes useless, and so do your weapons. The building sucks, not many blocks.  Their is no need to set a home base, just build everything on your ship. All planets just feel like reskins. Do not Buy! Wait untill its finished, which might be never seeing how many empty promises the Devs made. Just buy terraria. Terraria has replay value, unlike this game.			"

								Honestly, I followed this game way befor the release actually happened. And it looked like everything I had ever wanted in a game. I got so caught up with they hype of the games pre-release, even pre-purchased a 4 pack day 1. Then the game came around and I was so dissapointed. Granted, the game is in alpha stage, but I have played many of other early order alpha games and have had much more enjoyable experiences. Now, as far as the game goes.The game starts out interesting, but gives no clear instructions. You have to find out how to progress using a wiki, friends, or a board, but lets face the fact, that spoils some of the game. All the terrains are interesting, but nothing really to unique. Just color pallete swaps of the same materials. The mobs are unique to a point, however they are rather repetetive in behaviors. I could go on but I dont want to bash this game figuring its still new.I hope to see better progress and updates in the future.			"

												Before I continue writing this review, I'm going to clarify something. I actually like Starbound. It's an interesting game and, despite what people may claim, it isn't just a Terraria clone. Similar, yes. Clone, far from it. To be honest, if someone's just looking to kill a bit of time, I WOULD recommend this game. However, in terms of a game you can really put hours into, I wouldn't, hence the 'no' recommendation. They really need to add an option for half-way, but that's going off topic.Starbound has, at it's core, a brilliant concept, and a lot of that concept shows itself in an impressive way. Terraria might be an amazing game - I've sunk over 300 hours into it - but the idea behind Starbound is, in my opinion, even better. When it comes to realising that concept, it's been done to an impressive standard. Being able to set up whole towns (not just a bundle of houses for a few specific NPCs), travelling to different worlds, an unusual mix of sci-fi and medieval content, various races to play, penguin engineers (okay, not a major point, but I just love how they look like the Prinnies from the Disgaea series :D) and more.The thing is, I don't feel - and this is just my opinion, clearly - that it feels... polished, for lack of a better word... enough to really rival Terraria in terms of a game you can truly sit and play, as opposed to playing now and again. I'm not saying that Terraria is any better than Starbound as a whole - just that it's a game you can get better absorbed in. And as a point before I go on, I'm not writing this review to compare Terraria and Starbound. But that being said, since Terraria is arguably one of the best of it's type, I will end up comparing them at times.It's hard to really define what it is that puts me off, but I'll give a few general ideas. Starting on the least important point - the graphics style. I'm not saying it's bad graphically, but it just doesn't appeal to me. It's too... rough, I suppose. I'd personally prefer a slightly simpler art style that's more refined. Personal taste though. *Shrugs* Think of it like carving a statue - I'd prefer one with less detail but smoother lines, than a detailed one that looks like someone's just gone nuts with a saw :)Secondly, the 'matter manipulator', the means for mining and the like. It's an interesting idea, but it's just awkward. You shoot it at an area of blocks, some of which take longer than others to mine, and sometimes targeting far more than you want to. Same with placing - you end up placing more than you intend to. It's a real pain in the backside. Though this can, thankfully, be changed through modding (there is a mod on workshop at the moment that lets you change the size of affected area. Bless the modder who did that) it really should be something the game itself allows.EDIT : Turns out there is a way, it just wasn't anywhere in tutorial either pre-patch or post-patch. Really should have been. Thanks to The Lost Sentinel for tip :) Still think matter manipulator is just awkward to use compared to the tools you find in Terraria though... Possibly the largest put-off for me, though, is the way in which the game runs. Okay, I'll admit, my laptop is fairly... rubbish, to put it mildly. But it doesn't have any problem running most games - ones with much higher processing requirements run fine. It isn't a hardware issue, in short. But it just feels more clunky than other games. For those of you who can make sense of what I'm about to say, it's like it's slower without actually being slower. Go figure.Staying on the topic of issues, but taking a slight detour, I first played Starbound a long whilst before it was 'released'. Probably a year or so ago. What I've mentioned so far were issues that bothered me even then. Since I last played though, the game's been through two patches : the combat update (I think it was called, but whatever) and the full release update. I'm not wholly sure which changes I'm about to mention come from which patch, but it doesn't really matter. For the purposes of this review, I'm just going to combine the changes and refer to them as the patch, singular. Less confusing that way :)So... for one thing, this new storyline. Under most circumstances, I believe games need a strong story to them to be really great. I'm a writer, so stories are important to me. This though... honestly, I think Starbound was better off without it. For one thing, it's the sort of game where you don't really want a story that much - you just want to play the game. Before the patch, yes, you had to advance a storyline to get certain things, but it wasn't half as strict as the new one. Your actions are very much forced now, as opposed to having a bit more freedom with the old one. Sandbox games really shouldn't be so restrictive. And as a slightly minor point, this new storyline is... I'd say bizarre, but that'd be stretching the truth. Let's just say I really, really don't like it. It offends my inner writer at how bad it is. The occasional humour (I will admit I like the slightly sarcastic and/or weird nature of SAILs new dialogue) doesn't make it up for me. At all.Second, the new system where you can equip an item in each hand (two-handed items notwithstanding). It's an interesting idea - but I don't feel it suits the genre at all. This isn't Skyrim. The old system where you had singular items was honestly much better in my opinion. I admit that the system has potential, but it doesn't seem to fit into the game too well. And I'll make the next point as a continuation of this one, since they mine similar territory - the ability to scroll through the quickbars with the mouse wheel. Helpful, of course - but they really shouldn't have included the matter manipulator as part of that bar. It kind of gets in the way, especially since it sits right in the middle of the two halves of the toolbar.My third point - and I'm going to make this the final point, because this review's long enough as it is - is somewhat more... unsure. It's possible I'm imagining it, but I swear there used to be more crafting options available (e.g. copper-based armour). I like the way the crafting menus are spread out now - less packed and headache-inducing - but there seems to have been a reduction in options. As I've said, I could be wrong. Been many months since I last played. But there just seems to be stuff missing.I could go on, but I won't. I think I've made my point, really. So I'll finish with a simply summary. Starbound has an absolutely huge amount of potential, far more than Terraria ever did. But there are too many things that just don't feel polished enough, or don't really seem to work with the game type. I don't deny that this game is fun, as game's go, and it's a definite recommendation for anyone looking for the occasional fun. But it's also not something I'd advise if you're looking for a game you can really sink your teeth in to.As a final point of clarification, this is just my opinion. I'm sure there are plenty of people who disagree with most, or all, of the above points. Since I wrote the review, this should be common sense to realise, but hey, who said the whole world had common sense?I'd hope no-one, or he'd need to spend time in an asylum for being hopelessly optimistic.

												I have about 48 hours into version 1.0 so far. I played the stable Beta before this for over 200 hours. I'm keeping my recommendation as ""no"" due to the VERY bad storyline mechanics and missing techs. tl;dr: Get this game if you want to play Terraria in space. Don't get this game if you want a storyline or hate fetch quests.Full Review:You get a space ship and fly around the universe exploring random planets, towns, and areas. Think Terraria in space but with infinite worlds. I spent a lot of my time building colonies with the insanely responsive and customizable building system. It blows Terraria and vanilla Minecraft out of the water with block customization and the smoothness of the building process.That said, it's not without A LOT of flaws. The thing that sticks out right away is the loss of over 20 unique ""techs"" that really gave this game immense flavour in the beta. Instead we're forced to use *yawn* basic techs that are the same vanilla flavour that all games of this type have. Seriously. There is 4 flavours of a morphball from Metroid. there is 4 favours of double jumping. There are 4 flavors of dash. All of the work exactly the same, but with a slight twist. Look up the ones that were lost on the wiki and see what you're missing. You'll cry: http://starbounder.org/TechWe also lost unique storytelling for the individual races during the translation from beta to release. You have races that WOULD NOT become a space cop for earth now suddenly space cops for earth. So say ""bye bye"" to any sort of fun background story you had in the beta.Finally, the main quest is just simply bad. Not redeemable bad. AVGN: ""What were they THINKING?"" bad.You need to get these dragonball like keys to defeat evil. How do you do it? You scan the furniture of the 5 different races then battle a boss. NO JOKE. You scan a race's FURNATURE in order to find keys to an ancient evil. WHAT. THE. HELL? ANY other trope-filled storyline would have been better. Mario Brothers 1 had a more interesting storyline. The Matrix 2 had a better storyline. X-Men 3 had a better storyline. This is an unforgivable fail on the part of Chucklefish.The kicker? The specific furniture pieces are randomly placed in a LARGE infinite universe and you're given VERY vague instructions on where to look. You could look at 30 LARGE planets and find maybe one chair out of 35+ items to scan. It took me 6 hours of boring searching per race. I hated myself for wasting that time. I could have been productive or learned a foreign language. Nope... gotta scan a candle holder on Jupiter.Pros: - Procedurally generated worlds makes exploration feel fresh.- The controls are spot on. All damage you receive is on you.- Building things is incredibly fun an easy.- Infinite worlds in infinite combinations- The weapons and guns are fun to discover and play withCons:- Storyline. Its mechanics is the worst I've EVER seen in a sandbox game.- Having to scan everything and then scan it again.- Reward bags do not scale with level so quest rewards rewards are just bad- Questing, in general, is unimaginative.- Flavourless ""special"" locomotion and move sets- The fans on reddit who think Chucklefish can do no wrong.Once again: Get this game if you want to play Terraria in space. Don't get this game if you want a storyline or hate fetch quests.Was this game worth the three year wait for it to get into a stable ""finished form?"" NO. Terraria made itself 10x more stable and more fun to play in 1/3 the time with less people.I'll NEVER buy another Chucklefish game while its in beta again because I don't hate myself.			"

Early Access Review
								The last update to the stable game was released in APRIL (read the edit). This is really frustrating as new content is not being added to the main stable game that is already lacking a lot of content. For some reason Chuckle fish is unable to sit down and spend time to get an update for stable. Who knows how long things will go un-updated, but I do know that this game will not reach a level where it will be worth $15 for a long long time if things continue this way. EDIT: Finally an update and it only took 10 months for it to come out. My opinion still stands until they show that they can keep an acceptable update schedule, that does not leave massive amounts of time inbetween updates.			"

Early Access Review
								Preface:The more I think about this game, the more utterly angry I get. The developers of this game, Chucklefish, got 4 million dollars in half pre orders, half kickstarter PLUS an early access which did 1 million sales initially at $14.99 a pop and 3 years 5 months from start of development to now and this game is STILL in alpha. This is scandalous. This is litigious. Because they weren't short on time or money and let's face it, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing procedurally generated 2-D sidescroller. They haven't worked on anything but minor bug fixes and superfluous mechanics and artwork for a long, long time. The topping is this game is far from complete.This unfinished game which currently has incredibly dull gameplay, shows no sign of completion any time soon. And at the end of the day, even if it is finished it's probably going to feel as the game it is now. Dull, dry, monotonous. The height of tedium, from building to combat to mining to questing. Every facet of this game is incredibly droll and boring, and I will go into further detail in the actual review segment.Bottom line:$4,000,000 in pre orders. According to SteamSpy, there are roughly 1,891,483 owners of Starbound. Assuming Steam takes a 30% cut, then approximately $19,000,000 in profit.So in 3 years, 6 months and profits of 23 MILLION DOLLARS can not get this game complete.Houses in the Bahamas, off shore bank accounts. Which would be perfectly fine if the developers were competent game makers and made a polished, complete product in a reasonable timeframe. They are not and they did not.This company is either incompetent or conmen. I'd seriously advise against buying this product and view every game this company develops in the future with avid skeptism.Review:Starbound is an open ended galactic themed 2D sandbox game heavily based off the very successful Terraria. But this is also a sad tale of disappointment that profits off the good intentions of the consumer supporting the underdog indie developer.You start the game with a tool that allows you to mine at a very slow pace. This device can be upgraded, but only by use of rare loot based drops. And with each upgrade you need more of this rare item. The game excruciating hands out mining progression, which is a running theme.This is one of those games where building absolutely does not matter... That's it. Building any structures is pointless. I would argue this would be a game of creativity, but you have to unlock schematics in order to get access of cosmetic objects, and these are unlocked at an excruciatingly slow rate.The combat is dry. Quite simply because this is not a survival game. At a time you will have three mobs on the screen, half of which will not be hostile and winning is based more on the tier of your equipment than any meaningful combat decision making.Quest Progression In It's Entirety:Mine tier 1 ore -> Make tier 1 equipment -> Complete tier 1 quest -> Mine tier 2 ore -> Make tier 2 equipment -> Complete tier 2 quest -> Mine tier 3 ore -> Make tier 3 equipment -> Complete tier 3 quest -> Mine tier 4 ore -> Make tier 4 equipment -> Complete tier 4 quest -> Mine tier 5 ore -> Make tier 5 equipment -> Complete tier 5 quest....(This is literally what the quest system is. Developer has nothing but contempt for audience.)I can't wait for them to finish this game so I can ♥♥♥♥ing do the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing again and again and again with absolutely no excitement. Then I can just ♥♥♥♥ing kill myself.And what are the main quests? Mostly a dull gauntlet run to a boss which. Don't be fooled, that makes it sound better than it is. It's wandering through a multiple path procedurally generated environment filled with enemies which more often than not becomes a battle of attrition due to the fact you're just wandering the same rooms which no sense of direction coupled with how you start to inadvertently soak damage because of how dry and monotonous it is. To be fair, the bosses themselves can be moderately challenging as they have patterns that must be adapted to but they are still♥♥♥♥♥♥easy. If you die the first time you'll win the second.What about side missions? Someone needs a cake for no reason, your reward is a weapon that is worse than anything you can craft. Oh boy that was fun. One wanted me to give them a vanity item in exchange for another vanity item and that was my reward. Now this is the most glaring and obvious criticism most players bring up without actively targeting. The established universe is subject to development whims and not subject to any form of grounding, especially when this doesn't factor into any form of gameplay. This is a problem. Having a space terraria style sandbox, but still digging through the mud with a pickaxe and using rusty swords is the biggest bait and switch I've ever heard.Everything in the Starbound universe is a joke or reference or whacky in nature with absolutely no grounding, so you are incapable of being invested. Why should you care? The game doesn't. The races are a joke, settlements are a joke, quests are a joke. And they're all bad jokes in the Douglas Adams vein. The game goes to such length to show how it doesn't take itself seriously at all, but there is no payoff.This is the video game equivalent of someone handing you a bad finger painting and saying ""Here's my bad finger painting! Look at how bad it is!"" expecting you to laugh. How are we meant to respond? ""Hahahahahaha! You don't care at all and I paid you for this! I guess the jokes on me! Haha... ha... ha....""You can have a joke game but you need actual jokes. When Chucklefish's idea of a joke is making fun of their own flat universe... Jesus christ, really? Could you have more contempt for your audience and more self awareness?Long story short, it's Terraria but worse. Much worse. Technically it has more ""content"" but the whole game is dry and dull, dry and dull.Essentially a sprite artist from Re-Logic (creators of Terraria) remade a subpar, stagnating Terraria and made millions and consumers are torn between lynch mob and white knights.The only thing I can say to this games defence is it has a lot of pixel graphic assets (oh very taxing) and it's music is good.This company is fascinatingly cynical, because no aspect is fleshed out and it's not even a focus.""I'd really love to see some more games made on the Starbound engine, its so flexible and easy"" - Tiy Jun 27 - 2015Do you know what this says to me?""We ♥♥♥♥ed up. We don't know what we're doing. Someone please make a good game for us. All we can do is make innocuous content.""I resent this company, for being the most obviously cynical cash grab bare bones example of a game completely supported by hype, false promises and implications.We have enough problems with EA, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers without ambitious little ♥♥♥♥♥ doing it as well.PS. Hey Tiy, I don't think you were meant to use the millions of dollars you got to start a publishing business... Pretty sure it was to just make a game.Note: I edit this review frequently to better express my supreme disappointment of this title and to convey that Chucklefish are as trustworthy as EA.2013 Indie of the Year: You know how Starbound got this award? For just being a popular release to Early Access. It looks like Chucklefish isn't the only one without integrity. You'd think you'd have some ♥♥♥♥ing shame giving an award to a unstable, broken alpha game, www.indieDB.com.2013 PC Gamer Top 100 award: Came in at number 95. Apparently this is better than Monkey Island. Protip: It ♥♥♥♥ing isn't.			"

												So, with the 1.0 patch released I finally decided to get back into the game and an hour in I'm already encountering issues.*Overlapping interface elements. ( http://prntscr.com/bw8p21 )*Interface doesn't fit on screen. ( http://imgur.com/a/oosXP )*Lag spikes despite barely anything happening on screen.*Enemies that can go into an immobile invulnerable state for a short while, but still do contact damage.*Clunky movement. Pits in particular are risky business, and I find myself walking straight off despite barely having tapped the movement key with a full tile between my character and the edge. My spawn point doesn't help. ( http://imgur.com/a/n4Znu )Considering how long this game has been in development, these issues make it impossible for me to recommend it. I'm aware that my 1024x768 screen resolution is on the tiny side these days, but the fullscreen resolution option ingame has it available so it should be fully supported.Similarly, while an Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics card can't be expected to run most modern games at 60 fps (or 20 for that matter), neither is that any excuse for a non-graphics intensive 2d game to lag. Terraria runs smoothly even with a lot of things happening on screen, and I expect the same from similar games.			"

												For a long time, I've been one of the most vocal critics of both Starbound and ChuckleFish.  As it turned out, many of my speculations and predictions came to be true, of both, sadly.If you wish to learn of all the mishaps of the development, the forums of the group I am admin of, Dissinters Annonymous, hold a whole section devoted to archiving it all.  It tends to get handwoven anyway, so we'll focus on the game itself this time.  Furthermore, the game as of this writing, (Sep 16, 2016) and not any prior version.To put it bluntly, Starbound does not know what kind of game it wants to be, and does a terrible job at trying to be too many kinds of thing.  The controls are too loose and floaty to be a decent platformer, and the bad basic enemy AI really kill it being any kind of ""metroidvania"" experience.  The random generation just does not have enough actual variation to it, so all output gets very ""samey"" very quickly.  This applies to terrain, equipment, quests, and creatures.The building is fairly nice, that's one thing i can say about it.  But there's not much real purpose to it besides playing with virtual legos.  The storyline is bland, plodding, uninteresting, and utterly predictable.  The music is pretty nice.  Most things you can do in the game end up feeling very pointless.  Unless of course 2D legos is your thing.Preformance is atrocious.  There is a noted lack of options, especially of the video category.  It's a roll of the dice to get decent FPS, even with good hardware.Overall, starbound comes out as tepid, bland, and boring.  It's your $15, but there are games that do the same things better, and they are cheaper.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm sorry this game, it's developers? They have problems. Look at this list here:http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHyThe developers are unable to take any criticism and the fans of the game are rude and sadly hateful preventing any constructive feedback from getting to them. At this point I can only strongly urge people to stay away from this game as it has the potential to be another Towns. I maybe mistaken, it could in a few years turn out to be a great game. As is? Not worth your time or money, and that is the bottom line.As a note: It remains such a heavily played game on Steams watch list because the developers haven't fixed a ""bug"" where the launcher stays open or sometimes the exe even when you close the game. Shady when this has been reported to them numerous times since this alpha released in December.Edit: It has been a a bit now since I wrote this review and thought I might expand on it a little now that they have released a nightly build feel I should expand on the gameplay itself some. I didn't touch on it in my first part but focused on the larger problems, and plan to correct that now.At the core, the game itself is at present a stripped down Terraria. It may generate planets, but all these are is procedurally generated worlds just like Terraria. Only, rather then most of all biomes in one world they have maybe two biomes per world. Other then that worlds are bland and fairly uninteresting. There maybe generated villages but all these are good for is grabbing decorative items.Next on the list is combat. The combat is, even in the new nightly, clunky. A borrowed shield mechanic from Secrets of Grindia doesn't really help matters much. The monsters are all spazy with little variations despite the procedural generation nature of them. Also healing becomes an issue the higher in tier you go.Exploration, or.. why Terraria blows this out of the water. Every item in Terraria has a use that you find early on. Every biome has reasons to visit it. Every npc has a reason for being besides background fluff. The major difference between them is you feel rewarded for exploring in Terraria. Starbound throws out tons of things at you but none of it feels as exciting as when you get a hook item or magic mirror in Terraria, because these things have a use. They have meaning that makes exploration worthwhile.Now when it comes to fluff the game itself has some serious issues with bloat, lack of direction, and speed of development. The pokemon like mechanic is somewhat of an interesting idea but is half implemented and not done well. The expanding ships are not customizable, the various biomes are pallet swaps. The list goes on of fluff, while core things like selling items and various other necessary mechanics have at the time of this writing been left to gather dust. The whole ""story in a sandbox"" is a big selling point, and there is no story almost to be found!Given how slowly the team works as the game has not changed hardly at all in seven months.. we are left with many things unfinished while they work on silly side items rather then the main progression path.The game has spent three years now in development, and does not show it at all. It still remains not worth your 15. Also as of this spring chucklefish stopped allowing refunds, despite the assurance they always would. Further shady dealings with a team that has made millions and is hardly making any progress at all.Edit2: The 2014 very end of the year winter update of restriction.I'm only going to touch on this shortly for now. The developers have finally put in the framework for quests/missions. Ones however, that bring you out of the sandbox. Only as a way to restrict your progression for the most part as well. You are now metaphorically bound to a hubworld as they are along with most things of importance now set outside the sandbox, where you will find tech that allows you to explore planets after doing a bunch of run around more or less. Also they have removed several features such as temperature and hunger at the time of this writing. Main progression path still doesn't have as much done as should be after a years worth of effort without any sort of effective communication from them on steam.The game is becoming a non-sandbox restricted game with block building tacked on and features being moved to post release, later, or culled all together. I believe this will be my final update to the review until the full release. I still cannot in good faith recommend this game. Not because it is incomplete but how it is being handled and where it seems to be going along with the scant little still in it. The developers spent almost a year not listening to feedback while also not even managing to put in content that modders did in weeks after the beta dropped. The final result of it all is a less open exploration, chore to play ""game"", then what was there months ago.If this is the future of Starbound, it looks bleak.			"

								You can only play a game for so long before you've seen things twice. With Starbound I have most likely seen everything around 7 to 8 times as when a minor update came out, my character data would be wiped. Now although my character is no longer being wiped, there is nothing new being added to the game, which is honestly heart-breaking because the beta stage at first was fantastic. now... Not so much. I would also like to add that the screenshots above are LIES. I saw there first and was excited to build interesting looking builings with the blocks shown yet all I seemed to find were materials such a wood, stone, sand, mud and a different coloured sand. If you are going to show me what I can do, LET ME DO IT.			"

Early Access Review
								Spore 2.0.The developers promised to make a Terraria with times and times more content, but as it is right now, it can't even reach what Terraria was on release date. The game has dozens of reskins for one thing, terrible combat mechanics, weapons that feel so bad that calling them peashooters would be a compliment, pokemon rejects for enemies with AI as bad as their designs. There is no fun in exploration after first 5 hours of gameplay, everything feels the same and lacks challenge.The game does have great visuals, exploration soundtrack and ambient sounds, creating a very cozy atmosphere on pretty much every planet you set your foot on, and building is much better than in Minecraft/Terraria, but it's not enough to keep you playing for long, even with friends.Keep in mind that updates pretty much stopped after the developers got on Steam, and one of them up and left without saying a word, while others keep crying on their twitters how no one likes the game they're making and how everyone with a little bit of critique is a jerk and troll. Don't repeat my mistake, DO NOT buy this steamy pile of broken promises. If you're interested in a game with same gameplay, get cheap Terraria with hundreds more of actual content in. It maybe not as pretty as Starbound, but it's a much better game.			"

								I don't know what to say. I expected a lot, but was really disapointed. I expected Terraria in space, but got something else, something worse. The first three hours were fun, but then it got boring and not challeging enough. I just stopped playing.The controls are odd, I tried to switch between my first and second item in my hotbar and I still don't understand what happened.the crafting is weird. You can't make anything without a wiki.The graphics are not good. It may be a pixellated game, but they tried to put to much detail in it and it doesn't feel right.The multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ed up. I tried it with a couple of friends, but after a lot of trouble setting up the server we finally managed to get miles and miles away from each other, which made it a single-player game untill we managed to get into space again.The enemies are Overpowered or Underpowered. I or really easily kill them or I get powned by them, and both isn't fun. I don't mind if it is a little challeging, but this isn't challeging, this is impossible or way to easy.I just don't like and recommend this game.			"

								""Updates will come thick and fast, though, as we listen to your feedback, push fixes and add new content"", the game's developers claim in Starbound's Early Access blurb. Allow me to be blunt here - that's an utter, absolute lie.I'll elaborate. As an Early Access product, Starbound was released in a very basic, unfinished state and while that was to be expected, Chucklefish seemingly lost any and all motivation they had to actually work on this game as their first couple of paychecks came in. Thanks to a Kickstarter-esque early backing scheme plus getting their game on Steam, they made a very decent amount of money quite early on and then grew lazy on their laurels. Once they'd released a handful of post-launch hotfixes, Chucklefish redirected all their attention to idling about on their official forum, subreddit and Twitter accounts, to taking a long vacation and moving their office across the world and even getting a puppy for it so it doesn't look quite as empty, but the actual work they did on their game was lackluster in anything except for controversy. Updates never came thick and fast; they were largely cosmetic and took ages to be released. The last update was rolled out approximately three months ago and the Starbound team does a great job at consistently ignoring community feedback (unless passing off modders' content as their own counts).As far as I'm concerned, Starbound is a trainwreck of a game and Chucklefish is a bunch of borderline fraudulent people. Don't spend any money on this game until - if - they get their act straightened out and actually start doing their jobs instead of spending their money.Update: This image nicely displays how Starbound's ""development"" process has been coming along. Do note that while it has yet to be updated to reflect blog posts and what-not made during the months of July and August as of this review's update, there's been no game updates whatsoever in that period of time.http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140704032751/nochuckles/images/1/15/Calendar.png "

								Starbound will never be finished.Chucklefish is the most disappointing game dev I've seen yet.Hopefully the problems that they have with Starbound never manifest in their other games, because despite how little faith I have in them, Stardew Valley and the pirate game do look interesting.But it's a pipe dream. Expect more endless alpha. Expect no leeway to critique the games without being hounded by fans desperate to suck off the devs or desperate to justify their purchases, or simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ moderators permabanning you.

								Yes, I bought a ticket for the Starbound hype-train a long, long time ago and I hate to say that I completely regret the purchase. With so many features promised, who would have been crazy enough to pass up on a game essentially being the next Terraria? Sadly, this is not what Starbound is. This game alone, mainly due to Chucklefish's shortcomings as a developer, has turned me off of ""Early Access"" as a whole. Furthermore, it's these games that truly take away from Early Access and Kickstarter success stories with games like Don't Starve, and make consumers hesitant to help promising games get the much-needed funding to help get developer's visions off the ground and running. Promised updates that never came, Starbound is shaping up to be the next blunder of the gaming industry. I'm just happy that I wasn't among the hundreds of consumers that donated more than $15 to fund a vision that never came to fruition. Sorry guys, it's a very big resounding ""NO"" and ""PASS"" for me. I'm pretty sure there are thousands out there willing to say the same thing.			"

												I am not really sure what to make of the final version of Starbound. I bought this in it's early stages of development, and I have to say first off that I think it was a real mistake to release the game so early. It was literally years away from completion when it was first released. Way, way too early. Anyway, on to the final version, and I think I prefer the earlier version!!! The earlier version was more of a sandbox idea, you could just wander about and build things. The final version, though, I really find the alien creatures very annoying. They always attack you and seem able to kill you with just a few hits. When you are trying to learn the game, and more to the point when you are more interested in exploration and building rather than fighting, their constant presence of atacking creatures is very tiring. And I also have some objection to the fact that most alien cratures would be unfriendly. It would have completely changed the feeling of the game had they mostly been friendly instead. There really should be an option to disable or at least reduce the numbers of them. They are literally every ten feet in the game.  So I guess whether you like Starbound very much depends on what you expect from the game.  Recommended? Well, like I said, depends what you expect from the game. I will say yes, but like me you may find it a bit annoying.			"

And based off of what the devs have been saying, it looks like 1.0 is gonna be pushed soon with a lot of features people were hoping for not yet implemented.

								Starbound takes all of the amazing elements/gameplay from Terraria and somehow makes it mediocre and tedious. The controls and interface feel sloppy, the enemy AI is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, half of the game features are poorly or barely implemented, and even though there is supposed to be a vast of amount of content everything feels exactly the same. After playing for a few hours you will realize that all the random generation and variety is entirely hollow, pretty on the outside but totally empty. The game has also been in an alpha state for years now, this game is in no way in a beta.			"

								Stear clear of this ""game"".  CF is a perfect example of how to not run a EA game.-Nothing of a real update since I bought the game 6 months ago.-A Dev will post every month to 2 months on Steam to make it look like they are working on the game.-Game was delayed before I even bought it and I should have heeded that as a warning.-""Nightly builds"" are nothing but mere smoke and mirrors to distract you from the fact they have your money and now they could care less.*Update*After almost a year, they finally released a stable update.  And while there was some improvements, it still doesn't change my down vote.  The biggest reason, any characters you create for single player share the same universe.  This isn't a bug, it is a feature.....  You could strip mine the entire starting planet, have all high end gear waiting in chests for the new character.  At that point, you are just better off staying with the old character.			"

												As a big fan of Terraria, I wanted to like this game. It`s ambitious and the core idea is great, but the developers seem to have bitten way more than they can chew. The TL;DR of it is that currently, the gameplay is not satisfying enough to compensate for all the UI flaws and bugs that still persist after many years of development. What follows is a more detailed explanation of why I wouldn't recommend Starbound.The game is all over the place: It wants to be story-driven (RPG elements), it wants to be a Terraria-like sandbox (which means combat, mining, construction, farming, etc. in a 2D environment), and it wants to expand that concept to incorporate space travel and multiple planets. And that is fine, nothing wrong with a game being ambitious! However, in my opinion, none of these things Starbound wants to be is particularly well implemented, everything is quite bland and par for the course.  Anyway, after almost nine hours playing, I realized that the 'enjoyment X aggravation' scale was tilting heavily towards the latter. Here's why:>> Although planets have circular maps (there is no beginning or end to a map, as it just circles back into itself, which is nice), there are no minimaps of the planets' surfaces. Such a basic, fundamental feature shouldn't be missing.>> Death by hunger comes relatively easily, and the combination of limited inventory space plus the fact that many foods do not stack make hunger management a bigger annoyance than it should be. Also, the hunger meter goes down WAY too fast, as well as your HP bar once starvation is in effect (you could be dying of hunger within one or two day cycles, if you don't feed).>> At some point, when my food inventory was FULL, I was unable to assign food items to an empty slot in the quick bar. I actually needed to have multiple empty slots in the  quick bar before I could do that. So it's bad enough that you can't just eat from the inventory, which is a major UI flaw, considering how often you need to eat*. But then you need to deal with stupid bugs such as this, which requires you to wrestle constantly with the inventory system (one that isn't brilliant to begin with, I might add).* It's been pointed out to me that you can in fact eat from the inventory, by selecting the food item and then clicking an empty space outside the inventory box... which only reinforces my argument that the UI in this game is crazier than a three-legged cat trying to bury its poop on a frozen pond.>> Maybe I didn't go far enough into the game, but I didn't find combat satisfying at all. Movement is slow and the way you swing melee weapons doesn't feel right. I acknowledge the fact that this is a completely subjective assessment, but then again this is how reviews work. Please refer to masterpieces such as Castlevania SotN to see how 2D melee combat can be handled beautifully.>> Bugs, bugs, bugs! Many of them resulting in death and loss of items. The one that finally made me quit the game and write this review happened like so: I died during some battle, and appeared in the regeneration chamber on the ship, where you get the option to skip the regeneration animation. When I did so, my character respawned in freaking SPACE but WITHOUT the ship, then proceeded to die (which, granted, makes sense) and then a ♥♥♥♥load of items got dropped to the bottom of that screen, which is never accessible by any means, meaning the items were lost forever. Hours of grinding into the trash. Cue rage.Which brings us back to the TL;DR: Currently, I feel that Starbound's gameplay is not satisfying enough to compensate for all the UI flaws and bugs that still persist after many years of development. This is not some Early Access game that saw the light of day just last year. It's been out there for a while, and if it's not great now, I don't think I can trust the developers to make it great in the near future, or maybe ever? Yep, lets go with that. In contrast, it's amazing how smoother (as in relatively bug-free), more sophisticated and satisfying Terraria is. Maybe it's an unfair comparison, I don't know. All I can say is I'd rather go back to Terraria than playing another minute of Starbound right now.			"

												""Early Access"" is definitely the proper term for it.  It took us how long to get into a state where the entire thing wasn't being wiped every week or so?Honestly, in the six months it has been since public beta release (if not longer for original backers, though I've found no reference as to how that was handled for us), there has been very little positive change.  So many mechanics are reworked, changed again, and then altered to the point where over about 8 characters I've yet to progress much beyond the first boss for how inconsistent things are.This wouldn't be an issue if the game were internally consistent as well.  Levels feel arbitrary, difficulty and resource sparcity is all over the map, and your luck of actually finding reasonable equipment is something of a tongue-in-beak joke, to say nothing of how ""dungeons"" provide little to no challenge or reason for exploration (unless you want some new furnishings for your space ship).I can forgive some of the broken promises -- they're a reality of development that stuff gets cut when a studio finds them to be too great a challenge or too taxing.  But honestly?  I've expected a lot more than what has happened in these intervening months, and all I've really seen is just ""Terraria the Space Opera.""(At least in v1.0 Terraria I could progress naturally with crafting and resource gathering.)I still must praise the art direction, though.  The appearance of the game is wonderful and nostalgic, even if the optimization is horridly lackluster (and the GL version even more so), and there's something deliciously campy about swinging a huge laser axe at weird aliens.As a time-waster, I'd say it's absolutely worth it.  As a game?  I can't recommend it.  Not in its current incarnation at least.Somewhere down the road I'll pick it back up and see what's beneath all the dust.  I want to enjoy this game, but it needs a little more time in the proverbial development oven.----Edited on Monday, August 8th, 2016Well, I picked it back up, and let me tell you, at first I was truly amazed how far we had come!  Gameplay that did not grind to a halt because weather was happening, monsters that did not instantly kill me because I entered an unbalanced biome, and an actual STORY that didn't feel thrown in to test a boss encounter!All in all it felt like a proper, true progression -- the kind you'd expect in a game about traveling the stars and exploring the universe.  Linear, but not bad.Only, it's not so much linear as ""copy, paste, repeat.""Spoilers Abound Beyond This LineThe story is, quite simply, a bit of a joke.  You and you alone are perhaps the last surviving wielder of the might SPACE CROISSANT, which just so happens to be recognized by the plot-convenient grandmother of the game who ALSO just so happens to be the primary quest-giver.  Very convenient.  Kind of like having a special space station to keep all the critical NPCs in.In FetchQuest Starbound, your primary objective is to fetch the MacGuffins which will seal away The Big Space Evil with a name like the ""Destroyer"" or something very generic.  I have admittedly not defeated it myself, but between a friend and I, every chapter has been viewed in one form or another.And every chapter is the same:1). Go scan some things with your fancy new SPACE CROISSANT scanning mode (press the N key for ""No, not again, why must I scan things"").2). But scan only the Green ones (Colored For Your Convenience).3). Go to the racially-themed sandbox map that involves fighting and / or puzzling your way to a boss encounter!4). Kick its butt or try again.5). Collect shiny.And that's it.Once you have all six of the Very Shiny Objects of Destiny, your Space Journey is complete.And for those of you like myself who have spent more time doing the side quests in an effort to get the biggest (and best decorated) ship possible, only to realize that now you have a bunch of chuckle-heads wandering around your majestic Space Pyramid that keep letting the damned fluffalo out of hydroponics lab, well ... you've probably spent forever scouring the surfaces of planets to scan everything imaginable to decorate with / pixel-print / loot-for-unspecified-reasons-but-mostly-collection, and also probably all the highest level equipment you can craft.Because there's really not that much crafting anymore.  In fact, it seems like half of the equipment is purchase- / loot-only, and vendors are everywhere but seem to have very abysmal stock for supposedly space-faring colonies across the stars.  Seriously, does nobody send a care package anymore?That was about the time I'd also come to realize I had managed to see every biome and explorable area in the game; they were ... repeating.  Near-identical copy-paste delves, outposts, and subterranean mish-mosh that eventually I couldn't get far enough away from my starting quadrant to find a map that felt all too familiar.It was a fun 50 hours or so, but it's also supposed to be a giant sandbox ... in space.  Only the sandbox ended up being my ship and I've run out of things to do in it.Hopefully we'll see a patch in the future that adds back a lot of the cut content, like the unique monsters (I think we're down to maybe 30 now, of which you'll see about 15 frequently).  Though personally, I'd settle for more planet and star variance.  Only 4 ""tiers"" of exploration feels pretty redundant in a universe with literal billions of stars.			"

But even early versions of Minecraft had enough about them to make them fun - and they also provided a complete experience.This title is fun, but experience is not complete.

Early Access Review
								I want to start to say, i`m fully aware this is early access, but...From what i understand we`re in the last stages of the beta phase, and so far this game just ain`t going to work.I`ve played a lot of terarria and really liked that game alot, now i will not compare a 1.3 released game with a beta game, but i will however point out the strenghts terarria had and starbound misses.Don`t get me wrong though, i think starbound has great potential,and i really would like to see this game succeed.Now the things starbound gets right so far, is the building, it`s much better compared to terarria, and for building only i would reccomend this game but...As we know this game is more then just building, and that`s where things go wrong.I always loved to mine in Terarria, and starbound is no exception, but it feels wayyyy out of balance, i`ll explain why.To start off with the Matter manipulator, i think it`s a great tool, and a cool feature to add in the whole space setting, but the problem is, once you maxed it`s upgrades, it feels like the best thing there is, completely making drillls useless (unless drilling magmarock)Also, mining is just wayyyy too easy, once you get to risky, or dangerous planets, you`re litteraly showred with ores.Daimonds start to feel like copper ore, and the last 3 high tier ores are far from rare.This unfortunaly completely removes the fun out of mining, its just dig down a little bit, and prepare to find metric tons of ores.in short i really miss the Terarria style mining, where you would need a new tool to mine the new ores and such, or in this case a specific upgrade for the Matter Manipulator.Now for the combat..In the begin i felt a slight challenge, but as soon as i found a couple of better weapons, i felt indestructible, to my great suprise i had end game gear very VERY quickly.The boss battles right now are too easy, none of them provided a real challenge.Also the weapons at this point feel kinda boring, some are pretty nice with there special ability`s, others are just meh.What i really miss are those crazy weapons from terarria, for example a gun that shoots homing bees, and such.I could go on and on what`s missing, but i don`t want to be too harsh on this game, like i said i really want this game to work.But right now it needs some serious challenge in it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now for my top 2 complaints about this game, The performance.... i`m playing this game with my Wife and we both get bogus performance in this game at certain points, i would like to point out we`re far above the requirements to play this game, and honestly, bad performance in a game like this in 2016 is just unexcusable, on top of that i found 2-3 year old forum posts about this problem and the answer ""They`re working on it"" If this game is in it`s last phase of development i would seriously consider putting a halt on new content, and start optimising.My second big complain is multiplayer, You can not use steam to connect to your friends, you have to manually enter the ip number in game....Come on... we`re in 2016 this really gives it a bad look imo.So should you buy this game?Well, if your just in to building, sure go ahead! it`s fun to find nice planets and colonize them.But for all others parts of the game, just no.. i feel like i seen end game content i didn`t earn yet.I really hope this game will work, but at this stage it needs a lot of work.

								Good Game, if you're looking for Towns 2.0.In a nutshell, this is a good game. It's decently designed enough, the concepts are fun, and it's pretty decent in general.Then you get to the Dev team.They censor the steam forums, censor the reddit, censor their own forums, and keep and negative feedback from getting out, instead either calling them trolls, banning them from the forums for ""using an alt accout"", or blaming it on websites they can't monitor and control as well as this.The game hasn't had any real updates in months, despite the recent ""nightly builds"", which test out lackluster concepts in a seperate version of the game. Given that this is meant to be a beta, you shouldn't need a seperate beta to test anything else out.As well as all of this, the game was ment for a 2013 release, but was pushed back without warning, and the people who preordered the game rather than buying it here are being denied refunds.Steer clear until the game is finished, and finished WELL.

								A year ago this game was VERY promising, but the total lack of organization and focus of the devs has lead it to a never-ending  ""nightly build"" operation.For a few months after release they actually released decent content regularly but then at some point they went ""nightly"". That was the end of it. Nightly builds actually means:- instead of fixing existing bugs/problems they keep focusing on new micro-additions, some of which totally useless or just cosmetic (who cares about importing or playing ABC text tunes when tons of items still lack a decent description? )- every other day (almost) your steam client will redownload the bloody damn full game (that is around 1 gig).- sometimes you will have to manually delete your char and world folders, otherwise the game will just crash and won't run (so much for their ""no more character wipes"" statement).Frankly i think the biggest problems is the devs wanted to make this the ULTIMATE Terraria clone game - with every feature they thought of - and they didn't focus on finishing the game itself!  If they just kept fixing what was wrong before starting to add stuff on the to-do list, this could have become a true classic! "

								Please, please please don't buy into this scam. For the love of God, please do not buy.The fact that the moderators of this games boards here on the Steam Community lock all threads that criticise the game or the moderators themselves also plays a huge part in this scam. Shoo away the bad publicity so that even MORE people will buy into this scam. I'm quite sure that there is a large number of people that agree with me, if so SPEAK OUT. I'm quite certain that they're Kim Yong Chillin' right now with all our money.			"

								Don't bother getting this game. Not even worth it at it's current state. The Devs of it cannot take ANY form of criticism at all, and scam you out of your money if you buy the game. All biomes are the same, just with a different colour or background. Monsters are literally, all the same, just with different body parts. The UI is bugged and terrible, game crashes normally and is glitchy. In my opinion, I think Chucklefish have their heads too far up their asses to even do anything right, I'm surprised they know how to breathe.			"

												Starbound ... 3 years in my library.I had high hopes after playing the early access in february 2016.I played since release and in the end, the technical part is really nice when you compare it to an experience as old as Terraria.But the gameplay is messed up in a way that is hard to define. As if the guys who developped this had no idea about the notion and elements of gameplay as a whole.But mostly after 5 years of Early access, what you can craft in game is incredibly shallow.From beginning to end 6 types of armor to craft. That is it. Each type is declined in esthetic variations ... with the same stats.Maybe 20 weapons that are useful to craft throughout the game.No upgrades to speak of to your character.No upgrades to the backpacks you can build to put multiple augments ...For a sandbx game, the posssibilities of upgrade/craftnig actually useful tro your character are just too incredibly shallow to recommend this game.There would need to be so much more variety in terms of boss, loot, techs, progress.Not understandable nor forgivable for a game 5 years in development (which means any hope to a proper enrichment of the game is illusory) "

								Much Terraria, very minecraft, so awesome game, 10/10 would play again. In all seriousness this game is really great, especially considering its only in early access so far. The game is missing a few features/options I wish it had, I don't really care much about bugs since that is expected but the game do miss some important features and I will list them below.● It don't really have a tutorial and since this game is kinda complex and hard unless you played minecraft or terraria before a tutorial could be well needed.● It doesnt really have that many options and no options for controls, atleast not that I could find ingame, I don't know if there is a config file that you can edit but that should not be needed for a game.● You can't delete your character ingame you have to go to the installed game folder and find your player file there and delete it which im sure not many people even know about.Now some of the good points and features about this game.●Awesome graphics and environment for this kind of game.●Nice variation of monsters and they look funny and cool.●Really good and relaxing ingame music, altough I usually listen to my own music when I play games like this.●Copies minecraft and terraria quite a bit which I don't think is a bad thing since those games were good and successful, but the game also does its own thing and put in new stuff which is awesome!●I really love the whole spaceship thingy and atmosphere.●Good amount of customization and species and from my understanding you will be able to mod your characters looks and outfit later on, kinda like you could in minecraft.●Good multiplayer which makes the game even more fun! Nothing beats building, hunting, gathering with friends!So I guess this is all I got to say for now about the game since I haven't really spent that much time in it but I can already recommend the game, especially if you liked minecraft or terraria, I am sure you will enjoy this game, and it is only about 13,99€.

								I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game in its current state. I despise the mission system to the point that I have yet to beat the first boss. Originally it was a fresh and interesting game where each planet more than likely had something that you had not yet seen. You could summon and dispatch bosses at your own leisure to get to the next sector and find yet more unexplored planets full of interesting stuff. Now it has come out on the other side of the last patch as crap. There is nothing interesting about it that I can find anymore. Just an annoying boss and no incentive to keep dying. If they release an option for players to use the old system as a ""Free play"" or something like that then I will recommend from then on, but right now a flower has yet to bloom from the steaming pile of refuse.

												Starbound is... an interesting experience.Contrary to many opinion, this game is closer to being Fallout 4 in 2D rather than Terraria in Space, while I feel Starbound tried to push their idea further than Fallout 4 did, but it ultimately suffers same fate.It has many, many interesting system and game play, but none of them are exceptioanlly polished and well connected with each other, resulting in double-edged disjointed experience.As a person who tried translating this game, amount of work Devs put into this game is frustratingly detailed and extreme in size even after all those contents cuts as they progressed. Notice where I said 'Frustrating', this is because Starbound Dev team likely made common development mistake of 'Trying everything that designer throws at the project', which results in immensely bloated project with number of contents that are seemingly impossible to polish.Main cinematic quests are at best feels disjointed, at worst, it is directly conflicting with interactive building, exploration, collecting, and base management. And that isn't only the cinematic quest's problem.Still, this also means that you can distract yourselves when you exhausted interest from single content to another. But this advantage is mostly unaccessible if you dislike playing with other people.As current price tag of 16.99 CAD, this game indeed worth every penny to purchase. So I will recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								I break a rule in writing this review for the game. It is still in beta, or early access, or whatever we're calling it. But, in so doing - I rate this game at its current state, with no hope of it finishing early access, as such is only fair. It appears to have been in Early Access for quite awhile.I break this rule because it's worth it. This game. It's pretty nice, definitely worth the pre-release price I've paid.Starbound is a breath of fresh air in the 2D sandbox genre, of which there aren't many successful titles. Terraria is perhaps one, but not one I'm particularly satisfied with. Terraria feels undeveloped, wanting, and repetitive. Starbound shares some qualities, but branches out in a unique way that is invigorating for those of us who might enjoy it.Starbound is not a pure sandbox, where you are left to your devices in a single worldspace. Starbound possesses a basic narrative, that you can pursue at your directive, with some sparse side quests for enjoyment. You travel to other worlds, where - gasp - there are other people! NPCs can occur, some of which may not kill you on sight. Some you can trade with, others are atmospheric. Biomes have variety, monsters have variety. I'm not sure how many max tier playthroughs it'll last you until your bored, but I think for someone who's serious about the genre - it should last you at least 60-80 hours worth, as I'm not serious about it and that's what I'm clocking at. So, $15 for 60-80 hours of gameplay? Seems fair. That's not even including multiplayer.Equipment is also a new take in the right direction. You have TWO HANDS. What does this mean? Well, I feel this game actually takes an account for different playstyles. You can use two one-handed objects at once, making dual-wielding items, keeping a weapon and a utility object handy, two-handed weapons, two-handed tools, and all sorts of situations possible. There are also body upgrades, a basic armor system with cosmetic slots, a dye and sign creation system, upgradable ships, one and two handed guns, and many different biomes. You also have a pet, that you can play with, which my lady found very amusing.You also have your computer, which can handle tech upgrades and something called 3D printing. Essentially, any non-crafting based item can be deconstructed, then recreated using money. This is good for builds, as most of the 3D printing produces furniture. You can also find a guitar, where you can play music, and download mods to give you even more to play with. There is a hub that is unlocked that you get easy access to, and where your 'main quest' sequence is generated. I haven't finished it yet, but it keeps some appeal by tempting you with a mysterious gate in an ancient ruin out in space. The main quests are in isolated areas where you can't build, but you get a challenging combat, with a distinguished boss that may or may not have a gimick used to kill it. Very reminiscent of old Zelda or SNES titles. There are also SO MANY DIFFERENT WORLDS in a single save, that it's unreal.Gameplay is solid. I've only ever crashed in its earliest versions, attempting to run different modes for testing purposes. Standard modes run rather well. One patch I had to use OpenGL, but - that lasted a week I think. The community and the creators are determined; I was worried at the start, feeling they weren't cranking out content. Though, they've proven those concerns wrong, developing core mechanics and pushing the game to a more polished state.Some issues? Hitboxes aren't perfect. Some creatures have their heads slightly out of hitbox because they're elongated, and you can't wammy them. Creatures don't have critical hit regions, but I think players do - so there's that for PvP. I haven't tested multiplayer extensively, but I know it works. Descending down through platforms can get tricky since you can't drop through them, and you jump so high. I created a character for my girlfriend, and apparently, I share the same universe as her, as the homeworld her different race, new character has was my homeworld - complete with my base and chests. She has different bookmarks though, so I set her up with an unused planet in the system that she could farm and start off in. Tiers might get repetitive later on, but - playing this game casually solo has still been keeping me interested, at the very least having finished the Titanium tier. The most serious drawback? They update this game very slowly. But, the updates bring solid content, they produce other titles, and they're a new company. Maybe they'll learn from it, maybe not.To compliment all of this, the modding community looks like it'll really take off. The developers are really supporting them, and giving them spotlight. I anticipate with the modding community the game has, it'll be great to see in the future if the game finishes early access - or stops updating. Also, whoever the audio artist is, he's a godsend. The game's music is fantastic, and the art - yes pixel-art is art - is pretty impressive. Very clean, with good animation and articulation. Solid character customization too with aesthetic things to find and wear in your cosmetic slots!My personal feelings on the game?For $15 USD: 7/10, pretty impressive, and I write this with no plans for improvement. Great additon to the visually basic, but functionally deep Sandbox / RPG genre.			"

								Broken promises in terms of updates and basically any forward movement with the game in general. Hype and excitement met with complete disappointment. It's as if the devs have shifted their attention elsewhere. The devs also decided to move their office to a new location right afer releasing the initial state of the game, which drastically halted any true means of progress. They talk about updates on their site often, but they barely ever impliment them. When they do, none of them are game changing.This is the kind of thing that makes me want to steer clear of early access more and more. When this happens to a different game in the same nature, my friend likes to label it as being ""starbounded"".			"

Edit: Please stop saying this review is unhelpful because you disagree.As a preface, I had been following Starbound since it's first announcement, purchased it the day it came onto Steam (a copy for me and a friend) and have been following development on and off for a few years. Recorded playtime wise, I don't seem reliable, but I have been watching this game flourish- or moderately expand in this case.If you don't know what Starbound is, it is a 2 dimensional procedurally generated sandbox RPG, bearing many similarities to Terraria if you've ever seen/played that. I'm sure other reviews go into depth on exactly what Starbound is, so I won't waste your time and will instead explain why I do not recommend this game.Pros:Relaxing soundtrack.Able to make your own colony (not really as cool as you would expect, unfortunately).Co-Op and multiplayer can be fun if you have people to play with.Planet coordinates system is really cool if you want to explore a planet that someone else has discovered.Cons:The progression system seems unbalanced.The procedurally generated content doesn't ever surprise you or seem unique. Once you've seen one thing you've seen it all.Many features in the game are simply fluff that contribute no real value overall.Interesting features removed during development.Missing critical features that really should be here.Side-questing seems completely boring at worst and pointless at best.The Issue with StarboundI can't seem to find the right words to make this super lengthy and in detail (third time trying to write this section), so I'm going to simply touch on the issues that stuck out to me in the cons section above.The progression system seems unbalanced. - So Starbound has crafting, looting, and buying and selling. These ideas tend to clash with each other more often than not which makes the progression system speedy for some parts and slow for others. For instance, crafting weaponry for the first few hours is seemingly useless as almost all the loot you find will be better. Then as you take on harder monsters, loot you find will become useless in favor of crafting. It's the opposite for armor in the beginning. You'll find almost no armor requiring you to craft it. If you do find any in loot, it'll almost be guarenteed to be worse than your current stuff due to how all armor is defined in tiers. It's inconsistent.The procedurally generated content doesn't ever surprise you or seem unique. Once you've seen one thing you've seen it all. - This is heartbreaking because it's the soul of Starbound. The pool for parts that the planet generator picks from feels really small, as almost all your planets will look and feel exactly the same. For a game that has you jumping across the universe, it's really jarring when you warp lightyears away to a distant planet only to see that the major difference is the leaves are white and slightly bushy. The same goes for the creatures you find. Creatures are either unique, procedurally generated, or bosses. Unique are specifically created by the developers as are bosses. You'll end up running into the exact same unique creatures more often than not and it really makes the planets feel even more uniform. Once in a while you'll find a generated one, but they seem so uninspired and not-fleshed-out that you'll probably wonder what the point is anyway.Many features in the game are simply fluff that contribute no real value overall. - The game has a story. This is a good thing as it will provide a decent amount of base content for you. Unfortunately once you're done with that, there really doesn't feel like there's a point to continue playing. Yes, you can create a colony which is an interesting feature. Yes, you can go around collecting various creatures from different planets to make a zoo of sorts (which would be much more interesting if the creatures were more diverse). But the problem is this: there is no point other than personal satisfaction. This is a good thing for some and if it is, more power to you. However, some people like myself need a good incentive to use these features. Why make a colony when you can have a crew and can visit the Outpost for buying and selling? It's a decently fleshed out feature but ultimately pointless. I'm sorry to make the comparison, but in Terraria having a colony was essential because there were no other alternatives. Why make a zoo or catch a companion if you already fare well by yourself in combat, and the creatures aren't interesting in their own right?Interesting features removed during development. - So when Starbound was first released here, it had a hunger system, a dynamic temperature system, an enemy leveling system, a destruction system, and a few others I can't recall. Hunger recently came back which was received happily, but most of the other systems have been watered down and spread out across the game to the point where they're barely recognizable. Temperature is just now extremely cold planets or extremely hot planets all the time which are circumvented by wearing a magical backpack. Enemy leveling is now simple overall planet threat level (which is far less interesting and dynamic). The destruction system was almost completely removed (you could shoot out walls and break things with projectiles, which some people disliked but I found it to be an interesting mechanic).Missing critical features that really should be here. - The game has no pause function. Some people will argue to the death saying that the game does not need one. Here's the thing- this isn't Dark Souls. You're not often in super-intense situations where pausing the game would cheapen the effect. This isn't so much a problem on casual difficulty, but if you have the hunger system enabled, hit esc to go tend to something, you may be surprised to find yourself back on the ship with 30% lost money and most of your items gone since you starved to death in your absence. This is something that really irks me. Being able to pause in any game is absolutely essential. If somebody knocks at my door, I shouldn't need to be in a situation where I either need to save and quit (losing any progress if on a planet since you're warped back to the ship on load) or risk losing all my stuff and some money because my character starves while I'm away. The excuses that have been given to this issue are even more outlandish, being along the likes of, ""This would break multiplayer"" and ""Single player is basically local client side multiplayer"" in which case I would point to Minecraft which also has a perfectly functional pause menu while having everything done on a local server. The game also doesn't have any sort of auto-saving of any capacity- or even conventional saving. In order to save, you must save and quit to the menu. No mid-game saving and if your game crashes or power goes out, then you've lost all progress from your previous save which could easily be hour wasted. I never judged the game too harshly about this and figured it would surely be added when the game was released. Unfortunately, this is not the case and is mind boggling that the game managed to go through almost 3 years of QA in the form of Early Access and still not have this.Side-questing seems completely boring at worst and pointless at best. - This game also has questing- which is also a good thing as it adds variety. Unfortunately it's similar to most of the other features in that it is ultimately pointless. Rewards that are given to you are laughable compared to the effort that you need to put in for some of them. Travelling half-way across the entire planet to find somebody, travelling all the way back while protecting them for a bag that will most likely randomly give me a few torches or some throwing daggers? No thank you.out of space			"

												I just cant recomend Starbound; the game doesn't seem to be finished enough for that.Biggest problem I'm having with the game is that it runs like garbage dropping constantly to 30fps and even below, and before anyone says that I have weak computer, I dont, AMD FX-6300 and AMD Radeon R9-280 is not weak, maybe not great but not weak by any means. It seems that Starboound is using some sort of framerate ""smoothing"" and that is just messing up everything but even ignoring that: THIS IS A 2D GAME! it should not dop below 60 so there must be some optimization problems too.Second annoyance is that the combat in the game is bit lackcluster that you most of the time are just trying to get and angle where you can hit the enemy because many weapons cant really hit downwards, yes there is better weapons later in game but early on it is still bad. Also going down using platforms is just broken beacause holding down and tapping jump means falling through platforms until realeasing down and so going safely down with platforms is really tedious, just make me press jump for each platform and that problem disapperars, otherwise game is pretty nice so there is hoping it gets better with patches, on a side note the version 1.0 still says beta in window name.

								Starbound sold itself on the promise of Terraria's 2D combat, mining, exploration and building, only expanded to an infinite galaxy that you could explore, to be released in the summer of 2012.As of the summer of 2015, it's a half-baked grindfest that somehow manages to procedurally-generate an infinite number of worlds, weapons and creatures while making them all function almost identically. Performance is incredibly poor for a game that's supposed to run on simple pixel-art graphics, new updates arrive months apart, significant updates are even more sporadic, and the development team expresses contempt for customers who have been waiting for three years and counting for them to deliver on their promises.It's hard to think of a single title that engenders more concentrated buyer's remorse than Starbound.

												An incredible game with a fatal flaw. Everyone plays games like this for one reason, but that reason is different for everyone. Some like thebuilding, some like the exploring, some like the combat (though this game's combat is awful)... But I'll cut right to the point. What is the fatal flaw? Player Griefing. You can destroy anything you want, anytime you want. What's worse? Join a party, and you can go to anyones ship in your party and take anything you please, even trash the place. What's worse? The Fix for this problem ALREADY EXISTS IN THE GAME, but it's unaccessable. Shield generators which protect tiles from destruction exist, so why is it so absurdly difficult for these developers to allow us to use them to protect our hard work? I spent MONTHS building and creating complex and incredible planets and structures... and all I ask for in return is the ability to protect my work from the complete obliteration of a griefer.Aside from that, this game is wildly expansive and feels like the next generation of terraria. It really is an incredible game and I've loved playing it. I have loved the storyline and single player which other games lack, and dozens of the other features that this game features which really make it feel just simply wonderful. This is a 5 star game all the way.............once that flaw is corrected. Because of this flaw, I cannot enjoy my creations with the public, I have to sit to my own self or my two trusted friends. I'll never be able to share my server until this flaw is fixed, so I sadly must give this rating a Not Recommended until this absurd flaw is corrected. Because I find myself not wanting to ever play it again as long as everything I design and build through endless hours of work can be destroyed in seconds by anyone I want to share it with. As soon as the developres put in a reasonable solution to anyone with or without modding/programming knowledge, this will switch to yes and become my favorite and most recommended game.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game at full price nearly a year ago, while it was in EARLY ACCESS. Since then, the game is still not a finished product and is in EARLY ACCESS at the time of this review. It's fun for what it is, but any hopes of maintaining a character that you have built from scratch was destroyed over the last few months after many character and world resets. Though, Chucklefish (the developer) has stated that there will be no more full character or world resets from here on out. In addition, I don't really agree that I need to rent a server just to play multiplayer with other people that own the game. There are other options to get a multiplayer game going, but it's not something your run-of-the-mill gamer will know how to do. There are growing pains when trying to get your multiplayed games going, and what started out as fun slowly trickled into dissapointment. A year might a little long to be in the EARLY ACCESS stage of development.The gameplay and soundtrack were what drew me in a first. It plays similar to Terraria, and having different races and racials made it interesting.If it wasn't for the massive Winter update they had in 2014, I almost assumed that the developers had abandoned this game. Starbound has a lot of potential and can very fun, but I don't recommend buying it until it's a finished product.			"

												Not recommend until they fire everyone that gave customers flack for giving any input on the state of the game, or any input at all. There treatment of there customers is unfair and rude, anyone that used Chucklefish's hellish forums knows that, any input at all gets tossed out the window. Even after all this time now they still have not fixed any of the lag problems that have been in the game since early access.Please do not give Chucklefish any of your money they don't deserve it, not yet anyway.

								I spent 110 hours playing the game and having alot of fun. I then spent 1000 more lurking the steam forums watching the poor game get lost under the constant drama. Starbound was something I have high hopes for only to see them changed at a whim of the developer or in an attempt to troll the community. I would highly reccomend reading other more in-depth reviews but know that I regret buying this. Which is a shame. I feel as a Steam user the developers have just ignored us here, alot of the main problems could have been sorted with clear lines of communication. Instead we are ignored, considered 'toxic', we are a 'cess pit'. No. We have legitimate concerns which have been brushed aside in an attempt to not tarnish their name. Thanks for reading =]			"

Early Access Review
								This game has so much potential, for an early access game it looks as if it would be worth the price tag.  However if you are left handed DO NOT buy this game, with no simple way to change key bindings you will find it impossible to play, being forced to use AWSD instead of the arrow keys completely ruins the experience.  I will not be touching this game until this issue is rectified .... if it ever is !! I say this because looking on forums there have been a lot of complaints about this since christmas 2013.  If they still haven't sorted an issue as simple as this I don't hold out much hope for the development of the game.  A tutorial is available online telling you how to change your bindings using your local files , but I and many others have had issues with this and is not a justifiable solution for a game aiming to be as good as Terraria etc. This said, if you are comforatable being forced to play in the style that suits the developers,  i'm sure it would be a worthy buy, however, don't take my word for this because as I said, i've been able to rack up no more than 3 minutes in game time.

								It's basically Terraria without the complexity.  Theres virtually nothing underground (for the most part), it relies heavily on pixels (currency) and the crafting system is horrible.  This game has been beta for a very long time and nothing has been added or modified.  It has a very linear path that you have to follow in order to progress to other planets.  The combat is sloppy and random.  The resource management is awful, even if you have a pretty decent rig like mine, there are parts of the game that still chop.   I don't know if the developers are still working on this game to be honest, but don't buy it. At least don't buy it yet.  As it is right now, its really disappointing.			"

Posted: July 23, 2016
												In short: Wait until on sale.Starbound is an ambituous sandbox game that has often been described as ""Terraria in space""- far in the future, you are the lone survivor of Earth's destruction and flee in a badly damaged spaceship. At some point your engines fail and you're stranded... but despite the bleak outlook not all is lost. First of all, you've been trained as some sort of intergalactical super-scout and you still have some basic tools. Second, several alien races are known, and spread all around the universe (in fact you may very well belong to one of those alien races). And finally, you quickly come across a hospitable planet with an honest-to-god warp gate, Earth's gone, yes, but you have a whole universe to explore.Starbound runs the full gamut of features one has come to expect from 2D sandbox games- mine materials, craft stuff, get and modify tools, weapons and armour, learn abilities, farm and harvest food, collect collectibles, and generally do whatever you like. The ambituous bit is that in Starbound, there is a very, very... very huge universe of randomly generated planets, each with different biome combinations, gravity, flora and fauna. And the player gets to play as one of  six different species, all of them actually very interesting in both design and lore: While it's always nice to play as a generic human you may want to try your luck as a sentient plant with a passion for stabbing everything, a military bird with religion issues, an ape with a fear of Big Brother, a robot stuck in Middle Age mode, a narcist aquatic philosopher or a living star with the attention span of a tiny kitten. Your choice. Just like everything, really: The game does have a set of quests that will require you to upgrade your equipment and ship, and leads you to discovering the reason for Earth's destruction (plus you get to fight said reason, which apparently has tentacles). But maybe you don't care for that, maybe you just want to find a really cool planet and build a settlement there. Or become a carrot farmer. Or, always popular, build a really large structure out of really rare blocks? Up to you.On paper, this sounds amazing. The full package: Exploring, questing, fighting with procedurally generated weapons and seeing all sorts of really cool creatures, becoming an interstellar badass with the most awesome spacecraft anywhere, and at the end of the day, hanging out in your cool, hand-build mansion drinking space tea? If you are not exited by now I don't know what makes you tick.But: Starbound is really just a decent game. Now that it has officially been released I feel justified to say that the game has barely changed since the last Giraffe update. It does have a lot of very good ideas but none of them feel exactly fleshed out, thought all the way through. Starbound is a game where the graphic designers had all the fun, and as a result, it is a visually impressive game with extremely good building mechanics, surrounded by floaty controls, arkward combat, clunky UI and not even a way to pause the game.The game does look great. There really is a sense of wonder when you first enter a planet. There are tons of assets, not just really very many different biomes, all with blocks you can harvest, but also insane numbers of furniture, craftable objects and decorations. Just the different types of trees you see! And really, Starbound is at its best with its sweeping mellow music playing as you sit down and build yourself something nice to live in. You can actually start settlements and it will attract people to join your crew and net you some nice things. I wish putting up a complex, cool-looking house would be just as easy in Terraria. And I wish it would look as good there because Starbound's pixel art can't be praised enough, it's amazing, it's plentyful and it. is. gorgeous.But then you run into yet another monster that will kill you because of a hiccup in the utterly annoying combat animations. Or you'll fall and slip and drop dead because your little badass didn't stop when you told him to. And that's just some very basic and obvious problems.The sheer scope of the game does not make it better. Endless planets sound amazing but in the end the planets are really not that different and you usually want at least some sort of purpose to travelling. There's also no comfortable way to warp between different bases/settlements/whatever until you purchase ridiculously overpriced teleporters, which aren't explained very well in-game to begin with. Equipment you find can be so overpowered it's not even funny anymore but still fail to give you a chance against an odd low-level enemy. I can't comment on the quest chain, and how long it is, but while it is enjoyable enough to get send around the galaxy and actually do stuff it doesn't actually seem to make things happen, apart from me getting better stuff. Add to that the typical slew of just-released bugs that will need fixing, and you have a game that is often just as frustrating as it is nice to look at.What I am curious about now is how Starbound will be treated post-release. It had a long development cycle and it has taken criticism for various reasons, but in the end Chucklefish did deliver a game with tons of things to do. Only most of them don't work all that well. Will the game that already earned its makers a ton of money be fixed up and treated well post release? I am not talking about mods. It should never be a modder's job to fix flaws for the developers. With some maturing Starbound could become much better. That takes time. Minecraft and Terraria are perfect examples of game that started very simple and then grew into beloved classics. Starbound could do the same and it already has a much wider starting ground. Personally, I hope to see Starbound aging well.For now, I don't recommend getting the game outside of a sale. Terraria has a smaller scope but has been brought to the point where things are so crisp and smooth you'll probably enjoy your adventures on one reasonable large map. In terms of mechanics, feel and sense of progression, it still is the better game. Starbound still is worth a look, and I'd recommend a purchase when it's on sale. Your progress there will be bumpier but gods it often just oozes atmosphere.			"

								Starbound is truly one of the most amazing games that I have ever played. That being said, it is more than just a game - it is an experience, and will continue to grow due to the developers involvement with their community. The artwork is breath-taking, the environments are astounding, and the quickness at which the developers update and expand the game is unbelievable. I am highly anticipating ship upgrades as well as a hardcore mode once the game has been fully balanced. Starbound holds an amazing amount of replayability - with six different species to choose from, all with their own styles and lore. The game is currently in beta as I am writing this review, so there will be nothing but more beautiful features to look forward to: enhanced pvp, species-specific attributes, and more are to be implemented into this amazing experience. Thank you Chucklefish for making this experience, and its community, as amazing as it is. -Bandit Pants  ( A broadcaster at Twitch TV - currently on a one-year live stream challenge - twitch.tv/banditpants )			"

Early Access Review
								I was very indecisive about which account I should put this game on. I think I made the right choice, putting it in my ""meh, I dunno about this"" account. It pretty much sums up my opinion of it. I have absolutely no idea where they are going with this thing. When I bought in, I thought I had a good idea about what I was getting, but with constant changes in development, I really just don't know anymore. Sure, developing a game requires changes here and there, but SB is a game that really has no idea what it wants to be ultimately. It doesn't give the buyer much faith if the Devs keep changing their ideas. I can't possibly believe this game to be a ""vision"" when the vision changes every week. When I bought in, I was given this picture. Like all other early access games, you are given a gist of what's to come. When that ""gist"" is deluded with constant backtracking, and slow development, how can one help but to feel left in the dark?Here recently, there is a lot of talk about ""progression"". What is being described with this new content is NOT what I was expecting in this game. This linear progression stuff that is being talked about is fine in some games, but in a game that uses a procedural generated universe as its foundation, I feel the mechanics will collide.Resources as they are right now serve a very finite use. Once you've made your favorite top tier armor, found your favorite weapons and other gear, the whole value of resources comes to a halt. I would be okay with this if the mechanics change in the future, but it doesn't look like it's going to with this talk about ""armor progression"". It seems as if they want you to eventually find your favorite armor, favorite weapon, and that's that. Like I said, that's fine in some games, but in a game meant to be ""sandbox"", it doesn't fit well.So my question is: Why go procedural? It seems like a lot of pointless work. If I get armor and other items that don't require iron anymore (for example), why have an infinite, procedurally generated universe full of the stuff? To build with? Okay, sure. But building needs to connect to everything else in the game. I don't want to build just for the sake of building. I want to build to store and maintain my value and power in the universe. Not just build and horde items I'll never use again. What about selling this iron? Okay, sure. But if I already got my fav gear, do tell what I'll be buying with this money I'll be making. Resources need to have a constant tangible and economical value in a game meant to have no true end. In a game like Minecraft, having a procedurally generated world works because ALL resources need to be maintained. Since all materials need to be maintained, it has a constant value to all players at all times. All the mechanics come full circle because of this. In SB, the linear mechanics collide with the non-linear mechanics because it does have this infinite universe with resources, but they will eventually fill their finite use. Imagine in Minecraft once you've made a certain pickaxe, it never broke, and it never needed to be maintained. What would happen? You would no longer need to look for that material, and that whole massive world holds no value to you anymore. Now I'm not comparing Minecraft to SB as the same game, I'm only comparing the procedural generation mechanic they both share. I'm not saying weapon degradation needs to be in SB to make it work. I'm just saying it needs something to make this infinite playing field flow smoothly. Otherwise, we are all going to get our top tier armor, our favorite top tier weapon, and run around killing each other for the sake of killing each other. I want battles that are about power and resource. It's the key motivation for any pvp. You can't blame me for thinking that SB was going to be this. So much features promised, and so many different things planned, I feel that everyone who bought in found something about it they wanted, and they pictured their own little piece of paradise within it. That right there is what was banked on. Do I recommend this? How can I recommend something that changes it's tune constantly? It's a moving target right now, so no, I can't possibly recommend it. I don't know who it's trying to please in the long run. All I can say is: If you got the money to blow, and you're curious, go for it. If not, just wait and see what it will be when it's considered ""finished"". Whatever that means anymore.  "

												We did it! We left Early Access! Starbound is an open-world sandbox survival game developed by Chucklefish Studios, and has been in development for a very, very long time. Five years, in fact. It has humble origins from the Humble Bundle website, which launched a Kickstarter-style campaign to fund the development of the game. The game launched on Steam in 2013, and soon joined the “early-access” program where it reached commercial success and was already being hailed as a brilliant game, despite the fact that it was early on in development.Personally? I bought the game around that time and initially couldn’t stand it. I’d recently been playing Terraria and couldn’t shake the feeling that Starbound was just cashing in on Terraria’s success. I was, however, proven wrong. Very wrong.GameplayStarbound, as I said, is an open-world sandbox survival game a la Terraria or Minecraft, but with a Sci-Fi/Fantasy twist. The game features dungeoneering, survival elements, questing, and much much more. After the player starts a new game, you’re prompted to make a character. You’re given a choice of different races to choose from, which are all cosmetic (aside from the “Novakid” race; they’re allowed to craft guns as their weapon rather than the swords other races are allowed to craft). The character creation is nice, but rather limited due to the pixel-style graphics. A nice touch is that you can choose a default pose for your character – something not often seen in character creation which gives a little more of a personal touch and identity to your avatar. After character creation, Starbound’s story (added with the 1.0 update) with the player’s graduation from the academy for the Terran Protectorate, an alliance of all of the universe’s races to provide safety across the stars. The introduction mission acts as a tutorial, and after an entertaining Lovecraftian-inspired disaster, the player is flung into the stars with their very own ship and encouraged to explore and craft their way across the universe.Due to the nature of the game, there is no “goal”, you simply do what you want. Crafting, exploring, building colonies to fill with rent-paying tenants (I may or may not have received an achievement berating me for the poor living conditions in my colony), or doing the all-new and all-awesome randomly-generated quests that NPCs give to you. There is, however, a story.With 1.0, Chucklefish added a story to the world of Starbound, giving a new lease on the lore and feel of the universe. The story is told through a series of instanced missions, and details the player’s investigation into the Eldritch horrors that interrupted your graduation ceremony. Between instances, the player must gather “clues” by using a told to scan various objects belonging to the different races. Each instance ends in a boss battle, and the few that I’ve played so far have been satisfying, blending both platforming and the game’s intuitive combat system.As for building, the game is as good as it gets in the genre. The building is very similar to Terraria’s system, but additional tools such as paint mode, interactable furniture and a wiring mode adds a new depth, and the variety of building blocks allows for some awesome builds. I’m currently working on a shrine dedicated to the saviour of the universe, Big Ape.Sound and GraphicsStarbound has a great aesthetic to it, the futuristic ambience surrounding the planets and colonies really pack a punch, and the pixel art is a cracking way to emulate the sci-fi feel. Despite the somewhat simplistic approach to the graphics, the game still looks and feels great. The character design is also brilliant, and the multitude of different monsters sprawled across the universe never fail to surprise or impress. The penguins, too. Oh lord, the penguins. The music for the game is also beautiful, with an airy and out-of-this world feel to the soundtrack. The music has been designed excellently and really adds to the atmosphere (or lack thereof!) of the planets, coming together with the graphics to form an awesome experience.PerformanceThe game runs excellently, which one would expect after five years of optimization! I’ve only run into a few bugs, but since the 1.0 launch I’ve not managed to emulate any of them. Multiplayer can be a little touch-and-go at times and I’ve heard reports of memory leaks when using a server, but simply joining a friend’s game through the Steam servers is an easy fix. My game runs at a smooth 60fps, and friends with lower-specced rigs are reporting similar frame rates.To wrap things up, I’d say Starbound should be the model that all Early Access games base themselves on. The journey has been long, but the condition the game is in right now is a masterpiece, and I can’t wait for what Chucklefish have in store for the future. The game plays like a more-polished Terraria, with as many gameplay options as any triple-A title. Simply exploring the galaxy can keep you occupied for hours. At £12, this game is an absolute steal and I couldn’t recommend it more. It’s worth it simply to wear a gnome as a hat.There is, however, one criticism…. Needs more Big Ape.This review was written on behalf of TeamTom's Reviews. You can check out the steam group  here, or visit us on our  website[teamtomreviews.co.uk] "

												Wow, if there was ever a game that was so hyped up and had so much potential then it would be definitely Starbound. I don't recommend this game to ANYONE. In its current state, and for the far far forseeable future, it is just too unfinished. Updates are few and far between and the devs don't have a plan at all. They promised nightly builds and weekly updates and even they can't manage to do that. I would also recommend you don't trust the man behind the game, Tiy. Did you know he helped make Terraria, he made the art for the game and also assisted in the business side of things, he was also the reason why Terraria never got full modding support. Did you also know that he got FIRED because of how he lied about upcoming features and gameplay?Let me put it too you simply, Tiy is to ChuckleFish what EA management is to game developers.			"

								Absolutely unfinished tripe, the developers should be embarassed by what they are doing. They've failed to deliver on nearly every promise they have made, and have only created an inferior Terraria rip-off. Gameplay is incredibly weak, the weapons all feel exactly the same, monsters have the same exact set of attack patterns, worlds all feel the same except different colors.Progression is boring, you have to collect a bunch of useless garbage and then summon a boss to kill, repeat ad nausem.Music should be good, but it isn't. It's just so flat and emotionless.Not even the graphics are good, everything looks fuzzy and unclear, and I'm playing at 1920/1080p on a fairly large monitor.			"

												The graphics are nice, the planets are diversified and the towns look lively and I already spend hundreds of hours on it.But.I think there's still a lot of room for improvements.First are the Techs. I miss those from the Beta. Now, even though we have the choice between 4 different for each category, I only use and had needed of 1 of each. Maybe 2 in some very specific circumstances.The playstyles now. You can only go melee or distance. That's all and it's a bit boring, especially because a lot of times, the melee fighter will be disatvantaged and will have to rely on firearms against a lot of bosses.Now, even though the game tells us we can spend the whole game growing crops, well... it's like telling me I can spend all my hours in Zelda in the fishing mini game (I did spend dozens of hours doing that admittedly...). You can grow and sell crops, you can build cities, but it won't help you finish the game. Last, the worst point was the underwater. My hyotl doesn't swim any faster. And she drowned.Going underwater is a real chore and it's awfully slow. There should be a tech to swim at the speed you run on the surface instead of a tech to float.			"

												Honestly, I used to love this thing. I really did. I'm all about building and exploration, and it was great. And then for... no apparent reasons... massive amounts of content were cut. Weapons. Furniture. Encounters. You went from having weapons you could craft at each tech-tier to one of each type, and a large quantity of those locked to one specific race. For... no reason. Meaning now you have to find them, which is pretty rare in the game world.And it's not like there was a reason given for this anywhere, and I've scoured the patch notes. Just. ""Removed."" I'm horribly sure there's DLC coming that's going to reintroduce this... random content.Also the storyline- such as it was- was more or less broken to force it into this new 'protectorate.' Originally each char had an origin tied to their race, but now... they're just a student at an academy in what can laughably be called an intro. I've played it three times, and I still know jack♥♥♥♥♥♥about being a 'protector.' It's mentioned at outset and a few times in the 'main quest,' and... that's it. I have no idea why that happened.So... right now, no, honestly, I wouldn't recommend it. It feels almost like someone realised they were late for a deadline and forced out a half-finished game.			"

								The beta is finally here! Should you get this game? YES if you like the imagination behind Minecraft and the graphics and gameplay of Terraria. It shares alot of similarities with Terraria, but it differs vastly once you see the customization, enemies, crafting, npcs, and weapons, and that is just what is implemented now. The game is still in *BETA* and will have lots more content coming (about 1-2 tiers worth per week). If all goes planned, at release there will be mod support (hopefully Steam Workshop) which I can see making this bigger than Minecraft eventually.Also, if any of you peoples see a solar syster or planet named Sklurm or Sklurmitron-9, please tell me the coordinates!

												I really want to like this game.  But it just gets worse and worse the farther you get.Ok, so I tried it again now that its 1.0.  The game still has tons of annoyances and really dumb game balance problems.   Inventory and crafting menus cover your character.  Enemies that do contact damage in statue form.   I have 2 of the magic gems or whatever.  Already the progression armor is too weak to deal with the insane alpha damage enemies do on contact.  Orange slimes have different stats depending on the planet you are on.  Yes, you read that right.. the devs couldn't even take an idea from final fantasy one and make it so slimes change color as they get stronger.  But good news, they added a pokemon thing where you can capture monsters, so even though some monsters are pretty OP, its ok because you can make them work for you.. NOT!  I caught a flying turnip, and then had it attack another flying turnip from the same planet.  My turnip died from contact damage in one hit.  Enemy turnip was unscathed.  I got a quest from some guy on a planet.  I am never ever going back to the guy's planet because it costs fuel and he is just going to give me some lame obsolite weapon.   Combat calculations -still- heavily favor high alpha damage and knockback over sustained dps.  Combat is so stupid actually that I got a poison bow on the very first planet and its still better than almost every weapon I have found because poison seems to bypass the stupid armor calculations in this game.  Also movement speed slows when you charge your bow?  Why?  Maybe to make the controls seem even worse than they actually are.   And get this:  you have to water your crops now.  I know what you are thinking. rain will water them for you.  SORT OF!  When its raining you have to walk around your farm to make sure the game registers rain hitting the ground.  If you fly away to some other planet and dink around for an hour its really a crap shoot if your crops will be grown or not.  Usually not.I like that my ship has crew members.  I have a bunch of plant ladies on my ship and it really makes me feel like quite a space pimp.			"

								-----------------------------------Just scratching the surface of the game at the moment, so I will modify the review as I play more.-----------------------------------Starbound has to be one of the most promising indie games out there at the current age and time.We all can tell the game was very much inspired by 2D Voxel Side-Scroller games, namely Terraria, but it is truly adding to the genre by a lot. In terms of mechanic, it already feels better than Terraria.The replayability is even more insane now that you can go to different planets. Unfortunately, in space you are pretty much confined to your spaceship. I hope someday some space heavy modes will be implemented, because without that this is basically a different Terraria with many planets to explore.Monsters and NPC's are fun. The native species remind me a lot of Spore. S♥♥♥♥♥ria? S♥♥♥♥♥ria!Quests and storyline is actually very fitting and humorous.Multiplayer sounds fun, I will definitely try it.What I absolutely love is the open-minded devs. They are making this game long-term and they are thinking of the modding community. Sound and music is pixel-y and it fits nicely.The exploration feeling in this game is jaw-dropping.-----------------------------------The game, even in its alpha state, has a lot going for it. It has a crap-ton of content already. What I am looking forward to is to see how it evolves exponentially. The game can only go up. To the stars.-----------------------------------			"

								Given that the pace of 'actual' development--not 'i coded this useless thing' and 'look at this extraneous artwork'-- is essentially zero, i have no faith the team will ever release this. While the team is undoubtedly talented, and have made a great...beginning of a game, it will never be complete, and will never be what it could have been, what was promised, and what I paid money for. I'm not interested in sponsoring endless development, I don't care how awesome 'useless flavor-of-the-week feature X' is, and I don't care how you feel about 'making progress' or 'what 1.0 means'. I want a delivered product that can be judged on its merits. By not releasing it, chucklefish is getting away working on random fun things, rather than what would actually make this a complete game.

									I do recommend this game, however there seems to be the same problem with Starbound that Cube World faced, and that is the lack of regular updates and thus people thinking that the devs ran off with the money and that people shouldn't buy this game. Many people on Steam have said that they rue the day they bought this, but I honestly enjoy it. The reason that I still recommend this game is because it IS still being worked on despite what these reviews say. Yes, it has been a long while since the last update, but the fact of the matter is that the game is being actively worked on and you can see this through the fact that they release nightly builds akin to Minecraft's pre-releases, even if these builds aren't stable for everyone. This isn't me just plugging my ears andd refusing to listen, I just don't get what people are saying.tl;dr, I love this game and honestly don't see why people hate everything about it.			"

								While I did enjoy playing this game, I would not recommend buying this game, yet. There just isn't enough in it. It boasts a neverending universe, but has the same repetitiousness throughout. It's fun and enjoyable for the first time, as you make your way through the resource ranks, defeating bosses and making your way into the next sector, but when you reach the end, that's just it. Nothing more to be done. You can always build something nice, but most of the block variety is uncraftable, and must be hunted out and collected. The bosses are challenging, but can easily be nerfed with just a few well placed blocks. This game boasts potential, but it's been too little too long since its last update, and its grand promises are becoming little more than empty words.			"

								Why did i buy Starbound? Because it looked and sounded charming, a delightful Terraria like game that dipped into the splender of randomly generated content and i was quickly suckered in.Don't believe for a ♥♥♥♥ing second this game is actually worth the money. It looks good, it sounds fantastic on paper, the art style is utterly charming and it was those hooks that brought me in, yet, after many hours of play, i walk away feeling betrayed, annoyed, bitter and frustrated.Do not, i repeat, DO NOT allow the games initial charm to fool you. As i was very exicted when i started playing, being a big fan of Terraria, i thought this game would be right up my street, by god, how i was wrong.So, why exactly is Starbound bad and not worth your money? Its mechanically awful, hasn't been updated in months and the developers are a bunch of censoring♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ If those reasons aren't enough, then try the constant lies, horrendous ""nightlies"" and complete lack of communication with the community.Mechanically awful - The game plays badly, very badly. Combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Exploration is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Character design and progress is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Loot is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Progression is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its all♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why? Combat is clunky and stupid, absolutely no depth or fun to it what so ever. Exploration is an illusion, the game boasts infinite numbers of explorable planets, what it means by that is infinite recolours of the same boring♥♥♥♥♥♥ You get absolutely no reward for exploring anyway, its crushing, you spend hours digging through a planet, hoping that you might stumble across something interesting and useful and time after time you find nothing, absolutely nothing, you may find some silly little village underground and you'll think ""Woah, this could be cool"" and the game crushes you again as that discovery yields nothing, there is nothing to find and no progression via exploration. You progress by mining. And trust me, you are going to have to mine your ♥♥♥♥ing arses off because MY GOD are those ore costs high. You'll spend hours in lifeless undergrounds, digging away, breaking pickaxe after pickaxe until you gather what seems to be a collosal amount of ore, cart it back up to the surface, only to find it barely makes you a knife and a helmet (Which are both completely useless) and the armour set + boss items (Items used to summon in the painfully boring bosses) actually costs 5 times more... and its at this point you realise why theres infinite planets, and its because you need to ♥♥♥♥in' mine them all to get through the game.And trust me, this mining isn't fun. It isn't Minecrafts mining, where you never know whats around the corner, where each block of ore brings you a little pleasure and a little hope, where delight is found in knowing you are ever closer to finishing your next chosen goal, where your hard work is reflected in your creations, where you look upon your mighty mountain fortress or spanning tree house with a sense of accomplishment that only you understand... This isn't Terraria's mining, where every cave is an unexplored bounty of new threats and treasures to plunder, teasing you deeper and deeper with ever more delicious rewards and ore veins to beef your armour and weapons up, just one more cave.... just one more cave... until BAM, you knew you should have turned back, but you couldn't help yourself... but with a smile on your face you dive in again, picking up right where you left off, one death smarter than before... where you fear the corruption and the crimson until you find that perfect sword, that oh so perfect sword that fits your hand just right and gets you where you couldn't before and it was worth every second... Oh no. Starbound is NONE of those things and believe me, i wish it was.... No, Starbound is empty. The randomised monsters end up being meaningless, just reskinned health bags to paff at. There is no charming music, there is no reward, there is no happiness at the end of your tunnel, just more ore to dig for that boss item that'll end up being dissapointing, like the rest of the game. The game hasn't been updated in months - Well, this is both true and also a lie. You see, there are 3 versions of Starbound right now. The Stable, the Unstable and the Ugly. I mean Nightly. To explain, the Stable version is supposed to be as bug free as possible, the unstable is supposed to be as new as possible and the Nightly is supposed to be as new as possible... Uhm. Well, initially, there was just stable and unstable, but they decided they needed something more unstable than unstable and made Nightlies, where the game gets updated every night. So since the release of Nighties, the game has technically been updated every night, at the totally neglect of stable and unstable of course which haven't been updated since 2013. But thats not too bad right? I mean cmon... Well, it is, because nightlies are ♥♥♥♥ing awful. They are massively buggy and... well... to be completely honest with you, the development of the game through nightlies has been awful, its gotten worse since the last stable update. Things like ores dropping on death and stupid little additions that no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about plague the nightly updates like a curse and i can tell you with utter certainity that they are not worth your time or money.Why should you not buy this game because of bad developers? Simple, don't support them or their actions, show them its not ok to do the things they do by voting with your money. I will end this review with a sentance i used earlier as i feel it fits perfectly. There is no light at the end of your Starbound adventure, there is no light at the end of your tunnel. Only crushing dissapointment, over and over again. Don't be lured in, don't waste your time, effort, energy and money. Go play anything else, Terraria, Minecraft, just something else.I don't want Starbound to be a bad game, but i can only tell it like it is. I wish it was good and getting better, I really do. But its not, and at this point... i don't think it ever will be. Thanks for reading and i hope i helped you out.As a very final note, to developers who may be reading this, i advise you to think very carefully about putting your game on early access. Seriously. Its not a god send or a financial aid, its a business strategy and you need to be prepared to carry it out properly, lest you end up like Chucklefish and Starbound.			"

												After being in early access for roughly more than two and a half years, Chucklefish has decided that Starbound's version number is 1.0 - the fully finished product. Unfortunately, another 20-something hours does not show an honest effort put in for those seeking adventure.From the last time I reviewed the game, the basic gameplay loop remains mostly unchanged except for a few changes at the start of the game to accomodate for its 'tutorial phase' and story. The loop starts with gathering a planet's available materials and metals to help get yourself various crafting stations and some sufficient kit and especially armor, because it practically decides not only how tanky you are but also how much damage you do.The difference at this point is that the main quest also wants the player to find settlements of a specific race and scan certain scattered decorative objects, demonstrating the game's feature where your character's race influences the remarks they have about them. After that, an instanced mission is given to retrieve a MacGuffin from the race, including a mandatory boss fight in each as well. And then you're asked to do the same thing but for another race that is supposedly easier to find on a different type of planet or galaxy that's a tier up, restarting the loop since your old armor won't do you much good and you can't just 'jump' a tier without the materials to survive the specific atmosphere of later planets.Another big thing thrown in the loops are settlements, which provide a never-ending supply of terribly simple, generated quests asking you to fetch items, talking to NPCs that are very close by, or killing something on the other side of the planet; just as awful as Skyrim's radiant quests. Thankfully they share another purpose in that you can practically freeload from their containers without consequence, giving you an alternate means of obtaining some materials than just digging deep down. And of course, why you can do this just raises more questions. The shops do at least provide a source from where you can get armor from other races, though.One big thing Chucklefish has never seemed to really address since the beginning of the beta are planets. You know there is a problem when the setting allows for all kinds of crazy worlds to exist, and yet are much less diverse than Earth. For those unfamiliar, Starbound practically treats planets as single biomes (before settlements/bases), such as dedicated forest, desert, ice, ocean, and even volcanic worlds. These are quite literally are what they're advertised as, and the smaller sub-biomes that do exist are mostly there for wacky visual flair like trees with eyes and so only provide little different use compared to the primary biome's resources, so something like a beach or ocean will still only be found on an ocean planet. All planets aren't so different underground and actually do share many of the same sub-biomes regardless of the planet's type, so it can get repetitive there too. For such an important aspect of the game, world generation is seriously neglected.The game also runs quite poorly overall.Ultimately, not only development has been thin and slow overall, but Starbound is also a victim of having no real design plan for many game mechanics since the start. Much of these two and a half years of early access have been wasted on trying to redesign how various game systems are handled multiple times along with adding and even removing content (racial bonuses, temperature, and a lot of craftable weapons) to the ire of others. The one major new thing - the main story, is an unremarkable 'an ancient evil awakens' plot that has clearly been rushed out especially around near the end, so the devs could call the game 1.0.Players who like to do many vanity things might find Starbound alright, but if you are looking for a more technically impressive 'Terraria but in space' kind of game, you will be sorely disappointed. Until Chucklefish steps it up with a huge update or an ambitious modding project blows off everybody's socks, Starbound right now is a large waste of potential that could have been more.			"

												So after roughly one year I decide to play this game again and I'm dissapointed by some very weird gameplay decisions. The game feels tedious in terms of inventory management, you have to switch so much items while exploring, you cannot eat from your inventory etc. Since a few updates you can't craft pickaxes anymore and have to rely on finding them or buying them from a trader otherwise your slowass mattermanipulator has to suffice. I had much more fun in the beta with this game, version 1.0 doesn't feel right to me.Edit: You can't even pause the game especially annoying if you're in a cave and need to do something else real quick, learned it the hard way			"

Early Access Review
Avoid at all costs.Game has been in early access for over 2 years now with no release date in sight. Sold on undelivered promises of an ""infinite universe to explore and settle"", in reality you have a failed Terraria-clone that tried to replace character/charm/personality with procedural generation.This short cartoon created by a kickstarter-backer accurately describes the developer Chucklefish's strategy with Starbound more concisely than any review and you owe it to yourself to give it a look. http://postimg.org/image/6f2mqh7zl/ There is virtually no reason to buy this game over Terraria and support yet another cashgrab developer that took advantage of the new Early Access system to  make a quick buck.

												""it's funny actually, close to zero percent of the preorder money was used to actually pay for anything related to the game let alone towards stretch goals. The only reason we did the preorder was because half the team basically said ""we can't afford to work for free anymore, find a way to pay us or we're leaving"". We didn't hire any new people let alone pay them, they just got too excited when the preorder launched and I got shouted down when I was like should we really be promising more poo poo on top of what we've promised already. The only person off the top of my head I remember getting hired/paid after the preorder was our writer, Raze (another cool person, check out his studio Owlcave Games) who got thrown a few grand and then told to gently caress off after working unpaid for nearly a year.The leak happened because Tiy thought having a real time networked drawing app would be useful, so he got some Russian guy to code this whole thing for us.

												Disappointing to say the least, after 3 years i was expecting something more. The crafting is non-existing since you get everything you need from loot, this includes ores meaning you don't have to mine. The combat system is rubish compared to similar games, with armour being reskins of each other with the same stats, weapons are too random and magic feels like a last minute inclusion. The procedual generation is nice and all but once you have seen a dungeon you have seen them all since it's pretty much always the same layout, they didn't bother to add variaty, i saw the same ocean city 3 times in a row, not to meantion other small things like houses, there's just no variaty. The dificulty is non-existing again since i didn't have armour until i reached extreme planets, bosses only require spamming heals and face tanking them while doing damage. Aperrantly you are the only Novakid in the universe with their species description being used has an excuse to not put a single NPC anywere. Overall there's a lot wrong with the game, lack of content being the least of their problems, it's a shame because it's a nice game, it's just not Terraria, the combat is probably the most worst part of it when you compare it to Terraria.

												After being in early access for roughly more than two and a half years, Chucklefish has decided that Starbound's version number is 1.0 - the fully finished product. Unfortunately, another 20-something hours does not show an honest effort put in for those seeking adventure.From the last time I reviewed the game, the basic gameplay loop remains mostly unchanged except for a few changes at the start of the game to accomodate for its 'tutorial phase' and story. The loop starts with gathering a planet's available materials and metals to help get yourself various crafting stations and some sufficient kit and especially armor, because it practically decides not only how tanky you are but also how much damage you do.The difference at this point is that the main quest also wants the player to find settlements of a specific race and scan certain scattered decorative objects, demonstrating the game's feature where your character's race influences the remarks they have about them.

												Edit 3: Once again again I've given it a while and tried the game, but this time with a few mods to give it more content. Yes there's a lot in this, but the majority of it is collecting vanity (which I'm not a fan of really), so the mod was there to add end game difficulty and a more variety of armors along the way (rather then start, next, next, next)... It was more enjoyable to be fair, but by this point I've sadly just lost all interest in the game. If you LOVE Terraria, then this game probably isn't for you imo. Terraria was a lot more fast pased and fun I think.Edit 2: So once again, a year on I feel like I've given the game it's final shot. I'm a patient guy, but after more than  3 years I can finally say this is it. I only lasted 3 hours before I gave up this time. Whilst improvements are definitely there, and the combat is a LOT better, it still isn't anywhere near as good as Terraria, and I feel like after those 3 hours I'd already progressed somewhat far. I've done the same thing over and over, and yes Terraria is very similar in that regard, but I find Terraria MUCH funner to play and re-play over and over. I've got 300 hours in Terraria and will continue with that willingly, but Starbound leaves me feeling bored after not too long in game. It's a shame.. It really is.Plus I'm sad that the races don't really feel any different one from the other (aside looks). You'd think the plants would be immune to poison or something, whilst the robots are immune to electricity.. ANYTHING would make it more meaningful to choose..I'm afraid I can't recommend this game. Once you're through the game, that's just about it.Edit: I think this is near a year since I wrote the original Review (below) and there have been a handful of updates that have seriously improved the game. But considering it was aiming for a 2013 release date originally, I feel still like it is a little too late.I keep going back to it to try it out, but each time I finish the game inside 15 hours gameplay time (admitedly not collecting all the 'fancy dress items' but I'm not into that all too much). I payed £30 for the game (donation included) May 2013 which promised Fossil Collection on release (full release admitedly but still) and that is not out and it makes me very sad. It's a much better game, but I still stick with my original review below as the patches move at a 'Ruptured Snail' pace, nothing like a 'Pleased Giraffe' in my opinion. Sorry Starbound..Original Review:I don't need to say much to put my point across - Every single other review does it for me, looking down the list I can see...I, regrettably, purchased the game on day one of pre-orders. I have been following this game since late 2011 I think, when I first saw it in a post somewhere and I put the picture as my desktop background for a while back then - I LOVE terraria, and this was Terraria IN SPACE!! How could it POSSIBLY go wrong... Hmm... Too soon? Hell no! Its been months.. Years just about without any real feel of improvement.. Promise after promise and every one fell through. Of course they apologised, but what was it I was taught when I was younger.. Oh yeah - Learn from my mistakes. Did they? No.. Promises kept coming.. Promises kept falling through..I can forgive so much but it's just about a joke too far for me.			"

Early Access Review
Do you like the concept of ""Early Access""?  Do you want to feel like you're helping create a game that you want to play? Do you want to see that hard earned money you forked over reflected in the dedication of the developer?If you answered ""Yes"" to any of the above questions, then don't buy Starbound. Not convinced? Well here is why:1. It has very little content. It has been in development for years, and very little has been accomplished. Most notably in the past 12 months. So little progress in fact that many players believe the game is dead. It hasn't recieved even a minor official update in the last 9 months and counting.2. The team behind this game is incredibly out of touch with it's players. The creators made a public announcement a while back meant to sooth supporters in which they stated ""Chucklefish could fund Starbound for another 9 years at least.” They also explained that ""even if Starbound and Chucklefish never make another dime, the company has enough money in the bank to pay for office costs, employee salaries, and other expenditures."" That would be reassuring if any tangible progress has been made since then. They post update blogs on the official website weekly, detailing what they're supposedly working on, but since none of it has been added to a stable release we can only go on faith that they're not just sitting on our money.3.  The ""Nightly"" Build. When accused of slacking the Developers tell players to download the ""nightly build"". This is an incredibly unstable version which they themselves describe as ""more beta than the beta"". Unfortunately, it's so broken it's not easily playable. The starter missions are incomplete and impossible to finish, requiring console commands to progress and all the while avoiding obscure/mudane actions to prevent crashes. This could almost be tolerable if these same major issues haven't existed since the very first ""nightly"" builds. None have been fixed.  Remember those update blogs I mentioned before? They are all about minor cosmetic improvements, or about some new items they've mocked up. The game's basic progression and structure sits ignored and unfinished as they post screenshots of a gun shaped like a crayola crayon (seriously). It speaks volumes about their priorities.Combine all these issues, and it becomes apparent that the Starbound team cares very little about their fan base. If you are still on the fence, I urge you hold off and keep an eye out for when (or if) this game comes out of early access. Make your decision then.			"

Early Access Review
								PLEASE STOP AND DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!I had high hopoes for this game and really wanted it to become the next big thing I was thinking terraria was starting to wear me down and completed most of the content and picked this up heres what I have to say....This game started well, a good possibly even great sidescroller travelled around the stars beating various enemies hell knows where I was going with my mohawk human but I made do, I survived the elments and eventually thrived.Rinse, repeat do it over and over again craft boss summoning items and when you feel ready BOOM give it all you got 110% it was HARD like seriously difficult but once you beat the bosses it was great move forward to now pfft easiest thing ever. Don't gert me wrong the PvE is okay.... at best.However its sacrificed exploration for linear story it got rid of fantastic, brillant content and replaced it with okay and sort of run of the mill stuff. As I mentioned the bosses were hard but you would have to find the materials and thats were the game outshined all other games on the market at the time almost literally. I explored a pirate ship that sold rocket launchers and machine guns I just found an anchor and climbed to find Avion pirates sweet jesus I thought this is brillant a pirate airship but I want MY pirate airship....So I killed the pirates raided there equipment and built a similar model my self had guards e.t.c on board and chefs had everything a old rustic 500 block long pirate ship wanted. I fought bosses on there my security turrets gunning them down whilst i was running around shooting rockets using tech I've found to bareley survive on the deck that doubled as a death dealing arena with the hardest and most dangerous of fights I've ever had the pleasure of doing. Then assualting glitch (robot people) strong hold killing their knights and slashing my out with machine gun fire accidently summoing military army penguins complete with their boss donning a U.F.O whilst my security systems on my ship were doing all they can and I blasted him thinking goobye you son of a gun you fought well broke some of my men and turrets but it was the most fun I've ever had...... that is until they updated the game....Where do I begin? for starters they still let you build but have given you a hub okay not a badarse capital death dealing pirateship with over 200 guards but I can live with that its just an outpost on some asteriod pretty cool.... but wait linear quests that are pretty boring go get a coffee cup and spoon in that order then a paper plane to fight the penguins rather then you DISCOVER the boss for yourself.Next you have the PvE (if it can be called that) of the game, again previously you would explore and come across dungeons and structures of immense proportions now the game is setting you on a path that once you die you have to  do it all over again and again... and again which gets pretty boring. Ordinarily I'd think ""right lets have some fun summon a boss or explore see what chaos unfolds"" now it's go do a dungeon we have set it so thats EXACTLY the same over and over Secondly I originally played terraria for a while and got to hardmode thought okay a whole new experience thats pretty cool mechanical bosses and difficulty ramped up so much compared to normal mode.... but since 1.3 they have added in so much. Whilst not a new difficulty its added martian madness, enjoy killing aliens and cultists of ridiculous power and challenge yourself so you can get cool new items and fight in the sky whilst spells from the cosmos try to obliterate you, oh by the way did you want a epic boss fight here we have the moon lord kill him and get amazing loot to alter the worlds gravity or harness amazing spells as if made from a deity or a oracle.Starbound what have you added exactly.... secondary attacks and staffs.... a very narrow story a couple of new enviroments and pets that don't really do anything?....Finally the main nail in the coffin for me is...THIS GAME HAS BEEN IN EARLY ACCESS SINCE JUNE 2013!!!! almost 3 years So to round it all offPROS-Has a excllent explorationNEUTRAL (things that are opinated in my books)-Crafting and progression is not really intresting (as its just a straight upgrade)-Community are gradually wading into negitivity for games release-Sandbox has now become linear (not nesccarily bad but needs work)CONS-Got rid of MOTIVATION to explore the world thanks to the outpost-Combat is terrible just use hammers and a really powerful ranged weapon (you win everytime)-Bosses are boring and whilst new mechanics have been introduced its still the same fight over and over rather then destructable terrain and minions popping in to ruin your day e.t.c-The legendary enemies are just total garbage due to being able to craft a better weapon at next tier tier 10 beats all weapons IF used correctly-Devs raely update the game since I posted this it was 27th June 2015 the last update was on 27th April 2014 3 months nothing new... and previous patches made this game slowly slope downhillThats my full on honest review from my opinion if I were to rate this I would say...HOLD OFF ON ALL COSTS Started out great went bad didn't meet my needs then went toxic and everything about the devs makes me annoyed since they almost abandoned this once lovely game GO PLAY TERRARIA INSTEAD ;) "

Early Access Review
								This copycat was created to leech off the success of Terraria, and sadly I fell for it.  The developers were moderately active in updating the game while I was playing, but it was also clear that they had other priorities.  Compared to the game that inspired it, this one has very limited options in terms of both building and combat.The one extra feature it does have, that being the ability to travel to new worlds, is lack-luster.  Granted there are a few unique structures and biomes one might find depending on the world they visit, but in the end these things provide no interesting rewards.  In Terraria, exploration meant finding crazy new items and unlocking new characters for your growing city.  In Starbound it mainly means finding new tiles to use in construction, most of which are boring to look at.Don't bother with this one.  Purchasing it will do nothing to rekindle the flame that Terraria lit in our hearts.			"

								Let me clarify something: This game is fun...for a bit. Then you realize that there isn't much that you can do. The devs like to post tweets and progress reports that talk about things they want to implement, which is nice of them. It really is. What isn't nice (and is rather frustrating) is the fact that the game isn't going anywhere. There have been plenty of promises about content and features, but so far next to none of those promises have come to fruition. SoI'll say this - don't buy this game, or anything else from Chucklefish, unless it isn't in beta/alpha/whatever.			"

Product received for free
												A perfect example as to why you should NEVER leave a pixel artist as the head developer for an entire game. This game used to be an incredibly fun and rewarding sandbox game that had an identical charm with that of Terraria with tons of unique content, all to be explored in a sandbox setting with the only limitation being how much fuel your ship has, which you personally had to get before. What is it now? A grindy, unsatisfactionary mess that somehow manages to feel linear with an hour + long bulky ""tutorial"" played out in an intro cutscene followed by you warping down on an earth-like planet, having the game hand-hold you through it as your ship AI spams you everytime you pick up or see something new. Along with that, they've also removed massive amounts of content from the game, including mechs, enemies, ore and bosses and now you can no longer tamper with dungeons whatsoever while before, you could dissect them and re-build awesome-looking (and functioning) things using the stuff you took on your own base, even on your own ship. No more.The forum crying community has managed to drive this once glorious game it into the ground so hard, over 3 of my friends that used to love early versions of this game no longer want to even consider touching it with a 10-foot pole and while you as a newcomer may be neglectful of what you've missed out on, you should by no means of the imagination lower your expectations of video-games to accept the mediocrity and failure of this one.R.I.P Starbound.

												I would have recommended this game when it first launched it's beta however after 4 years of development its now clear that a lot of the content got cut out of the game and seems to have landed itself back where it was 4 years ago. The only outstanding factor which I will praise the team for is that the game seems to be a lot more polished than it previously was. I only played for a few days after the recent release and have completed the game, it is incredibly short and the bosses were severely easy to beat. Its genuinely a shame that the game is a shell of its former self and could have been great.			"

								If you wanted Terraria in space, you have comed to the wrong place. Starbound can be fun in the beginning but you have to do the same thing over and over agian, and there is not many goals to aim for.This game is still in alpha but, when terraria was in alpha, it showed us how a 2D sidescroller should be.If you want something more like Terraria, you should check out 'Edge of Space'.Though it is in REALLY early alpha, it has more clear goals and a really good tutorial.Thats why i think if you ARE looking for a terraria in space, Starbound is NOT what you want.

												What happened to this game?Where IS the content you have made over the last couple of years?What i see here is just the same stuff i saw about X years ago when it was first put into early access.I did not stick around to play every update they released. hell the game ran like arsh back then n it even managed to make me entirely forget about it untill it launched a couple days ago.Let me slow down for a moment. I love the idea of the game. as ya can see i spend over 100 hours on it in the last 2 weeks and thats with playing alongside my brother.The story consists of very minimal effort. your goal is to defeat the big bad boss called ""Ruin"" and the only way to do this. is collect 6 magic artifacts or crystals all legend of zelda style.Whohoo. the way you go about this is you Scan the requested civilization and run back to your quest npc. which in turn gives you an dungeon to beat. These can be quite fun if you are a bit undergeared but if ya have anything a bit more powerful then you should have and it becomes a boring walk from left to right situation.Sadly this has to be done 5 times.you scan each Civilization once to identify the location of the artifact and then unlock a dungeon to complete.this design is so damn lazy that i feel like they just gave up on the story entirely.there are 7 races in the game so yes. you skip 2 races entirely!the Humans gets wiped out at the start of the game. and the novakids gets only a single mention in a random note in the entire sodding game!You have a single hub world the Ark which is shared trough all your characters. infact your entire galaxy is shared on your account. it only changes when you join someones multiplayer.its cool to connect like this but the entire game just feels stale and empty.there are only a handful of diferent civilizations and zones you encounter.these become quite dull as these do not seem to change their designs at all.a Glitch castle will always be the same design on every planet you happen to encounter these.the same goes for prisons or biolabs or dungeons or civilizations.they are ALL the same!you encountered one of them you have seen all of them!this is a show on how LAZY the developers have gotten in the past years because in all honesty. I saw all of these SEVERAL YEARS AGO.What in the hell have these people been doing in the last couple of years.Sure i do not follow every update like a zealot but i do have a good memory on what the game used to have.I heard there used to be mech suits in the game.there used to be armor set bonuses and racial traits that made each race unique to play!now all ya get is a diferent ship and a useless ""pet"" that doesnt do anything at all. atleast i hvnt seen him do anything but eat and complain.There used to be a ton of diversity on planets. colors and sure recolored creatures but come the fk on.Overall.Its sad to say but i cant reccomand this to anyone.it used to have so much more but the overall story of the game can be completed in less then 10 hours.for an open world survival whatever kinda game. it just isnt an experience worth telling.the price is right however.For this price you can easily get a ton of hours out of it. if you like to explore and build then this sure can keep ya busy.but dont expect a terraria or 2d minecraft out of this one.Unless the developers intended the game to be finished by modders i cant understand why this is so shallow.

												The story of this game is quite bad, and the exploration is also quite limited. Yes, everything is infinite with procedural generation, but your gear can only get so good before the fun of the game is stripped for you and all progression halts. I'm going to try out some mods now, see how much they improve the game. If they do, I'll edit this review.EDIT: The game has a huge backstory, but to learn about it you must do stuff outside of the main story missions, and even the game.			"

								If I could use one word to describe Starbound it would be empty.  Most of space is an  vast, empty, boring place in reality and ChuckleFish choose to reflect this in Starbound. There are tons of planets but nothing really on them to keep them unique or give them flavor besides different colored grass and wierd trees Starbound seems proud of declaring ""biomes"" but they serve no purpose beside eye-candy and the occasional acid pool or rain. The creatures are randomly generated as such they are just a bunch souless cannon fodder devouted to bump into you and deal damage. Oh some of them have lasers but usually just the flying ones( the ""randomly generated"" claim really goes out the window here). Items are breathing some life into the game but I literally have scoured hundreds of planets and never found anything of interest besides the occasional village and dungeon, both of which are so badly repeatitve that I cant stand to go to other planets and see the same science dungeon that I just saw on the last planet and every 3rd planet I go to. If you want a game like Starbound go get Terreria, the systems present give it more soul then this sham, and you dont have to wait for terrible developers to ""fix"" the game or claim that it's Early Access as an excuse to not address problems for months at a time.Edit: recently it has come to my attention that the Dev ChuckleFish has been banning people from thier website and steam forums for showing any signs of critism of thier game or shady Dev strategy(they are developing multiple titles alongside Starbound). Dont give Chuckle Fish ANY money dont support Mods and Devs that only want your money and cant keep promises.			"

												this game plays terribly, the controls are really floaty meaning that when jumping to another platform, you way overshoot or way undershoot 100% of the time because of the jumping mechanics. the fighting mechanics only work when you are on a flat plane, when swining a sword, the swing stops at knee hight, so if you are on an incline, the monster you are fighting wont be hit even though it can be close enough to touch you. the inventory bar mechanics are just as bad, when you go into your inventory and have to drag and drop each individual item into your hot bar it takes to long and you can die in that time easily, also when picking up items even if it is a one handed item it fills both L and R spots for any given hotbar slot. this game plays like its a 3yo and under educational platformer.

								i just cannot recommend Starbound EA simply because it isnt worth 15$. the content runs out because the game is not finished yet.  all of the worlds are basically the same, but just a little different. On one planet you will see brown dirt and purple enemies, then the next world will have the same enemies and dirt, just different colors.          After playing for 40+ hours all i can tell you is to wait until it comes out of early access, when more content will (hopefully) be added. right now its just a hollow shell of what it could be, with some bugs. If you really need to play it, i'd suggest waiting for a sale.			"

								   They gave me my own ship, along with that I was given one tool that I would cling to dearly as I prepared for my arduous journey to this planet that my ship was conveniently anchored too.  And off I went, beaming down onto this planet of new possibilities, resources, and local inhabitants both peaceful and not. This is Starbound; where the purpose is to explore different galaxies, harvest resources, and create things to help you better survive the planet you are on at any given time.  Starbound is vast and it contains thousands of planets of many varieties. Ranging from the cold harsh Snow planets, to the intimidating and highly dangerous Magma planets. There is even a Tentacle Planet if you’re feeling curious! Right off the back you’re given a hand full of quests to get you familiarized with the games crafting system which has you building bonfires to stay warm, a table to make your various crafts, and a furnace to smelt the metal that you have gathered. The rest was left for you to discover.     No matter how simple and innocent this game may look, don’t let it fool you; it’s quite unforgiving. Beaming down to my very first planet I was greeted with my first contact of alien life.  And let’s just say they didn’t appreciate my presence, which resulted in a swift death for me. The game’s difficulty is challenging but not unbearable and what keeps you coming back is the games complex and deep mechanics. For example upon building my first pick axe and digging through my first few levels of rock my pick axe quickly broke and I was left with my first tool, to harvest at a slower rate than I previously was. Along with this mechanic there are a plethora of others including the crafting system which allows you to build everything you need to make your game more unique, from new armor and weapons to different star maps to travel to more distant and difficult galaxies. Or perhaps you would like to craft a few rainbow bricks to give your new house some much needed color.   There are no real limits in this game and the items, mechanics and worlds are always being discovered. Each time you pick it up you will find yourself doing something entirely different than you did the time prior. Who knows you may find a guitar along the way and find yourself playing a marimba with your friends over multiplayer. Another time you may find yourself coming across a local village on a new planet and raiding it like Genghis Khan! Regardless of play style, fast or slow, hostile or peaceful this game offers many different ways to be played and hosts hours and hours of enjoyment. I would highly recommend Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR Disappointed so far, waiting for a finished gameI've never played Minecraft nor Terraria - Starbound is actually first game in its genre that I encountered. That's probably one of the reasons why at the beginning, the game looked really interesting. However, my initial dose of exciment almost ran out after about 30 hours. My impressions, starting with the negative:- for most of the time, the game feels empty and lonely. I know it isn't finished, but so far - no quests to do (except for initial quests leading to first boss), no NPCs to talk to, no interesting places to visit, no story. Maybe I didn't search hard enough? If they're there, maybe they should be more accessible? I just wandered alone in the wild, killing mobs and gathering resources. That's the single biggest flaw in the game for me - at some point I just got bored.- speaking of gathering, game requires too much grinding. Realizing that getting to second boss involves no quests, just more grinding for pixels and steel - was a huge disappointment.- even for a moment, I didn't feel a need or desire to build a permanent house; I only dug holes on the road just to sleep at night. Which makes the sizebale amount of craftable items useless for me. After all, why stick to one planet when there's so many of them.On the bright side:- Starbound's graphics and visual style are really, really nice. The soundtrack is simply beatiful, I have to admit that sometimes I listen to it outside the game. The overall aesthetics and atmosphere make a very strong advantage.- different biomes, weather effects and game physics really are cool.- crafting system is fun, I like it.- the races and lore are quite interesting from what I found in the wikis, and I hope that eventually the game will allow to experience that.I probably won't play Starbound until next serious update or final release. And I hope it will bring real improvements, because so far I'm not sure if it was worth the money - and I can't recommend the game to my friends.I also think that calling what I played 'beta' is a really annoying abuse - 'beta' denotes software that is almost feature complete, but needs only polishing and bugfixes. Current version is nowhere near that state.			"

								If you are familiar with Minecraft or Terraria then you will definitly like this game. It has (or is going to have) everything that Minecraft and Terraria lacked. The game will feature quests, multiplayer and co-op, and an infinite amount of randomly generated dungeons, planets, mobs, etcetera. Also the music is awesome. Better than C418.Definitly worth the money, but expect the game to have some rough edges since it's still in beta.			"

								This game is fun for the first hour you play it but it quickly becomes exstreamly repetative. The game has also not been updated in a long time and the devlopers dosen´t seem to plan on updating it any futher either. I recomend to not buy this game unless it maybe comes out some time. And also if the price is cut down to atleast 9.99. At this point it´s not worth playing.Update: Hrmm well i gotta say that the new update looks intriguing and all. I really wish to try it out and give this game another chance but sadly it´s stuck on the loading screen as games tend to just say screw mac and pretend to be suporting them... even worse is that it worked before. Usualy i´m not writing about crashes as they can be induvidual problems but if the loading really is gonna take more than 15 min, then the game has indeed already failed to impress me. I fell this game has potential, but so i did with cube world i loved that game to death and that is why i am very sceptical of the game. P.S If you have a mac i don´t recomend this game as it not only stucks on loading, but my friend also has it crashing all the time. PC versions tend to work better though it´s a fun game to waste a few hours on just don´t exspect too much i´d rather stick to good ol´ Terraria so still no recomendation from me.			"

Mining is to Starbound what backtracking is to Resident Evil games : a very cheap way to boost the ""time played"" while making any real content. Said time will be used by the incompetent developper in a pathetic attempt to justify his laziness.And of course, since most people already saw through the scam and left, it means the only fans left are the extremists one, the one you cannot bargain, reason, or even talk with.ADDENDUM : now that it's 1.0, I retried it.It's still beta, and oh surprise, still trash.

												I really wanted to like this game, really did. Back when Starbound was on Kickstarter, I couldn't keep my hype, everything looked so interesting, so many good ideas and concepts, some of those created by fans (like the Poptops).When the beta came out, I was so happy and went to play immediately. My first impressions were that the game just felt so boring, and exploring the universe felt really empty and barren.At the time, I thought it was ok, the game was only at beta, I thought they would think a lot more to what could be some good changes to the game, specifically to the races. One of the Kickstarter stretch goals ($500,000), were the race of Novakids, which are “interstellar gas-bag people”, but now, this race is nothing but a reskin of the player model. This is only an example of the concepts that were dumbed down to something so simple and tasteless.The beta continued being this boring, wasted potential of a game. At a certain point of the beta (which took really long) they added quests to the game. These too felt really obnoxious to do; quests like ""fetch quests"" or ""escort quests"", things that you don't expect to do in a space-exploring game. But these were only the ""sub-quests"" of the game, so you could pass the time doing meaningless things, they added ""missions"" as well. Missions were nothing more than going through a lot of bad guys, waving your weapon, and defeating an underwhelming boss.The pacing of the updates goes without saying; the beta was so slow, any annoying bug or glitch took ages to be fixed or to be removed. There were many delays for the release date and many unkept promises.When they added ""upgrades"" to your ship, I got kind of excited wondering if this could be something cool, such as cannons for your ship, more gadgets for your ship, but instead you could only expand your ship to add more furniture, when you fully ""upgrade"" your ship it just feels like a huge empty metal box.Finally, when the game came out, I was shocked at what the game has become. I am embarrased to say that I enjoyed more the beta than the final product. The ""main storyline"" is nothing more than the ""missions"" that I mentioned before, the pacing of the game feels sluggish and not very compelling to continue digging through the planets and exploring, for me it felt like there was no real objective because; the intention of the game that is exploring, felt repetitive. Combat feels slow and clunky, movement feels floaty, the new ""hotbar"" looks and functions really badly compared to the beta one. There are still some bugs, which I can forgive, but the game still feels unfinished and rushed.As a sandbox, space-exploring game, Starbound is, in my opinion, a 4/10 game. It's really disappointing to see something that looked so complex and interesting die in this shallow abomination.			"

								It's a really fun game that people hate for reasons that are not actually related to it's gameplay. Is it as good as, say, Terraria? Maybe, depends what you are looking for. I'd say that the combat and building in Terraria is better. But, Starbound has more interesting exploration and lore. I would definitely say that it is worth trying out. It is at a very fair and reasonable price, and is great value for that price considering the huge amount of content in the game.			"

												WOW seryously WOW!!I have no words!I've played this game 2 years ago and it was nice, unpolished but good.I've played this game before the full release and DAMN! that was a blast! had so much fun...I've played the full realise and the only thing that pops in my mind is WOW!!!!!They seryously accomplished the impossible.... they ruined it...They made it slower, with less tutorial, with worse inventory management, with worse ""tool upgrading"" sistem, with worse teleportation sistem (it's true that is not normal to be able to beam to the ship from underground, but going back to the surface once you reach the core of a planet especially if you're starting from scratch (and of course you are since they deleted all the saves for compatibility reasons ^^) is excruciating. Wanna know a fun thing? Well before the release  they removed this annoing time waster, where are we now? back in the alpha of course! -.-Well i'm being a little too emotional here so let me write down what's changed and why it's worse now...For starters let's talk about the real beginning, the tutorial: Yeha there is a tutorial, it may seem cooler since is more ""story oriented"" (like it matters in this kind of games but meh no complaints here) but after you get on your first planet... well that's it! You're on a planet now well.... do something.the game doesn't help guiding you trough the various crafting stations (now more complex than ever).And the FIRST quest you'll get is to get core fragments... really? a person that doesn't know how this game works and thinks ""hey a quest so that's what i need to do!"" (especially after being throwed on a planet with ZERO explanations)will have 3 reactions 1) going crazy trying to find em on the surface. 2) going crazy since they grasped the fact that they're located near the center of the planet where hard monsters and really slow mining blocks (for theyr current tools) are situated. 3) being a good player reaching the bottom of the planet with basic tools (keep in mind that i'm talking about beginners that don't know the game here) to then find out that they are unable to beam back to the ship...Now let's compare it with the game before the release: No intro (meh who cares but it is a minus anyway) you start on the ship, beam to the planet and: iIt tells you what to craft step by step for the first equipments (and even the later ones)through quests, teaching you how to farm, mine make armors and weapons, ecc...and most of those thing are made trough ONE workbench and only later you'll have your ship and house full of crafting stations but you already have a lot of training on how you should move thx to the tutorials, explanations and experience with the first benches. You know with how many benches you start now? FIVE!!!! and all need each other to make stuff... (example: need a bow? make workbench (A) for building it... wait! you need string for the bow, so make workbench (B) nice now you have your bow... oh? need a bed too? simple^^ use work bench (C) and make the materials with (A) and (B)As i said over and over this is only the beginning for beginners without tutorials... since i had difficulty with this new sistem and i've played this game for almost 3 years...Oh just a little thing that of course is another annoiance to slow the game even more for no reason (since not even in alpha there was this detail) crafting now takes time... yeha now you want some torches? wait, want a workbench? wait even more...Let's change topic, inventory management... well where to begin...i'll just compare it with the  pre-release point by point:1) Pre: item in hotbar not in inventory so your hotbar was a slot for 10 more items1) New: Not anymore now all the equipped is in your bag too, reason of this decision? God only knows...2) Pre: Item management was splitted in 3 tabs, the game would automatically put a new picked up item in the tab choosed by default from the game BUT you could move everything everywhere with no restrictions so you could leave it be or make inventory your little ""zen garden"" so that every time you opened your bag you had everything where YOU wanted it to be.2) New: Now your bag is splitted in 5 tabs, every single item is locked in his tab of default, the only thing you can do is move the stuff in that tab around but you can't put it in other tabs, and just let me say this... THE FOOD TAB!every single piece of meat or potato or a lot of other suff to eat DO NOT stack together.... why? no seryously why? From the beginning food always stacked and in my opinion when the food was just healing stuff was the best, now we are back to the starvation meter? i think than more of a release this game has jumped back to the ""minus pre-alpha"" status...3) New: less slot in the hotbar and it's less intuitive than before...Ok enough switch of topic, the upgrading tools sistem: Well this isn't too bad is just... meh. Before the game guided you trough the upgrades, always trough various quests, for example: liquid gathering? (like water, fuel, ecc...) The game would make a quest and will tell you, ""hey enough with this sistem let's move to another one... oh right the fuel, bring that stuff for upgrades back to me so that i can teach you to gather liquids and then tell you what and where to find em)Here is more like: hey man nice tool you have there, what? you've found all those upgrading parts already? wow man go crazy use them for whatever you want!... ... ... ... ... ... WHAT? you used all of your materials on high cost stuff and now you can't leave the sistem? well screw you now you know what to prioritize now go back to the planets (under leveled or already explored) you know and bring me more upgrade stuff.. ... .... If you can find it! muahahahaErm... yeha something like that but well it's kinda intuitive anyway but not giving you a path to follow is a low blow in my opinion, ""Liquids"" ""Paintings"" ""Wiring"" should be quest related rewards like before to evade confusion but as i said i don't think is such a bad change but for sure it isn't better...Last topic, Battles: Now the only difference between ""New"" and ""Pre"" are the combos, hit more than once and you make 3 different swings with your weapon.... uselessIf you try to not trigger the combo you'll do way more dmg with single hits since the second hit in the combo does half the damge of the 1* and 3* attack.Well that's it for me, i was so hyped about the full release of this game and now.... what a disappointment, is like they threw away all the good stuff from the pre-release and took back all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff from the early beta + they added some extra trash just because...The saddest thing is that they changed everything that was in the beta and gave me and (i think) a lot more players a giant suckerpunch under the belt and right on the jewels with no warning what so-ever i don't think that most of this stuff  was suggested by the community so... well i don't know i just have this feeling of bitterness.I hope that this long rant helped someone on his choice ^^ "

								To those who've been patient with ChuckleFish, I salute you.  I know for many of us this was supposed to be the 'spiritual successor' to games like Terraria where ideas are expanded upon and the sandbox environment reaches a new tier of enjoyment and creativity.  I once believed that Starbound may well be this next step; based on my last playthrough as of roughly a week ago, I am closing in on the certainty that it will not.I initially played through Starbound when it was early released in the Early-Access 'Beta' (and to be perfectly accurate it was far cry from what I would have considered a beta game).  I fundamentally enjoyed some of the mechanics and certainly bought into the hype of what it would eventually become: a space-based exploration game with an element of combat built into it.  It was interesting, it still was linear and boring in the end, but I knew that it wasn't ready for prime-time.  I had the serious expectation that it would be within some amount of time; after all, Tiy was involved.I've recently switched to the nightly builds and went through another playthrough of the game.  I frankly will say I'm shocked that the game essentially hasn't changed in the year since I've played it.  Sure, there's some reorganization of the quest system, the way in which progression proceeds changed slightly but overall the game was still in the same state it was in the initial 'beta' phase it was the year previously.  Some improvements, I'll grant, but certainly not to the level I would have expected of a 'full time commitment to development' as promised from ChuckleFish with a full year's worth of effort.It simply lacks focus and is still not enjoyable.  The combat has been reworked, reworked again, and then reworked again.  Numerous small additions (primarily in the in-game clutter department) have been added but fail to deliver any cohesive theme or point.  The planetary exploration has had random new bits associated with it (like underground mini-biomes that apparently house 'fabulous loot' which is generally procedure-generated garbage) that contribute very little or nothing to the experience.  The quest system is resolved within a few hours.  The upgrading of tiers are the same thing for each tier just with a new name.  The combat is still clunky and boring.  Sure, there's lots of new random items to craft (most of it useless, because it's still not apparent how or why I should build or craft anything in the game) but that's essentially it.  The towns, castles and sewers are still there but just like a year ago have no motivating goal to prod me to explore them.No unifying vision.  No known objective (other than the straightforward quest system).  Nothing.If its current state is soon to be labelled 1.0 then I would highly recommend you avoid.  I had hoped by this point that the development team would have centered in on what the game's purpose should be about and refined the experience but they have not.  I agree with most of the steam reviews that, aside from the few cheerleaders for the company, the progression of this enterprise has been lackluster at best.  Devs continue to blame their customers for not being patient enough while simultaneously - get this - have NINE OTHER GAME forums for other games that are either in kickstarter or development mode.  ChuckleFish had better, in the very near future, decide if they want to be known as a company that promises the world and delivers a gold-plated turd or if they truly appreciate the fanbase and buckle down on projects they commit to.

								I updated this review and changed my recommendation to no since I'm not really recommending the game until things get fixed and more polished.Gear Progression and DifficultyGear progression is interesting, but fails to keep pace with player. You can jump to the next tier too quickly and the difficulty doesn’t scale well at all. This is due to the fact that the bosses drop unique items needed to progress to the next tier. It's a great concept, kill boss, gear up, explore and progress to the next boss, rinse repeat. What you get isn't implemented very well at all; the fights are dull and lack the challenge of bosses in similar games like Terraria. On top of that they can be easily exploited simply by building some blocks as a barrier.  This leads to my next point.CombatCombat is very cumbersome and becomes boring rather quickly. While it's awesome to have futuristic weapons like plasma rifles/laser guns most of the crafted melee weapons are exactly the same with the only difference being swing speed. Most creatures can be killed with one or two hits from a melee weapon of the same tier and that’s basically it for almost every creature with the exception of some NPCs. Sure you can find awesome weapons, but they don’t feel powerful, you just keep clicking and whatever is in front of you dies. There’s never any sense of diversity with enemies and the AI combat is basically just jump attacks with some decently powerful ranged attacks from flyers. NPCs could be a challenge due to their weapons and armor, but the AI is too limited. The NPCs never work together and basically become cannon fodder. The system isn’t broken, but it definitely needs tweaking with a lot more weapon and AI diversity, especially mobs of NPCs. Space TravelI’ve played MineCraft, Terraria, Cube World and many other sandbox games, but it was the space travel which drew me to this game in the first place. Having basically unlimited planets to explore seems like a great idea, but again it needs work and balancing. There’s “sectors” that get progressively harder and have more diverse “biomes”. That makes it fun to jump from solar system to solar system to discover new planets and find weapons, tech, dungeons, towns, etc. While the biomes are interesting, I like the asteroids and moons, they still don’t feel that much different from each other. Again the enemies in the biomes are basically all the same with the same AI but different skins, it’s a blue slime instead of a yellow slime. That would be OK if they AI acted differently but you’re basically fighting the same stuff over and over.BuildingBuilding stuff is easy, fun and there a ton of objects to acquire throughout the universe, but again things need adjustment like some materials take way too long to break if you made a mistake building your structure or simply want to make a change to an existing structure.There’s a lot to love about Starbound and I still have fun playing it, but there’s a lot of work to be done. I’m not going to get into any comments about the Devs or Chucklefish, but I will say they have a hit on their hands if they concentrate on getting core mechanics, AI and combat working.			"

								In its current state, the game has unpolished gameplay, unfinished story and interface, limited and clunky crafting, and relies entirely on rehashed and randomized worlds.  As it's been nearly half a year since an update on this ""early access"" game, this may be the best we can expect. I know I bought this game hoping that I could see it become better, but that hope has long since dried up.  Avoid this game, and avoid the heartache of another game not living up to its potential.

												So now that the game is in 1.0 - or rather, this is the supposedly complete version - it feels more appropriate to review it.What I was shocked to find was that this game now offers less than what was in the pre-release, early access version. Simple things like the temperature system and many useful techs have been removed, and the game suffers from some embarrassingly bad glitches. Wanna play in 1920x1080 fullscreen? Too bad; your mouse is locked to a 720p window that prevents you from accessing much of the screen. The game has plenty of lag spikes, and considering it's just a bunch of pixels in an environment that's likely less complex than Terraria, a much more stable game, it really doesn't make much sense.It's not an awful game, sure, but it's the game that made me never want to fund a Kickstarter ever again. I gave them $15, and they've more or less ♥♥♥♥ed me over with empty promises and lies. Originally, I thought that this wasn't such a good game because the devs just stopped updating it for quite some time, though at least then I could assume that they were working on improving the game. Now? The game is worse than it was two years ago. I dunno what infuriated me more: the extremely long and extraordinarily restrictive intro mission that blocks you from actually exploring space, or the fact that once you do explore space, it feels completely pointless. It had a ton of potential, and you could even argue that it reached that potential before the recent update - but that's just the problem, isn't it?			"

								This is a fantastic game.  I know that a lot of people might be skeptical since it looks like Terraria, but as a long time Terraria player myself I can assure you that this is a very fun and unique experience. While it holds on to many of the concepts that made Terraria amazing and fun to play, it also adds plenty of exciting and unique features that make this game the amazing experience that it is, Starbound.    Not only has it been very fun to play, but it has helped me out a lot with my YouTube channel. I have started making Starbound Shorts (humorous short videos of about 18-30 seconds) and it has helped me grow a lot.

												I put well over 200 hours into this game before the final release and I must say that I really do not like a lot of the mechaincal changes. First the HUD is a complete f*cking mess. I don't know what they were thinking when they changed it. The 1-0 options were way better for this game type. And crafting isn't as fun anymore either. What's with all of these tables I have to make? It was already crazy before, this is just nonsense. Fighting is slow, enemies on the first planet are way over powered. Just.... this game is a mess now and that is incredibly unfortunate. I absolutely loved playing before all of these changes. I proably won't ever play it again unless they go back and re-simplify what they confuddled. Hashtag thoughts and prayers.			"

								Awesome game! Highly recommended.Early access game that is still incredibly active and constantly being updated with lots of info on each update. Since I've been playing the updates do not seem to impact save games, which is important for a game like this to address pretty early on but others seem to overlook. Immense detail, and variety of different terrain types and evolving world environments hosting unique minerals, life and civs/ruins to be explored and goodies to find everywhere!Recommend to anyone who wants to build and explore a huge universe that is constantly being updated and expanding. I'd recommend now if you're in to the building, exploring, farming, mining and raiding type of game. Light on the storyline currently, but a solid start with a load of found and existing potential. So far it's a great game and can't wait to see next few updates, too!			"

								This game is one of the most creative and wildly innovative games I have seen. Although only in a very early beta, this game has lots of things to offer, so don't worry about there not being enough to do. Anyone who has played this game will agree tha it has a fantastic future when it seeks a true release. The many worlds mechanic is intriguing. The weapons are fun and nice> There are so many different types of planets and world generations to explore. The enemies seem to be endless in different quantities. The sound effects in this game are crisp and clear. You can customize your character with several different races that can do different perks. You can also make them look however you like. If you told me that this wasn't a beta of this game, then i would fully believe you, because this game is one true masterpiece.			"

								Terraria in space? Not in my mind. Try as I may I could not get into Terraria. Nevertheless, as my playtime can attest, I found Starbound to be fantastic. Explore, create, fight, quest, farm, starve, drown, die: Starbound has it all. Whether you want to build a tower so high it grazes the stars, dig to a planet's molten core, or simply fly your ship from planet to planet indiscriminately blasting hostile, brain-washing apes and peaceful bird-men alike you can in Starbound. Despite being in early beta the game plays very well; it has most of the major game systems already in place, smooth performance, and a welcoming, burgeoning community. That said, the developers, who are pushing out updates every few weeks on average, are planning many more features. A longer quest line, side-quests and FTL style space ship combat to name but a few. To conclude, the comparison with Terraria is apt, but don't be put off Starbound if you didn't enjoy it. Starbound is a wonderful, compelling game in its own right, even at this early stage of development.			"

								Lets get this outta the way first: yes, this is like Terraria. Very much so. But it's more than that, if a comparison has to be drawn between the two then Starbound is like Terraria 3.0, in Space! Starbound has certainly learned a lot from Terraria and improved on it in many aspects. There, that's said, now onto the game itself.Starbound is a space survival sandbox and even in this early beta version it offers so much. Quests sketch up an over-arching story and give the character a purpose other than just surviving, and owning a space ship enables free travel to different worlds whether it be for a change of scenery, to seek natural resources (yes, the distribution of resources differs between planets!), or for conquest!Characters can be customized in many ways, starting with one of 6 different races (each with its own lore and guiding philosophy) through a multitude of hairstyles to lots of clothing styles. Equipment-wise characters can use backpacks, hold items in both hands, or wield two items at the same time (like an axe and a flashlight). Then there's crafting, with each menu offering instant recipe search, categories, direct input of quantities - seems basic, but it all adds up.The survival aspects include the basic need for food and shelter, but also body temperature or a sanity-like dependence on light. The environments are varied, from the casual green meadows to raging ice storms in the frozen wastes, and each environment has its own challenges or advantages. Then there are the inhabitants (if any) - beasts either passive or outright aggressive - that come in different shapes and sizes and can look so outlandish you won't believe what you're seeing. And if beasts are not enough some planets may sport humanoid colones or settlements -- those again may be friendly or not so, but the way to deal with them is comletely up to the player.What appeals to me the most though is the music! The background tracks are great and change to suit the current circumstances -- battle, day/night, storms or sunshine -- it's so good that I can just sit and listen instead of playing. The sound effects are real good too, surfaces have their own footstep sounds, bests roar when attacking or just in their unique ways when idle. Honestly can't recommend this enough and will certainly be following the development.			"

								When you first look at this game, you can't help but think ""Hey, isn't this just a reskin of Terraria?"".But once you play it, you can't help but notice:- It is graphically and aesthetically ( the art style ) better than Terraria, The NPCs and player characters have much more detailed animations and emotes.- It has the same loot mechanics as Terraria, but with better random weapon generation.- It has 7 ( currently six, but with the Novakid coming on a later update ) playable races with their own distinct advantages, craftable race items, ship styles, and dialogue. Starbound also supports custom races, complete their own stuff.- You are not confined to one world and are free to explore any planets on the systems, so long as you have fuel.- Wildlife is also randomly generated, with a chance of them being either passive or aggressive. Mod support for monster parts makes variations seem unlimited.- There is a significant amount of variety in biomes compared to Terraria, with more coming up. Did I mention there's a tentacle biome?~- Giant pilotable robots and vehicles, with more coming out in later updates. There will also be vehicles styled after each race's theme.- The building process is much more complex compared to Terraria. You can ""merge down/up"" blocks so that they are slim or ""fit just right"" allowing you to accomplish more than what several terraria bricks can do.- This game has lore, and lots of it, discovered via book drops and dialogue.-This game has better ambient tracks than Terraria, with combat themes playing when in danger.- When you get hit, you don't sound stupid. Seriously, the most annoying part about Terraria was that one sound effect when you get hit. Luckily, this game has an exponentially *less* annoying sound effect when you get hit.HOWEVER:- This game is in early beta, which means not everything is final yet.- NPCs are almost as dumb as their Terraria counterparts, in that although they may walk into their demise from time to time, they're smart enough to run and hide or call for guards.- This game is poorly optimized, but playable.- The wildlife is just about are almost entropic as their Terraria counterparts. Pray for Saint Jiub when your house is swarmed by bird-like creatures.Final verdict? Buy it if you're interested, but if you want the complete experience, wait for the final product. The recent update also means no more character/ship/world wipes, meaning your progress is permanent in these early stages!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game expecting Terraria in space, honestly. It looked great and i loved the idea, but when i actually played Starbound it felt like i was lied to. The only way i managed to find fun in this game was by playing with a friend of mine, as playing alone would have been frustrating and just plain boring. The beginning of the game is a mad dash to either set up a farm or farm the monsters for meat, because starvation is a very real issue. Unfortunately, the monsters are very cutthroat in Starbound, and won't hesitate to destroy you as quick as possible. Once you get enough meat, you're free to mine down into the world without too much fear, except rapidly respawning monsters love to surprise you in tight corridors and murder you there too. It doesn't help that monsters are randomly generated, so it's hard to find out which ones are friendly or hostile until they're breathing toxic smoke or charging at you at full speed. This aspect does not get any easier or better later in the game.The combat is simplistic and boring. There is no strategy to any enemies because they all attack the same way, which is ""Rush the player and if i have a ranged attack then use that while rushing"". Combat boils down to swinging your weapon at the enemy until it dies, or shooting it until it dies. Dodging is hardly a factor except against the flying enemies on the surface, as underground enemies force you into tight corridors to make avoiding projectiles near impossible.Progression in Starbound feels lazy and uninspired. To get better equipment and to reach planets in other sectors, you need to beat certain bosses. To even fight these bosses, You need to craft a specific boss item that requires a great deal of investment itemwise. Pixels and your valuable metals are commonplace, but some bosses require even more work than that(Such as the robot boss, which requires a rare drop using a weapon that does annoyingly low damage). Most of the bosses are also pathetically easy. As me and my friend fought each one, the boss's sole strategy(With one exception) was the same as the monster's tactics of rush the player while using ranged attacks if possible. The 1st boss is th eonly one with a different strategy, and feels quite epic to fight the first time, but that only makes the coming bosses disappointing. The 2nd boss charges the player and thats all he does. The 3rd and 4th are easily defeated by simply making a thin cave of dirt. The 3rd boss can't break through it and the 4th can't either, leaving both open to attacks with no way of being a threat.Equipment-wise, Starbound fails spectacularly as the game progresses. Lets say you get the best armor you can at the beginning, and now the starting planet seems easy in comparison. You go to the next level planet, to get new ores and materials, only to find that it's like you're on the first planet with starting equipment. This is how it is ALL GAME. You go to the next level planet to get better equipment(such as titanium, or aegisalt) means the enemies now one or two shot you again, and your weapons aren't very threatening to them. Once you upgrade and are ready to go to the next planet, you face the same dilemna each time. It makes the endgame very unsatisfying, especially since the final boss(the fourth, in case you were curious) so far is basically the halfway point for gear collectors. it becomes a boring grind to get better equipment that means nothing at the endgame. It comes across as uninspired to just have the next planet be a gear check to the best you have. Theres nothing unique about later enemies or later armors, except for the armor's look. There are a few redeeming qualities about Starbound however. The planets look very nice, with beautiful visuals and different biomes. There are dungeons to explore and villages to trade it. These feel like where the real work of Starbound is. The villages full of friendly people and guards who will attack you if you come across as hostile. The dungeons that feel scary and unique and feel rewarding(at time at least). Finding my first Glitch castle was an amazing sight, though all of the enemies went down easily, and the treasure was lackluster at that point of the game. It was still amazing, seeing the unique decorations, the atmosphere of each dungeon, and the enemies that filled them. It's a shame the enemies have no real AI beyond the standard though. Would have been nice to raid an avian temple and find snipers or grenade traps instead of guards with guns that were hardly a problem for my two swords. Overall, the game is disappointing to anyone looking for a Terraria-like experience. Even looking at this as it's own game, it's bland and there is no real difference between the races besides visuals. The bosses are not a challenge, the enemy AI is overly simple, the equipment feels pointless, and progression is sluggish and frustrating. For this game to cost 15 dollars is insane, especially since Terraria is ten bucks and frequently on sale for a quarter of that. Theres alot i didn't cover, such as the pixel system(the currency you use in almost every recipe that'll keep you grinding), the weather system(Acid rain can bite me.), and the unique bits of planets at times(Poison water everywhere!? and now i'm freezing?!). Just.. Don't get this game till it's done. Hopefully it'll live up to what it promised, instead of being an overpriced beta thats only fun with friends.			"

								Much of what I have have to say about tihs game is already echoed by many others with much higher hours spent playing the game.   Having said that, Starbound, for me, is the perfect example for why one should not contribute immediately to early access games. At the very least, contributions to early access games should be done a few months into a game's development cycle. It is a complete gamble for the promise of a complete product.  I bought/supported this game when it was first avaliable for early access. At first, updates were regular and patch notes were detailed.  The community was strong and vibrant.  As time progress, updates started becoming less frequent and dialogue between the the developers and the community less so.  I can't speak for others, but the attention given to this game feels pretty much like the attention I give to a project I start and abandon when I realized I bit off more then I can chew.  I bought this game when it was first availabe on Steam and I am pretty annoyed. With the money contributed, I could've bought a finished product and enjoyed it more.  I can not imagine how the players, who originally backed this game on kickstarter and donated more money, must feel. At it's curent state, I highly do not recommend this game.			"

												I previously recommended the game shortly after it went into Early Access, but I have a more structured opinion of the game now. If there was a neutral option, I would set it.Starbound is basically a 2D No Man's Sky that got it mostly right. Freedom to explore as far as you want, wherever you want, whenever you want. You simply need to have fuel in your ship. The planet generation is pretty stellar - no pun intended. There could be all sorts of different alien monsters, a settlement of Florans, or a human military base - complete with lots of shiny loot.However - the main story is lackluster and cliche, revolving around the races you already know exist. Only the intro and the ending are at all interesting, and the boss fights are underwhelming, especially the last one. I suppose that's what you get for trying to insert story into a sandbox game.Starbound did hit the nail on the head with its exploration mechanics, and it does have an active roleplaying community should you be interested in that - however, if kicking butt and taking names while retaining sandbox capabilities is your thing, I'd recommend buying Terraria instead.

								The only reason I can't reccomend this game is because of the team behind it, I love this game but it was supposed to be finished years ago. Worse than it not being done however is that while there is no end to this project in sight still. You may think, hey! Leave them alone! They update on a fequentish basis. Well yea, that would be all well and good if they didn't make it worse with every update. Imagine a game that will never be finished and goes backwards in progress. Either it will stop working, it won't be any fun for any person of any kind anymore, they're finally stop pretending to try because noone will buy it anymore, or something worse that can't even be fathomed... like it getting so bad they change the name and change it into something else. I can't trust them and niether should you. This game is great, honestly by the time you read this it'll probably be a big ""was great"". Thsi game is the equivalent of the Titanic, please don't go down with the ship, spend that 15 dollars on something better like 30 gumballs or something. That's a lot of gum and bubbles, and will eventually add up to more fun and less dissapointment than this will give you.

								Starbound was to be a game with a ton of potential and interesting features.Sadly, these things have yet to be added despite it moving past it's ""certain"" release date of late 2013 and 8 months after the fact. The game, despite being in a beta state, lacks many of it's intended features and is long from having them. The developers do not update based on their promised schedules, do not communicate on a satisfactory level, and seem to think it's okay to push updates and promises down the calender year to solve and sort out later while working on other projects.The scaling of the game is inconsistent, the crafting system is tedious and promotes grinding, the combat is shallow and unrewarding. And many of the seemingly fun things don't matter yet because uses haven't been applied to them. I cannot see this game being complete, at least, not with it's intended features. I cannot recommend this game unless you are interested in an incomplete Early Access game.			"

								Now I've had some fun with this game for sure. Maybe even $15 worth. But I'm going to not recommend it here because of some big issues that will probably stop others from having much with the game. Glitches and other early access issues are not really problems with this game anymore. Honestly, I'm not sure why it's still listed as early access.First of all, you will discover very quickly that the game devolves into nothing more than repetition. Go to the new tier of worlds, get the new tier of resources, use new resources to go to the next tier. Rince, wash, repeat. The exploration is admittedly exhilerating for a while. It didn't get boring to me until after I got to the 4th or 5th tiers when I realized that all 5 million planets are essentially the same exact thing. When I finally got to visit exotic biomes like the tentacle biome, I couldn't even tell the difference between it and the rest of the planets. The same boring algorithm randomly generates all planets using the same pieces. Once you seen the pieces, exploration is never thrilling again, so enjoy it while it lasts.Lastly and most importantly, it's been half a year since I've seen a noticeable update to this game. I guess the devs got all the early access money they wanted and just stopped bothering. This game is just one of the many successful early access games I've seen, and contributes to a larger problem I'm having with early access games. Once a game goes early access, it never seems to be anything but early access. This is the problem with a business model where the customer willingly pays a game company the full retail price for their game before the game is ready. The company no longer has any need to continue spending money and time on the product because they've already been paid. Unless some sort of contrat legally holds the company to a set of promises, the early access model will continue to be a flaw in the industry.			"

								Starbound is a stunning and fun game that is easy to learn and play by yourself, or even with others.You can choose your race and customise the appearance of your character. You are spawned in a random planet that is chosen by the computer from a variety of worlds.Similar to Terraria, you have to scavenge for supplies, weapons, and resourses to build a home and live in a safe, friendly environment. Except in Starbound you don't live on just one planet for the whole time.You can gather fuel such as xoal for your ship to run, and take you to a new, and completely different planet filled with totoally new generated caves, enemies, dungeons and many more.As Starbound is still in Early Access, i think the directors of this games have done and outstanding job so far. I think this game deserves a 8.5/10 based on the early access stage. "

												I don't have an excessive time in it, but my experience with what I have done with the game so far was so bad that I refunded it.Let's give some context here, Here is a game that is no longer in early access and with system requirements that my computer easily exceeds. So why is it that whenever the game decides it's going to rain my FPS has to completely drop to 30 or lower? Why is this a normal occurance that this community just accepts? Performance is all over, it's overall playable I guess, but if what I hear is true, once you get to populated planets or a hub the framerate is terrible too. This rediculous, and these positive reviews were not covering this as if it didn't matter??But I'm Me, I played on an Intel HD 1000 for a long time in the past, low fps is something I can handle. But the UI, ohhhh my goodddddddddd. The UI is awful, I mean this is not a subjective thing, it IS DREADFUL to use, it is so jarring to play games like Terraria, Minecraft or most any PC game and then go to this game. You find it's clunky, difficult to find anything, difficult to navigate and so on. It's digusting how bad a PC games interace is. And it does get in the way, you WILL fight with it. Why can't I just right click crafting stations, storage, doors etc like every other PC game of this genre? You instead have to hover over it and press E. Because of course, the slower route is basically the only route right now.Add onto this, crafting is annoying, it takes time to craft things, and you need to keep the crafting window open which can be annoying to watch, but I guess this is a survival game technically. By like the furthest definition of it. Which brings me to the food meter, that doesn't get explained to you in the tutorial until your close to starving, I seriously didn't even know it was there, it's just a bar sitting up in the corner, it doesn't have a food icon or anything. It feels like such a tacked on feature that doesn't have to exist, and wouldn't lose anything by getting rid of it.Finally the games melee combat is terrible, especially against multiple enemies, the sword doesn't just swing like it should, it does a little combo animation thing over and over, which looks nice but doesn't keep enemies back even if you are backpeddling away from them. It also doesn't strike smaller units that manage to be under the sword when you are striking and it feels very unfun to use. Terraria did this much better by having swords arch down more.I know my hours don't show much, but this was enough to make me refund the game, it feels very unprofessional and I have no idea what is in store after I leave the beginning planet, and quite frankly I don't care anymore. If these seem minor to you then pick it up if the other reviews convince you, if these could bother you, then maybe check into workarounds or wait to see if they get fixed.			"

												To give a good discription of why this game is good, I only need to say a few words.It's Terraria with space travel and a story. Also, it's no man's sky with content besides geology simulator.Now, that's just the surface of this glorious experience. You can be a human, bird, space gorrila, a tribal plant thing, a japanese fish, or a person that was a star. Oh, and I forgot to mention the feudal robots. There are space alpacas, penguins that are criminals, frogs, space nazis, space hitler, tentacle planet, (formerly known as earth), Giant spiders, giant holographic ape heads that shoot lazer fists at you, bird robot, proceduraly generated monsters, and worlds.Now, there's one more thing about this game, that can eighter; make it better, or make it much, much, oh so much worse. Mods. If you're going to mod this game, stick to the workshop. It has the quality mods, made by people who arn't bronies or furries. You'll get ship, weapon, meme, and cosmetic mods, with a few race extenders and races. There are some S.A.I.L replacements here too. But, besides the workshop, DO NOT, AND I REPEAT DO NOT INSTALL ANY MODS THAT ARE NOT FROM STEAM. From nexus, you'll get porn and fetish mods, and anywhere else, it's much the same. One more risk from instaling mods, workshop or not, you have the chance of completely bricking a save, because you installed it incorrectly, or you removed it. (ship mods are the worst in this regard.)In short, there's lots to do and see in this game, and if you ignore the existance of 75% of the mods for this game, you'll have a great time probably. Or your computer will just refuse to run it at a decent frame rate. That's a problem too.			"

								There are over 423,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo planets in the Starbound universe. Each star system is in every person's own universe with key placements at each location. An example would be that if I found a major floran prison in the Artella system, the outter orbit ring from the star, at Kremler III-b planet... chances are your game will have a giant floran base there too. However! It will not be identical. Your universe will generate the planet, wildlife, most loot conatiners, some structures, and even sub biomes differently. Think of it as a marriage between using seeds and proceedural generation.There is over half a dozen major races. Most of then playable. Each has its own lore and background which you can sometimes find bits of while exploring the 423 qadrillion worlds. You will find quiet peaceful villages of NPCs. You will find hostile military bases. You can start your own colony and recieve randomly generated quests. Sometimes your colonists will dislike other colonists. Sometimes a colonist wants more respecting and standing. Sometimes they just might ask for a cake.The creatures you find on worlds are all randomly generated as well. A giant really big codex of different heads is consulted. Which world type biome and sub-biome filters things. Then a random head is picked. That head has a list of attacks and other features, which one is picked. Then onto the body. Arms. Legs... and so on. Then colors are selected. That species is then tagged as passive or hostile by defualt and you will find those on that planet. Each planet has multiple creatures, of course. Eventually you can play Pokemon and capture some. Use them to help you in combat or build a zoo. Robotic things, flying things, creeping things, lumbering things... there's just so many possibilities of creatures you will see. Weapons. Think Borderlands. There's a LOT of weapon types. Each with their random rolls. 2-handed weapons have a random secondary attack. I have a spear that does fire damage and it doubles as a flame thrower! Its also nice because fire = a strong light source for exploring deep down inside of caves. There are melee weapons, modern weapons, futuristic weapons, magic weapons, consumable weapons like grenades... the selection is impressive. Armor increases damage so if you find a FANTATSIC weapon 2 hours in you will still be able to use this weapon in the harshest of worlds effectively once you completed the progression tree.There is a good wiring system to let do intresting things with items. Its just like redstone from Minecraft basically. There are so many block types. SO. MANY. You can color some blocks with a painting tool. Some blocks you can craft some you need to get out there and collect. Some blocks, like dirt, come in many colors. All this is good for people who whish to make a colony or intresting bases and such. More then this there are thousands of other items. Thousands. You might find an arcade machine. A coffee maker. A floran statue. Litteraly so many decoration items... best part is you can scan these into your ship's 3D printer and make more of them for your building projects.Starbound offers amazing exploration in a gigantic universe which you can explore on your own single player then take your same character online to your favorite servers. What I enjoy about Starbound is the game is built to be modded. When this game comes out there are going to be exceptional projects out there. Already the game feels alive to me offering more then just fighting and killing. It has such a scope but at the same time it feels casual. Does not make you eat every 5 mins nor will there be gigantic game ending alein attacks every hour. Play at your own pace... go to planets with difficulty levels you find enjoyable. Do or do not do what you find fun :) Starbound is a game I adore so very very much. Perfect? No. It takes these guys a YEAR to push out a major update. Which is stupid and far too long. Other little things I dislike too but all in all?One of my fav games. Overwhelmingly I give it a solid 5 out of 5 ... this is one of my favorites!			"

												TL;DR:- Cut content that was present in the beta and is absent from the final release.-The monsters and combat still feel very repetitive and unoriginal after around 2 hours in game.-Lots of stuff that was promised is nowhere to be seen-Pets still feel underwhelming.-Vehicles still useless and broken.I enjoyed playing during the beta, seeing how much potential this game had and what it could have become.Sadly, they decided to release the beta and sell it as the finished product.:: Cut content ::When I went to create my old character (which was obviously wiped) and start anew, I noticed that they actually removed some customization options (either hairstyles or various color options for different races), why they would remove content before releasing the game is beyond me.Furthermore, while they did add more biomes and dungeons, they also removed some (USCM bunkers, for instance).Every time you pick up any material (be it dirt or other kinds of terrain) it goes back to its default color, which is really not great if you wanted to export a particular planet's biome or whatever.:: Lore and character interaction ::They drastically changed the lore which featured deeply rooted hostility beetween some races and factions, which was completely justified given that the florans nearly brought the hylotl to extinction, but now they are all friends, hugging each other (this change is related to NPCs interactions).:: Hunger mechanic ::The new hunger mechanic is nice, except for the fact that you cannot stack food, and while this is not bad per se (imagine if you could just stack 1000 canned food per slot in your inventory, so much for survival), it makes farming crops extremely painful and boring, because you need to go back and forth ad infinitum harvesting the crop and storing it in the fridge (which also has limited capacity, so you need 10 fridges if you wanna have a decent storage of food).This issue could be easily fixed, in which case I'll update this review.

								It was the evening, when a good friend of mine, gifted me Starbound. I found out the good news while browsing my email box on the toilet. I had ingested quite a few microwave burritos that I found in a box behind my garage, earlier in the day, so naturally my stomach felt as if it were filled with a sludge of toxic dooky matter. But I digress, I was sitting there on the toilet perusing my netbook and reading email when *DING* I got the giftcode in my inbox. I was so surprised that at that moment my unpuckered♥♥♥♥♥♥began expelling the most raunchiest blast of poodoo ever, launching me far across the bathroom and lodging me in the wall between rooms. That is where I am now, typing this missive while awaiting the latest patch so that I can continue my Starbound adventure. I fully recommend everyone play this game but I also suggest you wait until your stomach is void of any food so that you don't find yourself like me, stuck between walls and using a broom handle to type on my keyboard acrossed the room. A++ would buy again.			"

 STALE TOAST Please note this is a long review therefore if you are not the reading type then perhaps move on...I have been a huge fan for a while and this game has given me tons of hours of fun (Even though my game time indicates otherwise, I played a tremendous amount +/- 200 hours offline, the recorded hours is my multiplayer gaming) however since Starbound 1.0 was released, I was incredibly disappointed.A huge amount of content has been cut, so I'm a little perplexed and bitterly disappointed. The perfect analogy to explain this disappointing event is as follows :-What the menu saidThick Toasted bread with pickled onions, mustard, melted stringy cheese and roast beef. Topped with a side serving of gourmet salad or golden french fries and includes a bottomless drink of your choice.Starbound 1.0Stale ToastI must warn you as a buyer that this game was extremely exciting and had a huge amount of variety that slowly vanished and materialised into... well.. stale toast.Here is a short list of mechanics and other things which were cut that made me frown: Large amounts of weapons and apparel have been cut which killed the diversity. The Dynamic Temperature System. Some awesome mobility options were cut (Flying). Weapons and items would react in so many diverse and interesting ways.We now we sit with no temperature system, farming planets for days to find theme-based equipment so everything is stratified, no flying and just meh...Quests and progression system is linear,simple and a bag of stale toast: Obtain Item   Use Item to get to point A Obtain a different item at point B and then travel to Point C to make a new item. Use new Item to get to Point D to get even newer item when you arrive Guess what... now go to point E to... lemme guess, get a even newer item at point E... No sir, you get stale toast.The only cool thing about the aforementioned is the grass changes color as you progress through the planets and you may perhaps see an eyeball tree or two.The main story line feels forced and just meh... The reason why I say that is because I thought it was going to be a fun filled adventure, riddled with combat, mystery, excitement and unrestrictiveness. My initial thought was gunned down as multiple features, shops and so forth are locked from you, until you progressed enough in the story line.Thus I have to play the game their way so I can do Plan A. It immediately becomes linear and flat... I grow tired of finding the specific planets to scan things ...stale toast. Further disappointment followed after it was incredibly short and not very rewarding.With regards to the side missions there isn't anything much more exciting than the main story line... The quests are really boring (MMO style) and you get three categories of quests: Go get this Kill this,  Bring this to this person.To top it off the rewards they are totally not worth it, you generally receive ""surprise bag"" which contains either a M.M. Upgrade Module, a Tech Card or sometimes if you lucky...stale toastCrafting your weapons/armor is pointless and ultimately stale toast:Kindly advise the reason for the crafting system?It can be can be a tedious task to farm up resources for specific armor, however it ends up being easier to loot weapons, sell them to vendors, once you have saved enough pixels take the shortcut of just buying the armor.Therefore it renders the crafting system useless cause you can either buy that awesome looking armor a little later in game or you will most likely have a drop which looks like stale toast yet it has better stats than your badass super diamond handled laser axe!I've always enjoyed rare drops as I find it thrilling to kill a boss an he unexpectedly drops that axe you always dreamed of or go exploring to find that random box sitting there full of riches (this is in-game kinda) but this further diminishes the reason for this system to be implemented. Since day one of me playing Starbound I have ignored the weapon/armor crafting system entirely and have only used it when forced.Overall gameplay and other current mechanicsI found out that the moon (or in this case moons) are not made of cheese... it was crusty in texture, bland and.. well more like stale toast. Moons are nothing exciting you just go there jump over spikes 'n stuff to get to that purple liquid that is turned into fuel that allows you to arrive to another planet. So yeah that's it for them wonderful moons.... Giant, Bland, Lifelessm Fuel Stations kinda like the Shell Gas Station at 3 am.Colonies are fun to build but they serve no purpose... once created and you leave... that is it, your colonists just stand there or  walk around... there is no need for your return unless you left your badass super diamond handled laser axe behind again. All that hard work for no real purpose. Secondly if you create large colonies like me your frame rate tends to suffer. So I stopped creating colonies as it wasn't worth it. Plus with everyone just standing around doing nothing, their dwellings only contained stale toastPets bounce around and do a little fighting but yeah... after my second pet I abandoned this feature as there is nothing exciting about it other than providing a little extra dps.Starbound has this massive universe and I find it absent... its just missing that spark that it had in early access.The Crux:The game is priced well and it did have bang for the amount you paid but that was then.Beautiful worlds, drizzled with interesting concepts in large universe however this is crippled with not that much to do. Once one has built a large base and/or made your ship look bad♥♥♥♥♥you are left with a boring and short story line that is plagued with rinse and repeat mechanics. As I progressed I was shocked at the lack of content... it just became so uninspired... it all boiled down to traveling from planet to planet mining the next tier of resources and making stuff, stopping at this moon to get fuel. (Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥what about my colony, agh nothing happens so they will be fine... move you stupid cat I can't see what I'm doing!!! <meow>)Later you have to go around to certain planets in order find each of the six races and their civilizations, start clicking around for green highlighted objects to scan them, talk to this NPC then that NPC to learn more about them to eventually get the next mission and so on and so forth.Some of these missions are like little instances, with an objective and puzzles with monster dotted everywhere. They tend to entertain you for a little while, but after a couple the novelty wears off and its rinse and repeat.Make your ship/house look pretty, travel again, craft this, buy that, travel here to complete this... low and behold that is it.I am not jumping on the hate train however I was bitterly disappointed with the final product and this game was leaps back at version 1.0... the beta versions were far better and I must say the current state that it is in has curbed my enthusiasm for the for a while and will probably not play it again if it remains in this state thus I cannot recommend it.Starbound is certainly not the worst game I have ever played and had some really fun moments (especially multiplayer) however it is so large but it's atmosphere is lacking, current game content gets boring fast. It only took me a few hours to get bored of Starbound 1.0. It is a very sad day indeed for Starbound... Please fix yourself I miss you♥♥♥♥♥3/10 can't do stale toast again. "

												It is an amazing game. Great visuals, relaxing music, and very cute art style.The problem is balance, progression and gameplay.Combat gets old quickly. Enemies use mostly the same kind of AI, and even though they look different, strategies are the same. The issue is that combat is unfun due to high damage dealt by enemies and low damage dealt by you. The game features worst kind of quests - ""search"" quests. ""Find unknown number of things for no reason whatsoever, we won't tell you where, though."" There are couple of quests where you're required to scan X items of race Y in order to complete the quest. THe quest usually says that ""They can be planed on planet of type Z revolving around star of type W"".... The problem is that the universe is randomly generated, meaning that when you find the star of the right type, it may not have the race you need, may not have the items you need, etc. It is extremely frustrating.Want to avoid ""search quests""? You can't. You have to progress through them in order to unlock shops, upgrades, etc.There's also the whole material progression nonsense, straight out of minecraft/terraria. There's material X, then there's material Y that is stronger than X, but is in more dangerous location, then there's material Z that's stronger than Y but is in even more dangerous location, BUT to get to location with material Z, you must first to unlock upgrade W, for which you need to find material Q, and even once you found it, you need to build upgrade B constructed on object A. There are chains of that nonsense.Digging mechanics, again. It is better than in terraria, but the game could use some mining explosivesThe game has some very strange design ideas. For example, upgrading your armor increases amount of damage you deal with weapons. It is very non-obvious. Last tier armor could upgrade your damage 5 times or more, and trying to fight enemies without it means plinking things to death (to your death, that is). You can't skill those.Speaking of which even tiniest enemies can deal truckload of damage and have a lot of health. Basically, you plink everything to death, unless you search half the galaxy for materials, do a very annoying upgrade chain, and get something that'll boost your damage but only against certain tier of enemies, and to face next tear, you need to hunt for materials again. Sigh.On unrelated note npcs love chasing you around only to stand in front of an interactive item you wanted to click, blocking it.The devs did a great job creating amazing aesthetics/presentation... but messed up with the gameplay, which is not very good. The problem with gameplay is that it often sends you searching for some item, except that in infinite random generated universe, you don't always know where the item is. Searching for needles in a haystack, again and again. Those searches pretty much destroy game pacing and ""immersion"" The intro mission is amazing, but when you're searching for one more thing in the infinite universe, it doesn't feel like that intro.I have impression, that developer's attempt to focus on ""survival"" ultimately ruined the game, because it looks like a lot of effort was put into making stuff harder to obtain. Alright, so you wanna grow a certain plant. You can't buy the seeds, you have to find them. You want to make a sword.... you can't buy the ore, you have to find it. You need a rare material for a cool building? You have to find it. Prices for everything are high, cash is hard to obtain, and selling prices for items is incredibly low. Heck, at least in dwarf fortress you had creative ways of obtaining materials, were mostly fine with lower-tier materials (rarer metal didn't automaticlaly mean stronger weapon) and could buy stuff from passing caravans.  20 hours in you might discover that you CAN buy the ore, if you do a quest for a merchant, and said quest, will require you to hunt through half of the galaxy for some plant seeds and crafting stations. Meaning it is ""To get A, find B, to find B, craft C, to craft C do X, and to do X, find Y and Z"". Oh, and if you want to sell fifty thousand tons of rocks you mined? Well, their selling price is zero. The experience is very uneven, searching for things in infinite randomly generated universe is very annoying, and many elements of gameplay feel strange. It is very tempting to just play on minimum difficulty and use cheats for any items you have trouble finding. ---------In the end, it is a pity. Amazing visuals and presentation, ruined by flawed not well thought out gameplay component.			"

								I've finally decided to weigh in on this game. I really wanted to love it and have played it for what seems like hudrededs of hours. Like other reviewers I would say that yes, it needs a greater sense of purpose. It needs something to make me care after I have played it as long as I have. I have endured the game hoping the next update would make it the great game it could be.  Instead I have lost and had to redo many character because the game lives only in early access and continues to have  updates that erase your characters. I've gotten tired of messing with game files to keep my passed characters. I wanted  this game to crush Mine craft. Starbound has alot going for it, but it has taken to long to get here. The developers needs to  Stop creating new games titles and foucus on finishing this game Asap.  Give it purpose and you will have a winner. Until then I can no longer recommend this title. In the passed I have recommend it to friend I have even bought two copies one for me and on for my daughter. She like Mine craft better ahhhh.			"

												The 6 levels of progression are like a single game with new game plus. Each progression is identical. Explore a different planet for new city, click everything in site, mine for a small amount of material that's conveniently located on the same planet, build new level of boots, chest armour, helmet and breathing pack, fight slightly different looking boss that's mind numbingly easy.  If you like the building/exploration of terraria then buy this game. If you're looking for space themed digital lego with unlimited, but exactly the same, content, then this game is for you. If you're looking for an actual video game, with some amount of problem solving, challenges or enjoyable boss fights, then look elsewhere. I enjoyed Terraria - but this game ruined everything that I enjoyed about Terraria and made everything ridiculously easy.Boring.Ps. Multiplayer doesn't make it better. It's like you are all playing your own game, but can randomly drop into the other person's game if needed. But you won't, because what's the point?			"

												Popular games often inspire others to follow their lead. We saw it ages ago with Doom and Starcraft, we saw it in a huge way with Minecraft, and we saw it again with Terraria, itself following in the footsteps of Minecraft. There's nothing wrong with trying to improve on a formula unless you completely miss what made the original good, and somehow that happens all too often. Starbound seemed for the longest time to be the one true heir to Terraria, but it's clear now it's fallen into the same trap so many others have.Starbound sets you as the newest member of the Protectorate, a galactic peacekeeping and civil service force based out of Earth. Your graduation ceremony serves as a brief tutorial before♥♥♥♥♥♥goes wrong and you escape the destruction of the planet on the first rustbucket ship you find. A quick faster-than-light jump leaves you stranded in orbit around an alien world with no fuel to leave, no tools besides your Matter Manipulator, and an aggressively helpful AI.From this humble beginning you can make your mark on the galaxy. The main questline helps you get your ship up and running, introduces you to a trade hub with tons of stuff for sale, and sets you on track to confront the thing that destroyed the Earth. In pursuing any of these goals you'll be exploring randomly-generated planets of all sorts, from verdant forest worlds to icy hellscapes to tentacle morasses and more. No matter the composition, each planet will have resources to gather and treasures to uncover, most of which are hinted at in the planetary scan from your ship.Once you beam down to a planet you'll have to hike your way around from your landing site, either across the open terrain or venturing down into the caves every world is honeycombed with. Numerous creatures inhabit these places and most of them are aggressive, so you'll be needing to take weapons and gear and be ready for a fight. There's a wide range of swords, axes, spears, whips, pistols, rifles, launchers, and so on to equip yourself with, each with randomized stats and effects. I never found anything too outlandish but you can dual wield one-handed items, allowing you to enjoy stabbing and shooting all at once.Your Matter Manipulator is used to dig, break down walls and objects for collection, and place materials from your inventory. This means there's plenty of construction to do if you want a quaint home on the alien prairies, and you'll need one for all the different crafting stations and upgrades needed to progress. It was here that the game started to break down for me though, because building bases in Terraria was my favorite part and I was super excited to do the same in space. However, having a base in Starbound isn't nearly as convenient, necessary, or useful because of your ship. You need your ship to explore the cosmos and return to the trade hub for important quests and purchases, so every trip to your base is a bunch of extra beaming and warping steps. You can build a teleport pad for your base but it requires a rare drop and a TON of money for just one.Once I realized what a pain it was going to be to maintain a base, I started to see the same annoyances in everything else. Crafting is a huge one, because there are so many additional steps and requirements just to make basic things. In Terraria you just needed the material, but in Starbound not only do you need materials, but for building blocks you need to have FOUND the item to produce before, and for other items you need blueprints which are randomly dotted around the universe. So you might have dreams of a neon techy space colony but unless you find one to strip AND score the blueprints for all the furniture, you're stuck with your dirt and wood hovels.Stripping buildings and resources is something you'll spend plenty of time doing, either to make gear from ores or just get cool blocks to build with. But your basic Matter Manipulator is maddeningly slow and the upgrades require tons of modules which are, again, scattered across the universe. And even if you strip down a whole base, it fills your inventory with so many special blocks and items you can barely carry it all. Starbound has a mind-boggling amount of items and furniture and materials to play with but ironically this drags the game down because it makes it so much harder to collect and organize and use. Terraria didn't have the best inventory system but I've spent so much more time in Starbound's just trying to get the junk I want to build to the place I want to build it.The deeper you dive into Starbound, the more roadblocks you run into. There's a huge spread of side activities like archaeology and pet collecting and cooking and ship upgrades and vehicles but every single one is locked behind quests and random drops and money. Money is easily the worst part, because you need tons for everything you want to do, but at the base difficulty you lose a full THIRD of what you've earned when you die. And you're going to die a fair bit unless you're terribly cautious, because enemies are aggressive and do loads of damage, and even just falling a short distance can end your fragile life. It's crushing because every time I sit down to play I start out optimistic and eager to find or build new things, and then 20 minutes later the same walls start rising up again to get in my way.There's so much I could talk about in Starbound that ends up ruined by needless complications and restrictions. It's maddening because the game is ostensibly about the freedom to do what you want, explore where you want, and build what you want, but the design simply does not support those goals. Terraria understood how to achieve this, how to give players this freedom while placing new items and options just close enough to strive for. Starbound gives you an entire galaxy of possibilities and then slaps your hand away every time you reach for them, pointing you back to laborious quests or high prices to deal with first. I wish I could like Starbound, I really do, because it's gorgeous and charming and has so much to do, but it refuses to just let you enjoy any of it. Until it learns to ease up I'll be building castles and soaring through the clouds in you-know-what, because it doesn't feel so much like work there.			"

Early Access Review
								The pitch for this game is exceptional, especially for those of us looking for something like Terraria with more content and discovery...The issue is in the lackluster execution of that pitch. The architecture and design team is un-focused. This team does not appear to have anyone leading it whom is capable of drawing out their potential. The team ignores their core gameplay experience and instead invests heavily in 'pet projects' that most players find to be moronic.─────────────────────────────────────██ An example discussion over at ChuckleFish HQ:─────────────────────────────────────• Tim: ""OHH, we need harps in this game man!!!! That way our characters can play musics!""• Jim: ""BRILLIANT MATE. Let's also add 20 different sizes of snowballs""• Sandy: ""... How will we integrate that into the core gameplay experience to make it rewarding?""• Tim: ""DUDE, a harp is it's own reward. I will spend 80 hours working on tunes too!""• Jim: ""Yeah, and I will make flavored snowballs, who would not want their snowballs to have flavors!!! THIS IS SO RAD. TERRARIA's never had flavored snowballs""* Names have been changed to protect the 'innocent'─────────────────────────────────────██ TL;DR: Do not buy, is unlikely to be finished or fun.─────────────────────────────────────*sigh* If only there were a good lead to tell them to focus on the core gameplay experience. They have not worked out practical gameplay problems such as the progression and rewards around critical elements (Mining, Armor, Weapons, Bosses). Instead, most all they seem to do is add bloat that the designers think are 'cool' like flavored snowballs and harps. No joke.			"

												No, the answer is no, you should not buy Starbound.The reasons are multitudinous, but let's start with what they get right. The game looks nice and sounds nice, the soundtrack is pretty boss and I never had a track there that I disliked. That's it, that's all they get right.The main storyline is bad, the lore isn't bad, but perversely going v1.0 involved deleting all of the MUCH better lore present in the beta(I think one or two books survived, but that's it), both hugely reducing the volume of lore present, and rewriting a ton of stuff to have a much more serious tone which the game just can't support. The main storyline consists of six missions which steadily get lazier and less detailed as you go along, until it's literally just a flat plain where you kill enemies for ten minutes until you get a boss that has only a single attack pattern. Still, the pre-made dungeons for the main storyline are still better than the actual planets...Because there's nothing interesting on the planets, at all. Each planet has(or, well, most...), one dungeon, one village, and one or two minidungeons lying around that just contain a structure and a chest. Everything else on the planet is dull filler full of really annoying monsters, and getting around the planet is more annoying than in the beta because they removed some techs that made travelling much faster and less painful.Also, ""most planets,"" because several planet types(magma, frigid ocean and toxic) contain nothing. Literally nothing. Not even dungeons or minidungeons. And they don't even have any special resources to mine for that the other planets don't have.The combat is also pretty bad, because 90% of the weapons you get are useless, and the remaining 10% completely trivialize combat. There's a literal ONE useful secondary function for weapons(assault rifles with grenade launchers), and all the rest are an absolute waste of your energy. Melee weapons are thoroughly pointless, they have no advantage over ranged weapons unless your hand-eye coordination is too poor to know how to aim.Crafting suffers from having way too many crafting stations and way too many crafting ingredients, especially because the game still only pulls ingredients from your inventory, not nearby containers. Crafting weapons and armor has, what, 50-ish ingredients to keep track of? If you add in food-crafting, you're easily at around 150, if it stops there. So have fun keeping track of where you put all those ingredients, or even just which ones you have in storage.Speaking of crafting food. Food in your inventory decays, so it benefits you to eat the closest to decaying first. However, there's no option to sort your food tab by ""decay level."" So you have to mouse-over each unit of food in your inventory to figure out which ones you should eat. Also, speaking of sorting, you can sort your own inventory tabs, but not currently-opened containers, so your storage will ALWAYS be a mess.I remember they said they were going to add it in, but NPC's still don't give a damn if you rummage through all their sock drawers and steal all their♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also doing this is so lucrative that you often won't need to mine at all, since random villagers nebulously have piles of rare ores lying around their bedroom or attic most of the time. The rest of the time you get manipulator parts or tech cards.Manipulator parts are nice because they take the mining/building parts of the game from ""suicide-inducingly slow"" to ""frustratingly slow."" Tech cards are worthless since there are four upgrades for each tech, but they're sidegrades, not linear upgrades, so you're really only going to want to pick one upgrade for each tech(the only one I actually used outside of main quest dungeons was the double jump, too). This will cost you 16 tech cards total, but the game just keeps pouring them on you. It feels like they were originally meant to have more of a point.Speaking of things that don't have a point, the Outpost, AKA the only place in the game with merchants you'll ever care about, starts out not being fully staffed, gaining open shops as the main quest progresses. However, once the main quest is over, there's literally nothing left in the game. So the outpost will only be fully staffed by the time you no longer care if it is or not.Also, on the main quest again. 50% of the main quest involves looking for randomly generating items, with no idea whether they're present or not before landing on a planet. It's slow and tedious. To be more precise, you need to scan certain items, of a certain species' construction. There's a stage for each species for this, and only that species' items count during that stage. So if, say, you find a place with all the Apex items you need to scan during the Floran stage... too bad, hope you remember where that planet was by the time the Apex stage rolls around.The game also has terrible performance, so any time there's more than three enemies and/or an atmospheric effect on screen, it'll slow to a near-crawl and half the time ignore your keypresses. Logically, the final boss fight them involves constantly spawning large amounts of tiny enemies. This does make it the only challenging boss fight in the game, though, because sometimes the game will ignore a keypress when you use a healing item and almost condemn you to play it again. It's not a bad boss fight outside of that, it's just waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much of the same thing over and over again. Either reduce the final boss' health bar by, like, half, or add some more stages to him to shake things up a bit.The rest of the game's bosses are defeated by finding a staff with the [Element] Portal spell and placing it on top of them while you dodge their projectiles(Erchius Horror excepted, but that's only the very first boss, you probably don't have a staff by then).I probably missed SOMETHING else that was bad about the game, but it ultimately amounts to ""pretty much everything, except for one piece of fluff(Ironbeak) and the music. Oh and also all those other pieces of fluff that they inexplicably deleted, but I guess they don't really count, do they?""EDIT: Forgot that they also, inexplicably, decided to make asteroid fields pointless, they used to have resources and facilities, now they have literally NOTHING. Moons got emptied out as well, for basically just a pointless fuel collecting minigame. Barren planets got added, and, again, they're a type of planet with NOTHING on them, not even trees.			"

												Underwhelming is the only word needed to describe this game as of 1.0I have ~100 hours in this game, and 80 of them are just screwing around in multiplayer pretending to have fun.  The only reason I didn't stop at 30 hours was because I got a few friends on a server and I enjoyed hanging with them. We weren't playing the game, Starbound was just the chat platform we used.The story is against the very nature of Starbound. It forces you to be the good guy. Ontop of that, it's literally just 5 repeated ""go fetch this to fight boss"" quests that ends up in a game-ending boss that's stupid hard to solo but a walk in the park for 2 players.The ships are too different. Novakid' ship has (personal opinion) the coolest design, but it's probably the smallest one even after it's fully upgraded. The developers said there would be different advantages for the different races, but so far, the literally only advantage one race has over all the others is that it glows in the dark. But actually, all races glow in the dark, for some reason. There's no reason to choose any 1 race over another. Adding game-changing advantages to each race would allow for 7 different replays, right now there's just 1 playthrough, and after that, you've seen all the game has to offer. The enemies are incredibly boring and generic. Every enemy is a reskin of another enemy. There are basically 2 enemies in the game: flying, and not flying. Everything that flies just dashes into you from the air to deal damage. Everything not flying runs into you to deal damage from either side. Every planet is the same under the surface. The dungeons are boring. The celestial system makes no sense. You can find ice planets in close orbits around ""Fiery stars"" but around the very same star, there's a magma ocean way further out. It makes 0 sense. Do not be fooled by the ""Procedual generation"" everyone is talking about. The universe is the same to everyone. It may have been generated originally, but if you start over with a new charachter, it's the exact same universe. If you go online to a server, you'll find the exact same planets at the exact same coords and each tile is placed exactly the same. Basebuilding is pointless because you can have everything in your ship. Engineer crewmembers are overpowered to the point where it's not even funny. I have 1 single engineer, and he's upgraded my ship so much without me doing anything that I can fly from one star to another without using a single unit of fuel. That's right, I use so little fuel now that it rounds it down to not using any fuel at all. That ain't fun.Moons are boring. They have 1 feature that makes them attractive: fuel for your ship. That's it. Moons are useless once you have an engineer and 2k units of fuel (see above). And to round it off, here's just a warning for you multiplayer lovers: Do. Not. Group. Up. With. Strangers. You will find that your ship is raided and destroyed before you can even do anything about it. Your ship has 0 protection against randoms from just click-and-draging their Matter Manipulator over all your crates, effectively stealing and despawning all your loot and crafting material. What's the point of multiplayer if you have to risk everything you've worked for up to that point just to play with other strangers. On the other hand, if you don't want to grind through the game, just join multiplayer and raid ships. Free loot with no consequences! "

												This review is of the game in the 1.0 update, the first version of the game in Beta.-The story is fine, the quests however got really repetivite.-They have cut down on the tech variation you can have, you now only got one that modifies your mobility sideways, one     upwards, and one that turns you into a small ball.-The randomness of loot is still rather bad.-The story forced you to find different villages of different factions, something that got rather tedious since at times you just couldn't find one, no matter how many planets you walked around, yes, you need to walk around one planet after another until you find the right village, 4 times...-getting end-game gear was rather easy.It took me a bit under 30 hours to complete this, that's with a few hours of AFK time as well. Unless you like this type of game, then as of now, I wouldn't recommend this game, not for 15 $ at least, maybe after another big update. "

												Edited:I've been playing Starbound since its Early Access days, and let me tell you that the game has seen many changes since its debut alpha/beta launch. I've lost many characters due to updates, patches, and game overhauls, but alas that has yet to stop me from enjoying the game. With the full release of Starbound, the game is more fun than ever! Chucklefish has done a wonderful job in bringing us a space themed crafting/sandbox game. The story is good and the infinitely generated universe keeps the game fresh and appealing. Your exploration of planets will be well rewarded with a vast loot system of weapons, armors, ores and items. Each planet is unique in design and may contain settlements, dungeons, ruins, prisons, research centers, trading post or may be void of life all together. In addition to planetary life, you may also encounter enviromental hazards as well that can constantly put you in danger! Crafting, upgrading, survival, mining and randomly generated quest will form the base of your gameplay and it is a rather rewarding grind.Overall I recommend Starbound to anyone who enjoys crafting/sandbox games and enjoys grinding for rewards! I also recommend the Starbound Sountrack as well!10/10			"

								I used to ♥♥♥♥ing love this game a couple years ago. I forgot what update ruined the game, but all I know is that the Sector system (Alpha, Beta, etc.) was removed in the update that just made me forget this game. It used to be a blast, going around planets and trying to find new gear. There was actually a reason to build on land. It was a great game that I still remember to this day.Today it's not even close to what I remember it being. The quests that NPCs give you seem so childish and just bland for the theme of the game. The, ""AIs"", for ships don't make much sence to me. The ship upgrading ruined the need to look for a good planet to call home. The game is far from what it used to be: Fun. I understand all the negative reviews. I feel the same nostalgia that they do as well. If there was a way to go back to older versions of the game, I'd still probably be playing it today. The updates just made this game horrible.			"

The only thing that I truly have a problem with is the ridiculous slowdown and lag that the game constantly has. I know I don't have the best PC in the world, but I know I can runs games much more taxing than this. The fact that a game as simple as this drops to 5fps is inexcusable. I should be able to run this MUCH faster than the likes of Dark Souls 3 or Skyrim at max settings WITH visual mods.Do I want to recommend it? Yes. Will I? NoThe Devs need to work out the slowness issues and the fact it only uses one core.			"

I've always internally defined ""beta"" like this: ""The game runs for longer than 20 minutes without crashing, and the bulk of its initial featureset is implemented, however don't expect completeness or stability"". While the first part of this definition interestingly disqualifies certain Skyrim patches, Starbound fits the definition perfectly - I can run the game for hours on end, with no crashes, and I do get the odd bug here and there (also it doesn't seem like Chucklefish has figured out balance yet at the time of this writing). If you buy in early, be prepared for character wipes - they seem to be rare currently, but Now onto the game itself. Essentially, the game is ""Terraria in Space"". This isn't a bad thing. In fact, Starbound improves on many concepts Terraria introduced (e.g. player manipulated background tiles - no need to convert your stone blocks into ""stone walls"", just select your cobblestone and right click), as well as adding brand new things such as FTL travel to other planets. Getting bored of your starting planet? Drop some fuel into your ship and take off, you never know what you're going to find! Heck, the new planet may already have people and civilization there!All in all, I give this game ten Florans out of a wood table (positive marks).			"

Early Access Review
								       Chuklefish isn't putting much time and effort into Starbound, and neither should you. But why develop content for a game that you've already sold? You cant sell it twice. I feel that they are leaving too much to the modding community, and not focused enough on delivering a solid, stand alone Game. Maybe they dont' want to release any patches that hamper the modders freedom to customize the game the way they like it, but who knows.       My only major gripe is that the game being incomplete makes me feel that at any time all my works will simply vanish; the way my ship locker did. I have no desire to build at the moment, because they will wipe the worlds again when they finalize the universe map.When progression is changed to center around various hazards that will be found on the planets, it will probably be safe to build again. I cant' complain about the lack of content too much since the game simply isn't finished yet, but they really havn't made much progress towards their ideal, randomly generated game structure; as the current quest line ends after the first boss. Progression after the fourth boss is so fast, I'd really have prefered they left out the remaining levels.       The game is VERY FUN and addicting, right up until you hit the ""Impervium Wall."" A damning blow that launched all my friends out of the game, and confined me to my ship. The game will need much more substance than what is currently available before I could recommend it as it is now. That all being said; dont' buy this game YET, but you'll definetly want to play it later on. Starbound will have far more, longer lasting appeal ONCE ITS READY for showtime. If you get it now, it might spoil the fun.    also... their other games are looking pretty decent too.			"

								Starbound is like Terarria++. More places to explore (planets and such) which have different biomes and pre-generated structures both above and underground. Also, there are plans for boarding spaceships, spaceship combat (both far off), different biome/planet hazards (it's mostly just temperature right now (say, snow planets and moons)), etc.See http://playstarbound.com/the-future-of-starbound/. It's much fun. And very moddable.			"

Early Access Review
								A sad shell of a game.I was excited for Starbound. My friends and I bought 2 4 packs and we gifted copies for everyone. We thought it was going to be the new Terraria. The new Minecraft. The new hotness. We were wrong. When we started playing, I was shocked at how little content was in the game. The planets had one or two monsters. The planets were tiny. Gameplay consisted of looting the shamelessly tiny planets and moving on. Planets were mostly just randomly generated blobs of terrain consisting of 1 or 2 monster types. You left click them. They die.There are bosses, however... You can encase them in dirt. It makes them powerless. This has been a ""feature"" of the game since launch.The pace of development has been painfully slow. There are updates that are released, but they consist of minor bugfixes and some tweaks. Very little content has been added since my original purchase. I've played Terraria. I've played Starbound. Terraria is a much better, more fun, content-filled game. Starbound feels like a game with no purpose. At the rate it's being developed, it feels like a game that will never have purpose.Would not recommend.			"

								This game was quite fun. I stopped playing with hopes that the early game build would be further imrpoved later on down the road.Now there have been 10 steps backward where there should only have been progress forward.Tools are unrepairable, rendering the game an absolute tedious mess early game (and it certainly wasn't simple before), dungeons are now set encounters that don't take advantage of the game mechanics that were so imaginitive before, limiting you to only being able to jump or use weapons. With no set goal of how to progress, I can't help but wonder why the devs thought making the game more time consuming somehow equated with game depth.Avoid this at all cost. Right now the game isn't worth 5 dollars, let alone the 16.99 they expect you to pay. I wish I could get my money back.			"

								Devs dropped off the planet for half a year, game has been in what they called the shortest phase of beta for almost a year now. I hate to see how long phase 2 and 3 will be. At this rate, the game may be ready for an actual release in 2017.Game is okay as it stands now, but is grossly incomplete and very monotonous.			"

								Starbound is a decent game, but if you have played Terraria the game just doesn't compare. The game has been released for quite some time, yet they have released very few updates. I doubt Starbound will be finished for 3-4 years, if at all. Great consept and design but lazy execution.			"

Early Access Review
								I played a lot of starbound when it was in its infancy, and I really did enjoy it. The best thing about it was that it was a sandbox exploration game with no plot - you  had no purpose, and damnit it was beautiful. You could make new characters and just cut do the basic intro and you could be outa the starting planet in a few minutes, ready to explore. Each planetary system could have planets of all dificulties and types, to explore at your leisure. It was a simpler time...It was a better time......And then  The fire nation attacked  Starbound updated. With every new character requiring you to dig to the center of the planet before you may leave, starting new games is tedious. On top of that, you can not go to harder planets untill you complete a series on bossfights and quests, which you must complete in order to progress father into the system as well as upgrade your spaceship. These are mandatory, and they are always the same for every character. so there after you complete them once it is no longer a new and random experience, and is now a tedious time sucking part of the game that you must do for every new character.Do not get me wrong the game is good, it has many new items and enemies and yes once you do all the quests you have freedom, but now the systems are labeled, you know what kinds of planets to expect, no more just spending 200 fuel in the name of science. If there was an option to be able to skip the whole questline with starting characters (perhaps after beating it 100%) then I could recomend the game, but as it stands now, you might be tempted to play an earlier version.

												S/O To my friend Nick for buying this for me, minor spoilers ahead.Long read ahead, so here's hoping you stick with me on this.I played Terarria once, did not get any enjoyment out of it. 2D games aren't really my go-to when I look for something to kill time or play with friends, so naturally my first instinct when getting it was, ""Oh, great, this sucks. Another generic building game in 2D.""I've never been so wrong in my life.There is a story to this game, the original lore being cut out after an update some time ago. There are several races, Floran, a species of primitive plant people, Hylotl, the fish-esque peoples, Glitch, medieval robots, Apex, smart moon gorillas, Novakid, glowing gas cowboys, Avians, the religious fanatics, and the master race, Humans. Each race get's their own unique ship when starting and must repair it. As time goes on, you will be able to upgrade your ship as you attain crew members through quests or colonies (which will be mentioned later).  The main storyline is a ton of repeat, which really was boring, but the boss fights were very interesting.Much like other survival games, you need to gather blocks and resources to build houses or bases, or if you're like me, find settlements on planets and steal their items. I never was personally able to start from scratch, as for me, my friends who had some nice gear had chose to help me out with gear and weapons and whatnot right from the get-go. There are two kinds of armor in the game, cosmetic and stat armor. Cosmetics are just like they sound, good for looks, not so much for stats. Stat armor can be found from vendors on planets or made at a forge that you can either create or..steal. Weapons range from sniper rifles, assault rifles, Semi-automatic and full-automatic pistols, swords, axes, and ballbusting hammers.Once you progress in the story a little, you will find the main hub, be sure to mark the teleporter once you get there, otherwise you'll be looking for the way back again. Here you can find ore vendors, a general store, personal mounts, and other things that you will need come later in the game.As I said, colonies are a thing. My two-cents are as follows; My friend, the very same person who bought me the game, said he started a colony. Now I had plenty of decorations and stuff from an Apex place and decided I wanted to become a scientist. So I teleported to my friend and began building. He gave me a colonial deed and told me to place it down. Since then I've been obsessed with making places for people to live in this game.To start a colony is pretty simple, find a planet where it's said that there is no life, and begin building. Get a colonial deed from the outpost, and have fun.By the time of completing this review I finished the main story and have started another colony with my other friend. I'm still having fun with it. You can easily put plenty of time into this game.Final rating? 9/10. Story wasn't really that compelling and side quests get just as repetitive, but I could follow. Fantastic with friends.			"

												So its finally out after three years of early access, is it good now? Nooooooooooope.The hotbar has been replaced with a consolized abomination, instead of the old terraria-style hotbar you now have six options with a right and left hand slot with all your matter manipulator tools smack dab in the middle. It is extremely unintuitive and I have no idea what went through chucklefish's head when they redesigned it.Early game is still an annoying slog. The game sells itself as an ""extraterrestrial sandbox game"" but for the first few hours its just a ""sandbox game"". You need 20 mcguffins to activate a portal that takes you to the game's hub world, and you either need to be lucky enough to find a mine that has said mcguffins, or spend a few hours gearing up and digging to the core of your starting planet to find them.Temperature was never brought back. On a freezing planet and need to warm up? No amount of campfires or clothing will save you. You will freeze to death unless you craft the magic heating backpack. Same goes for radioactive planets and extremely hot planets. Your only survivabilty is from a backpack and none of the hundreds of items you used to be able to use.The story is absolutey atrocious. Its almost like it was an afterthought, what with the poor writing and cliche plot. Earth is destroyed by a giant tentacle monster, collect X amount of artifacts from all the races and kill the tentacle monster. Entirely uninspired and could have been left out entirely with no negative impact.The hunger system seems to have never been fixed either. Survival is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and is no fun at all, the hunger bar depletes from full in about 20 to 25 minutes, making you halt whatever you're doing to either find food or eat a buttload of whatever you have on hand. Uncooked food barely increases the bar while cooked food increases it more, making it even worse to manage.And I'm not even going to talk about the missed release dates and lies spewed forth by Tiy/Molly in the past, its just not worth it anymore.Honestly if chucklefish didn't mismanage their company as much as they did and faff about with the whole ""moving to london"" process (which took far longer than it should have), this game could have seen an earlier release, and hell, it would probably be better than this sorry excuse of a game.

Early Access Review
								Note: to see this review the way it was meant to be veiw (pictures, formating and such) go to:http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/05/game-starbound.htmlStarbound is the uber popular 2D sandbox game that takes pages from Minecraft and Terraria. Created by British indie studio Chuckle Fish Ltd, Starbound is more a spiritual successor to Terraria than a clone. Starbound is also very successful with over 1 million copies sold compared to Terraria's 2 Million. Starbound is still in early access and as such some of the things discussed in this review might change.Players start on a random planet in the alpha galaxy, they have to build a base, find ores and build a distress beacon which will trigger your first Boss battle. Starbound combat is more RPG like than Terraria's. playing the game was a lot like some of the popular Japanese RPG, where Terraria's combat was all about crazy weapons Starbound is more about exploring and combat feels more slow-paced. but that's not really bad. it's just different.Starbound has a some story unlike Terraria or Minecraft. each race is different and exciting to learn about. The Humans, forced to flee their planet after a monster invasion. The Glitch a robotic race that is stuck in medieval times. the Avian a bird-like race that fight for their god. the Floran, a violent race of plant creatures who are hated by most of the galaxy. the Apex, an Ape like race that is Superior in mind. and the Hylotl a pacifist fish race.Starbound seems to have looked at Terraira and try to do what it did but better. and in some areas it is. for example in starbound to place a wall all you have to do is right click. and the cool thing about Starbound is that with some many planets out there its hard to see them all. however Starbound's planets can start to get boring after awhile. the only types of planets are Deserts,Forest,Jungle,Moon,snow, and lava. i wish there where more water like worlds. the kind that always rain and stuff. also when on Moons the gravity doesn't seem to change that much. one cool thing in Starbound is the fact that some planets get asteroids that rain down on the surface. the not so cool thing is that these will destroy a good part of any surface buildings you may have built. in Starbound you can place NPC spawners, with this you can spawn guards, merchants and just some friendly NPCs to stay in your base. the NPCs will sit down on chairs, sleep in beds, and chat with each other. it helps to make your world feel alive.Starbound like Terraria has a lot of furniture and objects you can place to make your house/base look any way you want. and with a unlimited galaxy you have millions of maps to mess around with. also your maps stay with you no matter who you play as. so if you build a base with one person then go make a new character and come back to the same planet the base will be there. the same thing applies for mulitplayer.Speaking of mulitplayer, Starbound does have multiplayer but because it is in such an early state getting into games can be hard to do. but if you can connect to games the mulitplayer works fine. and allows you to have chaos with your friends.Like Terraria, Starbound has bosses that can be summoned for you to fight. right now there are only four bosses in the game, but more are on the way. so far i have to say that the bosses are pretty bland. a giant UFO, a Robot, a jelly fish, and a dragon made out of bones. there is a fifth boss in development that looks unique but right now the bosses kinda of suck.If you enjoyed Terraria or Minecraft then Starbound is a good choice for you. the only thing else i dislike about it is the fact that it sells for $15 during its Early Access while Terraria a fully completed game that is STILL getting new stuff sells for $10.  to be clear Starbound is in NO WAY a ""clone"" or a ""copy"" of Terraria, it is a game that was inspired by Terraria but it is its own game			"

								Didn't get far into the game before it was broken.I was supposed to go to the planet and get fuel, wood, and other supplies before being able to travel to new planets. The first thing I did was travel to a new planet. After realizing I shouldn't break sequences in the game even if I could, I started over. I collected a bit of wood, and tried to accept the main quest reward. It wouldn't let me, but I did delete and give up on the main quest, so now I'm no longer able to progress the story. Nice.... So I tried one last time, went down, got some wood, next thing I know some insane alien starts attacking me. My weapons can't do any visible damage, and every time I died, the alien was waiting for me at the spawn point. The game was then impossible to progress.This game was cool in concept when it was announced. I was excited for it! But they gave into public demand and released the game before its time. Now, the game is broken, incomplete, and rarely recieves updates. But why should the developers care, right? They already have our money. They're happy, and to them, that's what matters. I wouldn't buy this game if I hadn't already. It is not worth ""supporting"" the developers when they aren't supporting the game as much as they should be.			"

(I want to mention before review that I had a lot more hours of gameplay because I used to run SB outside Steam)Oh boy. It's 2016. This game is finally out. I don't even know how to begin, but I will give it a try since I am terrible at writing reviews. Get yourself some coffee, food and all necessary supplies for survival because this review is gonna be long. Ready kids? Let's begin!Starbound is one of the games I was interested in because of two things: sci-fi and space travel. I really enjoyed playing earlier builds and it had decent content despite game being in Early Access, but there were serious technical issues (especially if you play multiplayer). Because of that, I'm gonna list all pros and cons this game has:ProsArtworkI will try to split this into details: Planets are beautiful! From hot dry deserts to depths of the oceans, there's lots to be seen during exploration. This encouraged me to explore more. Race design is also well made, especially Floran and Hylotl. Ship design is well made too! If you want to have a giant castle floating in space, you're gonna like Glitch!SoundtrackThe first thing I like to notice when I'm starting a game is soundtrack! Starbound has one of THE best ambient soundtracks I ever heard. Even to this day, Starbound soundtrack is still on my playlist. If you ever want to relax yourself with good ambient music, you're gonna like it!Multiplayer and co-opYou know how they say, games are always fun to play with someone. This game enables multiplayer and co-op which allows you to explore worlds together. However, there are lots of issues with multiplayer (these will be listed in Cons).ModsI can't even describe how easy is to mod this game. With right tools, you can easily recolor weapon and change particles using JSON format. If you want to do more advanced modding (like adding new race, vehicles and worlds), LUA is here to make your life easier. Thanks to huge playerbase, there are lots of mods to be found in Steam Workshop.SandboxIf you want to be creative and build villages or skyscrapers, you're gonna enjoy huge set of different blocks that allows you to use during building. If you're a builder, this thing is definitely for you (because I am a terrible builder, qq).ConsPerformanceThis game has some serious issues with performance. I tested this game on my dual-core setup  and it causes freezing during gameplay. This game also has problems with memory allocation which forces you to restart Starbound few times in order to free up RAM memory. Rendering is poorly optimized and makes GPU so hot that you can cook eggs on it. If you need a game where PC asks you to end it's suffering, this game is for you!Scrapped contentDuring Early Access, there were lots of items and armor sets. Unfortunately, most of them are scrapped.Multiplayer issuesWell, here we go. This is the main reason why I set this review to ""Not Recommended"". Multiplayer is decent in co-op, but if you're going to join servers where there are 30-40 people online, you're going to have some ""fun"" with issues. Here's the list of problems: Dedicated server. It is poorly optimized and it crashes often due to huge usage of RAM and CPU. Exploits. Server allows client to execute LUA code without any kind of authentication which opens doors to vunerabilities and exploits that crashes the server instantly. Lots of players who joined multiplayer servers got their characters corrupted and unrecoverable due to huge abuse of LUA. ""Allow Asset Mismatch"". This is probably the stupidest option ever added to the game. If you're going to join your friend or your server with mods your friend doesn't have, there's huge possibility that you can crash the server or your friend. If you want to play multiplayer or co-op, I suggest you to disable mods during gameplay.You're still alive? That was my list of my thoughts about the game. I really want Chucklefish to work on optimization and fixing technical issues because this game is a game I would gladly enjoy while playing multiplayer. If Chucklefish fixes critical issues, I will be happy to to review it again. Until then, I will not recommend it. Sorry Chucklefish.P.S. Sorry if I made some grammar mistakes. My English is still potato.			"

								Has quickly become one of my go-to games to just pick up and spend all day exploring in. Like other people have been saying, it's like Terraria but in space, with a larger story line (that isn't fully implemented yet as it's still early release), greater variety of environments and of course, space and your spaceship. The developers are constantly adding new content and ever expanding the starbound universe as well as being extremely active in the community. You get to visit new planets, explore them, upgrade and create new equipment/gear, and mine though planets, and coming across civilizations (both hostile and friendly). The exploration aspect is the most fun (in my opinion), just spending hours mining and discovering settlements, new creatures, finding new decorations and gear, exploring asteroids and moons, all while enjoying one of the best soundtracks I've heard for a game. There's also a very large mod community supporting the game, that the developers are quite active in taking part in or implementing those mods officially into the game.This game has had a couple character wipes/resets so far, and it's so enjoyable, I ain't even mad. I just shrug, and get excited that I get to start a new character with new planets and new things to explore/discover all over again. I really can't recommend this game enough, it's absolutely fantastic and even more fun playing with friends. A great game that I absolutely can't wait to see the finished product of.			"

People like this are the cancer of steam early access, eroding away peoples trust in the program. SO many broken promises and SO much hate directed at the customers from the team. I don't need to link evidence as this review section is covered in it, and it is disgusting.Do not buy this game. I would go so far as to say do not buy this game even when/if it is completed in the year 20XX. Use the only vote that matters and don't support this kind of behavior with your wallet, if I had known it would end up this way I most certainly would have steered clear.			"

								Starbound actually is a great concept, lots of fun to go through and provides hours of entertainment, unfortunately this game will never be finished due to the developers recieving and spending all their profits on this game pre release. Unlike Minecraft where the game continued development clearly the creators have just given up. The product isn't stable (which in all fairness is explained) but sadly the product will never be stable. if you want a fun incomplete game go for this, but only if you can endure increasing errors, wipes and unfinished material present, multiplayer is fun but nothing like is promised!

								The game had some good ideas, but in general there is nothing to do. You travel from planet to planet and just mine for resources so that you can complete the one quest that will let you travel to a new tier of planets (and thus unlock some new craftable gear). This makes the game very repetative and boring in the long run. Its good fun for about 3 hours after that its just more of the same.			"

								This game is without a doubt one of the best games I have played this year - and it isn't even complete yet! The pixel art style is refreshing (none of this 8-bit nonsense) and the gameplay is marvelous. So much to explore and discover, got bored of a world? No problem, just hop in your spaceship and fly to another!As I would say with any Early Access game, be prepared for bugs, crashes and glitches! Do not throw your money at something that isn't complete yet, unless you are absolutely sure on it. - However, Starbound is surprisingly bug-free! Of course, it has some, but it is a highly playable Early Access game, compared to a lot of other ones.+ Great visuals.+ Astounding amount of content.+ Amazing customisation.+ Everything you would expect from a sandbox!- Still in beta, so will contain bugs and glitches (and even the occasional crash).Will update this review on the full release. :)			"

												This game showed so much potential back two or more years ago. The game didn't take a super-computer to run (much, anyways,) and the game was very fun and easy to play. Eventaully, things began to evolve, and as they should, but this game, as of 1.0, is NOTHING like the game I played two years ago. The game I played two years ago felt infinitately more fun and polished than.....this. The UI is awful, the performance potato, and the game itself....just feels more empty and hollow than it did. I'm glad that they've implemented an offical workshop for mods, but I feel like all of the changes they've made over the years have slowly dulled and uninspired the game for me. I do not reccomend. Unless you're a time traveler and can go back a few years ago, when the game was better.			"

								Starbound supplies the player with an awesome gaming experience that is very rare in games, especially in platformers. Starbound is very similar to the game Terraria; although many of the mechanics are similar, one thing that Starbound offers that Terraria does not would include, dynamic environments scaling accross a variety of different planets, hazardous environmental effects, randomized enemies, and many diffferent races to choose from. If you are looking for an advanced platformer gaming experience, I would highly recommend this game to every player.			"

								I have about 20 hours into Starbound and from what I've played it is okay.  I feel like the weapons are all cookie cutter, nothing really seems unique. There doesn't seem to be any events that take place that might test your home location defenses. The lack of healing over time bugs me. I spend more time in a bed/tent then actually exploring/mining. As the game stands right now in Beta I would not recommend it, your money would be better spent on Terraria with it's much wider range of content/weapons/building/events etc.			"

								(This review was written a long time ago, there has been a HUGE content update since then.)Since Christian wrote KIND OF a one sided review I'm going to tell you all you need to know about this game before you buy it.(it sure seems for everyone of these pros I need to put an asterisk by it.)First the Pros.For a game that's not nearly finished there is sure a lot of content and a lot to do.The artstyle is great and colorful for the most part, everything's distinct, you're not gonna get confused or overwhelmed.The space travel has potential and early on you'll be having fun with it.The music is wonderful, it's like if Halo and TES: Oblivion's composers got together on this because some of the music sure reminds me of those games.If you want difficulty, you're sure going to be dying a bunch early on in this game because there's a lot of things to contribute towards death; hunger, heat, creatures and whatnot.-The difficulty isn't forced and if you die you felt like it's your fault.Now for the cons.While early on you'll be having a blast, it soon gets repetitive once you've played enough, every planet feels the same and it bores you. I really do savor the moments when I find something interesting, like a military prison that has been overrun by its prisoners or a temple full of angry florans.But finding these things takes chance and by 15 hrs in the game you're on the wiki looking for cool places to visit.The music feels off. The game is very sci-fi-esque and they've got the music set to a fantasy world.It can fit in the right planets but most of the time it feels like you're playing death metal while frolicking in the flowers.Tediousness. The game feels like you're just grinding way too much.Scouring the land in search of coal JUST to fuel your ship just feels like busy-workHaving to create a beacon for a boss fight JUST to die and have to create it AGAIN.It's infuriating and certaintly takes away from the experience.It's unfinished. Now mind you I know this is early access but this review is for someone who is wanting to PURCHASE the game.No It's not riddled with bugs.Yes if you play it enough it gets dull.I've heard they are adding new things like space combat.But if you are wanting a FULL game stacked to the top with content then, you may or may not want to hold your cash.So that's my review, it's a good game, not the greatest albeit I did enjoy this game a lot more than Terraria.I'm really hopeful in the future of this game.

								Starbound, Star.... Tar... Terrar... Terraria, ya no. If you want a ♥♥♥♥ing fun game for a cheaper price, without the weird looking Sprites, just buy Terraria. It's cheaper, and it's much more fun. I know it's still incomplete, but really, I feel like all it is, is a reboot of Terraria, except set in spaceeeee. Not a really good transition, the worlds at first seem diverse, and the monsters seem special, but after a few hours into the game, you realize that each monster is just different colors and sounds. The tiers seem random and too easy to complete, and there really is a crappy assortment of weapons, of course, if your into buying a more expensive game with less items, and generally really boring combat, go ahead and buy it.

Early Access Review
								Starbound is my first 2D-style indie game I have ever played before, so I write this from my perspective, as a person who is new to Terraria-style games; and who is much more experienced with 3D indie games like Starmade, Blockland and Minecraft. I've been playing indie games for many years now and I have begun to get rather bored with nearly everything I play. So, I decided I would play this game hoping to be surprised with a new and unexpected style of gaming.-------------------------------------------------------A moderately fun game to play overall, but it tends to get boring after playing it for 3 days, with nothing really new or interesting to do. I mean, sure, it's all different environments everywhere you go, but fundamentally none of it is much different; you'll find pretty much the same stuff no matter where you go. The gameplay is quite repetitive, with your main goal mostly being to just keep your ship fueled so you can travel to new places, where you will spend yet again most of your time mining for more fuel. And once you level up to the top tier of technology, weapons and armor, there isn't much else that's new to do. There is a quest system but even though I played the game for over a week solidly, I could not seem to find any quests of any sorts to give it any use, other than the tutorial quests I started out with.It has a considerably steep learning curve. When I first picked it up and played it, I found its controls unintuitive and difficult to use, and the tutorial didn't help much either with figuring this out. If you are a person who is completely new to Starbound and know nothing about it when you start a new game, expect to die many many many times, until you figure out the way to play. Because of this, I highly recommend looking at player-made guides to the game, though those may contain gameplay spoilers.After you figure out the basics, you will mostly spend your time trying to advance through the different ""tiers"" of armor, techology and weapons. In search of resources to make better stuff for yourself, you will also stumble across underground ruins, creepy tombs, tribal villages, and even robot/monkey space facilities of sorts. It's also very fun to launch a big attack on a village and burn their buildings to the ground, if you're the sadistic type.Unfortunately, the resource requirements for items is absurd. To get better weapons and armor and technology, you have to spend many tireless and rather boring hours of clicking and popping your way through layers of blocks to find large amounts of resources for a small piece of body armor or that next gun or sword. And if you get injured while off exploring, you better hope you get lucky enough to find some sort of vine or cactus vegetation in a cave and collect several of them to make a tiny bandage that heals only a small percentage of your health.As for gameplay difficulty, it's very very difficult to survive when you first play, and the difficulty options don't offer much choices that would go easy on newbies. You have difficulty option choices like that in SCP Containment Breach: Temporary death or Permanent death. There is no ""peaceful"" or ""normal"" or ""hard"" option like in Minecraft. Oh, and you can expect to be constantly falling into pools of deadly poison when stumbling around in dark caves, or getting attacked, with no real way of your body regenerating health on its own. So, have fun with that.As for aesthetics, it is a rather appealing game and carries its atmosphere of 2D alien planets fairly well, with cute cartoonish textures that reminded me of some nostalgic Cartoon Network flash games I used to play when I was a little kid. The graphics look fairly nice I guess for this genre, but I haven't played any other Terraria-style games so I don't have anything I can fairly compare it to. One feature I especially like is the way the liquids work. Unlike Minecraft and other games where liquid sources are either just solid blocks or flowing things that don't really spread out evenly but act like an illogical geyser, the liquid physics in Starbound act like you'd expect liquids would in a 2D game. If a pond springs a leak into a cave, you can expect that cave to be filled with all the pond's water quite soon and no water left in the pond. If a pocket of lava is mined into, there's a big danger it could fall right over you and kill you!There is very little actual space-oriented gameplay. You can't change your ships appearance except for adding furniture on the inside, you cant pilot your ship yourself (everything is done with an onboard autopilot; you just choose a destination), and you cant have space battles. This is a significant blow to the ""Star"" in StarBound.Feature wise, there are many different things you can do, though in the current state of the game there are some things which one could obviously wish they could change upon.Features:- Build a base/house/evil lair of doom on planets, asteroids and whatnot.- Fight cool and seemingly procedurally-generated monsters- Explore endless open planets with different environments and even multiple different biomes on each of them- Pillage and conquer villages, homes and secret bases built by monkeys, anthropomorphic birds, talking flower creatures, aliens, and even robots.- Craft and arm yourself with a plethora of different defenses and offenses- Collect resources for your base by mining for more resources, all the while digging towards the planet's core.- Research technology to let yourself have special moves and powers to help with combat, climbing and digging.- Play online with friends and have even more fun building things together, or just messing around and pillaging other players for funAs for pros and cons...Pros: - Game is very stable, quite impressive for an early-access game. Very few crashes.- Lots of different features, as mentioned in above list.- Decent graphics- Online gameplayCons:- Very little actual space-oriented gameplay.- Unfitting soundtrack of symphony-piano style music.- Extremely sharp and difficult learning curve.- Gameplay gets boring after several days- Not much to do once you get to the top tier aside build more and shoot stuff.- No story/campaign modeOverall, the game is like that one gift you get from an estranged distant relative, which you find appealing to look at and hold for several days, and then never touch it again. It's fun and sparkly to play for a little while, but it gets boring fast if you're a serious and dedicated gamer. I can honestly say the experience I had with it was interesting but I wouldn't want to play this game again until it gets a massive future update that fundamentally changes the way it's played. I guess 2D games just aren't for me.			"

												On paper this seems fun, but most of it is just bland saminess that it gets boring before you even leave the first planet (which takes far too long to be honest, especially if you die with the plot cupons--which you can use up if you're not careful). I'm not going to say it's Terrania in space, because I've never played the game, and I know I might not have played it a long time, but the reason I can't recommend it will make that clear. It's about as intuitive as a brick is to breadmaking. Yeah, you can probably do it, but you might smash your fingers a few times and break some dishes doing it. The game has a very sparse tutorial that doeesn't really teach you what you need to know to do any of the basics. It might not take you a while, but it is annoying. You don't have many equipment slots so mining, harvest, crafting, and building are all beta-worthy slogs that take a long time, and a lot of fiddling in the inventory, which doesn't pause the game. Seeing as several of your inventory slots go toward weapons or a light source that means building anything involves opening the inventory, which blocks a lot of things. It's a constant click juggle. It really made me appreciate Minecraft's system Also the game has (and going by the forums never will have) no real way of setting the display to higher resolutions. So it forces you to use low res (which makes the game look worse than something from the 80s) or you play windowed, which sets the resolution at still kinda bad. It might be worth tolerating if the experience wasn't just so bland, boring, and hemogenized.Update: After playing a lot more (most of it offline) because Steam refused my refund. I have to say my original review was spot on. This is a bland, frustrating mess and it's not worth the asking price. I'd also like to add the lack of any kind of helpful encyclopedia. You're going to go to the Wiki for this one a lot.			"

												After playing starbound for a while before 1.0, I ended up leaving starbound, waiting for the inevitable 1.0 which was always 'coming soon!'. As time went on I became increasingly skeptical of both when 1.0 would come and how much of a difference it would make. Well I can safely say  1.0 ended up being a significant game changer. There is a complete story, crafting is far less strenuous, farming is more viable,  the game in general is bigger than I ever remember it being... on top of all that they added steam saves, steam integrated multiplayer and achievements! now is a great time to get back into/buy starbound. Better than its ever been.pros:(starbound 1.0 specific)*multiplayer is streamlined(Starbound 1.0 specific)*steam cloud saves(Starbound 1.0 specific)*Items automatically crafted, now with a button to stop the auto crafting*fully featured story and cutscene*easily hundreds of hours of content*tons of items*excellent infinite sandbox*fun unique bosses*interesting locations*dungeonsCons:*some technical glitches and performance issues still present*story is pretty cliche(intentional?)*new objective system makes the journal less useful than it was beforeAlso on a side note:NOVAKID FTWEdit: some things to point out that didnt particularly bother me, but might bother others:*Saves from prior to 1.0 are deleted for compatibility reasons*cant teleport from  underground, making digging back up to surface a bit more strenuous			"

								Starbound brings to life what games such as Minecraft and Terraria couldn't. The world presents itself as a magnanimous, peaceful haven with birds chirping and the wind blowing. Your character has the freedom to dig deep, deep down into the planet you've landed on, or search in either direction for goodies in caves and randomly-generated establishments. While the option for customization in terms of aesthetics isn't mind-bogglingly large, the game offers a wide array of materials, colors, and clothing options to choose from. Maybe not on the level that Minecraft has been famous for, but it's enough to complement the game's beautifully serene and awe-inspiring landscapes. However, at nighttime, creatures of all kinds stalk the surface (and underbelly) of each planet. The game, too, gives you a selection of weapons to choose from, each with their own statistics and features.There is enough here to purchase the game: from the jaw-dropping mountains, caverns, lakes, and forests, to (personally) one of the most relaxing and beautiful soundtracks to a game I've ever heard. I have literally felt my shoulders ease up tension and relax from listening to the title screen song.Nevertheless, the game is still in development. Yes, you will come across useless items with no current purpose. Yes, you may encounter a character wipe as a result of a patch. And yes, you will grow tired of the redundant mining, chopping, and crafting necessary to get the momentum going in this game. But in the end, it is all worth it, because when your character lay there in the bed you've crafted under the warm glow of a finely perched torch in the dark of the night, your home will seem more than just pixels on a computer screen: you will feel a sense of impending happiness and accomplishment in your tangible self for having created something so unique from the recesses of your mind. You will feel part of a planet, of a solar system. This game could be argued as a metaphor for the insignificant-yet-significant impact humanity can and has made on this planet, and, heck, maybe the next one over. Explorers, get this game. Thinkers and creators, pick it up ASAP. Adventurers, don some armor.Starbound is not a revolutionary idea in any sense in terms of gaming, but it is a fresh start to the void of game development games have seldom crossed: limitlessness.It is unlike any Minecraft or Terraria knockoff you will find on the gaming market.

								I used to be so excited for Starbounds release date, I used to love the games first release and think how much better it was then Terraria, I used to be the guy saying Starbound is the new Terraria ""get over it"". Point and case [used to].So what happened? Why am I not recommending this game anymore? Well lets look at it now. Its been 6 months since the last major update and all the dev team is doing is talking about new games coming out like Original Sin and how Ty doesnt like when people talk bad about the game. In that time Terraria has managed to slowly update itself and yet come out better and more enjoyable then Starbound was when it first came out and still is now.Now I get the games still in beta but thats my point. Ty stated all money was going to the game... Yet they are sitting on 4 mill and used 1 mill to buy a huge office... Now Id approve of this if it was to benefit the games development... but its making it worse.Honestly until the developers of Starbound get their act together this review of a once beloved game is getting its butt thrown onto the curb.

								Terraria in space!!!! Starbound begins with you fleeing your homeworld in a space shuttle, just as it's destroyed by an unknown enemy. With nothing to guide it, the escape pod shoots into space without direction, becoming hopelessly lost in a sea of stars. As luck would have it, the space shuttle makes contact with an abandoned space station and an adventure begins that will take you hurtling across the universe. Starbound contains both quests and story driven missions, buried inside its vast sandbox universe.The space station in Starbound is sprawling and full of potential. Throughout your travels you'll find ways to upgrade and repair it, restoring it to its former glory. You'll need to find a crew, conduct research, catch rare creatures, and unlock its multitude of facilities. From a factory capable of producing mechs to labs where captured enemies can be studied and trained, the space station contains everything you need to explore the universe.  "

												All the hype around this game and my general interest in a space exploration game in which the player can do as they please on top of the fact that it was recently fully released finally compelled me to play Starbound. And guess what? It's♥♥♥♥♥♥You're able to farm, build, fight, explore or sell things in this game. I couldn't stand playing it for long enough to try farming but from what I've seen it looks pretty dull.The building mechanics are actually decent as there's a good amount of options that allow for the player to really make whatever planet side structures they want. Sure, it would have been nice to be able to build things in space but it's too much of an issue. From what I've played fighting is a fairly mixed bag. The diversity in the weapons and the special abilities they each have is pretty cool and it was always quite exciting to finally find a new weapon to use. Problem is, the actual combat is... lacking. It's a desperate flurry of spamming left click in the hopes that your weapon will make contact with the rejected pokemon charging towards you. It's so imprecise that it just becomes a chore.Exploration is god awful and by far the most disappointing aspect of the game. Each planet is just a reskin of the last and there is quite literally nothing to do except trade, fight and get loot (and build, of course.) After adventuring around a couple of planets with my mate I was beginning to suspect that there really wasn't much to this game at all.Which just leaves you with selling. To be honest, I don't think I need to go to in depth with this one: You drag and item into a UI panel and press a button.So what else really is there? Well, mining of course!At the start of the game you get chucked onto a boring Earth-like planet and have to find 20 ""core fragments"" in order to get into the space part of the game. There is only one tiny little problem:Hunting for the core fragments is the most soul crushingly dull experience I've ever dragged myself through.It really comes down to running through a bunch of empty caverns in the hope that you can get deep enough into the planet to find a cluster of orange flowing tic-tacs in the ground. ♥♥♥♥ing riveting stuff. Add to that that you'll be dying from huge drops into empty caverns and hoards of the rejected pokemon chasing after you and you've got one hell of an irritating start to a game.For one the ""100 best games ever made"" you must be thinking that this game has some kind of saving grace. Well, there is one more thing... the story.And my god is it dreadful.Imagine the most generic science fantasy story line just being straight up told directly to the player instead of letting them slowly uncover the game's mysteries for them self. And that's the story. It's just some vague way of stringing together the quests you get given in the game.So surely, surely there has to be something here to enjoy, right? Right?Yes! There is! The art direction, graphics and animation quality are excellent. It is a really beautiful game. The soundtrack is also quite decent. So if all you want is a pretty slide show with cool music, then go for it!But if you're looking for a game with real substance and content, stay away. At best, it's just an average Terraria-esque game with space bits tacked on. At worst, it's slow, repetitive and just really empty. ""In Starbound, you create your own story - there’s no wrong way to play!""Yeah... not quite.Final verdict:45/100			"

								STARBOUND EARLY IMPRESSIONSI played it for about an hour, finished what I think is the first half of the tutorial. Of all the games in this genre so far, I'll just save time and call it mine craft likes, this one feels the most open.What I mean by that is. If you play mine craft, you know it's infinite, huge infinite world with infinite land mass. But honestly? in mine craft the world is only as large as how far you're willing to venture away from your home base.In starbound your home base is a ship flying in orbit around whatever planet you're around. I don't know how infinite each world is, I only played for an hour, but there are an infinite number of worlds. And each world achieves much of what different biomes achieve in mine craft: new enemies, new environment, new things to pick up and build with.There's obvious comparisons to terraria to be made, so I'll make them: Terraria felt like an RPG. A sorta castle vania mine craft like. Starbound feels like middle ground between that and mine crafts ""build and explore"" type game.The combat feels better in starbound than in terraria. I still hold a soft spot for terraria combat because of how well it scaled and how crazy it could get in terraria end game, so I wont make any more of a comparison between the two games combat other than ""starbound feels better, especially early.""As far as the tools and the building and the stuff this genre is best known for? Well I only played an hour so all I did so far was make a crafting bench, build a fire and cook some meat over it, then build a furnace and start digging down for iron to smelt.And honestly? So far? God I haven't had this much fun since the first time I played minecraft and realized I could do anything.			"

Some biomes being impossible to live on with acid rain and lakes of lava and some easy going. You can also make them safe by making a survival system providing oxygen. Also this game supports mods with its own mod folder just put them in and when you want to unistall just take them out.

This isn't even the full game, and it's blown my expectations out of the water. I really recommend this game, just for the fact that the exploration is amazing. Also, there is Lore in this game! There's lore about all of the races, and all of the races are rather interesting, none the less. And about the races, there's a new race coming in Beta 3, which I am extremely excited for.

												Grindhouse. Housegrind?Had this game for three years now, since it first came out on EA. Spent a bit less than 30 hours on this current build. Honestly can't say I'll be back.If you're the type of person who likes building things, namely colonies, you'll probably love this game. I like building, but it's not something I'll sit around and do forever. And honestly, outside of building, the quality of my moment-to-moment experiences go downhill very quickly.The most difficult monsters are the ones that just run or fly at you and try to occupy the same pixel as you; this ends up with the most boring monsters being the most difficult and the more interesting monsters being fairly rare and inconsequential.While the EPP (enviro protection pack) is an interesting idea on paper, in-game it negates any and all side-affects of the planet you go on, with VERY few exceptions. Either you freeze to death with absolutely no recourse to survive, or you have the right EPP and the planet mechanically plays exactly the same as every single other planet. It feels like an unfortunate black/white decision that actually tended to make the very earliest planets far more difficult and equally as interesting as the very 'hardest' planets.After all is said and built, there's really nothing to keep me in this game: mechanics aren't quite deep enough, planets play too similarly, time spent mining is quite and empty. In my 30 hours back with the game, I built a sick underwater palace for my shark man... And I left. Too much empty space left me feeling like there's better, more mechanically interesting things to spend my time doing. Not a bad game. Just boring, really.			"

								Let me start by giving the folks at Chucklefish a huge round of applause for drawing me in to this game.  The trailers, videos and other media for this game all looked epic.  Here was a true adventure game!  Something to revigorate that awesome Terraria feel, but even better!  An amazing tale of discovery and rebuilding!And then you bought the game, started playing, and realized - it was all a facade.Starbound has one of the worst put-together progression systems I have ever seen in a game.  It goes like this - find materials, combine materials, fight boss, next stage.  Rinse and repeat for not 2 tiers, not 3, but 10 FRIGGIN TIMES.  And after the fourth teir, there aren't even any more bosses.  Dreadful.Mining is useless, since caves are incredibly rare and usually contain nothing of use.  And anyways, you can find everything - yes, everything - you need just by walking around on the surface.  So that's almost 70% of the world that is simply useless.  Dungeons are huge and...that's it.  They contain almost no loot, and present no challenge since almost every room is the same.  Just fighting my way through Terraria's single dungeon was more fun than all the dungeons I have gone through in this game put together.  Dreadful.And, quite possible Starbound's worst offense?  Let me give you the fast version.  In a game with an insane, morbid cult, a devastated human race, and a race of mutated apes who are under threat of extinction, there are ten times as many terrible jokes, fourth wall breaks, and other things that ruin your experience.DREAD-FUL.Simply - do not buy this game.  Go spend your 15 dollars on Terraria, or Minecraft, or any other sandbox you can think of.  Don't let Starbound's clever advertising get to you - this game is nothing it says it is.			"

												I've put in about as much effort for the final version of my review as chucklefish did for their final release. I just got lazy and couldn't be bothered to finish it. I'll say this: Fun game till you realise how poor the end game content is... You'll be downloading buggy mods and entertaining yourself rather than letting the Vanilla game do it for you.Repetitive content which doesn't seem that apparent till you realise it's like playing in just a couple of forests in the world of pokemon (Which you can catch but they get stuck everywhere and are pretty much useless) ... There aren't many different creatures in the world and that is a boring facet of gameplay due to the rest of the game being too easy and a repetitive let down. Overall it's a good experience to begin with but fairly lacking in longevity.Yes, I've got lots of hours into this game but a lot of it was sitting in menus, revisiting existing content or building a town which in the end got really boring due to the lack of furniture.There's also no survival aspect apart from hunger which is rendered irritating at best once you have a decent farm going on.There's not much to do with pixels at all apart from to buy 2 different vehicles with almost zero utility and furniture from the pixel printer. Uninspired story and average game.I had really high hopes for this game, but after travel through various planets I realised quickly that the random generator didn't have very many assets to generate with leading to a frequent feeling of dejavu... Often you'll swear you've been places before.. Even across the galaxy.It's okay for a while but gets boring and requires mods for any long term enjoyment. If there was a ""maybe"" button I'd just click that, but because promises from devs were not delivered I have to say I do not recommend.5/10 - 4 Years of development should have provided a better and more inspired experience.

The quest are stale and boring, getting loot is not interesting, and the ""vast universe"" is pointless because once you visit a planet once, you never go back. What annoys me the most is online though, anyone can look through your ship's storage and and greif your ship. There is really no incetive to help each other because the game is TOO EASY.I would recommend buying when ever its on sale though. This game will only get better with time but for now, its not fun.

								I've followed this game since the very first announcement of its development. Terraria had just announced it was halting updates, and Starbound popped up in the distance. Everyones hopes were so high and everyone was tossing money at chucklefish as soon as they could.With 150+ hours into the game, all spread across multiple versions of the game ranging from the very first publically playable version to the current game, and even into modded and nightly versions. As 2016 rolls around and the games end goal comes into view, its entirely clear that this game on the whole was a dissapointment, and I dont have a problem saying this with confidence anymore. I've given it and the dev team more than enough time to prove me wrong, and while the game has certainly improved as time went on, it pales in comparison to anything it competes with.I cant with a clear consious recommend this game. I'd highly suggest against it, actually. Very few aspects of this game function and feel better than anything other titles that inspired the game do. Games such as Terraria, Castlevania, Metroid, you name it all do their respective inspired functions better.Seriously, Instead of giving chucklefish money, you're better off putting your play time into Terraria. You'll have way more fun, I absolutely guarentee it.Edit: You want me to comment on the gameplay? Fine, heres some comments about what I find unpleasant about the gameplay: The combat is very uninteresting and predictable compared to its competitors IE Hammers do the most damage and are the most reliable melee weapons, guns are generally weaker and will take you longer to kill anything, dificulty ramp up is very real with dungeons which I'm more ok with than just rolling through content like was previously possible, but its just frustrating for every single individual npc encounter in dungeons to be life threatening. Movement in the game is very flat and uninteresting, you're generally able to jump over any obsicals and the movement tech you get is usually not needed and really dosent help as much as movement improvements in other games. The cold/heat system I believe is coming back, which is a plus, but the hunger system coming back only brings back a relatively annoying factor. Late game scaling is extremely frustrating, and raiding end game dungeons without mods to improve healing items is damn near impossible if you arent willing to spend 20 minutes in a bed after every single fight you take damage in, because for some reason health regen does not scale up with how much health you have based on your high tier armor, making every single healing source take many many more and much longer to heal you. I dont have time to sit and grind out every problem I have with this games actual mechanics, but with 150 hours I've more than experienced early into late game of every version since it was first available. They made it slower by making it not the best strategy to just grind out metals in deserts which is good, but then made it a painfully slow grind with the pickaxe change. I appreciate the tool being gived more usefulness, but it feels like they could have just changed the way pickaxes worked instead of make them generally useless.			"

												I'm not going to defend myself with disclaimers and such like so many Steam reviewers do.This is a negative review and I know it will inherently get downvoted because it doesn't fit with your personal belief that the game is good enough to recommend to others.I'll present to you some facts.Early AccessA joke in terms of real content.  Content you can enjoy and go back to, not 'do this and drop it five seconds later and never touch it again' content.Lesser ores are not used in higher tiers.No storyline.Mod system in place requires the majority of written files to overwrite existing ones making compatability a mess.Client-sided everything makes cheaters able to crash servers and cause havok.Picks, while flimsy, were useful in digging quickly.Novakid race taped on to meet with funder goals.All cutscenes are able to be skipped.Monster 'elites' spawn randomly.Moons are used solely for fuel and have nothing else.Lore is grim with every race having flaws and motivations.Intro cinematics with a voiceover from the voice of Bastion.1.0 releasedA joke in terms of real content.  Linear gameplay.  Building is the only thing that is content, and that's the end-game.  Collecting things isn't content, it's chore work.Lesser ores are used in higher tiers.Storyline present, has quality of that of a small child.  Consists of doing fetch quests five times and has bosses after each.  Ending is Disney level and doesn't conform to the player's difficulty level for reasoning on why it's a big deal.Mod system in place now has a patch system for editing JSON files and for altering LUA files you add on a custom LUA script with the JSON patch to run, and then use a hook idiom to alter the flow of the LUA files.  Heavy editing requires the replacement of the LUA file itself.Client-sided everything makes cheaters able to crash servers and cause havok.  Why did this not get fixed?Picks are far inferior to the matter manipulator, an indestructible block destroyer and liquid collector.  Note this is a good thing- item durability is stupid chore work for remaking things.  This is the type of item/content that should have been stripped.Novakid race taped on still with no lore integration or mention.Intro cutscene with floating wheelchair lady who is an Iris Apfel knockoff is not able to be skipped, and takes a centry to play out.There are no more random 'elite' monsters but instead shoved into the random quest system, stiffling unique encounters.Moons have a butt ghost that is not able to be killed and are stupid easy to avoid.  Moons still are the ""places to get fuel and nothing else"".Lore is happy go sunshine and Humans are the direct relatives of God and can do no wrong whatsoever.  Everyone loves rainbows and sprinkles.No intro cinematics.  Replaced with a StarTrek themed ""protectorate"" intro that apparently every race ever joined and we're a Tier 1 universe now.I could give more, but at this point I'm just demoralizing myself.All-in-all the 1.0 release has less content than the early access revision.I suspect it was shoveled out before No Man's Sky was released to get more sales.If Tiyuri's Reddit post on adding content post 1.0 will be ""mindblowing"" is correct, then in the near future this review might change.Until my mind is blown, I cannot recommend actually buying this over Terraria.Oh, here, have a nice video:

								If you liked Terraria, you're going to love Starbound. Hands down.If you however didn't like Terraria, I'm sure you'll like Starbound. I wasn't a huge fan of Terraria, because once you explored the world, you've seen it all. In Starbound however, not even the sky is the limit. You can travel to a ton of different planets and many different solar systems in like 5 different galaxies. The game has a few bugs as of right now, but it's Early Access, so it is to be expected.I recommend this game. It is currently a little bit cheaper on the Humble Store, however, because of the $/€ issue.			"

								I got drawn into the hype.  It really sounded like the perfect game.  But now its the end of 2014 and Starbound is still early access.  I can honestly say that at least the product is a game, but it isn't really fun.  It looks nice and every once in a while I start it up.  Then I'm reminded in 15 minutes why I don't play it.  I just don't know how a game with so much seeming variety can feel so empty.  Others have said that updates are very infrequent.  I don't know, but the game feels the same every time I fire it up.Anyway I don't care for the game and my opinion of Chucklefish has soured.  I say save your money for a publisher that finishes their games.			"

								What to say about Starbound?Well, it´s amazing. In many ways. You can do everything, nearly unlimited. Settle down on one Planet? No Problem. Grab all Stuff and just wander from one planet to millions of others? No Problem. Build up a high-tech fortress to defend you from all evil? No Problem. And many many more.In my opinion this is a game I always have been looking for. Easy to learn, difficult to master. But lots of fun because you live in a real sandbox universe. Build and explore? No, better build and/or explore. Or do some Quests. Or battle the evil. Or battle the good. Or just dig yourself a huge cavern. Or explore them. Sigh, so much to do and so less time. Pleasy be so good and buy it. Just hit the buy button, you can´t do anything wrong. Early Access? More to come? They should give out divorcement coupons ^^			"

Early Access Review
								Starbound Early Beta ReviewIt is early days for Starbound, there is a lot of content to be added. At the moment the game looks and sounds beautiful and creates an amazing atmosphere, this is where the game excels the best right now.Unfortunately everything else is rather shallow right now. I hope and expect for richer content but in the beta right now there is a tiny amount of content. There are a small amount of mob AIs, a land based simple mammal which will most likely do 1 of 2 similiar attack patterns or sometimes shoot a projectile. Flying mobs which will shoot projectiles and humanoid mobs with either a sword or gun. There are a few other rare mobs but mostly you will see the same things over and over.The combat is fun at first but again gets limited to using similiar melee/shields/guns though the melee is quiet varied. The planets are all extremely similiar, block layouts are the same and there is not much unique to different planets. Different levels have different ores but the ores are currently completely unbalanced. Of course this is beta and everything mentioned should be changed and expanded on. Even the next patch should solve a lot of the balance issues.The dungeons/temples/labs are cool and there are a lot of types but most of them seem to revolve around fighting the same mobs over and over in new rooms hoping to find useful stuff in the storage areas. There are occasionally jumping puzzles which can easily be done with blocks. Most loot from these areas and from chests on planets aren't that good except for the techs and legendary weapons which you really want to find on the highest danger level planets. This might change after the new update again, with everything else. The bosses need a lot of work and balance at the moment and are easily beaten by placing some blocks.Most of the time I spent on Starbound was either travelling around planets or mining underground which gets really repetitive and boring. Although there are countless planets to explore the things you need to do to progress through the game are set in stone and there is not much replayability right now.As expected from a beta there is a lot of work that needs to be done, this is far from a finished state, if you enjoy games like Terraria and this looks like fun you should get it, but don't rush as it is far from complete. If they can pull it off then Starbound will be an amazing game.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me change this up a bit now that there's been an update; 17/02/2015Let me tell you a little bit about Starbound. An indie 2-D early access title developed by Chucklefish studios. They couldn't find an engine that allowed them to do everything they wanted to do with this game, so they made their own. It is early access so there will be bugs, and there will be problems. I will address them in the review, but don't mark this game off your buylist just yet. I'll tell you why It's already worth the price. Almost everything is generated randomly. This is a wonderful feature.By random, I mean randomly assembled by randomly chosen parts. You seldom find anything that is ever the same. Monsters and creatures with random parts, sounds and attacks types; and certain attacks paired with certain parts. Trees are randomly assembled, but all drop the same kind of wood except for rarely occurring variants, but this isn't a weakness, honestly. Soil is randomly coloured and tinted, along with weather effects that are randomly selected from a set of interesting phenomena available to the planet, depending on its biome. Replayability is wonderful. Progression rarely gets as satisfying as it does here. It is always makes a notable change with the user's power level. Admittedly, you have about the same strength if you just go to the next tier solar system, but if you go back to easier ones, (Which I highly recommend) you should be able to handle the creatures with relative ease.Boss Battles have changed dramatically. There are only two implemented in the current version as far as I can tell, and they're both well fleshed out with suitable arenas and backstory as to why you're fighting them. The fights are needed for progression, and I'll come back to this when I discuss the mission system. Random NPC villages and structures spawn on your worlds, and this makes for fun dungeoneering with or without friends. A new feature means you cannot just break the blocks of the dungeon from the beginning, adding challenge, as you have to reach the end of the dungeon and disable a shield generator before you have the ability to hoard all that sweet,  sweet  decorative loot.Progression through mining has been overhauled almost entirely. Ores look different in appearance now, and not just in colour. All ores have different textures, except silver and platinum, which look shockingly alike but that sort of adds to their charm. You find a different version of iron in each level of solar system, and you make an alloy out of it later which is stronger than the previous. In the past, you used coal as the alloy material for everything, but now you use all sorts of things to create alloys, from oil to uranium. A very important change is that you don't require an absurd amount of metal to create a set of armour and weaponry anymore, so you don't feel overburdened by mining.Spelunking is a lot better now, with over a 150 mini-dungeons added. It appears that there is a theme with them spawning, so you'll find the same themed ones on a certain planet's underground, and an entirely different set of them with a different theme on another. Underground exploration is a fair bit more diverse since these micro-dungeons were added. The caves are still a bit bland, but you can get a fair amount of entertainment from killing the creatures, and finding the ores you need is quite satisfactory.  The humour in the game is hilarious, with all sorts of references to various sci-fi series from the past, present and most likely future. The art style is wonderful and the worlds all look lovely. Decoration items are all very well designed. There are all sorts of clever and witty remarks from the NPC's, but they could still do with a fair amount of variety. Their attitude to your character still depends on your selected race.Modding I hear you ask? Of course it has modding, and it is highly suited for it too. Just be careful with what you install, as there is no in-game mod manager, it will have to be done externally and there are all sorts of game breaking risks, such as character and world corruption.Let's get onto some of the new features. Your ship, and it's AI. Your ship has a newly implemented progression system, where you upgrade it over time with materials, after purchasing an illega- *cough* -legitimate licence from professional businessmen. Every ship has a S.A.I.L (Ship-Based Artificial Intelligence Lattice) with a different digital representation depending on your race. Your ship, how it appears and how it upgrades is also dependent on your selected race. Your S.A.I.L unit allows for you to upgrade your main mining tool, a matter manipulator, over time with mining speed and mining area. You have a mission system with a tutorial which introduces you with the basics of the game, and a main quest which just helps you allow unlock further progression, such as activating your FTL drive allowing you to travel to other solar systems.The mission sytem has a special mission for each tier that requires you to obtain a full set of your tier's armour, then you can accept the quest, which will require you to do a dungeoneering mission or a bossfight. You will receive rewards and be allowed to progress to the next sector with its ores. These dungeoneering missions and bossfights are well fleshed out, but there should be more of them and I believe more will be added in the future.Lastly, 3-D printing and the Tech system. The tech system was used to give you all sorts of useful powers to use throughout your experience, and are now all available without having to find a specific chip. You just obtain a blank tech card from a mission or rarely spawning chests, and you can unlock a tech. You can now equip 4 techs at once. Every tech has a specific slot assigned to it. You get the survival techs which involve passive ability to survive harsh environments, leg slots which involve jumping, such as a double jump. You also have another slot for techs which involve double tapping your directional movement keys activating the ability, and lastly your active ability which can be activated using F by default. In the past you could only have one tech equipped at a time, so this is a great change.3-D printing is a feature where you use the in-game currency, 'pixels', to learn the schematic of any furnishing item (which there are hundreds of) at a fraction of the printing price. Once you learn the schematic you can print more of it at will, at a price. This is useful for base building and decoration, so I would say it is a good feature.Currency in the game is another thing. At the moment it is mainly gotten from killing monsters and a certain machine which allows you to turn ores into money. You cannot sell weapons or other things to NPC shopkeepers yet, but you will most likely be able to in a future patch. NPC shops have a theme, you might get a clothing vendor who will sell you clothing specific to their race, or a food vendor who will sell you all sorts of foods. The food making system along with the crop system has been revamped. Foods now only give you buffs depending on their rarity.For enjoyment purposes - If you're a lone adventurer looking for a singleplayer joyride; or if you're looking for a rollercoaster of recreation to enjoy with your friends - Starbound does it's job, and it does it well.I'd recommend you to give the game a shot,  it is already worth the money, but you can wait a while longer for  a more developed version before purchasing. In the past I would've hesitated to call this game a beta, but with the new update it is very well done and deserves everyone to try it at least once. If you have some money around and want to help with the Beta testing, definitely give it a bash.Hopefully I have helped you in your decision for purchasing this game!Have a wonderful day, Good Sir or Madame!

								I bought this game for the multiplayer. I played a little singleplayer and had some fun but it wasn't enough just as I expected. So I tried to get on multiplayer. After going through 2 days of digging and pleading and reworking and backtracing and downloading and errors and uninstalling and redownloading and searching and quitting and trying again and teamwork and almost prevailing and then not prevailing and loosing time and loosing my life and loosing my mind to Starbound & Hamachii i've come to realization that the only people who gave thumbs up are loners or liars. The multiplayer would be so much simplier with just server browsing like Killing Floor or any MMO. This game sickens me, but I'm going to keep trying.Oh and keep in mind when you look at my hours, I only spent 4 playing. The rest are me starting and restarting and joiningg and rejoining only to have it fail and error EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is the only review I have ever made at this time but holy crap it is worthy of it's place. **** you Starbound, it's not like your gonna be done ANYTIME SOON			"

												Before 1.0, I spent over 900 hours playing Starbound and would have recommended it very much. But as of 1.0, I can no longer do that.Not sure what happened, but all of a sudden Starbound is acting weird. I've uploaded a screenshot to give an example of the mayhem, but there's also problems with black boxes appearing where objects or sprites should be and slowly multiplying until the game is unplayable. The biggest problem though, is the crashing for no reason at all. Alt tabbing, teleporting, moving stuff in my inventory have all caused a crash for unknown reasons. Even starting up the game and getting to the Chucklefish logo caused a crash once.And that fish is starting to annoy me more than the Duck Hunt dog.During Early Access the only problem I had was an occasional slow down and trouble connecting to my brothers to play together. Luckily the multiplayer had been simplified with 1.0.I had  other points I wanted to get in to, but the lack of stability is enough to not recommed at the moment.			"

								Well, I have to say it's a very promising game, but I strongly disagree with the developers' practices. I bought Starbound a year ago because they had a very clear development plan and, frankly, I give up on waiting. After many months without a update, Chucklefish has lost all credibility I had trusted them. And that goes beyond Starbound's quality. It's about good business practices, which is the reason why I don't recommend buying it. At least, wait a few months (or years, who knows) until the game is finally released.			"

								This game has jumping. You can press the space bar to jump up and down. You can jump on your spaceship, and you can also jump on planets and stuff. You can jump on a mac or a PC. But be warned, your thumb will get tired from jumping so much. The best tactic is to jump away from monsters, cause then you can jump over rocks and grass and whatever you want to jump over.			"

								I've been with the community since early 2013, and known of the game since its inception. And not till date do I regret spending time on it. The community is excellent, and the game itself is quite fun, although improvements CAN and MUST be made.All in all, it seems too much like Terraria in space, and lacking the fun of loot, considering how all armour and arms that are in any way GOOD have to be crafted. Of course, you have to BUY or FIND guns, and they suck a lot of the time. But all this will change, and I know that.Good game,  and I reccommend itEspecially after its proper release			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game last year, and not on steam.  I was given a steam code for when it appeared on steam later.  It was not being advertised as an early access title, but being in open beta.  Beta versions of games are supposed to be pretty much feature complete, and just the bugs are getting ironed out before official release.They have a 3 stage beta schedule.  In December 2013 they were in beta stage one.  Today, they are still in beta stage one, about 11 months later.  The game is also no where near being feature complete, and with all they still want to add, it may never be finished at their current development rate.I did have a little fun with the game when I purchased it, but I would prefer to wait for a finished product so I haven't played it for a while.  I just checked in on it again for where it's at now, and sadly there still is no idea when this game will be finished.I really can't recommend this game because it is hard to say if it will ever be finished, and if so when.  It is a cool game though and will probably be great when it is done.  Just don't buy into it now, as its future is dubious at best.  It should never have been released as early as it was, and not with advertising that it is in beta mode when it is still in development.Thanks to this developer and this game, I will never support an early access game again.  I used to think indie developers were a great alternative to getting burned by triple A developers and all their bs dlc and nickle and diming, however it seems some indie developers will burn you too by taking your money and abandoning/blowing off the game.  The next video game crash is coming.			"

But here is a quick run-through of stuff it needs to fix:-You can only make private servers on hamachi without spending a bajillion dollars-There's no real goal to accomplish in the game-Base building is somewhat difficult an the point of a home planet is stupid-It takes forever to get off your starting planet and when you do there is little to no feedback on where to goI'd give this game a 3.5/10.

Early Access Review
								So after putting 200+ hours into Terraria and unlocking hardcore mode, I got bored of fairies and unicorns trying to murder me. I opened up YouTube to find that someone was streaming Starbound with his friends and fell in love with the game. That was way back when people could still die from coldness, I assume before the Winter Update...One day, I noticed it was on sale, and used one of the gift cards I got for Christmas. I played it for a week straight...And now? I've put 56-ish hours into Starbound, and have all the crafting stations, got all the ores (I think), and finished all of the quests before the book-on-a-stand and bird-emblem quests. (All as a Novakid, who I hear is still unbalanced)It was fun for the first few days, but only now do I realize that I was just following the same system over and over:Go to an unexplored planet, walk all the way around the planet, get any decent ores and open all the chests, (there are chests 'hidden' EVERYWHERE) then go to a moon, refuel, and repeat.Literally the only thing that broke this system was the quests, and they aren't even that fun. Sure, the first bunch of quests are easy as hell, but even the harder ones are very rarely worth the trouble and are required to progress what little story there is... See the problem?As others have mentioned, planet exploration is pretty limited early game because of the tech suits and you have to do quests to get the tech suits in the first place.Long story short, Starbound had a lot of promise, but now it's seriously losing the shine it had, if it hasn't lost it already. I wish I could say this game is worth the $15 it's selling for, but honestly it isn't. If you're looking for a Terraria-esque game and haven't played Terraria yet for some reason,  just go play Terraria.  It has way more content than Starbound does, and actually gets updated more often as well, even though it was officially released earlier this year. EDIT (Glad Giraffe):The idea of a combat update wasn't a bad idea. It really needed it, considering how most fights involved the same recolored mobs. I've decided to give the update a test run, to see just how much has been added or changed.General changes, may or may not be accurate:- Mob spawn rates increase at night, in a way that reminds me of the first in-game night in Minecraft- Special attacks, as stated in the official update post. Pretty cool so far, haven't found any unique items yet.- Tent regen is slower than the last time I played, might just be me Novakid: Even harder than before, since you only get two guns in the prologue and most mobs move to attack you. I died about 3 separate times on the first planet because of this and the really small amount of health Novakids have. Avian, and basically all of the other races: Plays about the same, though including the new mob variety on the starting planet might be working against Starbound's favor. The small, orange blobs with blue eyes are fine (12 dmg), the three white puffs stacked on top of each other are ok (15 dmg stacked, 5 dmg separated), but the little Mawile-esque thing (21 dmg)? I hate that thing, as adorable as it looks. There's also a short and chubby Flygon that spits 15 poison dmg at you... Let's just say that isn't on my good side either.			"

Review For StarboundReview by: DEHUPros :- Lovely 16-bit graphics- So much to explore- Huge map and loads of planets and systems to discover- Ton of funCons :- Quests can sometimes get boringReview :Starbound is a very fun sandbox games with loads of stuff to do. You start in your spaceship that have been damaged, so you have to reboot it's system to get access to your first items and access to the teleport pad so you can explore the planet under you.Planets comes in different sizes and biomes, like Dessert and different weather depends of the planet.The start missions are just turtorial missions like mine iron ore and smelt it into bars and that kind of stuff, and later you get bigger mission like getting core fragments so you can get to other planets in same system.Only way to get to the first boss that gives you access to travel to other star systems, is doing missions in the hub area found in the star system.The games is like Terraria, just more future like.The game can be modded, so you can have even more fun with mods like in Minecraft.Additional Infomation :Developer: ChucklefishPublisher: ChucklefishGenre:  Action, Eventyr, Casual, Indie, RPGReleased on Steam: 4. dec 2013Release on consoles: TBAFollow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/This review is written for :The Panda's Corner "

								First Impressions - StarboundThe indie market is flooded with these sandbox building/survival type games.  Minecraft of course was the first, and Terraria followed suit.  To really be a success now in this genre of gameplay, the game has to be something really special.  Based on my limited time with the game so far, it really IS something special.Starbound starts off with a character creator, which many of these games do, but allows to be something other than human.  Six races are selectable at the time of this impressions, and each one has quite a few customizing options for the time of game this is.  After you've created your character, you're sent to your ship above a random planet, and begin the tutorial questline.  Yes, this game has both of those.From there Starbound becomes a game of exploring new planets, getting better gear to explore even further, exploring solo or with friends, fighting an endless array of creatures on your quest to survive.  Starbound, in these last 2 hours of gameplay have been more entertaining, and fun, than I ever had in Terraria.  Well worth the 15 dollars it costs.PLEASE NOTE: I have only experienced some minor frame drops and one crash, but your milage may vary, please do not insult the game for being a beta with bugs, as right now that's kind of the point, being Early Access and all.

								People keep on saying the devs abandond this game but that is clearly not true when you go to their web site it shows how much they want it to be perfect when they update it to the baseline game. Regarding gameplay if you have played more that 70 or 100 hours of this game wouldn't you say that is worth $15 all in itself. I will say that as it is now is shallow in the sense that i can get to top tier items in less than 3 hours now, so I would have to say don't get it now wait a bit longer until it comes out of early access.

												I have been with this game since the first couple months of development. At first this game was a meaningless grind for nothing but exploring a world woth virtually nothing to do. Now this game is packed with things to do but it doesn't feel like anything new. I've seen all of these things before in other games in the genre and I'm starting to get sick of it. You have about 10 hours of fun with suviving but then you overtake the planet and move on to another and explore that one to find some enemies with slightly different looks and attacks. After another 5 hours of declining fun with the gear you've been using since the beginning of the game, you decide to get new gear. You craft and craft but run out of pixels. You then kill monsters looking for them and get enough for whatever you needed. After this the problem doesn't fade away, it worsens as you enter the never ending grind for these irritating little blocks. So this game is minimally buggy and runs great but those that appear are pretty big like the ground disappearing and turning clear. The quests at the beginning of the game are GARBAGE. Get me coffee. Make me coffee. Get me a cup for my coffee. Get me sugar for my coffee. Just a pain in your butt for the first several hours of the game. I'm trying to like it but can't and would only recommend it to someone I don't like and want them to waste their money. Multiplayer is in pretty bad shape at the moment too. I give this game a 4/10.			"

								Where to start well lets start with you are one of 6 races (im the fish one :D) you are flying around in space when suddenly you run out of fuel D: your job is to explore the world and search for fuel so you can continue on your travels, but beware there can be scary but there are some passive mobs (SPOILER ALERT) like a cute little Rhino looking beast, after exploring on your little island fighting mods and gathering things to help you progress you are given quests to complete, this adds so much more to the game as it gets you to make and create things that way you will hopefully remember how to craft these things later in the game, (another spoiler) after doing a few of these quests you are told to create a distress beacon but be warned after placing this anything can happen from and alien invasion to a friendly visit, i got the alien invasion and got destroyed by evil penguins, now to the Graphics this game looks like an enhanced Terraria it has awesome NPC textures and awesome background that gives the game that much more Awesomeness :P. this game has small villages/dungeons and tombs to explore with real NPC's that talk and interact with you i got an offer to go fishing with one (ill take him/her up on that offer). I highly reccomend this game to any Terraria, sci-fi, sandbox, open-world game fans it is very entertaining with alot to do and a lot to explore once you got fuel for your ship that is well i hope to see you in one of the wonderful planets, im going back to exploring i finally got some fuel for my second trip :D -FluroTech			"

												EDIT2:I am on a fence with this game but giving thumbs down just because deves promised something that they didn't deliver.Ok, so ""full release"" is upon us. After playing few hours of it I can say with all certainty that this game doesn't offer anything more that has been done before.Initial main quests are nice and fun to do but after that it's old dig/mine/upgrade. Sad thing is that I still have to recommend Terraria over this. It isn't a bad game just a missed opportunity on part of devs to create something that they aimed in the first place.In conclusion play for a while if you have nothing better to do and move along.EDIT: Devs are working on creatures and now they are becoming somewhat cooler but still no word of endgame and a basic aim of the game. Imho this won't be finished anytime soon.Over 3 years in Early Access, not any closer to full/promised content. Terrarria during that time doubled it's content if not tripled.Worlds lack variety, creaters are ridiculous and not intersting. Devs seem to lose control of what they actually try to achive.Save your money for something else...oh and DON'T BUY EARLY ACCESS GAMES!			"

								""Starbound is just a terraria rippoff"" Is what i've heard by many different people, well i say they're wrong. The freedom to fully interact with your characters in several different ways, including mods that will add more races and story to the game. Well, i would also say that gameplay is way different too, both in feel and in skill. I mean, when starting a new character you might end up on a fairly challenging planet instantly, acid water, acid rain and monsters that has various attack moves. The lootable items from mini-bosses and chests has an unique function, they're completly random. Even if you kill the same looking mini boss there's a minimal chance that you get exactly the same item. Also i would say that if you look at the different planets visual design like backgrounds, biome and wildlife. You also see that this varies by which planet you visit, even if some changes and difference may feel small.The soundtrack is simply glorious, but i would apreciate if they added more battle themes. The Current version does NOT include custom ships, which means you can't expand them or move any original parts that was in the spaceship in the beginning thus offering a very limited space.Overall i think the game is ""working"" as entertainment which means it can be interesting from time to time since it can feel repetitive. Right now Starbound would need the following: More Quests, The possibility to re-arrange the spaceship and more content in general and Somekind of multiplayer item protection (Making people unable to steal from other players)			"

								Starbound encompasses a literal universe of content, with procedurally generated monsters, weapons, planets, and friendly NPC's.  Planetary environments actually have an effect on what kind of gear you'll need to bring with you.  You have the freedom to choose to remain on a planet for as long as you would like, or as little as you would like, and whether you scour one for secrets, or browse over a wide selection for a sampling of theirs, you're bound to be the richer for it.  While not necessarily a quest in its own right, the desire to find all the ingredients to make your race's culinary pinnacle is a thing that can drive you to explore many a planet for different kinds of foods.In Starbound you can...Create your own villageFill it with NPC's that you spawn from items you craftBuild a sewer system for your village with real sewageFly your ship to new worlds, stars, and sectors of the galaxyMake a stone pickaxe upgrade it over the course of the gameCapture monsters and use them to fight for youChop down a tree that has eyeballs instead of leavesEat the aforementioned eyeballsWalk clear around the planet to your initial starting pointAnd so much more!As a gamer with nearly 500 hours logged playing Terraria, and probably almost as many playing Minecraft, I wholeheartedly recommend this unbelievably playable dig-em-up, craft-em-up, shoot-em-up, spacefaring game.

However, Starbound is different, being a Terraria-esque game with its own attitude, tons of content, and procedurally and randomly generated worlds, weapons, monsters, etc. Starbound, to me, is like the prodigy son of Terraria, especially with it being made by one of Terraria's developers, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for either a quick-fix of adventure and survival or a vast journey with their friends, especially with its compatibility with PC's, Macs, and Linux computers. This game, though still in Early Beta as I give my recommendation, should not be overlooked. It's just a great game that brings something fresh and new to the table and doesn't stop being great until you exhaust your seemingly endless amount of options that the game has to offer.			"

								I don't need to restate what you can read in all the other negative reviews. So to summarise, the game is a grind fest, progression is completely linear and boring, multiplayer/online is unfeasible, and we haven't had a stable update since March '14. Don't bother, you'll be disappointed.Update: Aside from the March '14 comment, nothing much has changed. Apart from the goal posts, the combat/progression has been rehashed, again, and it's still lackluster, linear, and grindy. To put things in perspective, this game has been in ""development"" in early access for an entire Windows OS generation. From Windows 8 to Windows 10. Now they're planning on a console port, to con an entire new market while it's still far from even remotely finished.			"

								I adore Starbound. Whimsical weapon names, surprising weather system, fantastic background, beautiful soundtrack along with dynamically changing according to what's happening (dramatic music for battles), excellent combat, the concepts of exploring not one planet but an entre galaxy has got to be the most fun I'll ever have. Its a good game to play with friends as exploring dungeons and just adventuring will leave you happy. If you're familiar with Terraria and Minecraft, but weren't a fan of the art style, I say this is the one for you.			"

This could potentially be fixed by a large influx of new content, but for now, this game feels kind of soulless.			"

								I bought the game in August, and three months later, there still hasn't been a ""real"" update. Sure, every day the developers work on their nightly build – which is comprised of every single thing they want to add to the game, regardless if it currently works – but it seems that the developer's focus is to add every cool thought that they have to the game as a soon as possible and make it actually work later. The consensus has been that, if you want new content, you have to use the nightly build which they preface as buggy (it doesn't even open for me) and may risk losing all of your saves.Its up to you. Personally, I would rather have the devs focus on a specific idea (i.e. new character, quest, etc.) and make sure it works, instead of them adding everything at once.			"

												Eh, I have to say, It's kinda gotten bad since it's release. If you want to make a good experience, you'd think Normal would be good since you only lose a few of your items. Later, you're gonna figure out you lose basically all blocks and items. If you want a good experience, go on Casual with Hunger enabled. It's either this, or I suck at games. Probably the latter.

												Starbound had been rotting in early access hell for so long that it used to be held up as an example of how to do early access right. Somewhere along the way, a few things became obvious: Chucklefish is a horrible business with terrible business practices, and the devs lost their creative vision a long time ago.What started out as a promissing game that needed some tweaking and more content, ended up as a disappointing game that needs so much tweaking its like it left early access in name only. I'm saying that Starbound is still in early access, no matter what anyone tries to tell you.Long ago, in the age of myths when Starbound first entered early access there was a horrible monster known as ""damage on contact"". Everyone hated it and the devs rightly removed it. Then another set of devs got brain damage and decided that they wanted it back in because...I don't know, artistic vision? This is but one example of how its become clear that the devs have aboslutely no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what they are actually doing and what their vision for this game even is anymore.Along the way, the toolbar was twisted every which way as the devs desperately attempted to find something that worked. As soon as they did find something that most fans were at least okay with, they'd decide that the fans were wrong and make it worse. As it stands now, its a hot mess that will probably get you killed at least once.Planet and biome diversity has fluctuated over the course of the game, new biomes added, more dungeons added, and then a bunch of biomes and dungeons were removed for 1.0 because the devs knew better than those silly fans.You might be noticing a trend here where the devs didn't actually want feedback for the game during early access, but just wanted people to pay to be beta testers. And they failed at that, because holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this game still buggy. Even if you could somehow ignore all the bugs, for there are many, the game is so horribly optimized that you will wonder how such a thing is even possible for a pixel graphics game. In my humble opinion, my PC setup is above average. I can run most AAA games with few problems if any. I can even get some of those up to 144fps! And then there is Starbound, a pixel graphic game where sometimes the fps dips down to 30 or less.Its important you understand that the various races you could choose from used to matter, such as racial armor abilities, weapons, and more. As it stands now, the armor looks different and the ship is different and that's it.I'm going to stop myself from listing every single thing that the devs ""streamlined"" from early access, because I'd run out of space here. I tell you about it so that you can know that this game really did have a lot more content at one point, but for reasons known only to the devs, its been removed with little reasoning. You could make an entirely new game with all that's been removed. So much has been removed it feels more ""early access"" than some points of its early access life.Combat is awful, performance and optimization are awful, the ""story"" is homogenized and counter to promises made in early access, exploration is nearly pointless, the ""quests"" are repetitive to an insane degree, and the only thing that could possibly keep you interested is the colony system which I will admit is actually pretty good.The only good thing to come from Chucklefish was Stardew Valley getting published. Go buy that instead. It is an infinitely better game that deserves your money far more than this massive letdown.			"

Early Access Review
								Pro:- interesting setting- low learning curve- very diverse building blocks- multiple races and the racism that naturally occurs between races (no sugar coating of reality)- engaging fasttravel system, that doesn't unnecessarily shrink the world- varied combat weapons and abilitiesCon:- trivial difficulty, easy enemies, easy self-healing- extremely quick progression- no need to build- no nostaliga moments, as you simply switch planets instead of conquering a world- poor performance despite bing a pixel art game- slow development, Early Access for the ages- short sense of exploration, because progress is quick you opt into landing, digging, mining -> next tier -> repeat- food/buffs are meaningless- unprecise movement- early movement upgrades- crafting > finding / unlockingThe first time I got Starbound I managed to ""finish"" the game so quickly that it didn't last an saturday afternoon. Expected from early access. Now, years later, it doesn't seem to have changed much other than it takes slightly longer, because now there are missions between the tiers. They aren't difficult nor are they that interesting.The first game of this sandbox type I played was Terraria and I played that in it's early stages too. The difficulty was higher but not torturing but more importantly, you felt the need to connect with your world. If you went to far in one direction or too deep you ended up fighting monsters outside of your current combat strengh. In Starbound the transition from a weak explorer to a stronger one is very clearly cut. It's switching the planet you're exploring. And it's not like you can go to higher tiers earlier to seek out a challenge because you'll end up dealing with constant health loss due to artificially giving the next tier of planet something you later deal with passively by progression.Starbound had the need to stay warm in early stages and it slowed you down. Apparently enough people complained for this to be removed. But that's exactly what made Terraria great and Starbound badly designed now: You explore too quickly. In Terraria you had little means of moving around until you were well into higher tiers. In Starbound you get doublejump, anti-fall damage and grapple hooks (good idea but it speeds up everything) and then you blast your way through worlds. No need to build anything either. You put the crafting stations on your ship and that's that. Either you love spending time on housing and then do it or you completely skip it. That might sound like a nice thing. Do what you want and skip everything else. But one of the most important parts of a task is to have a purpose. Good design creats the need and desire to do something, which Starbound fails to do. If you enjoy housing building there are better ways to do it. If you enjoy exploring there are better ways to do it. If you enjoy combat there are a lot better ways to do it.Starbound had potential and probably still has. But it doesn't seem like the developer is moving in a direction which attacks there points. The ease of access to everything doesn't make for a good game. It makes for a good level editor but that's not what Starbound wants to be or would perform well at either.			"

												I like this game. A lot. Starbound just holds a special place in my heart. I was really hoping this review wasn't going to happen. I've always held out hope that after 1.0 was released, I could convince my friends to get this game to try it out, as they have always doubted this game through it's early access days. I really, really wanted to just dump all of my love into this game. And judging from my current time in-game (which is over 700+ hours as of writing), you'd think that 1.0 was worth the wait.However, I was wrong. I love this game, but that doesn't save it from a truthful review. There are huuuuge problems that need to be addressed. I don't feel like pointing them out, as every other review for this game has already done that and more. (Just scroll up/down, for christ's sake.)The only thing I want to point out myself is how much this game tends to rely on the community to create new content so it can be enjoyed. I've seen a large number of mods available that fix, enhance, or even overhaul concepts in the game that were otherwise very tedious and just not fun.I would recommend this to you if you're willing to modify the ever-loving crap out of this game right after purchasing it, but otherwise I wouldn't tell anyone to go out and buy it until Chucklefish stops relying on the community to make their game better.

								Fun as heck game, in my opinion gameplay- and graphicswise waaaaay better than Terraria (Though Terraria still beats the game when it comes to items and bosses), it also is more original, in my opinion. It has original ideas, items and it is science-fiction with weirdly medieval races thrown into it, the artstyle is enjoyable and the planets look amazing, and so does the weather system.Sadly, the game's community does seem to die off rather quickly, the last year, mostly due to lack of proper server support, it seems. Also updates have been all over the place, though, they added a lot of content.Overall, it is worth the 20 bucks I spent on it back when to kickstart it, and it is still worth that today. A nice reccomendation for the people who enjoy Terraria and science-fiction!			"

								I love this game already, and I'm excited to see how the developers are going to continue. I find the lore interesting and it's pretty good, incomparison to some other sandbox games, such as Terraria. I feel the game's beginning to become unique enough to stand on its own, and it'll keep on moving away from what the general populace compares it to (Terraria.) It's already a great game, although with some pacing issues. However, it's still in beta, and I'm absolutely sure it'll be much more polished when it's officially released. It's up to you. If you want to contribute a bunch and help with feedback, definitely get it now. If you want to get the intended experience, wait for it.			"

												I can't say i've enjoyed my time with this game. I've put in a solid 7 hours across 3 play sessions, and I have not been interested one time. The combat is incredibly dull, it could get interesting later, but if it hasn't in 7 hours then that's asking too much. I've wandered across 5 planets with not much interesting to see. I beat that first real easy boss the Eldrich Horror which was just some platforming to avoid really slow energy beams to press 4 buttons and flip a switch so some machine can do damage to it. The one bonus I saw was that there are some really high quality furniture peaces you can collect, like rotating security cameras, or other static pieces like sciency equipment, barbed wire, and chain link fence. This could offer some very interesting base building options.I came into this game after 370 hours in Terraria and was hoping it could give me the same feeling but in a different way. I quickly realized these two games aren't that similar at all, but I cannot say that I think Starbound is an interesting game in it's own way at all.Do your own research, watch videos and see if it's something you'd like. I don't feel like this was a good purchase.			"

								At the time of this writing, the game is in it's first stage of beta/early access.  From the offset, it is hard not to make comparison's to Terraria, seeing as how it IS the spiritual successor to Terraria.  That being said, the game is increadibly good, and surpasses Terraria in many ways.  From the start, if you don't like the planet your on, you can pack up shop and fly on outta there to another planet.  Large, small, mid-size, snow, jungle, moon, it doesn't matter.  The choice is up to you.  Add on top of this, that any planet you find of noteworthiness can have it's coordinates shared with friends (both online and offline), so that adds an extra flare of an exploration feel that simply wasn't available in Terraria without a non-Steam related server.  The game is a 9/10 out the box, and a 10/10 when it's fully completed.  Get it now, in case they raise the price, because it is worth more than the asking amount now.			"

								Starbound is one of those games like Terraria, you just want to keep going and expanding. The differences between Terraria and starbound are what make it stand out. For example, the music! Oh my god the music is so wonderous! I mean, don't get me wrong; Terraria had  great  music. But in comparison to Starbound, it stands no chance. another thing I like about the game is the motion, jumping. And character movement and action physics. The jumps look fluent, the movement actually defines what a body would look like running, and the other movements aren't blocky; they're smooth. Overall, I love this game and will see myself logging   AT LEAST   100- 200 hours.			"

								The game is OK.  The concept is fun. The modding community is really spectacular. The gameplay isn't quite there. The devs are not great. Last real update was in April -4 months ago and it included directional weapons which was modded in by the community day one- not much else to say. When it was released the dev's promised to have already been working on features like new ships. If a player can make a ship in a day or two why has it taken the dev's almost a year? I'm not joking ship upgrades have been ""in the works"" for over a year. The dev's have also handled some of the lashback of their poor development pretty poorly and not at all like professionals.Sorry Chucklefish you dropped the ball on this one. It is a game with limitless potential but my experience so far would be to avoid Chuclefish in any future endeavors.			"

												+Amazing generated worlds to explore.+Good, rewarding progressen. Doesn't feel like an endless grind.+Cool, variating weapons with special abilities.+Very nice graphics with love into detail.+Not the best story, but it works for this game.+Astonishing amount of content.o I have to add that I'm not interested into building/decorating bases and stuff, so for other players this would be another big plus I guess.-Horrible combat mechanics.-Stupid/annoying enemies to fight.-Clunky controls and inventory management.It's sad what Starbound has become, despite the many great ideas and the amount of time and passion Chucklefish has put into this. It's definitely not a bad game, but for me some bad core mechanics (especially combat) completely destroy the experience.Chucklefish failed basically at one point: Project management.They are a bunch of passionate developers/graphics designer who had a vision to create the perfect sci-fi Sandbox game. But instead of designing it carefully, estimating times and efforts properly, planning the development process, everyone just fired away typing some code as it seems. They've announced Starbound in February 2012 to be finished at the end of the year!What makes me think that? Well I am a software (not game) designer myself and have been following Chucklefish's feeds since 2012. Their announcements were so random and unrealistic, that I was constantly wondering whether they are straight forward lying on purpose or simply extremly naive.As an example see my comment of one of their ""1.0"" announcement back in September 2014:http://blog.chucklefish.org/finishing-up-starbound-1-0/#comment-116Now to the game: There are three problems which make combat unenjoyable and annoying in my opinion:Awkward Weapon/Item CooldownsSwinging a two handed sword (the complete animation) takes about 1/3 of a second. But depending on the weapon, you have a cooldown of more than 1 second. This causes your character ""wait"" between swings, making attacking with the sword some kind of unenjoyable and hard to time. This alone wouldn't be a big problem, if there wouldn't be this:Switching to a weapon triggers its cooldown. In the very beginning of the game you're dependent on your flashlight or torches in dark caves. But they give you a two handed weapon first, so you have to switch between your weapon and a light source constantly. That's not unusual (same in Terraria), and with quick slots it should be easy to execute. But as you try to switch to your sword and attack an enemy in front of you, nothing happens at first, probably causing you to get hit. And there's no player animation indicating that you first have to wind up or something, you just have to hold the mouse button and wait for the first swing to come. Later in the game I've found a cool grenade launcher and my plan was to assign it to a quick slot, with a sword and flashlight on another one to quickly pop out a grenade during fights and switch back to my sword. Not possible.This is when I realized how good the combat is implemented in Terraria. Even if Terraria's weapon swing animations seem awkward at first, they make total sense from a gameplay perspective. The animations are fluent and fighting feels intuitive. If you have the skills, you can use a melee weapon, a ranged one, spells and other items in a quick succession, killing your foes with style.I can see why Chucklefish implemented both of these ""features"". Procedurally generated weapons need to be balanced. A sword with high swing damage needs a long cooldown between swings. And since they do not have procedurally generated animation, your character just stands still during cooldown. And to avoid players bypassing cooldowns by constantly switching weapons, they simply added a delay after switching to a weapon.The EnemiesIt's nice to see procedurally generated enemies, but most of their attack patterns suck. Their ""charge attacks"" feel cheap and all have the same sound, which sounds like jumping in ""Super Mario Land"" on Game Boy (yeah, I'm that old). Same with the death animation - every enemy just ""vaporizes"" on death.  Some patterns are even more annoying, like ghosts getting invincible for a short amount of time after being hit.Weird Performance Issues/BugsMy computer is exceeding recommended requirements by far and I have a very solid and fluent frame rate, but I'm constantly experiencing bad ""latency-like"" spikes on single player. Enemies/NPCs just freeze for a while, while I'm being able to move around normally and after 2 seconds all the movements catch up fast forward-style, sometimes leading to me taking damage. I tried different tweaks I've found on forums, but nothing seems to work and other players seem to have the same problem long before the V1.0 release.Besides combat and enemies there are a few more ""clunky"" mechanics like inventory management, farming, eating, but I won't go into detail with that.So my guess is that since they started Starbound development without planning properly, they've implemented bad core mechanics at the very beginning of 2012 or even 2011, which they weren't able to fix even after all these years of extra development time. They have done some fixes, but they were more patch-ups than redesigns. I've made similar experiences with implementing software myself. It's like building a house: Once you've set the foundations it's very hard to change them without tearing down the whole house. If you mess up, you are able to fix *some* mistakes (e.g. removing a wall or moving a door), but the chance is high that even this will look awkward afterwards.I hope that they still manage to fix some of the main issues, since exploring and progression is wonderful, but I honestly doubt it after all these years of development.

												Back during early access, the game felt like a fairly disjointed mess. I chalked it up to it still being early access and mostly left it alone while I waited and checked back occasionally.Now that the game is out, I can say that the game still feels mostly like it did back in early access, in a variety of ways. I'll start out with the good parts of the game, though.It has some pretty nice music.Graphics look pretty goodThere's a lot of building potential since there's a lot of props.The lore behind the game is pretty complex Pretty decent mod supportFor the bad: The game still plays like a disjointed mess. Some of my friends have found it playable and enjoyable, but the most of us haven't. The game is still relatively unoptimized. Hosting a server eats up most of a new gen i7. The game seems to rely on mods to be playable. This is ok during early access, but not really acceptable for a 1.0.There's a few other gripes that fall outside of the game itself: There's still no changelog. Again, this can be ok during early access, but not having a release changelog seems pretty unprofessional. Mod documentation is sparse at best. They've had some pretty poor community management in the past. I didn't experience it directly but it still colored my view of the devs somewhat, so take that with a grain of salt.Most of the updates over the past couple years seem to have been mostly cosmetic (UI enhancements and the like) and added some backstory, but they don't seem to have really made the game feel more cohesive or enjoyable. If you haven't ever really enjoyed Starbound, you're unlikely to enjoy it now that it's out.(Also, I did enjoy Terraria, but Starbound has disappointed me regularly for the past 2 years)			"

Early Access Review
								Ive had this game since when it nearly came out.  Ill try to be concise and short with my summary.I  DO NOT RECOMMEND STARBOUND IF YOU ARE AIMING FOR MULTIPLAYER WITH FRIENDSThis game has been in development so long that Stardew Valley came out fully finished - with 1 person working on it - while this game is still in ""Early Access"" , and that game has likely more content. There is a lack of content in this game that leaves it feeling dull after a little while.MOD MAKERS add more content to this game than the developers.This Game is an absolute must read for how NOT to develop a game - When it was released this was the next best thing to Terraria and likely could have blown up even bigger due to its concepts, however , the games developers consistently released tiny updates that invalidated many mods - and of them there were MANY fantastic ones. This was done over and over again so that many modders , nearly all of them, quit the game.The vanilla game is not upto snuff after being out this long and I understand modders should not normally be considered with making updates to the core game - but when they are producing literally 400-900% more content in SINGLE mods than exist in the entire vanilla game , then yeah , they should have been considered. Me and my friends only played this for the mods. That says ALOT , infact , it says it all.This and many other decisions led to a complete die-down of the momentum this game had at the start so that eventually it became just a mediocre title - but they got their vanilla changes in! and after ALLLLL of this time? Thats not saying very much at all since the game itself isnt too far off from where it started originally , 90% of the features in vanilla were fleshed out , thought out and released by modders early on. Only to have the mods rendered incompatible for the umpteenth time for some additional run animation , or jump animation , or a quest overhaul etc.This game was an enormous disapointment to alot of people , myself included.

												Starbound is a game I really wanted to enjoy. Terraria had some good ideas, taking the Minecraft Genre 2D, but its implementation for some things felt a bit rushed-- because they were. I won't go into that here, but things were rushed out the door. Starbound was taking its time, and that made me hopeful.If this was the game it was a year ago, I would recommend it. Heck, if this was the game it was when it first entered early access I'd recommend it!Back then, the progression was fun. It didn't force a story on you with unskippable cutscenes that have text so small I have to squint to read it. It didn't have frustrating dungeons you can't build in when building is a core mechanic of the game. You didn't need to collect lots and lots of powerups to dig better, because you could just make a drill. The bosses were fun, and progression was quick. You could actually start the game, find coal, and instantly go to another world! How cool is that compared to this?The game was great when it felt like it was embracing being a multi world Terraria. Then it added very finicky combat that made me long for Terraria's simplicity, and made you need to go through one of the most frustrating dungeons I've played to be able to get past the first world.The 50 hours I spent on earlier versions was well spent.I cannot recommend it anymore.

								Starbound...Another Neverfinished Access game (3 years since i bought the game) (I often buy Early Access games, i like to discover indie gems.)But...Starbound...WTF happened ?!I feel ripped off. I'm very disappointed. Devs did a great job at their debut, and it was very promising. Better Terraria like ! I spent hours exploring planets, looting dungeons, fighting monsters, building my house, farming, looting weapons, trying to dig deeper and deeper to the core of the planet where i was established, which i never reached.Because one day, after an long awaited major update, the game didn't start anymore. A problem with Win XP, reported years ago by many players, but nothing was corrected.Laggy AF, when i can play Skyrim, Borderlands 2, Oblivion, Far Cry, or Paint The Town Red (many voxels) without problems. Never had any explaination. Maybe it works now with Win XP, but i don't care.The game is no longer what it was. There's new stuffs, ok, but as we say in French, ""ils mettent un pansement sur une jambe de bois"".See SgtP3pp3r evaluation, i won't have better words.Thanx for your work Devs, anyway.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I've been looking forward to its release for quite a while. I have played in early beta and soon after they added the Outpost. But I just feel the progression is too slow and too linear. In past versions of the game you could be out exploring the galaxy pretty soon into the game, but now you have to do a lengthy series of mundane quests  involving scanning objects and getting to the end of a tedious handcrafted dungeon.The game is hampered with a boring main quest about Earth being destroyed by a giant space monster. Even if you are a native of another planet, it starts you off as a graduate on an Earth academy, This means you character is not a blank slate but is instead an Earthling most likely. Even if you skip the tutorial you have to sit through a long cutscene once you have reached the outpost where an old lady tells you about the fate of Earth (I don't care about Earth, I'm a beep boop alien robot for the Creator's sake!).The game shows you everything you can craft so far, even if you don't have the materials. This is pretty good, plus mining and exploring the planet is fun, even though the lack of randomly generated monsters does hamper the sense of danger and caution when exploring a planet. However, movement abilities are pretty weak, you get a dash after you give the Outpost tech-guy 10 copper bars, however this dash is barely a metre in distance and has a long cooldown. You can upgrade this dash to an air dash but this is also pretty weak in comparison to other platforming game's movement options.It took me a very long time to repair the FTL, which requires the completion of the linear dungeon I mentioned earlier. I am still gathering resources to be able to breathe on the moon, so I can mine it for FTL fuel to actually use the FTL. This progression is really slow and I don't like being stuck on the starting planet for that long, I have already explored all of its surface and the mine area. To get the best gear you have to complete these scanning quests to populate the Outpost with more NPCs, these scanning quests require traversing the galaxy hoping to find items of that race, you then repeat this for every race and call it the main quest.Overall I can't really recommend it as a game you open up, sit down and explore,craft and mine in. The open end sandbox of the game comes after an extremely long series of quests and you will be stuck on your starting planet for a while, so you better like mountainous green planets because you will have to stay for a while.

												This game completely trashes its own potential.-Story is dogshit, feels super rushed, replaying feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing chore-No racial traits whatsoever.-Lack of content after YEARS of development.-Building houses serves zero purpose, all you need is your ship.-Bosses are crap overall, no challenge, no good music (same song is used in like 4 bossfights), no good visuals.-Where's the interaction with NPCs? All you can do is mash E to get random ♥♥♥♥♥♥ responses.-No ammo for firearms, instead it eats your energy. A very dumb system, in a game like this what you would want is sustained fire.-Mob variety is poorly done, you can meet slimes that you find on your first forest planet on a radioactive snowy planet later on, i don't think it would be hard to add more enemies after years and years of development considering that most enemies are reskins anyway.-Death animations are... what the ♥♥♥♥?-NPC settlements are the same across every planet, a floran village in a jungle biome is no different from a floran village on a scorched planet with extremely hot temperatures, even the NPCs look the same (no protective gear)-Exploring is a joke, you just walk left/right for 15-20 minutes, might come across a village that you pillage because once again there is no interaction with the NPCs. ♥♥♥♥s sake, they don't even react to theft.-Vehicles are poorly designed, the terrain was also not made for them. You keep bumping into things and you have to build bridges to drive over gaps with your scooter bike thing, on sea you always need to get out of your boat, cross the island, spawn it once again, rendering boats pretty much useless - you might as well just swim. Also no submarines or anything to be able to travel fast underwater.-No jetpacks/anything that provides airborne mobility. You'd expect things like this in a SPACE THEMED game, but still there is literally nothing of the kind.-""Novakid"" have zero lore, despite the promised ""full integration into game's lore""-Very few quests, NPC quests ""fetch this kill that"" are ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting-Co-op is bad, there is never enough loot for two people, let alone THREE people (and we had the pleasure to play as FOUR)Chucklefish, sell this game to someone more competent.

								It's honestly hard to recommend Starbound to anyone that doesn't like Minecraft clones, but to be honest, I wouldn't even recommend it to those that even do...or at least, not now.It's essencially a 3D Minecraft a.k.a. like Terraria but not really, but there's substantially less to actually do. Even after a few updates this game is lacking in what people go play those games for; and that's to have a significant goal that doesn't get old. Basically, there's not much to do in Starbound. Planets are randomly generated, so you can travel to them to find materials or treasures. But you can't really make anything besides weapons with them. No furniture or anything like that, which you have to find and steal from other places. There's a lot of weapons to loot, but why bother when every weapon you can craft is 3 times stronger most of the time? Digging deep doesn't reward you with much besides small amounts of money, which you can't even trade or buy decent weapons with. Not a lot of explenation or exploration, average graphics, boring landscapes, boring combat with not a lot of divercity...It's probably best to wait until Starbound has something a lot more to offer. Until then, stick with Terraria.			"

												Quite some time ago, I made a review for this back when it was in early access. There were a ton of annoyances that mercifully have been fixed. So does this mean the game is no longer a ""roller coaster"" as I put it, where every clever idea is countered with an idiotic design decision?No.Indeed, for every annoyance fixed, a new one is added to the game. Development has been a tumultuous cycle of game balance and interface changes. Will they fix a genuine source of player frustration? Will they fix something that wasn't broken in the first place? Will they fix a problem merely by removing a secondary issue that made it unbearable, rather than fixing the problem itself? Will they break something else entirely? You'll never know until you're already in-game.As of now, literally every other nitpick in my old review is dead and buried, but the only remaining constant has been the inability to pause in singleplayer. I recall complaining about the hunger system, and how being unable to pause made it so that just getting up to tend to some real-life distraction required an investment of time, to secure a spot and slap down a bed lest you starve to death. Remember what I said about fixing a problem by removing an exacerbating issue? They shifted the hunger system away from the easiest difficulty. Gee, thanks for making the escape key a mere annoyance rather than an elaborate method of suicide.I want to bring up the latest wave of nitpicks and genuine ""what the ♥♥♥♥ were they smoking"" moments of this version. But like the issues of the last review, these will pass in time. Half of them, I'll look back on and laugh at myself for complaining. The other half, I'll surely wince at whatever new problems have superseded the old.A long time ago, my final suggestion was that to recommend you wait, and only buy the game after a good series of updates so the devs will have time to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. That time has come and gone.This time around? I still recommend this game. But the game has been, currently is, and will surely still BE equal parts fun and frustration. I no longer recommend you wait for updates. I recommend you wait for when it's on sale.			"

												I really want to recommend this and if the game is updated again, and meets criteria, I will.Combat is really bad, especially compared to Terraria. Even in singleplayer I have lag. It's heavily melee focused (the weakpoint of terraria combat) and it's bad. Your movement is way more restricted than in Terraria, feels way worse and less fluid. A lot of moves don't let you combine them and you can't have more than a few movement abilities (which can't combine ofc).Basically combat/movement -> worse than terraria in every way.Boss fights involve holding down left click at long range and jumping when they shoot. Actual story mission bosses are a lot better.Your friends AI is really inconsistant and sometimes sits there and does nothing.No map + have to search entire towns for quest givers. Huge pain in some town layouts.Generic quests often SUCK. Like comon Chucklefish- ESCORT MISSIONS?! Nobody likes escort missions! And the AI is so terrible it will just jump into spikes and die.. which doesn't even make sense because the AI is capable of navigating.Farm missions - okay idc but boringGather missions - okay idc but boringKill missions - The only good ones but because boss fights are boring (as stated above) still boringFinally, the way money works really segments how the game plays out. I know you guys really like the idea of losing money when you die but it really hurts the pacing of the game. You get put into positions where you don't want to take on dangerous missions because you have a lot of money on you- so you save up until you can spend it and that takes forever and you're not getting money from dangerous (read as- fun) missions. Encourages slow paced, boring playstyle. Really bad.Terraria had a much better system- you just lose the money (could have been ore too, would have been fine) you have on you. Gives a risk/reward for staying out longer in the field but doesn't ever give you a reason to not enter the field.Also.. inventory managment is missing features Terraria had for a long time. You're gunna give us inventory loss but no way to auto deposite items in chests? You're gunna make us water crops by hand? You're gunna make us replant that carrot seed every single time without auto placement like in terraria?Come on guys. You can have all these features but when it boils down to it, the majority of the game should be the fun bits- not the boring ones.			"

								Dear developers, I have a proposal for you: Seeing that you have little to no interest in continuing to develop this game, seeing that with every iteration you happen to make Starbound worse, I'd suggest a change of approach. Make this into a stable platform for mod-developers to create all the content. This means that you do not implement new features and that you remove things like quests. They suck, let them be re-done properly by modders. Focus on optimizing this game. Where I ran this at 60FPS on an old laptop when it first came out, I now sometimes get 20-40FPS on a GTX 950. Focus on making modding even easier and prevent mods from breaking with each of your versions.And if you do not wish to continue with this project at all, since by now you pretty much depleted the pool of potential buyers, why not make this open source for other people to complete?

								Starbound is a very fun game that will be played for hours or even days, the game gets updates very slow  but is very very fun after the last few updates its turned in to pure awesome, I feel the devs should keep on working and try to add as much more as they can before they run out of ideas.

												Played this a lot during the Early Access period, then put it aside until the 1.0 release. Picked it back up and discovered that while the story and the setting had been revamped, the mechanics had devolved into pure tedium. Maybe mods will eventually restore some of the earlier mechanics and UI features that helped inject an element of fun into this slogfest, but nothing will help the floaty controls or endless repetition that ultimately wind up defining the overall experience.I regret supporting this product.

								I was told this was basically Terraria in space, but upon playing it is so much more. It has a beautiful and exotic game world full of planets with randomly generated biomes, you'll never see the same type of forest twice. Random generation in the game as a whole is really good, even enemies are randomly generated. The music is amazing and relaxing (leagues above Terraria IMO) and the graphics are still classy 2D. The game itself is pretty much pure magic even in its beta stage.			"

								People call this an overglorified Terrarria. It is, its not worth the time and honestly it has alot of potential, but the devs really screwed up. The controls are confusing, the first boss is a Penguin in a UFO, that hard to beat unless you have a bunch of good stuff. Mining is impossible since ores are so far and few between. You never know which animals want to be friends or eat you, so getting jumped by fluffy monsters is really misleading. After the first 20 minutes you sit back and wonder ""Why the bloody hell am I playing this, back to CS:GO""			"

								Every part of this game is amazing.Imagine for a second if you could take every problem in Terraria - from minor to massive - and fix those problems. Then, add a nearly immeasurable amount of extra content, throw in a spaceship, and give the player a story to follow, in a world that allows them complete freedom of action, and you have only begun to scratch the surface of Starbound.Every time I try and think of a place to start on a review of this game, I get stumped. The sheer volume of content to cover is almost overwhelming, and every part of it is delicious. Even in it's current state (beta as of this writing), it is amazingly polished, and tons of fun. In the two days I've had access to this game, I've logged 34 of those 48 hours playing Starbound. Anyone who knows how picky I can be about games will appreciate what that means.Don't wait. Buy this. Buy this game right now, play it, and never look back. You will not regret it!			"

												It lost somewhere in development the old spirit. There's now a main story that keeps you playing. Or at least tries to. No more easy exploring and discovering new, strange, and deadly planets. You have to complete the first 'real' quest to get your ship's warp engine working. That means you need to grind through the first planet's ground to craft you an armour and a better weapon. If you don't do it, you will face many painful deaths in the mining facility. I warned you!I spent 55 hrs in early access and enjoyed every single second of that time. Now, after the release version 1.0 hit Steam, I spent 2.5 hrs in Starbound and regret at least 2 hrs.All the game would need for my pleasure is a 'Free Play' mode out of the box. Until then I wont recommend it unless you're looking for a game with a mediocre story and borderline annoying boss fights. On the bright side are the lovely art style, exploration and great possibilities in building your own settlement which, and I'm very sure about that, will need your help.

												I wanted to give Starbound an immediate recommendation as soon as it came out of beta, but it's changed over the years.Chucklefish dumbed it down over time until its formula became an extremely stale version of that of its older brother (Terraria): a series of boss fights with filler content between them. Starbound's filler content consists of relatively dull mining (extremely tedious before you start upgrading your matter manipulator and getting crucial basic techs) and walking around in NPC villages looking for randomly-selected pieces of furniture that push you closer to unlocking a boss battle.The techs and more important pieces of gear you unlock don't feel as ""embraced"" or balanced as they do in Terraria. Your first grappling hook will make many of the game's puzzles completely trivial, but most of the alternate techs are useless or very mild variations of the original ones. A shield will make the game infinitely easy compared to using a two-handed weapon (which may have a somewhat-useful ability that pales in comparison to a shield's ability to keep you alive), but it makes the game more monotonous.Starbound should not be considered a ""survival"" game in any way. There is a hunger bar in its standard game mode (""survival""), but food is incredibly easy to keep up with regardless of how you do so. It becomes nothing more than a passive healing buff you should maintain (but can easily afford to forget for 5-10 minutes), not a critical concern. Other survival elements, such as overheating, radiation, and cold (actually, that's all of them) have been turned into simple equipment checks (do you have this special backpack? No? Then come back to this new planet when you do). The colony system might have been what kept me hooked, but it boils down to doing fetch quests over and over again just to make merchants sell more things (that are typically garbage) or regular colonists to join your crew (who tend to get in the way more than help). Your colonists are effectively invincible pieces of walking furniture that emote and give you money every now and then. You don't have to do anything to maintain them, and they don't help you outside of giving you money (which is already easy to come by because you'll constantly be selling useless outmoded weapons). Colonists do not starve, become thirsty, or interact with farms (animals or plants). Speaking of farms, there is no way to automate them at all.I would say the game is still worth a positive review, but the 1.0 release caused the game to stutter/lag for me constantly (which causes various issues, mainly ""teleporting"" enemies), plus the aforementioned dullness. I might try mods, but only after the performance issues are fixed.			"

												What have they done to the game I loved?I used to love this game, sure I did not play it much, but the amount I did play was beautiful. But when they released the game offically out of early access they changed it, it doesn't even feel like the game I loved anymore. They added a horribly dull plot, removed so much content that so many people loved, revised the HUD system and how it works even though everyone was content with the old one, and ontop of that changed and removed so much other content that people loved. This is not the game I bought in early access. This is not the game I used to love. It feels like a different game using the same engine. If I knew this is where starbound, the game I loved over all others similar to it, would go I would have never bought it all those years back.

Honestly, i'd choose it over GTA5!So at first my frined showed me this and i just wrote it off as a terraria copy. But he convinced me to get it. Whcih was the best decision EVER!! I played it for the first time and i couldn't stop! IT's addicting, FUN, time-wasting. Over all its just amazing. But.. it does have it's issues. sometimes when i leave it open in a closed tab, it crashes.  Sometimes EVEN IN GAME.I thought it was just me but my friends have the same issue. But also, it's completely fine because the auto-save in this is the best! It doesn't tell you when it saves but everytime i crash, it loads up from the same place. Anyway, you should definitly get this. I give it a 8.7/10. It's not perfect, but it's still just great :)			"

												TL;DR: Do NOT buy this game in full price, since it might not work at all. This only aplies to some players but I am one of them.So. This game worked fine before the final release. 1.0 It broke the game for me and many others. The road untill this point has been rocky. I backed the game the moment I head about it ( I am a huge fan of Terraria ) and played pretty much whenever a new big patch came out. The last year was a pain since the devs were hopping around different ideas. I would say what I think about the current build, but like I said its not working for me. I will edit this to a better and a complete review after CF or someone in the community fixes this game up.			"

												Starbound does a lot of things well, or at least acceptably well.  Unfortunately, it fails in one of the most basic and critical ways, which is providing good controls.To be clear, when I say a lot of things, I don't mean everything but the controls.  There's a lot of other problems with this game - the very shallow pool that the procedural generation draws upon, the grind and repetition, and the fact that the game tries to both be a survival/building game and a classic platformer and fails to be really good at either.

								Starbound can be summed up in one simple word. Wow.A sort-of follow up from Terraria, Starbound is the master of one-upmanship. It takes everything that made Terraria great; the survival, the crafting, the world, the music, everything and simply one-ups it every single time. Rather than having an expansive vivarium to traverse, Starbound gives you an entire universe. Travelling in your ship, planet hopping from galaxy to galaxy is just...breathtaking. This game has more content than some AAA games to date, it's teaming with life and places just begging to be explored.Player freedom is also more prominent in Starbound. You choose everything from your race, to the very planet you choose to call home. The game does follow a main quest line, but the player is free to complete this however (and whenever) they want. The game tells you what to do, but in the most subtle ways possible, so I wasn't feeling lost after the first hour of gameplay. Bulding is also much easier and less time consuming than it was in Terraria. Rather than place single blocks, you can now ""paint"" buildings quickly and more precisely. Crafting too is also much easier, resources are scattered across planets depending on their biomes, which can make the retrival of which rather time-consuming. Starbound is simply amazing, and for an Early Access game, it's so far been behaving itself. You should buy this game. Now.+ A HUGE leap from Terraria, almost every aspect is improved.+ So much content. Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of exploration.+ Very player friendly, UI is easy to access and work.+ Flawless soundtrack. Perhaps the best I've ever heard.- A few minor bugs, nothing too serious (yet.)9.5/10.			"

First off most of the things they added I already had from mods so it really added nothing speical to my gameplay expirence, but they did add some new things that didn't do much. First off now you have a ship A.I that doesn't do anything other then spit out ""Fetch this material so you won't be stuck on the first planet"" quests and the new race the novakids which doesn't add a whole lot more to the game.With this ""big"" update nothing has really changed most of the stuff they added you could have gotten from mods. So in short I think if you want the game wait until they release the full game but I think that won't be happening.			"

												This game has been a bonsai tree. It started out very unrefined with great potential, and throughout Early Access it was pruned. There were moments in EA where it was beautiful. But no, it needed more pruning they said. Snip snip snip! Sorry, did you like that feature? Whoops. This happens alot with Early Access games. Why do I not recommend this game? I don't think you should pay $15 for a twig. That's what it is now. It's straight and narrow, just like progress through this game. The sandbox features are the dirt this twig is shoved into. What a shame that it came to this, but too much pruning for too long has led to this.P.S. Personal rant: Most of the developers were agreeable, but the few that were hostile to criticism totally soured the whole process. I hope that those individuals will learn to accept criticism in the future, otherwise they are doomed to alienate people with good ideas and constructive feedback.			"

												I can't recommend this game. I have been playing it and trying to have fun, but I'm just not. It's too grindy. Mining takes forever and it isn't fun. The monsters look great, they all look different, but they all act exactly the same, and combat isnt fun either. There are a ton of weapons, but just holding a spear out and poking things to death is the best thing to combat the real monster: lag. The world loading is slow as well, once you get the sprint ability you will outrun the world gen and you might as well not have been sprinting. The movement in the game is painful, double jump feels heavy.The game is beautiful, it is fun seeing the towns and cities that you encounter, even though they are just set pieces. They have no depth. I also want a reason to build something. There are so many blocks and so much potential, but I'd rather just shove everything in a chest in my ship and just place the crafting stations down. I want to have fun with this game. I want to love it. I had more fun when it first came to steam a few years ago. I hope the devs will continue working on it and make the game fun, because it definitely has the potential and the bones of a fun game, but the implementation right now is dull. The game just isn't very fun right now.			"

Written in 2014I'd say this game, Starbound, is a good one. It brought me tons of fun in the first 20/30 hours. But soon I got to the very end of the game, tbh I was quite disappointed. Given that this game's still in early access, this seems not to be a problem. The problem is, ages have passed since its last update. It's been quite a long time for an EA-state game without a single update in several months. Therefore, I do not recommend it. It is fun to play but not the one I thought it would be.Edited in 2016I used to love Terraria so much, so I thought I'd love Starbound too, cuz imo, this game should be a big advance. But it failed me and it will do it again when released. Its idea's still fascinating, but we've already waited too long hoping it can finally turn out to be the game we desire. It failed us and Starbound atm is like nothing but a combination of pieces o' crap.TL;DRScrew you devs! I'm out.			"

												One day, you and your friends are enjoying an excursion in the woods when you stumble across a solitary cave. Outside stands a fish; he chuckles and beckons you closer. When you approach, he regales you with stories of adventure and of entire worlds to discover beneath the depths of the earth. What mysteries does this cavern's depths contain? What secrets could you unfurl? You and your crew could know, for the low price of $15.Titillated, you hand over the money one person at a time until you've all entered the cave. Heart pounding with excitement, you light a torch and hold it aloft, illuminating the cavern with a saffron glow. Grinning, you stalk into the darkness, and grinning grins of their own, they follow you.Several feet in, you come to descry the visage of what appears to be a solid rock face; a dead end. Obfuscated, you give it a nudge. It doesn't move. You try again with your shoulder, but this attempt is just as futile as the last. You issue a mighty roar, bringing your foot against it, and a patina of dust glides off the surface. You watch the wall with expectance. Nothing. Sighing, you motion to your friends, and they approach.You and your friends spend the next several hours pushing, kicking, and attempting to shove the wall down. At one point you hear the din of metal, and look over to see your friend using a pickaxe; you don't remember where or when he got it, but ultimately he's not making any progress - the wall is completely indestructable. Finally, you decide to take a break. You lean back against the cool stone and squeeze your eyes shut, the sweat trickling down your face. You're beginning to realise that it was all a farce. There was no adventure, nor mysterious depths, nor secrets to be uncovered here - and there never was.You call to your friends to cease their efforts, and grudgingly they comply. When you again reach the outside, the sky has grown dark and there's no trace that the fish had ever been there. Furious, you squeeze your hands into fists until your nails bite into your palms, until you can just begin to feel your warm blood beginning to trickle. ""Are you alright?"" your friend enquires, placing a reassuring hand on your shoulder.""Yeah, it's nothing,"" you reply, avoiding his gaze.Turning away from him, you gaze off into the woods. Somewhere out there in that ebon expanse is a fish, chuckling merrily as he's several dollars richer and your group is several dollars poorer. In your mind, you can still hear his chuckle; it repeats itself endlessly, and you know from this moment on, that sound will haunt you for the rest of your life. You'll wake screaming in the dead of night, the sound limpid as the memories of your crushed dreams harry you again; you'll be sitting by a pond on a sunny day when the sight of a lone fish sends you sprawling away in terror; you'll be telling a joke and one of your friends will laugh, and that laugh will remind you of that fateful day - that one fateful day, where you and your friends were blithe and stupid enough to listen to that fish...that one...sordid...chuckle fish!

EDIT:As to my actual reasons for why I dislike this game, read on:I found it to be a shallow, poorly balanced experienced. Terraria benefits from having everything hand-crafted, making it a game with a lot of depth and replayability; you can always come at it from a different angle, find something new.In Starbound, depth is a veneer of procedurally generated content often with no rhyme or rhythm. In Terraria, what you choose to pursue in terms of armor, weapons and accessories is a strategic decision: Do I want to be a tankier, more melee-oriented character, or do I want to be more ranged-based -- maybe I could be a mage? In Starbound, it's a roll of the dice: Does this randomly-generated shotgun named 'The Poopstick' that I could purchase for several hundred coins have better stats than my starting sword? Usually, in my experience, the answer is no.I've also found exploration to be lacklustre. I can dig all the way to the center of the planet and find basically nothing, or if I do, it's a tiny little cave with some pixel containers in it. Never do I find chests containing valuable loot, or dangerous dungeons with some high-tier rewards at the end. Once I dug down really far and found an underground temple/pyramid-type structure, and inside I found absolutely nothing; some breakable pots and a container that was totally empty. I once flew far away to this snow-covered planet, finding a high-tech base with a laser-guarded room, guards that had automatic rifles and snipers that could one shot me, et cetera. I made my way around this base, sneaking past the guards, opening all the containers I could find. You know what I got? Some furniture and some stims, and some other miscellaneous stuff that's basically useless. Terraria rewards exploration, but in Starbound, you might as well not even bother.There's also no reason to do any base-building, as most planets are identical. And most of the time you're going to be flying around in your ship anyways, so it's not like there's a reason to settle down. You go to a planet, find what (little) there is to find, and move on. The game allows you to collect furniture and materials to build with, but gives you nothing to do with them. Why am I going to settle down on one planet as opposed to another? I might as well just throw everything in my ship; at least the game spawns me there.There's a whole bunch more stuff; I could talk more about the lack of interesting procedurally generated content, the floaty combat, the starting quest you have to do that takes way too damn long (a good sandbox game should just drop you in and allow you to do whatever you want; forcing you to do this tutorial quest where you've gotta go through this colony and then fight this giant boss at the end is extraneous and tedious).Anyways, that's just my opinion and it's all right if people dissent. It's been several updates since I've played, so maybe they've fixed some of the issues I've listed. I can just say that, for me, I've not found it to be a worthwhile experience.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: THIS REVIEW IS OUT OF DATE! DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COLONIZATION CHANGES!Starbound is almost a good game. I actually enjoy it, mostly. Surprisingly, it's gotten worse in many ways as time has gone on.I won't speak about bugs in detail, because it's early access, and there really aren't any gameplay bugs that cause any trouble, mostly. The game runs better now than it did a long time ago, but as far as playability goes there, little has changed. Main problem is that it not infrequently hangs/crashes when trying to start the game.The graphics are nothing spectacular. They get the job done, which is good enough for me. Nothing looks bad, doesn't impact your ability to play, so no problems there.The audio is also nothing special. The music is fine, though the sound effects are a bit limited. Nothing problematic here.The controls are fine, but it doesn't behave like you may expect it to at first.  But, the controls work, haven't had any problems actually playing the game. Fully responsive, fairly simple, can just start it up and play, more or less.The interface is pretty awful, I'm afraid. Menus can be moved around on screen, but more often than not, closing and re-opening a menu results in the menu appearing in the default location, which is highly irritating, and makes accomplishing basic inventory management(crafting/placement of objects) frustrating. Tooltips do not exist for interface aspects, and the tooltips for items are not very useful(although that's due in part to the fact that many items are almost identical to eachother). There's a query tool which is equally useless; next to nothing has a unique description, and nearly all descriptions contain zero information.  I will say that the interface DOES WORK, however. There are almost never problems with actually accomplishing a menu-related task. Buttons work, no bugs to speak of. Just frustrating and lacking descriptions. Partly an early-access issue.Broadly speaking, the mechanics of the game are good. Basically identical to Terraria, but lacking polish. Sadly, below the surface of things, the mechanics are unfortunate. Combat is depressing, as the enemies lack any real diversity, and the damge dealt by enemies is VERY badly balanced. Sometimes you'll be dying in one hit, sometimes you'll be immortal, with nothing actually creating that distinction except on a per-planet basis. Item progression is very badly implemented, and has only gotten worse as the game has developed. Simply, don't expect to get much out of your time spent. You are unlikely to improve your equipment in a timely manner. That's including the craftable items, and finding weapons in chests, etc. Progression is simply far too slow. There's now a questing system, which is unspectacular. NPCs will ask you to do menial tasks, like most games. The game contains farming, which is massively over-simplified:  hit ground with hoe, plant seed, harvest crop within minutes(or less...), literally no other steps. One major change to things is mining tools; originally, picks/drills were EXTREMELY annoying to craft(vast quantities of materials), and required a progression of upgrades. They also had durability, but could be repaired at any time using various ores(to varying levels of effect, depending on the ore), including once the durability reached zero(could use the item still, but to basically no effect).  Now, however, picks are simple to craft, but BREAK when their now-massively-reduced durability runs out, and they can no longer be repaired(as far as I have seen). And believe me, they break VERY quickly.Once upon a time, it was possible to see every tier of item(but not every item, mind you) inside 6-10 hours of dedicated grinding, which included fighting bosses and going to new planets to find better materials to craft with. In the most recent incarnation, a couple of hours may not even get you to a new star system(or even another planet...), and almost certainly won't let you see beyond the first tier of items. There's also the issue of the total lack of incentive to build anything on-world, even with the now-halted progression. Upgrading your ship will allow you to simply put whatever you like on your ship(which isn't inherently bad), negating any real motivation to ""colonize"". Basically, you'll feel trapped in the beginning, but still have no motivation to actually DO anything on the world you're trapped on. Planets basically exist to be looted, and that's it. You CAN build if you want to, but it'd be purely for your own amusement.-----Summary:The game is almost good. It has all of the groundwork for a good game, but is crippled by the fact that the developers seem uninterested in actually focusing on any particular aspect of the game(that is, they won't complete anything). It has essentially no major problems except for the fact that it takes way too bleedin' long to get anything done, and there isn't anything to even do. If the devs decide to actually complete some of the parts of the game, it'll probably be good. Sadly, there are appear to be philosophical problems in this game's development. They seem to have abandoned the storyline idea in favor of...nothing.I expect that the good parts of the game will get better, and the bad parts will not be improved. I won't say that no one should play this game. It can be fun, still. Maybe one day I can actively recommend the game, but as it stands, it gets boring very quickly. The game's at least an 8/10, but lacks staying power.			"

												So... I've played this game before it was fully realeased. It was... alright, to say the least. Now it is... alright yet again, just a bit better.The thing that made me buy it was space, and the fact it has exploration and sandbox features. I always wanted to have a sandbox game where I can do whatever the hell I want in the infinite universe, and Starbound is that game.""Then why do you give this game a negative review?"" You might ask.Let me first tell you what's great about this game:1. You have your own spaceship where you can travel wherever you want;2. There is some nice variety in planets, monsters, biomes, weapons etc.;3. There's the story, which isn't really deep or complex in quests, but it's good IMO;4. Each race has history and culture... except for Novakids but that's because they don't care about history;5. There is a lot of stuff to upgrade, collect, buy etc.;6. You can play on instruments and form a band;7. A lot of other things I don't remember...Now with the issue that just makes me get bored in this game really quickly:...I honestly don't know. I just don't want to build anything. Just a thought of it demotivates me from playing, so does collecting stuff because I know that stuff like fish or cooking collections will just end up being a chore.I didn't even get myself to decorate my ship. All I did was to upgrade it to maximum size and then just left it half empty...I keep trying to guess what deters me from building in this game. Maybe the game is too small? Maybe there are too much furniture to pick from? I don't know... And I have the similar issue with Terraria, though there I also have issue with how it is unfriendly towards newbies (more on that in my Terraria review).Now, it was a hard choice between recommending the game or not. My personal experience is just slightly more towards no, but that's just me.If you had similar issues in Terraria, then you will only have fun doing main quests, you'll get bored after that. If you play Terraria a lot though then by all means buy it, you won't regret it.Now for those non-Terraria players. If you like space and exploration, then I guess you'll like this game. If you are also creative and like building, then you should give it a try. "

Early Access Review
								I will start off by saying that I never played Terrarria before, so my closest experience was Minecraft. I was overexcited when I started the game and begun building my first shack, then I decided to explore my new homeplanet (as apparantly Earth got destroyed). First, I have encountered an well-guarded prison with extreme level of detail, which I decided to clean up. I walked further and found some ancient ruins, which led to my first gold ingot. As I went further I got more and more excited... and then I walked into my home from the other side - end of the planet.From my personal point of view, planets are very different and each flora and fauna is unique (though frankly, every planet is habitable). Any Star Trek admirer will appreciate some visual similarities to the worlds from the original series. However, each planet falls a bit short. In my opinion, it would be great to have at least a few ""special places"" on each planet. Equally, until I have crafted a Platinum pickaxe, I was ocassionally getting a bit bored while mining the more or less ""advanced"" resources.I guess one of the best parts of this game is that you can actually travel to other planets on your spaceship and you can do it with your friend through multi-player :) Many people complain about absence of LAN, but according to several sources, the game developers are working on introduction of local network cooperation.Enjoyable and it gets extremelly addictive once you find out how to travel to other planets and constillations! Happy hunting! :)			"

I intially bought this game to pass time while waiting for No Man's Sky but i kinda enjoy this game much more than i expected.

Product received for free
												What gets to me is the way the story/main quest is structured.Scan some decorations, do a dungeon. Repeat 4 times. Open the gate and [not available in nightly]. I'm sure that when it releases and all the lore books (now PGIs) are available, it would make it a bit more interesting. But as it is, relying on a bunch of text to make it more interesting is not the best approach. I'd much rather experience some things, it IS a game after all - albeit a sandbox.My problem with the game's flow is that it's kinda bland. And unless whatever's behind the gate acts like a Wall of Flesh, ushering in all new monstrosities and gear, it's kinda meh.That, along with the fact that the fantastic structures are inhabited by painfully obvious RNG scripts (I won't dignify them with the term AI).I feel that, if Starbound - with it's myriad of races and architecture - were a proper RPG, I might enjoy it much more. As it is, the main quest is 5 dungeons, and the settler quests are just RNG fetch/kill quests without any real narrative or reason to them.Not to mention there's only 7 armors in the game, of which 3 are stat side-grades, and all the rest race-specific are re-skins; and all found/dropped armor is always stat-less cosmetic stuff as well... I don't know, the game just seems like it's made for social-minded people to screw around in. I'll give it a token play-through when it's launched, but I'm not holding my breath or anything.			"

								Dear developers: stop making teaser blogs and videos. After a year of no meaningful updates and half your staff leaving, it's not teasing - it's taunting your customers. This game starts with an early grind that is unnecessary, then never delivers the variety it promises. After you've done the first planet, you've more or less seen it all. Oh you'll develop new tools and new materials, but only to match the grind of the planets on an endless treadmill. Occasionally interesting set-pieces on the planets are not enough to raise this game above mediocrity.			"

The only difference between them is their character cosmetics, their ship cosmetics, their useless cosmetic pet and their armours.

												Note: The 2000 hours played is a result of early release play, where having a server online counted towards your time played. I hosted a server for friends and family. My play time is closer to 60-80 hours, dispersed between releases over the game's development period.Definitely not the game originally promised - reeks of the developers growing disinterested and trying to push it out the door to get it over with. I followed this game from it's inception, all the way to release, playing at different points in its development. The only thing that makes this game worth more than a few hours' time worth of gameplay, are mods. And even after that, the game easily loses its lackluster. I echo the sentiments of others:- The main storyline is repetitive and boring.- A lot of the systems feel unfinished or stunted and aren't fun.- They seem to have cut features in order to push out this 1.0 release without much communication about why or how.- No incentive to revisit planets or play with a group of people.I had high hopes for this game, but I was sorely disappointed.

												Back during the Koala build all the way to Upbeat Giraffe, Starbound became a game of its own, with new ideas and improvng on older concepts, but the closer it got to release, the more restrictive, unimaginative, and confining it became, forcing players into a route, or ""play style"" in order to be able to enjoy some, or most features. It has now released with a clunky, washed off and forgettable story; as of yet there is no way to skip cutscenes of said story other than the intro. Starbound has been improved in some ways, but has been severely set back on others, and it has become a sluggish sandbox with very weak rpg elements.As someone who played this game since 2013, I am not entirely disappointed with the product. However its discouraging to play as is, and thus cannot honestly recommend it. Although if you are able to enjoy the story and progress its stages, this is an enjoyable sandbox in the end.			"

												The community is fairly divided on Starbound because many people that have owned it for years have seen it regress over time. I'll try to put this into perspective for those that are unfamiliar with the game's development history.Imagine that Minecraft is still in early access and you haven't played it in a while. After a prolonged period of time, a large update is released, so you go to check out how the game has changed. To your surprise, the developers have removed The Nether (the dimension that looks like Hell) and all the materials and crafting recipes that went along with it. They replace it with a crappy, linear platformer level where you are required to jump over subsequent pits of lava, with a time limit of a minute or so, to get some crappy prize, like a few mushrooms or a bucket or something. After searching for several hours without any luck, you discover on an online forum that diamonds and the associated crafting recipes are all gone. Instead, the developers have implemented a new kind of ore that is functionally identical to iron, but has a different color and allows you to craft iron items with that color instead of the normal color. Upon exploring underground, you notice there are WAY MORE underground structures than there used to be, each one being just a few meters away from each other, and that there are only 3-4 different types of underground structures... like the entire underground world is just a mosaic of these repetitive structures! In fact, they are so abundant now that the randomly generated caves are almost missing from the game because there is no room for them to exist.You begin to scratch your head. You wonder why the developers would make these types of changes and why it took 6 months to do so. You notice that the entire community is also upset about these changes and that the number of people that like the new direction is nearly zero. Another 6 months go by and another major update is released. You check it out with the hopes that the developers listened to the players' complaints and reinstated some of the old content, or to see if any of the new content is worthwhile. Instead of reinstating diamonds, there are now 5 types of iron, again, functionally identical, just of 5 different colors. But now in order to unlock iron recipes, you now need to find a village and complete 10-12 'fetch quests' for the villagers. FOR EACH NEW GAME, you are now REQUIRED to spend 2-3 hours at the start catching fish, baking cakes, collecting wood, etc. to fullfill these quests before you can aquire recipes for iron items. Also, the Ender Dragon has been removed from the game entirely... for seemingly no reason at all, and isn't replaced with anything new or any new use for the Ender dimension.Now, if it were your first time playing Minecraft, would you find this updated game fun? I think so... probably... I guess....? But for many that have been around for a while, it's almost painful to play the recent releases of the game. Almost every single example I gave for the theoretical Minecraft development scenario pertains to some analogous change that was made in Starbound over the years with very spread out updates. From many user reviews, I see development updates summarized as ""one step forward, two steps back"". This really isn't an exagerration. It isn't just a bunch of content-hungry impleasable fans whining about nothing. It's been unfortunate, confusing, and painful to witness this game's development over the past few years. I hope new players that just purchased the game can enjoy their purchase, but I pity them for not being able to experience the version I loved 2-3 years ago. I pity all of us for never being able to play the game we envisioned would be the final release. It's almost as if whoever developed the game until 2012-2013 sold it off to a disorganized team of complete amatuers, who just screwed up the appeal and balance of them game. What really set this game apart from Terraria, Minecraft (and countless others) was the appeal of uncovering the unknown, and the promise for expansion in this direction. Minecraft and Terraria have more/less one world you can play in that becomes knowable in a few hours, whereas in Starbound, you were always excited to find out what the next planet would be like, what types of secrets it would hold. This is the partly why Star Citizen has raised over 115 million USD. It's why the new Mass Effect game is bringing back and expanding upon the planet exploration concept. It's why we are all eager to see how No Man's Sky turns out. This is what drove us to play Starbound, but even in beta, it never felt complete. This aspect, the most promising and differentiating aspect of Starbound, was simply never completed. In fact, it was 'benched'/reduced for game elements that nobody wanted, such as a linear, mundane quest line.			"

												Gonna copy what a guy already said online because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he made every point correctly.The game started out with an intresting premise. Multiple differenct races each of them explore space for its own reason with its own goals, it's own allied and enemy races, its own tech and it's own special abilities, exploring to find the reason why they left their planet in the first place.Sounds intresting no?Well, what we got now is everyone is happy, everyone is united, no conflict, part of a united federation type deal, all races are the exact same with the only differences being cosmetic and plot devolved to ""Cthulu is coming to kill us because he hates all life, we must unite (despite being already united) and kill him!""Since beta from more than half the special abilities or techs (like nullifying gravity, flying, teleporting, FTL dashing, mechs ect) in the game got gutted for no reason at all, the game went back to use a terrible ""Damage on contact"" combat system.Also, in the 4 years that it has been out the devs never gave a ♥♥♥♥ to properly optimize it so it'll run at more than 10 frames per second on gaming PCs.

WTF-Can't adjust controls-Fullscreen system is a bit wonky-You are able to hurt people who help you, in which the first thing you think it's an enemy, but in reality you just killed an NPC.-Missing item descriptions-Lag spikes occasionally, even when on single player, when damaging a hostile, it freezes for a sec then resumes.Wouldn't play this when bored.

								Having played Starbound from the bare bones beginnings to now, when it's almost ready for release, I think it's fair to say that Chucklefish has well worked up to the hype. The storyline has grown to be far more enriched, with truly challenging bosses (no more digging underground and shooting the boss from where they can't reach you), and a crazy awesome amount of new biomes, from creepy hive biomes in total darkness to swamp biomes complete with mute frog people. The addition of teleporters makes it very easy to set a home planet, or bookmark interesting biomes. Even if you don't want to settle down somewhere, you can expand your ship considerably and pimp it out however you like.If you're the kind that likes to build things, there are whole planets devoted to construction. If you usually game with your friends, the servers are getting much more consistent and well run. If you are the type that enjoys exploring on your own, the map is practically endless, so sally forth!I think most of the bad reviews this game received were from salty people who bought it early and gave up too quickly. Starbound is definitely worth trying on your own. :)			"

												The game feels boring now and exploration is just stale. Don't get me wrong,this game has great content. But In order to progress I have to scan items? Thats super boring, I don't feel like flying planet to planet to scan a bunch of objects. Ores are alot harder to find now. And the only thing I get for finishing quest are a bunch of reward bags, I like it when you used to get tech for completing quest and exploring but I can't do that.Dreadwing is super hard to fight. I can't even beat him. And the crafting is just trash.			"

												Edit: My immense game time comes from playing and replaying with every new iteration over the entire course of it's beta, and mods, both things which are not taken into account for this review because they're not a part of the v1 core releaseStarbound is a Terraria clone set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away with 7 different playable races all with their own theme and a range of different paths you can take to ultimately reach the end game content: you can farm, mine, fight, colonise and/or explore, and the game allows all this diversity through pixels, the games' money, and the Outpost, a location you must go to early game where everything relevent to advancing the game can eventually be bought there, i.e. the metal bars shop. Also there are other shops there, and they have their uses, but you'll probably visit these shops once or twice, get what you need from them and then forget about them, excepting the colony shop if you're colonising, but even then you'll only go there for the essential colony deeds.So being released 5 years after Terraria it must have some improvements, right? Sure, like how it removed the dedicated background blocks and just made it so you can place blocks in the background, and gives the opportunity to find ores in the background instead of just in the foreground, the matter manipulator is an era appropriate upgradable high-tech dream compared to picks, axes, hammers and buckets, upgrading crafting benches feels good and is visable from the begining giving you clear goals to progress further up the tech sapling, making buildings is fast and the end result can look amazing with so many different blocks with a wide range of themes to pick from, the hotbar feels good to use since items sit there virtually instead of physically allowing you to have a single item in multiple loadouts, the missions are a nice bit of flavour pitting you against unique bosses, 2-handed weapons all have some cool secondary ability that adds some flavour to fighting enemies, and damage is upgraded mainly through armour, which allows you to find a cool and unique weapon and continue using it all the way through the rest of the game; later weapons have a higher base damage than ones you'll find early, but there are unique pre-made weapons with fixed values instead of procedurally generated values that you can find at any point, can last you the rest of the game and don't feel overpowered because of this system.Now all that's well and good, but I can't help but feel it falls flat in so many instances. Enemies are lifeless and forgetable with the only challange in combat being how much health the monster has compared to how much damage you can do and it's made worse by the fact that EVERY procedurally generated mob does nothing but charge, an attack that involves walking up to the player, standing still for a second and then flinging themselves off the edge of whatever cliff you're standing in front of and is completely negated by simply hopping over them. The pre-made mobs are only a little better throwing their own unique attack in, but they only do the one thing and they all have this period of charging their attack that either gives ample time to set yourself up to dodge it or sprint up to them and whack them to death before they lightly dent your health. The only times combat becomes treacherous is early game when you're unarmoured and have no healing items, if you fall into a pit swarming with mobs or there are a large amount of hazardous blocks and you fall into them because of the floaty controls.Techs, which are additional options for mobility, have such a small selection and feel unimaginative: you've got 3 slots and each slot has 4 techs available, but after looking at them for 1 minute it's really easy to pick out the best for each slot and then forget there are any others at all. Then there's the EPP, an item that on the surface seems like a good idea but then you realise that its role used to be filled by a 4th tech slot and didn't utterly consume the back slot in favour of the light backpack, which is now literally useless because you're choosing between surviving at all on any planet with a hazardous environment and seeing easily in the dark. Use the flashlight? Hope nothing you use is 2-handed. Torches? That's an entire loadout slot because anything that requires the matter manipulator consumes both hands. I was expecting that the final upgrade for the EPP would smash it together with the light backpack, because, you know, that would make sense in a high-tech universe, but it didn't. Seriously, I have this all purpose handheld constructor/deconstructor, can make ground penetrating radar to find caves or ores and can make pokeballs but I can't stick a lightbulb on this thing that's supposed to help me survive in hazardous environments. There is so much irony in this because your AI even comments on how dangerous it is to walk around in the dark when you first make torches.All the quests are boring. Honestly, all of them. Do yourself a favour and save 10 minutes when you make a character and tick that little box to skip the intro quest because all you do is run right and watch cutscenes about a stupid area you'll never see again. It's a very pretty area, but that's it. All the other main quests are scan a lot of stuff belonging to a specific race that isn't ever Human or Novakid and hope there's enough in the area so you can just do the mission and progress. I can't complain much about the random quests, but that's just because they're all ""Do this specific thing for this specific NPC instead of for yourself"" with ""specific thing"" being something you'd normally do in the game, except for the one where they make you click on another NPC and then run back to the first which is ♥♥♥♥ING DUMB and has nothing to do with actually playing the game.The planetary procedural generation is trash, and once you've seen one planet of it's type you've seen them all except for whatever ""dungeons""/villages and mini-biomes happen to be scattered on it, which are all literal cut and paste, so once you've seen one the next time it appears on a planet you know where everything is in it they become predictable and dull.Please don't think that this is a bad game, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the time I've spent playing it, but as of the time of writing it's a game with a lot of missed potential and sloppy mistakes as evidenced by the modding community tweaking and overhauling aspects, adding cool vehicles and mechs but relying on mods doesn't make the game good, it means the mods are good. What the devs have ended up making is a solid base, a platform that I hope they continue to add depth to.			"

Early Access Review
								Sometimes it's a problem to be a massive fan of a game like Terraria, the 2D RPG-Platformer-Building masterpiece. I say this because the hunger for more similar games that meet the expectations often leaves me disappointed. There are so many Terraria clones out there that, plainly, suck balls. So when Starbound came along and it seemed to not suck like most clones, I really wanted to try it out.  Turns out that this clone does not suck, at all. It's difficult to innovate in this genre, because there is not a lot more to add to what Terraria has done. Starbound takes this to a new level: there are virtually infinite worlds to explore, as opposed to the one in Terraria. Granted, these are smaller, but the variety in them makes it incredibly satisfying to fly from one planet to another and find a completely different place, with different enemies and different loot to find.  The RPG aspect of Starbound is also top-notch. You can choose what race you want to be from a wide pallet and based on that the quest system and the upgrades for your equipment will be different. So yes, you have to play the game from scratch several times to enjoy all the content it has. And keep in mind that this version is still early access. It only gets better from here on.  I have to address also the fact that this game has been in early access for almost two years now. The developers are taking it slow, perhaps too slow. Take that into account when buying this game: the released product may be very different from what you will get now. But in the mean time, you can enjoy a game that takes Terraria and expands it to a whole universe. It's the same, but different at the same time. If you love Terraria, you will love Starbound. Maybe not as much, but it sure is enjoyable.			"

												This isn't a negative review where i don't like the game, more leaning in the direction of I don't like where the game went. before there was this emphasis on exploration, but a strange vagueness to it all that could be cleared up if you decided to pursue it without the game telling you you have too. Since 1.0, a half baked story starts you off holding your hand instead of just plopping you on a broken spaceship stranded above a planet (a scary scenario, and the game made you ask a lot of questions). And since 1.0, I can't even play the game, the performnce dropped so bad I was shocked, I wonder what happened...			"

Content lacking and poorly optimized release, nothing like Tiy promised. This game may look complex at first, but it is shallow and empty.I mean, this game is great if you wanna roleplay or something, because there's no real objective besides the main story as far as I know, everything you do after that is personal gratification.

								Do not buy this game. Plain and simple. You look at it, look at some of the reviews. It looks pretty hopeful, yes? It does. That's how I was tricked. This game has taught me to NEVER trust Early Access Games. Ever. The update schedual was a lie, I remember being told there would be updates almost everyother week before.. And that was right before there was nothing for almost a whole year. They promised us a brand new race, Novakids, and you can actually SEE it in the storepage. You can get a mod which makes them playable, as they are technically in the game's files, but the dev. team are working at a snail's pace.Hell, all they pretty much do now is say you should get mods. Because they aren't going to be updating it all that much soon. So if you don't mind waiting, say, three more years for the game to actually be done. Then get it now. Just know it's filled with bugs and it's novelty wears off after a few days when you realize you can't progress too far.			"

								The majority of criticism on Starbound comes from the incomplete nature of the game. However, this is to be expected, since the game is not fully complete, and each purchase of the game supports the developers and allows them to do more.The replayability is great, with 6 races that will each have their own storyline and billions of procedurally generated planets to explore; however, the frequency of updates is rather unstable, and playing the base game may get boring fast. There is a 'beta' option called Nightly, where you can access an extremely unstable build of the game that is updated almost every night, hence the name. Controls: 9/10 (After a bit of getting used to things, I found myself zipping along with my grappling hook and tech)Replayability: 8/10 (I think the planets ingame number in Quadrillions, actually.) Content: 6/10 (it's early access. Deal with it.)Simplicity: 8/10 (That's a pretty good score, it's biased since I play terraria and the controls are different)Melon Factor: 10/10 (It reminds me of terraria, and i've got good memories of terraria :P)Score: 41 out of 50, and that's for the game in progress. i'll have to redo this again after every major update. Pretty good game.			"

												I honestly love these types of games. 2d, sandbox, with a story. In fact, the story is why I bought this game. Which is why I have a refund pending. One word. Bosses. The bosses in Starbound are incredible, but are only fight able through the mission portal. The mission portal doesn't work for me. And I'm not the only one! On top of that, the newest update makes me not able to start the game sometimes, and I can't get five minutes of playing in without it breaking. I like this game, I really do! I just can't recommend this to anyone until these issues get fixed.			"

I got on once in a while to play with friends because they had just got it, but other than that I didn't touch it. I'd love to play this more, but the lack of content and the exciting promises that are taking way too long to implement is off putting.

Early Access Review
								As much as I love the idea of this game, I am sad to say that there are some technical aspects that keep me from having fun with it. The GUI is really clunky and gets in the way, and its design is not exactly intuitive. The quests seem really contrived to me. Various tools are harder to use than they need to be. Progress in the long-term (i.e. new planets, armor, equipment) and short-term (i.e. the matter manipulator, finding resources, completing quests) is really slow. The combat involves a lot of awkward hopping around because of how erratic the enemies move. The creature designs in this game are pretty good though, and it's truly a very pretty game. The character customization options are varied and distinct too, although that still has noticeable room for improvement. I'm still so-so about the story/lore aspects. Also, music! There's also musical instruments in this game and you can play your own music! Lots of musical instruments! Oh my god! It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to deal with .abc format though. Also, the music changing for combat just really isn't working out for me.All in all, there's a lot of things getting in the way of my honest desire to have fun with this game. That's what my issues really boil down to; it can all be summarized down to 7 words: there are too many things in the way. Terraria was beautiful in its simplicity, elegant in its design, and Starbound is elegant and beautiful only on the surface. Mechanically, there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out, and I hope by the time this gets out of early access, I can finally get the fun times I was hoping for, because whenever I jump back into this game, my experiences feel pointless and tedious. A 2D sandbox survival roleplaying game that is a direct successor to Terraria that takes things to the cosmic level is my wet dream, but Starbound just isn't quite there yet. I still have a lot more fun with Terraria. Starbound has tremendous potential, and it trumping Terraria seems like it should be a no-brainer, but in its current state, I think Terraria is still by and large the better, funner game.			"

								I bought this game on it's Steam release. I figured $15 would be well worth the time I'd spend playing it and all the wealth of content it would have in the future as the futuristic counterpart to Terraria.2 weeks short of a year later and I can't say I'm impressed. The game has barely moved forward and there is talk of a 1.0 release for this game which has less than half the content promised by the developers when I bought the game. As it stands Starbound is fun for a bit, but has little lasting appeal and replayability. It's not quite the better Terraria I was promised, but it's certainly not a bad game.I wish Starbound wasn't the game I have to say made me wary of Early Access, but unfortunately that's exactly what it did. If the devs ever end up putting everything they promised in the game make sure to wake me from my cryosleep and tell me what year it is.			"

												Starbound is one of my favorite games of all time, but is it finished? Not if you consider optimization an important part of a finished product. This game at version 1.0 runs so poorly on so many powerful systems (frame rates between 15-30 when it's raining, or if there's some fog, or if you're in a busy area) that I don't understand how the developers can sleep at night having released a game with these issues - after getting player feedback for ~3 years of Early Access. Sure, most of the time the game runs ""fine"" (at 60FPS), but it should run fine all of the time if you have a system well above the recommended specs.The game has other issues and design flaws but those can usually be fixed with mods. The poor performance can't and is unacceptable.I will keep playing this game and enjoy it immensely but I feel like I have to leave a negative review for the time being because the performance problems are so big.

												EDIT: 1.0 released. The care is long gone--Starbound is an unfinished game, and there is no grantee that it will ever be finished. Even if it is ever finished and reaches a 1.0 status release, I don't think it will ever be the game it was hyped up to be.While the game in the current state is playable and initially showed strong potential, development progress has come to a near standstill, and there are significant problems in the existing product. You might get 20 hours of play time from Starbound, but it doesn't have much replay value.Since the game was published as Early Access in 2013, there has been very little progress in game development, programmer (Bartwe) and artist (Rhopunzel) have left the company, and there have been a number of serious incidents which call into question the honesty and moral integrity of Tiy and his company. In mid-2014 there was a nine-month period with no updates at all. 2015 has been fairly similar.The amount of progress which has been achieved over the years is damningly small. This is a company that took in millions of US dollars in pre-orders and has at least a dozen staff members. What are they doing all day?Chucklefish has a blog where they show off development progress, but it's mostly PR and photoshop mockups. They hope to convince players that progress is really happening and that some day, the magical update of their hopes and dreams will arrive.There have been incidents in the past where they would publish updates which had wiped characters and destroyed items, ala the Feb 19th 2014 ""chest apocalypse"".The events including the repeatedly broken delivery date promises, Bartwe and Rhopunzel's departure, Omni's mass-banning incident, other censorship and community dishonesty issues, the nine months with no updates to the game, and other toxic community drama should scare any reasonable person away from this title.I've gone from hope to pessimism to just moving on and leaving it behind. Starbound will almost certainly never be the game I had hoped it would be.			"

												I can recommand this game to people I know. But i cannot publicly endorse this game anymore. It took 5 years to CF to ruin the game bits by bits. Hold your spite greasy fanboy, because i'm not writing this lightly. Sure right now the game may be good for someone who just drop-in and never played the alpha when they first released it. But if you did play the alpha and try to get back in the game now like i did, i bet there is a high chance you'll go full ""where's my fun gone ?"" like i did. Oh sure, it's no good to generalise things. Many people will be satisfied with it. Good for them. And here's my reasons why CF destroyed what was a great game ; ---The story is bad. And you should feel bad. ---It's pointless. There is no build up, no meanings, you litteraly can't risk or loose anything, boss AI is ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ape"" lvl and it can all be done in less than 3h. I couldn't care less about the npcs even tho i tried a lot. I know this is not the most important feature in a sandbox game but why do something silly and pointless that have no meanings or impacts when you could use that time to implement more things or boost others part of the game ? You know what i liked in the alpha ? If you wanted to know what the hell was happening you had to scavenge codexs or talk to npcs to get informations. Why not keep it that way ? Why try to push us to be ""the hero"" when there is so little in play ? Why not having ""The ruin"" ♥♥♥♥ up other planets across the universe so you really have a reason to go through the underwelming 30 lines of quests called ""Story"" ? That whole story thing is a total waste because it lack depths. It is minimalistic to the point it's irritating.---The sectors system was good. ---Yep it was. It added a sense of progress through the game. You had to ""upgrade"" if you wanted to go deeper into space. Now you just need to upgrade that cheap EPP and ... Tada. I've got the best armor and weapons to go with it, i upgraded everything, so what now ? Well, nuffin'. It felt good to ""go to sector X"" knowing that♥♥♥♥♥♥will get serious there. Now the map feel dull. Boring. Flat. Worst; unimaginative. I don't even want to scroll through it because i don't feel like it. The feeling of ""I want to explore that forbidden path now that the *ù^*ù% boss is dead"" is gone. Maybe it's just me but having sectors was a really good thing and a logical one. It added so much ""depth"" to the whole thing even tho it was just a hollow depth it was here. Now when i scroll the map i'm just ""meh"". ---The ""cheap"" ship upgrade thingy.---Hah! How pathetic. How weak to make upgrading your ship a pixel grindfest. You know who use such ways ? MMO's do. Just to keep you playing it till you got the shiny peeble you want. Grind. GRIND YOU MONKEY ! YOU WANT TEH BIG SHEEP ? GRIND THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's so desastrous that in a sandbox game where there is SO MANY items that could be used for upgrade instead of being fckng useless what you need to get for a better ""home"" (since the ship is your first home so to speak) is the main currency. Oh yeah, and those purple box you find everywhere. I guess this is how lazy you can get after 5 years of developping while people lick your butt everyday telling you you're doing good rekting something beautifull. I'm not even mad. I'm amazed at how opportunities are wasted here. ---The quests system---I did like 10 quests before it almost drove me mad to ALWAYS DO THE SAME STUPID ""FETCHING"" THING. Fetching. Another thing you guys took from MMO's. This is horrible. The worst part is that the rewards are terribly game breaking. Thanks to this system i almost never had to actually mine my ressources. I actually like doing quests in the game i play. But AGAIN there is no meanings. No impacts. You just go your bag full of ressources and that's all. I can see people arguing ""This is for people that doesn't want to mine but do quests and progress"". Well, you're dumb. It's like buying Terraria for it's storyline. Whoever thought it was a good system/good idea have little to no knowledge at all about how to do a good game. The way it is it just feel like ""hey look you can do quests for the npcs now lolz :))))))"" Welcome to the future of ten years ago. ---Hunger / Weather---Huehue. Food everywhere. Huehue. cheap EPP upgrade. There is no way to die of starvation unless you really try. There is no more problems with hot/cold when you upgrade your EPP. Those two features are dead. End of story. Did someone say ""Laziness"" ? ----------------------------------------------------I could go on and on about maaaany things that are broken/stupids/out of place but what i pointed out already are the main reasons i don't think i'm gonna play Starbound much anymore. So, what happened ? Where's the fun at ? Well i guess it's up to you to find your own fun when playing such game. Don't get me wrong, the game is ""good"" by the actual standarts of the gaming world ... But that's all. It will never go above average unless you start modding it. The reason i won't support this game anymore is because i was here when it started and i know from what base Starbound evolved from. Sure it had plenty of bugs and broken things here and here. But most of it was really great, the ideas were golden and they turned them to copper. I was a diehard fan of the game to the point i pushed my friends to keep playing it even when it became obvious that CF was gonna put the game into deep sleep. But time's a joy killer. And here we are, 5 years after with what i consider the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ little brother of what could've been a monument to gaming. Actual vanilla game's good. But will never be ""great"". Not until you mod it.And after more than 5 years of developpment it's ... Not good at all. The lack of depth, meanings ... It kill the concept of ""sandboxing"". Why bother doing anything when nothing have any value ? Why should i bother grinding hours and hours to build a colony that will be completely lifeless ? Some people will have fun doing it. Again, good for them. But the potential here is wasted. It will never flourish to the maximum of the capability it was so close to achieve back then. And it's a damn shame. Here's my two cents about a game i really enjoyed and put much hopes into and that died prematurely at the hands of people i will certainly never put any trust in ever again. *insert gif of CF wiping tears with chunk of money*			"

								At first sight, this game will blow your mind. Terraria in space, what more could you want? However, due to the lack of updates by Chucklefish the game becomes stale quickly, even before you reach the supposed endgame. Monsters, weapons, planets etc. start to look the same as soon as you leave the first sector. In its current state I do not recommend it. Buy it as soon as it is out of beta.			"

New game begining and a new race... nothing special about any of that... just filler junk. So i play on trying to ""fix my ship"" which i think is much worse than the old turtoral. But i play on. same exact game play. Few new crafting items, but once again nothing actually new or exciting. Finally get enough resources to get a pick axe and really start exploring... NOPE they break in just a few swings and i cant seem to  find a way to repair them like you use to. Thats really dumb. REALLY dumb. What a waste of time still.			"

												Pros-Extremely beautiful pixel art with cute characters and breathtaking environments.-Extremely beautiful music.-Good building mechanics.Cons-Huge lack of content.-Uninteresting and unoriginal Plot.-Shallow.-Empty.-Boring and extremely repetitive randomly generated fetch quests (take this A item to this B dude and return to me)-Not sure why people say it's a sandbox, if you consider gta v or elite dangerous a sandbox, then yes, it may be a sandbox for you.-Few survival elements that end up just being a annoyance. (cold and heat management have been cut off from the game.-Souless characters without personality.-Every race feels the same. No racial weapons, no racial food, same story. Only tiered racial gear without any special bonuses, just cosmetic.-Few uninteresting weapons and abilities, all randomly generated. Don't expect a Terraria here.-There are few biomes for each planet, which end up looking the same.-Eventually you'll find some kind of shockingly easy and BORING ''labyrinth puzzle platformer'' dungeons that add nothing to the game.-Slippery movement that doesn't make platformer mechanics better.-You can see all that the game has to offer after an hour of playtime.-Everything in this game seems like a placeholder. It doesn't feel ''finished''.-Boring boss fight mechanics, some are incredibly easy, other ones just annoying.-Novakid race, at the moment, has zero background lore.-Too many items that are just cosmetic or/and funny.-Every village you find looks exactly the same. (villages have different themes for each of the seven races.-Not very smart AI behaviour-Grind, grind, grind, die, grind.-Vendor npc and shops can be quite useless.-Shallow colony system.In general terms, it's great on the artistic side, but it's not a good game in my opinion, still amazed at all those positive reviews.

TLDR:Bought Starbound during steam summer sale 2016. Love the game, it's my favorite 2D sandbox game to date. EA ends on July 22nd, 2016. I play hardcore and am currently playing on the unstable version until game releases. ! definitely recommend the game. I can see myself putting in over 100 hours into this game.My Impression:Played every 2D sandbox game there is. I loved Terraria (always have my heart) and recently tried Crea (very buggy not worth). So after being disappointed by Crea, I decided to pick up Starbound during the Steam Summer Sale 2016 (disappointed by the Steam sale as well). I am loving Starbound so far.Positive:+ Nice story+ Different races+ Awesome graphics (obv for the genre)+ Tons of weapons, items, and blocks to build with/use+ New, innovative take on 2D sandbox being able to travel between planets+ Innovative take on 2D sandbox combining a fun platformer/metroidvania with a crafting game like Terraria+ Awesome sound, sound is perfect for every situation you are in. Very well done sound. Music and score is high quality for a 2D sandbox game+ Steam Achievements+ Steam Trading cardsNegatives:- Price (didn't discount during Summer sale), Terraria is cheaper and Starbound should be priced the same as that- I heard it's been in Early Access forever, but I just purchased the game, comes out of EA on July 22nd, 2016Very Very Good Game: 9/10I read the negative reviews and: I play hardcore and have died twice (someone said it's too easy, they must play casual) Someone said you don't need food anymore (again I play hardcore), and you definitely need food. I think you run out of hunger too fast. I love challenges though. Most of reviews are from older players who don't like the newer stuff. I am a new player and I enjoy the game a lot! Enough to say it's my favroite 2D sandbox game to date of writing this.My salty screenshot of my dead hardcore character:

								Amazing concept.Terraria with space travel.But the game feels like it'll be in early access forever- I rarely use the steam workshop, and it appears thats the only thing making this game content rich. When the developers ""complete"" this game, and take it off early access I'll give it another chance but it's just so bland, you're better off playing terraria some more.It's pretty well polished, but I'm just not interested in playing this game any further until it's been completed- after a few hours it's done holding my attention and I just wish this game wasn't such a dead end. I totally understand imaginitive gamers spending days and weeks in this game, but the reality is I just don't have the time or patience to dedicate to this game enough to let my imagination take the reigns. It needs more substance.			"

												So.  I put in 25 hours total in early access and now 1.0 (most of that time being in 1.0).  It's fun though inventory system is a mess.  But the reason I can't recommend it is because of game breaking bugs.  I had several flags in several systems (checkpoints to teleport to) including my home base planet, the ark (the npc and story zone), and much more.  Loaded up the game today, all gone.  Can't get em back.  Can't progress through the story.  Can't find/easily get back to my home base system.  Just kind of screwed.  Cool. Bottom Line:  Still seems in Early Access.  Game breaking bugs.  Don't buy til fixed.			"

Early Access Review
								XX Pleased Giraffe XXAt first Starbound was a game I bought, in VERY early access because I loved Terraria and also enjoyed Minecraft a bit. Starbound promises nerly limitless exploration, thousands of worlds to venture and gut for ore and trees. Each world is of some type. An enermous volcanic planet can have  icy pools of poison or precios liquid fuel at its surface. A mile below the surface could lie an ancient Avian tomb or dungeon. Fallen travelers could have left their goods stowed away safely, or not, in small tombs deep beneath the surface, just begging to be rediscovered, only to find it contains a bandage and 5 red flares.The soundtrack on this gem is.. unlike any game, EVER. It blows my mind. It's full of emotion, wonder, and sadness. I get chills from the music for this game.Starbound was incredibly fun from the start. the story was all but existent, but the core gameplay was there. I spent many many hours offline playing with my brother on LAN. (I have at least two hundred more hours than steam reflects)Eventually we stopped playing as much. We'd hit the ""end"" of the game, went through character and world wipes as the Chucklefish team expanded and improved the game experience. I released a neat-ish mod in March 2014, and soon after stopped playing; everyone was waiting for the next big update.I played a few times afterward, seeing the early removal of pickaxes as the main mining method. The ship's state of early disrepair. And again stopped.Fast forward to last week. I'm sitting here at the computer and see ' ""XXXXXXXXXX"" is playing Starbound ' in the corner, and I think: ""Okay, sure..""I'd stopped following the dev updates months ago. Busy life and all. Launching the game presented a professional and information rich Game launcher (better than before) and after launching; the all new dev logo, a cuter load screen.I'll do a TL;DR from here. I started an avian character as I had always. I began the game, and repaired my ship. I expected to find nothing interesting in the world below.. But again I was mistaken and sunk many many hours into a newly polished, beautiful sounding, playing, looking game.I cannot wait to see what they bring to the future. "

								This game is incredible.  Even as an early Beta this game is more complete than the last 3 Creative Assembly releases (Rome 2, Shogun 2, and Empire).  Regardless, if you aren't willing to deal with occasional glitches, some currently unbalanced aspects, or missing object descriptions, coupled with the fact that there will be character wipes before the game is released as a finished product, then you may want to wait to play.  So far I have logged almost 80 hours in this game and I have barely scratched (pretty good for a $15 investment) the surface.  The prospect of losing that progress doesn't even bother me because the purpose of the game is to explore, constantly finding new content.  If you get tired of the scenery on one planet, start digging, when you get tired of that, fly to the next planet in the system, and if that gets old, there are currently 4 ""finished"" sectors and one that encompases everything that will ultimately be in the game by the end.  Looking forward to the final release of this product.			"

								I can't recommend this game. It was a good idea to be able to travel from planet to planet, while in a Terreria style. However what it brings to the table isnt good enough. Even though you can go to differnt planets and so new types of Aliens and monster its more or less the samething as any other planet. The game is repetitive and gets old rather quickly. The bosses are easy, fighting is easy, if you die nothing really happens. Also the game hasn't been updated in months. For me this game is a no go.----------UPDATE-----------They updated after months of waiting. I will play for a little and come back to review> The new items and what not are really pointless. And no updates from the Winter one, That was months ago! It still has no great purpose or soul of Terreria. I wished this game could have been done it could have been great, but no. > Also in fourms and other blog type things the Devs are banning and ignoring anyone who is saying anything about updates, or wanting refunds, etc. Just move on			"

								LATE EDIT: The developers are very poor at updating and keeping their word. However, Starbound is still a very good RP platform, what with construction and multiple worlds to build upon, and a lot of support for modding in custom weapons and such, which are visible to Vanilla players, via combining Vanilla assets in interesting ways. If you're into RP, there's a /lot/ to be had in Starbound, but otherwise I can't really recommend it.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I find it to be more entertaining and more interesting than Terraria. I recommend this title wholeheartedly.Sure, it may lack the variety in weapons and items and bosses that Terraria has, but it already beats it in artstyle, player-character animation quality, scale and world generation, and this is just the Beta, whereas Terraria is prettymuch a fully complete title. When more content is added, this game will be star-bounds ahead of its predecessor.			"

								Starbound is a very fun game, especially for those who like to build and explore.  For those who have played Terraria (or Minecraft), you'll be familiar with the basic formula of mining, crafting, building, and surviving.  That said, Starbound - despite not being feature complete yet - is already light-years (pun only slightly intended) ahead of both of those games.  There are already more than enough features to make the game highly playable and enjoyable, including an infinite variety of worlds to explore, enemies to combat, and structures to build.  That said, I must warn potential players that the game is still indeed in development, and one should assume that there may be loss of character data/progress during this stage.  (This will apparently not be an issue in later stages of beta testing, so check the game forums for current updates.)  Also, because of the nature of an Early Access game, be prepared to run into bugs (though major bugs in Starbound seem few and far between.)  That said, I still highly recommend Starbound to anyone who is interested in a game that offers the potential for dozens (hundreds, even) of hours of gameplay either alone or in a universe full of your closest friends.

												Alright, where do I start? 1.0.For Starbound, this is a reaaalllyyyy touchy bit. Some say the game is even better, some say it's only been ruined. While I don't disagree with either, let me share my opinion.I think 1.0 is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have a few more complex systems, there's a lot more to do, the bosses are more fleshed out--, and  on the other, you have a lot of systems missing. The story is short, the quests are tedious to say the least and after a while, it goes a bit No Man's Sky and the exploration gets a little stale.Let me break it all down.-THE STORY-When you really look at Starbound's core, it's a 2D space exploration/survival game with a short story. It's no social commentary and it certainly isn't the next Undertale, but is it really supposed to be?This is a little difficult to explain.Starbound isn't supposed to have a deep, rich, gut-punching story. It's a sandbox game. Sandbox games don't normally have invested stories, and Starbound is no exception. You can make the argument ""Oh, but it can if it just would!"" but that's not the point of Starbound. If anything, starbound only added the story to give your progression some back-bone, which we'll talk about next.-PROGRESSION-Starbound's progression. It's gone through a few changes. Some people like it, some people hate it. I, for one, found progression in 1.0 a little more enjoyable than in older versions. In 1.0, you have a reason to progress. You have the one evil at the end of the progression to face, and you have to work to get there.This ties in well with the story. Like I stated earlier, the story drives progression better than in older versions of Starbound. While progression is easy and a little short, it's better than it was. It keeps you scowering planets for resources to carry on your way because you now have more of a reason to do it, which brings us to our next topic.-EXPLORATION-A lot of people get stale with Starbound's exploration, and rightfully so. It gets repeditive, tedious and often, if you've seen one planet, you've seen them all for the most part.The good thing about Starbound's exploration is that it is actually more varried than a lot of other games. The biomes, especially are what shine. It's got a sizable ammount of biomes for planets, and in those biomes, sub-biomes, and each sub-biome has an assortment of special, hand-crafted creatures and even buildings and special structures. While these, too, are procedurally generated, they do have many variants to explore.Alas, eventually, like anything, it gets stale after a while. You've seen it all, you're grizzled and battle-hardened. You've seen all that these biomes have to offer. This is true after a while, but let's stop and think.Are we being unreasonable? It's expensive, time-consuming, tedious and near impossible to hand-craft these sorts of things. Our finite hands can't possibly make something truely infinite. At least seemingly. Even though I'm a hard-core optimist, even I know you can't please everyone with procedural generation. Not with our technology and human ability. For what it is, Starbound's precedural generation has a lot more to offer than many other games of its class, if not all of them.-NPC's-Bad paragraph transition, but how do you link NPC's with a statement on unrealistic expectations?Anyway, the NPC's in 1.0 are flat-out better than in older versions. They have purpose. They're more than just cardboard stand-arounds that you can sometimes trade with, now. They have jobs, they have quests for you, and if you do enough of them for an NPC, they will grow to like you and request to join your crew. Upon joining your crew, they can follow you into missions and onto planets, protecting you. The A.I is really dumb, though, I will admit, but if you don't have friends to play Starbound with like me, NPC's really do make the game feel a little more alive.-MODDING-All in all, Starbound is a modder's game. The game is bare-- but it's bare for good reason.Let me elaborate, hear me out here.Starbound is bare. Think of it more like a canvas. If there's something you find is missing or something you don't like, there's a mod for that! Starbound has a workshop and at least two other modding sites for if you don't have the Steam version or if you're looking for a 3rd party mod.Starbound is really more a game about you and what you want, and it's giving you the space to do that.There are countless mods all the way from simple tweaks to total conversions. All your pick. So do remember, Starbound is a canvas. It's giving you the space and the accessability to shape your story to what you want it to be.-CONCLUSION-I will be frank, Starbound is not a game for someone who doesn't like modding their game. It IS bare, it's short, it's lonely.But Starbound thrives on the modding scene, and this is the best thing it could have done in the long run, but that is a conversation for another time.If you don't like mods, this is not the game for you.If you are fine with a modded experience, are a simple kind of person or are a modder yourself, Starbound will defintely be your canvas.I hope this review has been helpfull, and I do much apriciate your reading this and considering my view on all of this.Now, if you'll excuse me, Sire Rovaklovich, The avian monkey king, and I have a group of crab-worshiping robot cultists to take out. After that, we might swing by that under-water toll booth that sells those nice hats. I could use a good sun-hat for when we're hunting down some unobtainium on that massive space mushroom. I'll talk to you guys later <3			"

								This game is simply amazing. This sandbox game has attempted to go over an obstacle that most sandbox games suffer from, the feeling that you have nothing left to do. And let me just say, the developers have done this beautifully, instead leaving you thinking of what to do next. The best thing about this game is that the developers are willing to listen to suggestions from the community, something as a game developer you need to take advantage of.  If you enjoy games like Minecraft and Terraria, you NEED to check out this game.			"

								Clearly Starbound owes a lot to Terraria, and it's probably safe to say if you like one you will like the other. Even in the beta stage, however, Starbound has a huge amount of content to recommend it, and so far it seems to have more replayablity value than Terraria did for me. The interesting differences between the infinite number of planets you can visit in Starbound have kept me coming back for more, and I’m excited to see what this game becomes when it gets out of beta.

Product received for free
												This game almost never failed to bore me. I enjoyed countless hours playing this game, and everyone who had gotten it that I recommended it to didn't regret their decision to buy the game. I highly recommend it to anyone who considers buying it.And to those comparing Starbound to Terraria, well, here's some differences:Pros-Starbound is space-based, meaning there's not just one world, or two, or three. There's way more than you can imagine.-Starbound has 7 races to choose from, all with their own technological advancements and cultures.-Starbound has a storyline.-Starbound includes crewmembers that actually fight with you, unlike Terraria's NPCs that just sit in a house.-Starbound includes challenge rooms, which are similar to obstacle courses, rewarding you if you succeed, and punishing you for failing.-Starbound doesn't require you to keep crafting more pickaxes, rather, it requires you to upgrade your Manipulator Module.-Starbound is much easier to mod.-Starbound includes quests.-Starbound includes vehicles.-Starbound includes pets.-There's less debuffs in Starbound.-You can feed your ship pet.-Starbound doesn't include invasion or events like in Terraria, which some find annoying, but some find fun.-Starbound has better music, I know this is preference but come on, let's face the facts here.-You can see your underwear in Starbound <3-Starbound's armor doesn't include set bonuses, which can be a good thing, as if you find a new, better piece of armor than what you currently have, there's no reason not to equip it right away, whereas in Terraria, you might wanna hold off equipping it because you may want to keep your weaker armor's set bonus.-Starbound gives you a ship, which is basically an upgradable home already built for you.-Starbound has 2-handed weapons which generally have a special ability when right-clicked, as well as 1-handed weapons, such as dual-wielding pistols-Shields actually work as shields in Starbound, they don't just give knockback immunity like in Terraria-Starbound includes terraforming AND microforming.-Starbound has much more biomes and mini-biomes.-Starbound has post-endgame vaults, Terraria has nothing endgame.-Starbound has procedurally generated weapons, meaning there's more than 1,000,000 weapons. That doesn't include all the other items in-game.-For Starbound's defense, what you see is what you get in terms of damage reduction. In Terraria, damage reduction is based on half of your total defense in normal, and 3/4ths of it in expert mode.-After you finish the game, Chucklefish Games gives you a thank-you card (via Esther),which really warmed my heart,aswell as the ending credits.-Last but not least, THE most game changing feature, is that you can crouch in Starbound. :0Cons-Terraria has mounts-Terraria has accessories instead of techs-Terraria has equippable grapple hooks; you have to hold them in Starbound.-Terraria includes fishing quests.-Terraria has more bosses and side bosses.-Terraria has expert mode, so rarer drops are easier to obtain, while the monsters are harder to beat.-The minimal damage you take in Terraria is 1, as opposed to Starbound's 2.-Terraria has more achievements.-Terraria has a summoner class, which Starbound doesn't really have much of besides pets and crewmembers.I could go on and on about the differences between these two games,but there's just something about Starbound that Terraria doesn't have, and I think it's that once you've completed the game, you can look back at all the places you've been and the things you have done. It really is a great game.9.5/10			"

								This game is absolutely amazing! This is a sandbox creative type game that is full of so much content and fun, you will get lost in it for hours. You have amazing customization options starting with your character. Choose a races (1 of 6), choose your look, choose your clothes, then hop into your spaceship and start exploring the universe. Once you get into the game, customization and creativity are yours to control. One of the many things added to the game that I absolutely love are the musical instruments. You can find musical instruments like a guitar, harmonica, bone xylophone and many more. They work off of an abc music system. Download your favorite music/songs in abc form to your music folder and jam out either solo or in unison in a band. That is just one of hundreds of small features and nick nacks this game has to offer!This game is worth the full price and you will get more than $15 worth of fun. Note: To improve your experience, play with friends!Note: With the most recent update there are no longer any more character wipes!			"

												**POST RELEASE REVIEW**Wow they just removed stuff. And they didn't fill half of the promises they had made. No thanks.Was a neat game that I was pawing at and dying to get for the longest time. I still remember how excited I was when I found out that I could finally buy it, and I did, etc.Now some SEVERAL million dollars later, they can't even finish the game that they started. Claiming that funding was their bleight, they reached to EA, and they received. Now they took the cash and split.One of the shining examples of why EA is a massively flawed system, and also a huge example of rediculous fanboys ready to defend a dying horse for no real reason.All in all, I would stay far away from this title, but it would be wasted breath. Any and all who are going to buy this, have already, and this review won't change anything. I just have to sit here and shake my fist at the devs for abandoning their hopes and dreams for the game and running with the cash.			"

Play either on your own or with friends as you find yourself stranded over an Alien Planet with the task of getting Fuel for your Spaceship. Beam down to the planets around you and gather resources, build anything you like and fight off alien lifeforms. The soundtrack is beautifully composed and it's very easy to lose hours with this game. I highly recommend to anyone who loves a bit of creativity in their gaming experience. :)			"

								Everything you could want from a sandbox game. This is literally the best side scrolling iteration of the genre, and it's just beta. It has more content available than I've ever seen in a sandbox game, and it's just beta. Honestly, it's more of a private side-scrolling sandbox MMO than it is just a coop-optional sandbox game. At the moment, the game is going to be constantly readjusted and changed while they fix bugs and add content, but for $15 you'll be hard pressed to find a game with more to do and more to explore. Build a base together, fight bosses, explore dungeons, and even play your own music through ABC notation.With a ton of content to add and the support for developing mods readily available, the future is bright for Starbound.

Infinite worlds to explore.   I gave into the hype and bought this game on day 1, as did many of the other reviewers here.  You can still see the excitement in the early reviews.  We thought we were funding a game meant for greatness, but what we got were crushed hopes.			"

												So which game will be done first, this or Half-Life 3?  Place your bets!EDIT: Seriously, it's been two years.  I'm gonna try out Steam's new refund feature, and I implore you to do the same, so you can buy a game that is done/close to done.EDIT EDIT: Oh.  Uh, I guess we see whose bets won.  ...I dunno, though, I've kinda lost the desire to try it now.EDIT COMBO: I heard they deleted most of the content.  That's not how you make a game 1.0!LOL			"

								When I first got this game, I played it for a few hours, then stopped. I thought nothing of stopping, I thought that it was because I found other games to play, which happens, even with games that are my favorite.However, I recently retried playing again, and now know why I stopped. To put it simply, this game is boring. There isn't a sense of flow, or actual adventure. While there seems to be a large amount of customization, it's very lacking, and you find yourself wanting the next part of the game. You want to find that big civilization that will have more to do, but it isn't there. You want the high tech armor and special equipment, the better building blocks and house parts, but they are so far in the distance, with so much tedium in the way, you wonder ""Why bother?"".The dungeons and mine shafts have little to nil, enemies go down easily with even the most rudimentary of weaponry, and important items (like food) only drop with VERY specific weapons, thus disallowing you from using the weapons you want. And when I say enemies go down easily, I am not kidding. Let's use an example. On one of the planets I found a laboratory. In that lab were what APPEARED to be heavily armed soldiers and scientists. They said some generic ""leave the area"" phrases, before I started to kill them. I was wearing no armor, and was carrying a cheap weapon I had found randomly in a chest. I only had to heal myself once.In short, this game just isn't worth it. You want a nice, open world 2d building game with lots of options? Go with Terraria, the game that this game blatantly ripped off.			"

								Everything you could want from a sandbox game. This is literally the best side scrolling iteration of the genre, and it's just beta. It has more content available than I've ever seen in a sandbox game, and it's just beta. Honestly, it's more of a private side-scrolling sandbox MMO than it is just a coop-optional sandbox game. At the moment, the game is going to be constantly readjusted and changed while they fix bugs and add content, but for $15 you'll be hard pressed to find a game with more to do and more to explore. Build a base together, fight bosses, explore dungeons, and even play your own music through ABC notation.With a ton of content to add and the support for developing mods readily available, the future is bright for Starbound.

								MY GOD, YES.It's a bit too early to fully review this game, however I must say that the Beta is going quite well. It hooked me upon starting on my first world...although not everything is implimented yet there is still quite a LOT of content in the game.I have not reached the endgame, but I have watched countless streams of people who were in that part of the game.A warning to all: the game is in the first phase of Beta, wipes are EXPECTED. Don't go building an epic Glitch castle and then cry your heart out when that save is wiped. The devs experiment a LOT to get the right balence and feel to the game, and wipes are going to happen in order for you to fully experience those changes.If you are on the fence about buying: price probably won't change, so you could check back later and then buy it prior to release. (although you should test it and get a feel for things...don't go too deep, you might burn yourself out before full release)Yes; this game looks similar to another game in the genre called Terraria (if you have not heard of that, go search it NAO), however both games branch off in quite different paths. In Terraria, you stay in one area...map is pretty small compared to Starbound, and it's more focused on just mining and obtaining gear so you can slay bosses and stuff...eventually making your own utopia (I guess)Starbound, however: you start on one planet, as soon as you get your bearings, you check your star map on your ship...you'll notice how quickly things change. Millions...no...Trillions of planets out there await your beloved starship's arrival and your feet to touch the ground. There will be harsh enviroments...which will require special equipment and tactics. Monsters are fierce and also randomly generated. You'll probably won't be able to come across the same monster on a different planet. There are several sectors in this vast universe you explore...each one getting harder as you progress. Tread lightly, traveler: you might come across a hostile pack of monsters, a mini boss, or even a sacrificial cult of bird-people worshipping the sun.Good luck, and explore safely.-Unknown Minutes "

												I've got a lot of time in this game. Inflated by the old launcher bug or not, I /do/ have a fair few hours in it. And I've followed the game out of its teasing and into its modern day incarnation. All I can say is I don't recommend it. Chucklefish may have published a fair few fun games, like Stardew Valley and Risk of Rain, but when it comes to development... their true colors show over the last four or so years.Starbound is a flawed product. It's expansive and is pretty much the definition of a sandbox, but it's empty. It doesn't have the content its competitors do. Even with the addition of a story to progress through, the game still feels crushingly sparse. And despite me enjoying Starbound's art more, Terraria is pretty much its pure superior. I could get into the Orwellian nightmare that is Chucklefish, with their forums locking down on pretty much all criticism and negative response in favor of a cloud of mindless supporters. Or how the lead dev treated his composers, writers and programmers, many of whom left the product while it was in the works. The reason I believe the writing and stability of the game became so disjointed and worthless. Ultimately, though, Starbound is simply not a great game. It's not even a good game. It's a mediocre game at best.I had high hopes that this would be the next Terraria, something to improve upon the formula and also let me play as a cool bird/monkey/fish person in space. But instead the game has proven to be Terraria's inferior in almost every way. All I can say is that I hope Chucklefish sticks to publishing games, and keeps their hands out of development until they have a better grasp on what makes a cohesive development cycle.Then again, not much more to expect from a team of pixel artists.

								The game has potential but like terriaria it takes a long time to update, it gets fun for a while then you reach your limit and gets boring.  All the bosses are too easy, they should implement them to breaking blocks imo.  I went through all the bosses without seeing any villagers, villages(just my luck) so that was dissappointing and by the time i am already too strong but oh well.  I would still recommend it if you don't play 12-24 hours straight like me and unlock everything but none the less it's a way to waste time.			"

								Yeah, it's Terraria in space. They have lots of nice tweaks to how these sort of games play though. For instance, right from the start you have the ability to mine multiple blocks at once. Also, if you stop mining a block partway through it, the block will stay cracked for a bit, instead of going back to normal instantly like in Minecraft. The worlds are huge, each one is fairly unique, and there are tons of worlds to explore. You should probably buy this game.			"

												I thought the game was fully released? Have they just decided to keep the practice of wiping characters in the full game too? After the full game release update my brother and I decided to play together. Over the course of a few days everything was normal. We took a short break on account of me working and when I boot up my starbound today my character is gone. Game is fun and all but i'm pretty upset about this and find myself demotivated and I don't want to deal with this outside of beta. It is worth noting however, whatever kind of bug this is did not affect my brother.			"

								Starbound is easily an addicting game. I assume it as Terraria's successor, with better graphics and a much larger world. I was instantly hooked on it. When I litterally first started the game there was a bit of confusion on what to do, but after I found the small tutorial they give you I recovered and actually started playing. You litterally feel like your exploring the universe through a spaceship, and you techniqually are...this game is HUGE. On a side note I love the instruments, that was a hilarious, yet beautiful touch. I even enjoyed the comical responses my dim-witted Floran had for nearly everything.Building is very nice and simple, too, and you can find some really nice stuff! from giant bird artifacts to golden toilets. Who wouldn't want a golden toilet to match their throne room?But...After beating all current bosses, gaining the best armor, and flying to only level 10 planets, I find the whole process getting very repetitive. I would like to see more storyline behind all the races.This is only a beta for now, but I am very, VERY pleased with the results. I would rate this game an 8/10, the last two points missing from the grindy feeling later in the game. Hopefully they will fix that and give the players something to do once they get all the good stuff.If you enjoy exploring in videogames the most, you'll find this game a good grab for your collection.

								DO NOT shell out for this until it's in a later, later, later stage of development (For an estimation, I'd say about two years in the least).At first there's plenty to do (or rather the illusion of such,) with the various materials and planets you can pillage, working towards advancing on the gear scale. However, once you've hit the loot roof, that's it - there's nothing else to do. Building becomes tiresome, and the combat is non-existent. Tackling old bosses has no reward factor. Visiting old tier planets introduces you to a set of cut and paste biomes, with each planet likely having some pre-generated buildings or village. Yes, I realise this is not a handcrafted universe but a generated one - and it shows. None of the planets have any special nuances, and the layouts for things like glitch castles and avian villages don't seem to differ at all. I'd rather eat a small cake that's well prepared than stuff countless, hastily baked cupcakes into my face. Things do not improve with online play - you are just introducing the same, boring lack of gameplay onto a multi-person stage. The game simply doesn't have the functionality of Minecraft or the soul of Terraria to make it worth coming back to in its present state (and likely for a long, long, long time to come). Most of the roleplay communities I've visited over the course of my Starbound travels are simply awful, infested with 'demons', early teenagers who too busy roleplaying 'oh we are suddenly in love', or just erotic roleplay. Else, there's simply people making use of the game as a chatroom, imprinting modern day culture on what should be an alien, exotic environment. Granted, this isn't one of the problems I can blame on Chucklefish - independent servers and their populations are out of Chucklefish's control. Regardless, my encounters with those communities have been less than fulfilling, making the prospect of using Starbound as a roleplaying platform grim.Ultimately, this game at present is just a set of bones which doesn't need anybody else's money being pumped into it. The 12 million Chucklefish already has should be enough to fund their work, but evidently the mistake of giving them dosh before the game's release has fostered a group of indolent, whinging babies, who think they do not need to live up to their promises of FREQUENT updates (thick and fast? an adequate description of the disappointment myself and other like-minded consumers have developed, and with good reason). At the same time, they're working on other game projects irrelevant to this one, and publishing the games of other developers no doubt so the CF dev team can accumulate more money that they won't use for game development. It's a shame, I like the look of some of these CF published games - but that this excuse-making, undeserving bunch would reap some of the profits makes me kind of physically ill. IN SHORT: Do not think you are going to get frequent updates, do not think you are going to have a lot to do, and don't expect any (re)playability. The game is so very far from even nearly completed, and Chucklefish's abyssmal management won't solve that soon. Let them use the money they already have to do something with Starbound, rather than whatever they're doing to♥♥♥♥♥♥it away at the moment.EDIT: Also they need to sort out their launcher so that it closes by itself - I suspect a lot of 'time played' for people is being falsely attributed to them neglecting to close the launcher, even when the main game window is shut down. I had to launch the game from the .exe directly in order to bypass that pesky, misleading launcher.			"

												I would of felt this game was worth 1/3rd of its current asking price... a nice causual game to give me a change in scenery, but in all honesty I feel like a replay of Terraria at $10 dollars would be a bit more enjoyable.  I admit that does disappoint me.  This was supposed to be terraria in space and a game that could grow beyond the limitations of terraria which was namely that you were confined to one world, however terraria packs more in one biome than this game can in one of its varieties of worlds and gives you a more compelling and enjoyable reason to explore and dig dig dig dig.I ordered this game as soon as it became available in beta form and played it a bit then and it was ok.  5 years later and it is still only ok.  It actually feels like little has actually changed from 2 years ago.  I was excited about the prospect of a space adventure where you could colonize an entire planet, but I find it falls a bit on its face.  Also sooooo much exciting things were promised and then never made the cut due to the developers more interested in making cute game art... however i do understand many games in beta are like that and then shipped with what they had time to do.. 5 years wasn't enough. I've done a pros/cons section below to the best of my ability to remove the bias of my expectations and just evaluate the game as is:Pros:- space adventure where you go to multiple places/worlds- its fun to dig and build a while.  You even get to expand the space on your ship where you can then customize its appearance- the universe is near endless giving a nice sense of smallness in a huge universe-you can recruit people to inhabit your spaceship... even engineers to decrease its fuel consumption- randomly generated npc quests to send you here and there and keep you busy a little while- Steam workshop.  Supporting modders can add amazing aspects and tweaks to a game that can expand and alter a game in very fun and exciting ways.  If anything, this is what will bring me back to this game to give another chance.Cons- lackluster generic story line of cosmic Builder vs Destroyer- very little character or race development.  There is some race specific armor and weapons but any race can buy it and you generally just cover it up with your social tab- everything is procedurally generated, which I thought would be a big plus and add to the diversity of the game, but it just does the opposite.  There are millions of combos of weapons or guns but they all amount to the same type of weapon in just a handful of catagories.  Guns shoot, swords swing.  sometimes you find one with slightly more dps yay-  You climb teirs of equipment and gear but it feels the same from beginning to end.  You find gear that can handle the creatures on your current teir and you then progress.  You get to the next teir and you find similar but slightly better weapons to take care of similar but slightly stronger creatures.  There are some boss fights or scenarios when you go from teir to teir.-  Mining or digging is the same as the point above.  you find minerals to help you progress to the next teir only to find different named minerals to do the same... mostly by upgrading your armor or crafting stations.- From start to finish you can complete the story line with somewhat of a grind in 20 hours.  I feel no urge to replay it.			"

												I usually don't write reviews, but this game frustrates me and here is why. The game has much potential and I will list 5 pro's below.- Many customization options- Lots of references to sci-fi material- Extensive crafting system- Decent story serviceable to the game- Decent gameplayNow I will go into the negatives why the game doesn't work for me. The game feels bloated, it has a lot of ideas and content but it doesn't feel coherent. There is too much cluttered together and though I feel an RPG or a similar game should be extensive. The core components of the game should be streamlined, yet it feels like a mess. This game has taken forever to come out, and I felt it would only be honest to review it once the game is officially released. I have seen builds come and go of this game and the final product is dissapointing even compared to the earlier versions of the game. It plays unbalanced, frustrating and just a chore to get through. Now I am sure there are a lot of proponents for this game, all the more power to you if you enjoyed it, I didn't and this is the first game I have reviewed ever, yet I felt just to write a review for this game just to inform you. Buy it if you really like Terraria and you look for something similar, otherwise don't waste your money and time on it. Because how often i have tried i can't enjoy this game.			"

												Starbound has come a long way. It was being hated on in its early life but over time got better. It was in early access and to be honest with you i thought it would never be realeased. People that bought it in early acess didnt get anything but oh well. Some things did get removed although i will tell you the beginning intro is the best thing i have seen in a game. The music is a lovely thing in this game. You can also build a colony for our own RACE. Yes novakids you can finally see eachother on the same planet. There are tons of races and plus you even have a workshop at your disposal. You can upgrade your gun and ship and even yourself. The game for its price is an awesome game that deserves more credit.

												tl:dr Severely dissapointed with the final release after watching it develop since a few weeks after it became available way back when.will include story *spoilers* later onwhen my friends showed me this game we had just finished our terraria playthrough and was looking for more like it. We saw this game and said that it looked like terraria in space so we decided to go with it and see what an early access game had to offer. I'll leave this here that this is the single worst expirences with early access I've had with the time it released in early access to release date. Seeing as they had ~5 years of development and what we got is my biggest problem with this game.pros- great soundtrack and had this since it was added- fixed performance so low end Comps can play *had major issues up until release*- fun gameplay very akin to terraria and the like- overall artstyle is cute/funcons- bad controls that will get you killed and get you killed alot- they dropped alot from the beta to the release that going through would take up more space than necessary but i will         leave that they dropped nearly half the tech they had and you didn't need to waste your backpack on survival gear- only around 70 monsters which become very familer very fast- the story *more later*- repeat tilesets start to make worlds look too similar- bad ai *combat involes dodging a single enemy move, while other ai walk aimlessly and sometimes sleep**SPOILERS*So this ""story"" is the single most dissapointing aspect that this game wasted so many years on developing. It involves a tutorial which sets a decent start and gives the player something think about as they travel. then it has 11 more missions that is it where 5 are scanning mssions and 6 dungeon missions. I can say that minus the scanning a player could easily finish the game in less than 3 hours with the bosses being generic and easy.mining facilityStory Aspect: basically the fuel is radioactive mutates people into monsters.Boss: a giant crystal that has nearly instant death beams and spanws minions activate the gun in the center 3 times it diesScan for floran crap until the old woman says its enoughFloran huntStory Aspect: you get to be the grand hunterBoss: giant bug that moves very slow and has a tough hide that you need help to breakscan for hyltol crap until woman says your goodHyltol libraryStory Aspect: some librarian needs help with his booksBoss:  the antagonist enters as head of a cult wanting to bring about the end of the universe most attacks are way to slow and easy to dodge except one where she goes metroid morphball and just drills into you whether you like it or not nearly undodgeableScan avian crap until old woman says its enoughAvian templeStory Aspect: see the avian temple to their god Boss the avatar(i might have these mixed up)Scan apex crap until the old woman says its enoughApex minikong fortressStory aspect: help the resistance storm the fortressBoss: think television andross from starfox and floating turrets around himScan glitch crap until the old woman says its enoughGlitch castle defenseI'm going to say that out of all the missions this was the laziest first they brought back the bone dragon from near the beginning of starbound and found him a place (which I enjoyed) the problem is he has 1 move and its breathe fire causing a small explosion and lingering fire. then to make this fight have any kind of difficulty they just set an infinite spawn of cultists till the dragon is dead its really boring and I was glad it was overStory Aspect: protect the escentric glitch defend his castle from a cult siege Boss : freaking bone dragon man with only 1 attackOkay this is where I'd say scan crap but thank goodness you don't have too only thing is you don't need to do a dungeon for the last part the old woman just give it to you.FinaleStory Aspect: kill the equivalent of planet aidsBoss: identical bout with cult leader and then the heart of the ruin planet once you do this you beat the game and it give some lore heavy crap that some over spirit will send you back alive probably found in the lore they wrote not spending time to find out about it thats not the issue this is---It then says that you have saved the universe (looking fine) and that you have brought together all six race in a unionship and this is where I have the problem there was never an indication that you were being a diplomat to any of these races and I can't think of anywhere where they say that they are at war with eachother and that any wars predate the game itself so it ended up feeling that they meant to have diplomatic missions or something and just didn't do it.

												Chucklefish has converted me to a new idealistic mannerism of approaching development.In the alpha/beta there was a stunning amount of additional content and non-intrusive hud, a (better) dual wielding system in which you chose exactly what went where, and there were 10 slots, instead of having to switch between two pages with Z or whatever key you use. There were asteroid fields loaded with random and scary enemies that did hundreds of damage, destroying your character in seconds. There were sectors differentiating difficulty inbetween planetary systems, and different things you required to live on certain planets. Crafting didn't have an arbitrary wait time, and multiplayer was genuinely fun when you would get lost underground with friends... and don't even get me started on the availability of techs, where you could have rocketboots, mechs, etc.! There were really cool random weapons and many deviant features that opposed the other sandbox games of its time, when it came out.But no, Chucklefish taught us that this isn't the way! They've taught us to remove all that content, to exclude features, to remove dozens of Techs which made each player loadout unique and interesting, to ditch preferential random design of all creatures on every given planet and the random skills they'd receive, to scrap several tiers of armour in favor of ones that are simply pointed towards a single stat and disallow most customization (magick sucks, melee sucks, and ranged is about all you can rely on anymore), make it so you can't 3d-print items early in the game (and have to go arbitrarily collect ores to create a pixel printer), and finally; LITERALLY REMOVING SEVERAL TIERS OF LEGITIMATELY CRAFTABLE FURNITURE AND RESKIN/RENAME/RETCONN IT AS A REWARD FOR RANDOM VAGUE AND TIME CONSUMING NPC QUESTS.In truth, Chucklefish has shown me that the definition of appropriate game development is to start off large and reduce the amount of impressive things you have until you've basically destroyed your game. We had it all wrong, guys!Bravo, Chucklefish. I loved the game at the start and now the only reason I can stand it is because of a few features it has (such as playing music, hunger, and player abilties), that frankly if someone mods into a game like Terraria, I'd uninstall Starbound for.

												Starbound is a game about exploration and discovery, providing a unique experience through the exploration of different planets and their inhabitants. The player is tasked with saving the galaxy, but is free to side-track and pursue their own goals throughout the game. As the game progresses, the player unlocks more technologies, stronger weapons, and better armour. The game has a plotline all laid out for you, but you're free to do everything at your own pace.However, Starbound shines most in the exploration and discovery factors - discovering colonies on planets, structures built by past generations, and currently used buildings. The game is diverse in the amount of lore and interaction it can provide, gives the player the choice to pursue these endeavors or not.But, Starbound 1.0 is a buggy mess. I yeilded 5 crashes in 30 minutes from just exploring a planet and talking to its inhabitants. The game would freeze and crash with no error. There is also a bug that causes all graphics to turn into black squares, which happens randomly, and to fix it, the game must be restarted. NPCs sometimes follow you around aimlessly, forever. When the internal engine has trouble keeping up, all NPCs (including enemies encountered on planets) will lag tremendously, jumping forward and backword as the engine has trouble processing the NPCs physics, which results in something that looks like a laggy connection to an online server, but in SINGLEPLAYER.This is inexcusable. Previous versions of Starbound were never this buggy. Hold off to get this game until the developers step up and fix these major issues.			"

Early Access Review
								So, where to begin with?Ah... right. First, I want to mention that, at the moment while I'm typing this, it's the first stage of the early beta.That means that there isn't as much content as there is going to be on full release, so don't expect it to be already complete.The current beta is ending with Tier 4 of... 10 Tiers I think there's going to be.The game starts with you spawning in your own Spaceship. It's character-bound so you don't have to worry about losing it.You're making a tutorial in which you'll get to know how to use items and play the game.The tutorial itself ends with the end of Tier 1... after that you're on your own.Inside your spaceship you can travel from planet to planet. Every planet has a predefined biome and the planets themself are generated by a 'seed', that is actually it's coordinates. With this system every planet of a coordinate is pretty similar, so sharing coordinates is possible! The further you get, the more and harder biomes you unlock. Planets and their related enemies have a level, so going on a high leveld planet isn't a smart idea if you want to avoid instakill-hits.The planets are generated with random structures, such as dungeons, cities, laboratories and so on. Enemies differ from planet to planet and so do their hostility. There are many ores to find but to get all the ores, which are available in the game, you'll have to explore many planets since planets only have some of the ores. Also, the higher the level of a planet, the greater the ores you can find on it. This adds a good variety in the game and their related tiers/levels.Your character yourself can dress up with armor and vanity armor, which you'll also be able to paint later (not yet possible). Additionally, there are currently six races to select of, every with its own cultur, story, items, armor and all the other things.You can learn the so called 'Tech' skills, which allow you to, for example, double jump or dash.There are many items in the game as of its beta stage right now and every weapon are random generated, meaning that finding the same weapon twice has an incredibly low chance. There are even hundred varieties of the same block, like sand that is obtainable in green, blue, red, yellow and other colors, adding a varity in building. Of course you can build things yourself since it's a sandbox game.TL;DR - The game adds a lot of variety to exploring, building and gameplay. And there's going to be a lot more with its continuing development, giving players a lot of fun, especially in Multiplayer. People who already loved Terraria will have a new must-buy title with this game.Though, since it's a Beta yet, many features might change in the future.			"

												It's a bit boring to be honest. The combat controls feel clunky, the controls in general are bad. Inventory management is a chore, looting things from chests is a chore (no option to loot all using a keyboard button, have to click for everything). Mining takes too long. Imo the matter manipulator should be able to mine at max speed from the beginning. Making mining slow is anti-fun. Just boring. And this is coming from a newcomer to the game (I have not played early access). It's too bad I went over the 2 hour limit for steam refunds. RIP 15 dollars. I had 4 hours at the time of writing this but... I'll play some more to get my money's worth, maybe i'll come to like it like Stockholm's syndrome idk.			"

												If ""Waste of Potential"" had its own word and was in the dictionary, Darkest Dungeon would be pictured next to it. Below that would be starbound.Starbound is one of the few games which was more pleasurable to play during beta than release. They took out things that made the game interesting and fun to explore like temperature, randomized planets, and randomized creatures. Those are all gone. Now we have a bunch of in your face drama story that tries to force you along with it by content locking you out of certain things until you do it (This was in beta, but you were pretty much free after the first planet and a mission. Unskippable cutscenes and dialogues full of useless schlock about a run of the mill elder gods story that has any semblance of being mysterious obliterated by shoving it down your eyesockets.I wouldn't say it's bad, but boy did the development team huff some paint when they decided their open world survival and exploration game with a skeleton story needed quest gating and less randomization.

												Art style is very good and building structures is fun; There's a lot of themed furniture and crafting it is not too complicated.Combat is okay but everything less than your current planet tier is pushover and anything above it is instant annihilation. AI is as dumb as it can be and can't find its way out of wet paper bag, so it's no problem to kill enemies.As a result of this, your crew is utterly useless and can serve as minor meat shield at best. Engineers & mechanics, though, quickly improve your ship to maximum where fuel is no longer an issue forever -- so no point in fighting at moons.  This feels very rushed.Different planets are fun to explore... once. After that, it's the same planet over and over. No point in going to second planet of same kind.There's an endless stream of quests generated by settlements, but these quests are very boring and easy: fetch quests, fight quests.The most interesting part is pre-made content: main quest, fixed quest dungeons. Sadly, there's not much of it.Bottom line: if you can entertain yourself for hours building cities just for the sake of it, you'll like this. Otherwise, don't bother. There's close to zero adventure in Starbound.			"

												If steam had a ""neutral"" option for recommending, I'd go for that.Starbound changed like a billion times during development because the devs couldn't decide on what they wanted the game to be. They made a procedural building-exploration game only to realize too late that not tying the key concepts of building and exploring together with something concrete (think Don't Starve, where you build to survive, explore to build and survive to explore further) made the game absolutely barren.There's a billion, a trillion planets. You'll visit 20 of them at best, and forget about 18 of them. One will be your homebase (which you'll never move from, there's no advantage for building multiple bases). 2 or 3 of the same type of planet will be enough for you to gather Resource Lvl 1, upgrade and go to the next type of planet to do the exact same with Resource Lvl 2. Dungeons are literally the same - same enemies, same structure, sometimes even the same loot, dude. You've seen one of each type, you've seem them all. They threw in a story that requires you to explore to try and make you actually explore a planet, because as I've said, other than seeing dungeons/towns for the first time and perhaps nabbing their stuff, nothing presses you to explore. Ores? Weapons? Cash? They will all pretty much just fall into your hands. Open Random Wooden Box #3 and you'll find some weapon with crazy DPS. Open Iron Chest #5, 3 manipulator modules, 200 pixels, etc. Sell your junk and you'll get rich (until the next fall damage-related death). Most quests are random, given by colonists who you make homes for, because for some reason they decided that fixed characters in the Outpost with fixed sidequests was a bad idea? And the rewards for quests are simply ridiculous, being either a manipulator module, some random weapon or whatever, and if you've done enough quests, the colonist becomes a worthless crew member who gets trapped on everything and dies within being 5 minutes on the planet. You don't even need to explore for materials for the best armor in the game - you can just stumble onto random merchants that SELL one of the best sets. They're expensive, but you'll be swimming in cash most of the time.Combat is shoddy. For some reason the game lags as if you were playing on a server all the time - your character moves normally, but monsters and blocks take a second to appear/move/attack, making hits not count a lot of the time. You'll also get ganged on a lot, then try to run and die from fall damage. Fall damage which could have been mitigated with a tech (Bouncy Ball) that they decided to pull from the game and put nothing on it's place. The EPP is a tragedy. Get a couple of bars, craft some mcguffins and you can make an upgrade that allows you to explore some new planets without any sense of accomplishment. It eats your augments - you can't take one back and swap it for another, if you put one in over another the first one is just lost forever, no matter how rare or expensive. Why? Scenarios and a main story were a decent idea, but executed poorly simply by lack of content and by lack of effort. There are 8 (if you count the tutorial) maps where you aren't allowed to break or place anything (can't complain about that) and follow a linear path to a boss. They're pretty, but you won't do much other than kill the odd monster and press the odd button. Puzzles could have helped a lot, but mostly the story and aventure maps fall through on simply not having enough to do. You'll save the universe and kill the Ridiculously Powerful God-Killing Evil Entity in like, 5 hours.Moons are just lifeless gas stations, supposedly 'dangerous' because of the spooky ghost, but you'll only get killed if you stay in place. I have no clue why barren planets are in the game, and asteroids now have no valuable resources. Why they kept the gateways coded in being that after the first 20 minutes you'll have a shortcut to the outpost/ark right on your ship (and the only thing the gateways do is take you back there) is beyond me.Still, Starbound isn't a bad game. You'll have some fun, and if you like building just for the sake of building, there are many pretty blocks and objects to use and collect. Then you'll forget about it and play it again three months later when nothing else in your library looks interesting. As a game developer, Chucklefish is a great publisher. TL;DR: Procedural building and exploration game where building and exploration have no connection whatsoever. Devs realized that making procedural exploration just for the sake of being procedural is a bad idea way too late and put in a story, but it's weak as hell and the game shoves everything you need in your face without having you make any effort whatsoever.

Early Access Review
								Things may change by the actual release, but I seriously doubt it.Starbound strikes me not as the spiritual successor to Terraria, but rather a reskin of it. Let's take first impressions:Okay, character generation. That's pretty cool, we can be humans or bird people (with breasts) or plant people (with breasts) or robots (with breasts)... you get the idea. The customization is a nice factor, as it was in Terraria, but it also has the same gameplay impact: zero. I understand why there are no species differences; it makes balancing the game easy. However, it also means that really 'species' is just another layer of paper-doll customization that does not build on Terraria's gameplay.Oh, I start out on a spaceship? That's cool... and it's out of fuel. Okay, forced plot to form a tutorial. Got it. Go press [E] around some consoles so you can get exposed to visually complex UIs that mean nothing to you at the moment, then press [E] some more to beam down to the surface... which is Terraria again, but with different colors and critters.Now you start out with a 'matter manipulator' which serves as a universal block editor that combines the functionality of axes, picks, and shovels in Terraria. That's a good thing; this is supposed to be a future and future gizmos are cool.However, the matter manipulator is absolute _crap_. It takes ages to collect dirt, of all things, and you have to use it to chop down trees. I hope you like holding down the left mouse button for extended periods of time, because, hoo boy, you're in for some exciting left-mouse-button-holding action.Gameplay proceeds as follows:1) Make a crafting table by collecting wood and then magically generating the table from your back pocket. Like Terraria.2) Make a bow by doing the same thing but now acquire some vines as well. Same back-pocket generation. Like Terraria.3) Use the bow to shoot a critter to get some meat so you don't starve to death. Hey, actual gameplay mechanics that aren't from Terraria! Thing is, Starbound is very particular that you use a bow to kill animals to get food. Hit them with swords? Shoot them with laser beams? Nope, you've somehow made the animal corpse inedible, no meat for you! Use the bow, using the exact same hold-the-button-then-release-when-it-flashes mechanics we've seen in... well, Minecraft, minus the flashing; Bastion, with the flashing... most games with bows, really.4) Cook the space meat over a campfire (crafted as per previous) so you don't get space ringworm. Alright, that's more Minecraft talking.5) Craft a forge by collecting stone (remember, your starting tool sucks!) and then...6) Start crafting wooden tools, as in Terraria.Wooden tools that are better than your high-tech space age matter manipulator.Progression then consists of collecting better materials to build better tools to get better materials and kill bosses along the way.Just like Terraria.All the vaunted 'worlds' mechanic does is change maps out at the cost of fuel (which must be collected) and allow for even more palette swaps, but since this is a game about building materials, the palette swaps mean that you need mineral X for object Q and sorry Mario but the mineral you're looking for is on another planet.If you've played Terraria, you've played this game, pretty much. If you've gone through and beaten all the bosses in Terraria, then you've also inadvertently beaten this game too.			"

								Even as if anyone will even see this review, Don't buy this game if you're looking for: depth of gameplay, non-ridiculously unbalanced prices for VERY low amounts of simple cosmetic building materials, QUESTS, AI interaction of worth, understanding the use of most things untill you grind for the resources that are then wasted. general sense of progression, plot, modding support, updates for bugs or just updates to flesh out already added features at a reasonable rate, intuitive in-game decriptors/explanations, uses/recipes for many general blocks, some form of useful in-game glossary of terms, steam workshop support(mods), and so much more.Basically the game is really worth about $5 USD in it's current state. As I'm not even considering it officially released until the basic features, already in-game, are even attempted to be finished. Only a great game if you LOVE^love playing vanilla survival minecraft on singleplayer for exceedingly long periods, but if the nicest looking building supplies cost 10x the current cost per SINGLE block.

												It's my life... it's now or never... I loved the early access version, even if all intro was just a paragraph explaining DIFFERENT origins. Early access was full of life, landlord managing, struggling combats, 3D printing and a department store. Release version has instead a dragon age 2 intro, void walkings, no terraria management, useless weapons, low inventory spaces with no way to create your stuff and an abandoned square.Just like my real life this is not funny and depresing, look i know this has absolutely nothing to do with the game but i will point it anyways: Before i went to college I was like Alex from Stardew Valley. You know, full of hopes and dreams, always smilling and working out like a psycho. After College I became a broken hearted drunkard full of pessimism that just plays videogames and have sex sometimes with a girl or two, just a carcass of an undead vessel. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS GAME, IT WENT TO COLLEGE, MEET A DREAM GIRL, BROKE IT'S HEART IN PIECES, ABANDONED EVERYTHING IT LOVED TO DO AND IT'S JUST UNDEAD.When i modded this game before was just because I wanted to see other races, maybe having the chozo weapons and prismatic stars as a plus, now i had to MOD IT TO JUST PLAY IT. It was cool that the hunger metter is back, now i have a reason for farming, but what was NOT COOL was forcing minecraft play in order to get that metter, good thing i got a mod that disables loot drop on survival. Miss the old temperature system, and the USEFULL skills like breathers, bounce bubles and such. I had to MOD IT AGAIN to dismiss fall damage in order to beat the first boss.When you have to mod a game TOO MUCH to be enjoyable is not worth your money, third party unsalaried people is making it fun, not the one who is getting your money. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this... is just a carcass of a great early access game.What makes this even worse is that developers are just morons that instead of working on the huge issues in the game keep adding collections just like trying to emulate Banjo Kazooei, but banjo kazooei was fun, had charismatic characters instead of generic ones, and ran smooth. Avoid this at all costs, there are cheaper games like terraria that are light years beyond this piece of spaggetti coded pseudo sandbox.			"

												This game took a long time to get from alpha to beta to still-some-sort-of-beta to we're-almost-done-I-promise to... finished? I started playing Starbound a while ago, disliking it during beta, and now seeing it reach 1.0 has not improved my opinion of it in the slightest. It took a long development hell to get here, and it wasn't even worth trying the game before this point because any character you made would be wiped when the next update came around. Combat doesn't even come close to the diversity and fluidity of Terraria, the occasional varied planets become familiar and uninteresting after a few travels around space, mining is unnecissarily tedious, balance problems in weapons and enemies, strange optimization issues where the game will just freeze for a second and then take all of your inputs during that time, poor quests, missing tech and armor tiers from beta, and more. I can't think of every single problem to list with this game, but it can be summarized by saying that Terraria set a standard Starbound can't match on any level. It's not something that can be described accurately through words, but when actually playing I had a constant feeling of drab emptiness with little fun. Thank you for avian characters, but after almost 40 hours I'm incredibly sick of this game - while it took me 240 hours of Terraria for it to become just 'somewhat boring'. I can imagine the effort that went into making Starbound, but I'm sorry, it's not a good game in my eyes and I have to 100% recommend Terraria over this.			"

								This game is great. Despite being in early stages of BETA it has already proven its worth. Endless procedurally generated planets, monsters and weapons with biome diversity and thousands of items to be discovered or created through crafting. With many content additions and improvements planned, it is a great investment with hundreds of hours of entertainment. Definitely recommend.P.S the starbound soundtrack is amazing			"

												Alright, so from my experiences playing this game I have finally came to a conclusion on what i think about this game, and the more I list these pros and cons, the more I want to actually write a review about. So this is my personal review on Starbound, the game that ruined my want to buy early access games for pretty much forever. So, the progression of this game was a little dissapointing as it felt like the progression that was introduced in the beta, repetative. Literally the main story that the game has is just you going to different planets and trying to find very specific objects randomly put in different villages. But sometimes the objects might not even be there, having you to travel around to more planets simply to find that one last object to complete the main story quests, and this is literally the WHOLE main story quest line. It isn't very engaging and really boring to be doing this over and over again untill... well... when you beat the whole game. Speaking of quests, all the non-main quests are just the same thing. Either ""give someone this"" or ""kill those people over there"", and that's it, and the rewards are no to exciting either. Almost all, if not, every quests in this whole game gives you a reward bag which either gives you a random upgrade module or minipulator module and maybe a vanity item, which makes the reward bag not really worth much as you will find more by simply walking on the surface and opening the chests you find. The boss fights in the main story quest line were alright. I did like the mechanics that some bosses have, but some bosses are just too easy and are not challenging at all, and to give you an example, I was able to beat the Apex and the Glitch boss very easily with no effort at all. The bosses also do not really scale well with the number of players that are there (I would probably bet that their is no scaling at all), which makes bosses EXTREAMLY easy playing with another person. The early game was an issue to me as well. They made early starbound really unnecessarily difficult, because Starbound's enemies are designed to counter the equipment that the developers think you SHOULD have then and not what you ACTUALLY have. So, finding materials for new equipment and armor can be a frustrating experience. and speaking of equipment, they removed a lot of the equipment that you can make. I remember being able to craft war hammers and axes back in the beta but now the only thing you can craft in terms of materials are just swords, but you won't even need them because they are really low on damage compared with item that you pick up from chests and containers you find randomly in the world. So those are my main points to why I don't like Starbound, and their are other issues I have with the game such as: The Hunger system being annoying, The UI being stupid, and the gameplay being boring. But those are my main reasons. But even with that all being said, Starbound is not completly bad, it did have some good stuff in it like the musical instruments and that you can add custom songs for you to play in-game and the ship upgrades to hold all various things of your choosing. So in short: Boring progression, Un-unique Quests, Unchallenging Bosses, and Unbalanced Enemies. I really would not recommend this game to another person because of these reasons, and because of these reasons I do not think I will play Starbound ever again since the game have very little replay-ability. I really hope Starbound gets it fixed, reworked, or something. It had a great foundation and great potential, but in the end, it did not reach my expectations and that the game is not really finished.			"

												I really didn't like this game when it was in the very early stages of Early Access when I last played it, but since so many people seemed to be picking it up now it's finally hit version 1.0, I thought I'd give it another shot.I still don't like it.Atrocious combat, tiny icons that are near-indecipherable and very difficult to distinguish from one another, vague objectives with little to no guidance on how to actually accomplish them and the mind-numbing tedium of digging out a thousand blocks of dirt painfully slowly just so you can get back on top of the hill you fell off... not a fun gaming experience for me, I'm afraid.The pixel art is lovely (albeit tiny at high resolution) and the music is gorgeous, though, so that's something, at least.I can't recommend this in good conscience to anyone but the biggest fans of Terraria, which is a pity, because the concept is compelling and there's a serious dearth of old-school Starflight-style ""explore the galaxy and find stuff"" games in the modern arena. Unfortunately Starbound just doesn't deliver in this regard, placing too much emphasis on the ""mine and craft"" aspect and not enough on trekking across the galaxy -- at least in the early hours. But I feel most people will probably lose interest around their seven thousandth dirt block well before they get their ship to a respectable state and start doing more interesting spacefaring things; I certainly did.

												I've spent a bit of time in this game exploring all side missions and goofing off with my friend and yes we've had great times on this game but as of now I cannot bring myself to recommend Starbound and here's why : Pro's: - Sandbox, you may alter the environment and lay waste to procedurally generated neutral towns as much as you desire- The tech system eventhough there isn't a whole lot of options in it currently (9 upgrades) adds some great secret areas that can only be traversed with the upgrades- The randomized challenge portals are a heap of fun and actually are very diverse from platformers, to trap challenges to actual arenas- Unlocking the markets in the Outpost gives a good sense of progress in a similar way where in Terraria you receive new NPCs - One of the two vehicles in the game are very fun to play around with (the bike), leap over terrain at will!Con's :- Becoming landowner and building a village for rent has the most mundane rewards imaginable. we built a town in a volcanic planet for the higher rewards there and we ended up with incredibly rare and low amounts of pixel payouts and absurd quantities of food, bandages, seeds, ... which didn't seem like much of a reward at all- Random planet generation isn't all that random with each terrain of planet having a gauranteed type of one civilization and slightly different organised village of said type of civilization (Floran, Apex, ...) you'll want to find a neutral and hostile type of each civilization- The main storyline quest is repetitive always following the same recipe: Scan 5-10 objects of the next race, then visit that race's capital in a special 5 minute mission. Do this 5 times, congratulations you have completed Starbounds main ""story""-line.- There are other things being omitted from my review for the sake of not listing the entire contents of the game (such as limited armour, weapons, ...)P.S. If you haven't tried it out yet, Terraria, Craft The World, ... have a LOT more content than this game!+ Approved by friend			"

												I've been attempting to play Starbound since around 9 months before it came out of Early Access. I've endured constant FPS drops, freezes and crashes, all because on those occasions that it runs decently I genuinely enjoy the game. These problems have been reported by several players and acknowledged by the devs on more than a handful of occasions. But they still have not been fixed.Unfortunately the game still freezes and crashes frequently, admittedly not as often on single player anymore, but when using multiplayer it's a real problem. I bought this game to play with friends, but at the moment I'm only really able to play alone. This game should not be out of Early Access yet, far too many bugs still persist. Bugs that have existed throughout Early Access. Bugs that should have been taken care of before the game was officially released.			"

												As someone who, admittedly, has been both on the ""whiteknights"" and the ""haters"" sides of the neverending argument, I can tell you that, as always, the truth is in the middle... but definitely at least inclined towards the negative side.If you buy this game as it is now (don't mind the ""early access"" disclaimer, after this long it doesn't matter anymore) you get a very limited experience with one of its few redeeming qualities being that it looks pretty. If you want to buy the game anyway in hopes that the full version will be better, as someone who has followed development from day one, I think I can almost safely say that these people lack the means and direction to make it the great game they promised it to be, and it's flawed at its core.I still kind of enjoy it, I wish it was better, I wish it was at least 10% of what they promised, and I have some hopes residing in the fact that after a bit of time after the game will be out of beta will have passed, the devs plan to hand it over to a b-team for constant updates, so there's a (still unsafe) bet for the game to express its full potential then I guess.Too bad that at this pace we'll get to see the result of said coin flip in 2088.Anyway, don't get me wrong: it's not like it has 0 content, but the core game is lacking and the devs have taken the abysmal path of trying to develop its basic features and at the same time try to release more pretty furniture and stuff that will get old fast to keep the fans pleased until """"""release"""""". Basically, they are hoping to buy time but in the process they are wasting time, progressing at a snail pace and showing multiple times that they are still unsure about the game's direction.They still get at least a bit of my respect for being relatively new at this and aiming so high, but as of lately they seem like they have relaxed a lot, especially since they can just publish other games to sustain themselves (sounds familiar?).

												There's only so much false promises, cut content, and incompatability that I can put up with.  I had not bothered but if I did write a review sometime last year it would have been possitive - a desparate cling to hope that saner people abandoned years ago. Few games challenge the merits of Early Access as a concept as much as this one. An arbitary legal shield to hide behind lies by means of the ancient english Common Law ""caveat emptor"". Ignore the ~90% possitive reviews, many of those were prior to the repeated backstabbing of Chucklefish and not revised to reflect those scars. But I do find it suspicios that despute the volume of recent reviews there is not a ""Recent:"" Rating as well which would paint a very bleak picture.Oh and those requirements you see on this page? Ignore them. To run this game in 64-bit mode you now need Visual Studio C++ 2015 which may or may not have issues intalling on your computer based on the issues of prerequisite windows updates which may or may not have installed properly, or that your computer for other reasons outright can't process. But even then it might not be enough to avoid the constant frame stuttering at full screen regardless of how powerful your machine is.  The first world you land on now is so toned down it practically gives you the resources you once had to actually prepare for the trek to dig to the core of the world. Beyond that so much content was cut to the point where this feels like 0.1 instead of 1.0. Other reviews go into more detail on this, I suggest you read them.Mods feel more like vital content patches rather than superfluous user created things.  Yes, I know some people will make that excuse, but mods are not part of the game. The extent that modding feels ""necessary"" is just  a testament to how bad of a developer one is. So I won't recomend the game for what extra labor and research on your end will improve it to be, I'm recomending on what this game actually is upon initial installation. If you haven't yet bought the game you might still have fun with it since your mind is not tainted with years, years of false promises, cut content, and character wipes. But wait until like 2018, this game is still Effectively in early access despite the arbitrary 1.0 label and even assuming something that could fairly be described as ""complete"" and somewhat optimized for performance would be finisehd this decade is being too generous. Nothing good is worth of particular note: yes a neat soundtrack that's been there for years. A ""16 bit"" look that will struggle to render at constistently tollerable framerates regardless of your computer's high specs. tl;dr - you aren't getting less-chibi Terraria with a space opera, you're getting disapointment.

								What I tell everyone is this; if you have played Terraria or Minecraft and enjoy 2D sandbox survivals with RPG elements thrown in, just go ahead and get this game.I've loved every minute of it, the devs listen to the community, they support mods, the community itself is solid, and hosting servers works very much like Terraria.It takes a lot of memory to run in comparison to Terraria though, because it's an entire universe, not just one planet with multiple biomes. You can set a home planet, sure, but you'll be planet hopping all over the place, exploring civilizations, dungeons, labratories, building into the skies to reach the asteroids way up above... for a game still in beta, it has won my heart.And a note to everyone that discovered as you walk, you loop around the planet, no, you cannot dig to the center and pop out the other side. It's just the 'bottom' and that's that. *digging through and building through lava is a long process*			"

												Starbound is a decently fun game. Let me say that if you have played Terraria and fully enjoyed it, this game will probably put a bad taste in your mouth. I know that these games are not the same, but they are similar in many ways. They are both adventure games with an open world to explore. The problem with Starbound is that the game does not feel like an adventure. It feels like a massive chore after the first 2-3 story quests, and that is mostly due to boring and repetivitive scanning quests where you scour planets for literally HOURS if you are not particularly lucky looking for quest specific items. These scanning quests are given to you every single story mission, and trust me, they do not get any more interesting or fun. Just stale and annoying. The point of them is to bring you to explore the planets and go on adventures, but adventuring has its own issues. Adventuring is really crippled by the fact that going underground deeply or anywhere below mini dungeons is a huge pain because of boring loot, repetitive enemy types, and the lack of a minimap. It is very easy to get lost underground, and since the loot is mostly worthless, why bother? The loot in this game is mostly just bad due to the procedural generation. The staffs, 1-handed weapons, shields, grenade launchers, shotguns and hammers get outclasses by broadswords, assault rifles, and rocket launchers. The only fix I could give about the boring enemies is to make a larger variety of enemies. A lot of the enemies either charge at you or shoot you. If you stay on the surface and go through the mini dungeons and just collect chest and crate loot it will yield the same result for the most part but feel less tasking.  There are many other overall issues with the game outside of the problems with adventuring. The game is optimized really poorly. The only options to change related to video settings are resolution and the option to use v-sync. My friend who also played this game has a very high end PC and he even had FPS drops during heavy rain and boss fights. Continuing with the multiplayer, it is pretty bad from my experience. If you do not have excellent ping, the multiplayer will be extremely laggy due to more poor optimization. My ping is around 40-60 on average and the lag was still unbearable for a majority of the game. The world also unloads itself after crossing loading zones, so there are many times where you will be standing at an edge of the world waiting for the world to finish loading in. When you get the speeder bike vehicle sometimes the game just becomes a choppy and laggy unplayable mess, and you might as well just get off of the vehicle.  If you do not have a problem with poor optimization for multiplayer and video settings, unfulfilling adventuring, mostly repetitive quests and enemy types, then the games good aspects, which include compelling and challenging boss fights and attractive visuals should do you nicely. Is Starbound fun to play? It is not super fun to play after the first 10 or so hours, but it can still drag you in to finish the story. After finishing this game, I would rather have done another Terraria playthrough.			"

												This is a great game. Really, it's great, don't look at ""Not recommended"".But it's not an adventure-boss-fighting game. It's more of ""make your goal and play stardew valley"".Battles are too boring. Random weapons look cool... First few hundred of em. Eventually you get some ubersword and finish rest of the game with it.Bosses dont even have a second phase (except that one or two which got some new attacks).Plot? Eh, regular ""save the world"" thing, it's okay for sandbox game like that.And on the other hand theres TONS of decorations, different looking blocks, clothes, even some roleplay elements. There's lots of things to do- but you don't need it!Why buuld a house if you can fit everything inside the ship?Why get NPCs if they are almost useless? You can get ship upgrades even without em.Why do farming or mining if you can walk around the planet and get handful of food and ore?-------So.It's a game about farming. If you like stardew valley, if in terraria you always was the guy who builds stuff- buy it.But if you expect a lot of action and cool battles- go back to terraria.Gg.-------A lot of stuff got straight removed since earlier versions.Random mobs? Nah.More tech? Who needs it?Race bonuses? Pfft. Meh.			"

								its awesome... an i think you should definetly get it... maybe wait till closer to the official release tho. if you liked terraria then definetly get it...only problems i got atm is that if you fail the first boss fight its a reall pain to farm all the items needed for it again... you would have alot less of that if multi player is up but at the moment i dont see how to set that up yet.. isnt really clear.however this is an Early Access Game so that;ll definetly be improved at the official launch.

												I guess it's cool the devs pushed through to get this game out of Early Access hell, but the end product has a very mediocre progression to it. Exploration is great! But the combat is lackluster and construction is more tedious than Terraria. Some mechanics aren't explained well and don't make sense. Much of the game is unpolished and full of fluff that means nothing. Spent plenty of time in it, but just burns you out because the content is wide, but shallow. You run around and experience a bunch of cool new things, only to realize that there just isn't much depth to any of them. Worth $15? Yeah probably.Reached its potential? Not by a long shot =/			"

The time it takes to upgrade it, is not one I am willing to make again.  I wish I could just play a sandbox version, with some regular mobs to make it interesting.			"

												Gave it lots of thought if I should write a review at all. I am sure this game has some depth and can be fun...eventually.But if I am completely honest, the first hours are ridicilously frustrating and tedious. You should have fun exploring and experience at least some kind of adventure. And given this genre I expect just that, to have fun.I ran past around 5 to 10 worlds that, yes - sometimes have a different feel, because they are inhabited by different civilizations - but I also stumbled past 3 different starting planets that are basically the same planet. Then you have a little chuckle here and there, because of the different towns and races, but thats that. The core gameplay is just the same all over the place. Boring Sidequest and worlds that look different, but feel the same.  Basically I dig for minerals (takes 5 minutes until you reach the end), then try to get up, because I can't teleport out and die in the process. In my gamemode I additionally then drop all the ressources and never get them back (because you drop healthkits and food and torches while dropping dead). Additionally the fighting in close quarters feels heavily frustrating and klunky.Obviously it might get better with time. But the past hours just were horrible.TL;DRFirst 2-3 hours were fun exploring a new world in Terraria-Style.Then I basically got stuck searching for something new to do on worlds that feel recycled, small  and shallow.The digging and exploring at this point feels tedious and the movement/combat system straight up isfrustrating.Someday I might give this game a chance again, plus it might be not thaat bad. But right now, I have to ask myself ""Is this game fun?""No.			"

												I played Starbound a number of years ago and found it an enjoyable evolution of Terraria's sandbox/exploration concept, but it was clearly incomplete, so I set the game aside to wait for a proper release; I didn't even mind the long delay in development, since it suggested a better final product, but sadly the 1.0 release of Starbound still has an unacceptable lack of polish, and it fails to live up to the potential of being a successor to Terraria. It's in fact a clear step backwards from Terraria in many aspects:Annoying, poorly designed UI: unintuitive hotbar, panels always re-centering and being in the way, common items like food not stacking, hotbar items also taking space in the inventory, no convenient indicators for food spoiling, trashing spoiled food taking several clicks, no item search, no stack all function, slow unskippable cutscenes, visited planets not marked, no minimap, etc. Floaty controls; bad in a game that relies on jumping.Poor optimization: a PC that can smoothly run a game like GTA V on high settings shouldn't see the performance drops that Starbound has in busy areas or when zooming out.Lack of monster variety: everything's either a charging, flying or jumping monster or a humanoid; no minibosses; also almost nonexistent monster AI and pathfinding.Overall lack of balance: slow growing or replanted crops are pointless; farming is tedious, can't be automated and yields much less pixels than looting weapons; even mining can be supplanted by looting or buying ores; quest rewards are disproportional to the time investment, etc.Unsatisfying progression: too few tiers of upgrades, grindy main quest line, weird limitations for craftable weapon types at different tiers.Features that are tacked-on gimmicks, such as the ship crew, the (non-)challenges, the boring moons that are solely there for mining fuel, or all the fetch/escort side-quests.Halfbaked features like the gates that all lead to the Outpost.Lack of useful tips about important features like the quest objective compass, the scan quests also progressing by talking to NPCs, etc.Disjointed world: events like the boss fights are confined to non-sandbox instances, so it doesn't properly feel like part of the actual game; no interesting world events.Trite story and writing.Choppy map loading; the player will get stuck on the edge of the screen when moving too quickly, like with the hoverbike.The one upside of Starbound is the nice art style, but otherwise this release fails to live up to the hype or what could reasonably be expected from a game after 5 years in development. It's even questionable how much can be salvaged by mods, given the technological issues the game has. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state; you'd have a much better time trying out Terraria instead and revisiting Starbound if/when it's actually designed with a proper vision.

												It's been out 2 years since I reviewed this game, so I figured i might as well go and update it. Once again, I find myself getting into Starbound, even after the hundreds of hours i've invested during EA. Starbound really is a magnificent game, and it's got about everything one could want and more as a sandbox-survival game. For those who compare Starbound to Terraria, in terms of content at the moment I'm not sure but i think Starbound has more, while as on the other hand Terraria is extremely polished in what it does have. But keep in mind that Terraria has gone through constant iterations as it is currently version 1.3, while Starbound just released and is 1.0. I really like how the devs added a story as well, and the updated hud looks great in my opinion. The gameplay is very similar to Terraria, except for the fact that Starbound contains missions, which are essentially dungeons you fight through with a boss at the end. Combat is really enjoyable and with the energy system, it ends up being a lot more than spam clicking or holding your mouse. I find the game really fleshed out and I have to give my hat off to the devs for all the hard work which can be seen on the Starbound blog. 10/10 I would recommend.			"

												The game was extremely promising at first, it was fun and offered a lot of agency to the  player in their  choices. Then they added the quest system, which I personally was not too fond of, as it diminished a lot of  the original charm of  being a sandbox game. To go along with this, the quests are nowhere  near useful to the game nor engaging to the player. They are MMO quests. Another reason I have come to dislike it is the recent buffs to melee weapons that make using ranged weaponry absolutely worthless and pointlessy time consuming. The game has come to almost Cookie-Clicker levels of ""Watch a number go up!""This game went from ""Starbound"" to ""Differences in Scale-bound.""			"

I really wanted this to be a SciFi Terraria, but, based on the last 8 months or so, it probably won't like that. At least not for another 12 months.

Posted: December 25, 2016
												So I got this game some two years after playing Terraria, and I was expecting somewhat similar experience from it. At first I was pretty happy with Starbound as it has a story and clearly defined objectives where Terraria was more of a sandbox and ""figure it out yourself"" kind of game. I spent hours in Terraria digging and upgrading my gear as everything I crafted felt like it made me more powerful, in Starbound most crafted items are worse than what you find looting settlements. There is no opposition to stealing anything not bolted down in this game. You go in to some race's city and loot every container you can find, you can even take their appliances and furniture without a peep from the owners. This has made crafting nearly obsolete, the second thing that hurts crafting is the material progress. To get better gear you have to go to later plantes which you unlock only though story quests. In between story quests you have to farm (ore in Starbound is scarce and spread out at random underground) materials to get a set of next level gear or you will get obliterated by the next story quest boss. Rinse and repeat multiple times to get to the story final. This woudnt have been so bad if it wasnt such a chore most of the time. combat is not about thinking but gear and reflexes, weapons mostly suck and the most effective way I have found to defeat enemies is dual daggers simply because they can ""stunlock"" enemies due to very fast attack speed. Purple items are more of a curiosity than actually useful weapons. And final mechanic that killed the game for me was fall damage. I dont remember if Terraria had it at all, and if it did it did not seem to bother me, in Starbound I died ten times more often from falling than the medicore fights... Not worth the money, even discounted. Wish I saw that before I hit the 2 hour mark and lost my refund option.			"

With the new cookie cutter creatures, that went out the window. Now it is the same boring creatures every few biomes.  Imagine playing Dark Souls where you are one hit away from killing a boss. You had grinded up  to prepare for the fight. Just for you character get killed from the game freezing up. That is Starbound every ten minutes. Grind, grind, grind, hoarding, death, then restart.

												Great job Chucklefu--fish, you've managed to completely sterilize this game of any amount of ""fun"" it might've had back during the beta days. Assuming the game even runs properly now (gotta love ""full release"" games that crash more than they did in beta testing) I can't even force myself to sit through the main storyline because of how obnoxiously lazy, forced, and unintuitive it's been so far. ""Go from planet to planet to planet to find random crap to scan for 'plot'"" ""Fight♥♥♥♥♥♥easy mostly-scripted bosses in premade arenas"" ""Grind materials to unlock materials to unlock materials to unlock materials"". Seriously, it feels bad since I've been eager about this game ever since it finally got announced and from the start it's been nothing but disappointment after disappointment. It's obvious you guys have been putting tons of work into it with the old nightly builds, so why doesn't that seem to show ANYWHERE? Things like combat have been revamped numerous times and we're still left with ""left click to hit them or right click to do something else"". Enemies still either just charge you, or spit something at you. Now, the monsters on planets don't even feel unique since there's a list of premade ones that seem to dominate everywhere I go. Ship design isn't even remotely interactive and most of them end up clunky and awkward to navigate after a few upgrades. You even got rid of gathering different colored dirts to use. I can list off a hundred more things if I felt like anybody cared enough to read through them.And, the biggest insult, I feel, is that this is considered the 1.0 full release. I'm sure there will still be content updates, but now this is the game. The only way I could see myself enjoying it is if I just installed a dozen mods, at which point I'd rather just go play something that didn't need modded to hell and back to be decent.			"

												I'm going to be honest now; brutally honest. I've played the game literally since it came out, no, not this offical release, but the Early Access way back when.Starbound 1.0 is fantastic. It's a game you should definitely pick up if you love: -Adventure-Exploration-Procedurally Generated Stuff-Space-Terraria-Aliens-2D Sandbox adventures-Different PlanetsIt really is the be all and end all of the 2D Space-Exploration/Sandbox hybrid; I doubt anything is going to come close to it in years. The art style is fantastic and the Soundtrack is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous, there are very few faults I can find with the game. Unfortuantely... I can find some.Like I said, I've been playing since Early Access first started, the initial story was significantly different to the one you're presented with today; it was much more barren and more of a ""Lone Spaceman"" type of game. That carried with it a sense of daunting adventure that just isn't felt much today, the Universe was literally yours to explore and tame, it was fantastic and it made you feel free. Going into full release, the story has unfortunately become significantly more generic, before each race used to be distinct, if you were a Human, you had escaped the destruction of your world, Apex had fled from the totalitarian government etc. now you're basically just Starfleet and that's taken away some of the charm for me.My only other real gripe between full release and early access is actually to do with one of the systems in the game. Tech. It's actually funny how previously when I played, tech was taken for granted. Unfortunately going forward, Chucklefish have seen to remove some of the more interesting techs from the game (as far as I can tell), things like Gravity Bubble are no more and we have to make do with a double jump - once again, this is a shame but definitely does not ruin the game in any way, shape or form. It's brilliant and I can see myself racking up many more hours as I go.TL;DR: Despite the removal of some interesting features, the game in its current iteration is definitely the best it has been; it's worth full price and is practically a steal if you can get it on sale.

												I heard most of the gamers around me saying ""Starbound? Pff... Don't bother with it. Play something else instead, like Terraria.""So I didn't bother with it until I played Stardew Valley (which is also developed by Chucklefish). SV was in pretty good shape and I enjoyed playing it, and by the time I got enough of it, I heard that Starbound had massive patch. So I thought 'yeah, SB should be in a good shape by now' and started playing it.So, was SB in a good shape? Well, hardly. There is small annoyance everywhere which bothers the player, and those annoyance altogether makes player frustrating. Here are pros and cons (there were errors with my previous review regarding hunger system, and I added pros after playing more, 17/1/1).Pros:1. Lore-friendly If you like collecting in-game lore and like reading storylines and books, Starbound provides much better experience than Terraria.2. Delicate pre-generated worldPre-generated world contains buildings such as medieval castle, Japanese style manor, western style village, apocalyptic backgrounds, and many others. They are in decent shape too. 3. Pokemon! Um... wait, Starmon? You can catch hostile monsters and neutral creatures. Monsters can be summoned to aid you in battle and both monsters and creatures can be displayed for the sake of... well, displaying. It is always fun to add new creatures and monsters to collection.4. Relative ease of getting boxesIt looks like many boxes generates closer to surface, not deep dark underground. So you do not have to dig 30 minutes to get a single box which contains useless junk. Boxes do generate in deep dark underground too, so if you like digging, you can still dig.5. More NPC interactionsYou can do quests and hire non-hostile NPCs, and they actually do help while you progress through the game. Only thing I don't like is that once you dismiss your hired NPCs, they are gone for good, and there is no way to retrieve them.Cons:1. No minimapAre you serious? No minimap? I died while navigating through underground lavaland, and it took me bloody 40 minutes to get to the deathpoint. I almost deleted the bloody game. If no-minimap play is intended by the dev, I have no idea how no-minimap can make SB more enjoyable. If it is not intended, but is just not there, well, what a horrible dev we got here.2. Hunger systemIf well used, hunger system can add decent amount of tension and challenges to players, and gives extra contents to do of course. I think a game such as Don't Starve did great job at doing so. Is it well used in SB? I do not think so. It is horribly annoying to see your character starving while you are shopping in the middle of town or managing inventory in your house or spaceship. What makes it worse is that most of the food (if not all) and more than half of the ingredients won't stack. Which makes food inventory management one tedious chore.Yes, you can turn it off by choosing easiest difficulty; and you lose solid contents by doing so. Devs could make it less annoying by applying differentiated hunger-gauge depleting system, and more enjoyable by reinforcing food buff with different ingredients. If there were glow buff, I would eat it all the time, but right now, the only buff I care about is speed buff. 3. No pauseThere is no way to pause the game. So if pizza delivery is at your front door, you either need to exit the game, or use console which makes your character invincible (/admin), or let your character stand in the middle of dangerous planet, hoping no monsters show up and massacre the character. If you want to grab a drink from a fridge or go to bathroom, you either need to exi... well, you get the point.4. BlueprintsGathering ingredients itself is already hefty amount of work, and you need to farm blueprint also. Acquiring blueprints is based on rng, so good luck farming the blueprint. 5. Boss playUnlike Terraria, you do not summon bosses. Instead, you go to pre-set boss stage, and the path is guarded by minions and traps. Of course, you cannot dig through or add blocks to the stage, and the process is a lot like the good ol' Megamen. Buuut, you know, if I wanted to play such game, I would go and play Megamen instead - which is solely dedicated to such playstyle, thus more refined - not Starbound. So, if you wanted to build grand arena, and have deathmatch with summoned bosses... well, sorry pal, there is no such content in Starbound.It is not that I do not like such playstyle, but solely providing such boss is just disappointing for a game which is heavily focused on dig & build.6. Limited mobility and sightI can understand limiting the mobility and sight until midgame. But if the limitations persist even after the player reaches endgame, it is just annoying. Even with all the tech upgrades and best gears equipped, you would feel like you are crawling if you played Terraria. Sight gets better with Light EPP Augment, but in exchange for other awesome EPP buffs you can have. And in certain areas, it is really hard to tell a difference between background and real blocks. There exists difference between tension and annoyance; former one makes the game more challenging while the latter makes game like a mixed chunk of anger and frustration.I feel like the dev made SB feel like annoyance, not tension. Games like Terraria, Don't Starve, and Darkest Dungeon did great job at creating tension. From such games, the dev should learn the difference between unnecessary annoyance and challenging tension. Right now, I'm spending most of my playtime catching monsters, building grand colonies, plantation, and monster zoo; and those are relatively enjoyable, except that I constantly suffer from blueprint farming, no-pause system, and hunger alarm. If someone asks me if I would recommand Starbound, well, I would recommand if (and only if) the person has nothing else to do in Terraria and can withstand playing Terraria with lowest tier wing and hook, and without waterwalking / lavawalking / featherfall.

""Find Clues to Locate the Floran Artifact""The words reverberated in my skull, haunting me hours after I first saw them. No, it wasn't because this was the 4th fetch quest i've done in a few hours, and no, it was also neither the crushing defeat of having to use the poorly implemented scan function, but instead it was the realization that this was the first quest I would have on my own. Until now, the world of starbound had held my hand to a sickening degree, and finally it's letting me roam the world free. Shouldn't I have been excited? That's what I initially thought, but slowly it sunk in that I had no idea how rough or perilous the generation of these ""Floran Artifacts"" would be, and I had an entire universe to explore.Eventually, I got over it. Once upon a time, I had an exploration on a planet called ""Terraria"", and even though it's graphics were bad and pixels too large, it taught me that sometimes it was more about the experience than the destination. So I applied that to Starbound, and let the universe take me where it wanted to go. So to the ship's console I went, and I ended up exploring the star systems for quite some time. Nothing popped out at me, everything seemed to be a copy pasted description and randomly generated name- I really should see if S.A.I.L can come up with something more original. But eventually I found something quite extraordinary- an ""Ancient Gateway"" orbiting the Al Thaliman Waste star. Could this be a portal to a challenging land full of epic loot? Or some sort of summoning circle to spawn a giant beast of great importance? My Hylotl feelers quivered in anticipation.But the more immediate problem was fuel. This star system was a far ways away, as ancient gateways weren't exactly common... And I needed 500 fuel to get there. Sending my ship to the nearest moon pronto, I then realized that I had never been on a moon before. I crafted a backpack that allowed me to breathe in space, so the lack of atmosphere wasn't a problem, and the lack of immediate-kill-fall-damage was really refreshing. I explored around the moon, collecting mcguffin ore, when I had realized that there was nothing TO explore. Maybe it was a bit hopeful of me to assume something deep and exciting would happen on a place so desolate, but the only thing I found was the ghost from bubble bobble, which proved to be nary a threat if I went slightly faster than a slow jog. But to put it short- if there is literally no point to moons other than to tediously mine a resource, why are they even in the ga- I mean universe?After collecting my fuel needed, I finally blasted off. I was so excited, but kept a reminder in the back of my head that thus far, there was nothing interesting or enjoyable about my experience exploring the stars thus far. But maybe this was the start? As I walked up the steps of the ancient gateway, the air started to hum in an epic chord. This is it. This is what I had been waiting for. I put my 20 core shards in and it prompted me to teleport to an unknown destination, and so I did......Right back to the outpost you get at the start of the game. Next to me was the smug granny in a floating wheelchair, expecting me to give her my useless scan information that would likely lead to my next fetch-quest. Was this a glitch in the universe? A mistake? I pulled up my space-watch and checked the Universal Wikipedia, and sure enough, Ancient Gateways had no other use at all ""Thus Far"". Disgruntled, I kicked a can down at the penguin who wanted me to help beat an impossible UFO and retreated back to my ship.I visited many other planets nearby to help get my mind off the sour experience. I went to an ocean planet, which was probably my favourite experience in this entire journey. Falling to the sea floor and finding abandoned underwater cities was no doubt a thrilling experience. Of course, like everything else in starbound, it was empty and desolate and full of crates with swords and gear only slightly better than what I already owned. I went to a radiation planet to get durasteel for upgrades to my furnace, and there I found a ton of eyeballs and monsters that dealt extremely high damage to me despite being the exact same monsters I fought 20 minutes previous. Maybe the radiation on the planet inflated their ""Artificial Difficulty"" values in their DNA to extremely high levels? I shuddered at the thought of the same happening to me if I didn't have this protective suit. I also visited a ton of forest planets, what the woman in the wheelchair recommended to me, and didn't find any floran artifacts. I did however, find an avian airship, and stole all of their stuff while none of them cared.Bored, depressed, and without direction, I sat in my overly cramped spaceship and wished of home. Since you bounce around from star to star so often, there is literally no point to making a home base- leaving everything you need cramped up in your ship with no obviously apparent way to make your ship bigger. I found a bunch of crafting recipies for making stuff like doors and chairs, and that only made me long a proper bed and breakfast more than sleeping on the cold floor of my spaceship since I can't even fit a proper bed. I pondered on things. Was the fish that greeted me whenever I woke up laughing at me because I spent 17 dollars space-canadian on this miserable trainwreck of a ship? Was the granny sending me out to desolate wastelands with nothing interesting on them to do tedious quests just to show me the inevitability of life being meaningless? No. I had to prove them wrong.I set my space ship to go to a firey star. Orbiting these stars were the most dangerous planets out there, scorched wastelands and burning cinders full of dangerous life (apparently). Also with this came great riches, namely Solarium, Violium, and Aegisalt. I didn't bother crafting upgrades to my anvil to do anything with these, but at least they'd look pretty in my ship once I smelt them into bars! ""WARNING: TEMPERATURE EXTREMELY H-"" I ignored S.A.I.L's warnings. It was a useless annoying machine anyways. But lord, it was hot down there. I could feel my feet burning as soon as I beamed down, slowly dying even though my spamming of medpacks. Looking around was an abandoned destroyed city, with raiders everywhere shooting at me. This was it, excitement at last! My health slowly sapping, I considered retreat- but reminded myself of the tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I would have to go through just to craft the equipment to come back safely. I pressed on, dodging bullets and opening crates... Realizing that this was the exact same thing I had been doing this entire time. Distracted by this thought, a stray shot hit me in the back. I was on the edge of life and death, burning alive as the hot metal scorched into my back, vision slowly blurring as I screamed out my final words in pain and agony...♥♥♥♥ you, Chucklefish!OOC: HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥WHY THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ IS THE UI IN THIS GAME SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TERRIBLE EVERYTHING IS IN A DIFFERENT MENU AND THERES SO MANY MENUS AND EACH MENU YOU HAVE TO PRESS A DIFFERENT BUTTON TO OPEN AND THERE'S MENUS TO NAVIGATE WITHIN MENUS WHY IS EVERYTHING SO HORRIBLE AND OVERORGANIZED JESUS CHRIST THIS IS AWFUL "

												I bought this game fairly early in the develepment procces and got to see it change but this newest one i hate crafting takes time now whoever thought that up should get fired you may think you can deal with that you will just browse whatever else you want to craft but you can't click off of the item you are crafting you have to sit there staring at somthing and wait for it to craft. mining is still boring so there is that food doesn't stack anymore and in combat your better off just building a wall around whatever it is that is attacking you the pros are there is a story and now you can craft just about every building block so you build a cool house after you craft everything one at a time.

												So far it's been like a bad Terraria - if you get to play it that is. Very buggy and took hours to start after I found a way from the forum. Fullscreen is still unavailable for reasons beyond me and apparently for the developer also.The game itself is pretty much like Terraria in space. Compared to Terraria there's a story of sorts and a soundtrack that doesn't drive you nuts - but it lacks the atmosphere that made Terraria awesome. The mobs look like pokemon and the urge to dig in and find shelter is just not there. The quickbar is a mess and for some obscure reason food does not stack so eating is a chore. Get Terraria instead.			"

												Is it any good? How would I know? Admittedly, I have an old GPU, but for a 2D game I am downright impressed that Starbound manages to overheat my GPU to the point that my computer shuts down to prevent damage (100C within a few minutes).  The problem is markedly worse as of 1.0. Probably an edge case; it's probably doing some random thing my GPU happens to not like, but it's pretty garbage that there is (no longer) an option to choose between DirectX and OpenGL. Don't know if that would fix anything because I can't check. With a 2D, single-threaded game, though, I somewhat expect that I should be able to run the game perfectly even with software rendering, so why is it setting my GPU on fire?			"

												Starbound . now in full version is kinda frustrating.When you start a game you get a huge tutorial in the beginning that you cant skip (and i mean the spacestation missions, go there. collect 10 of this and that, use some basic items in a mission to see how they work etc)This is a 2d pixel sandbox-explore-fight-make-create-game. It doesnt feel like that in the slightest anymore.I like the idea that there are quests, i dont like the idea of beeing shoved in to it.Exploring starts when you completed most of the quests and farm a moon in your area for fuel.Theres a big tutorial, now my big question : Why give me items that i cant use and i dont have a explanation over in the beginning? Example =Ship expander module. Great.Found one.So.Yeah.Dead item for some time, i readt that after a long questline that you can use it.It feels very linear and unexplained despite all the basic explaining in the beginning.When im in a 2d pixel game that is supposed to be a sandbox and a place for adventure, dont shackle me to basic left and right-tutorials or questlines that say :"" can you bring me 10 ore?"" This is not the Antichamber . Its not complicated. Every 5 year old understands this game. Please dont take my little shovel from me and tell me to search for stones for your castle in MY sandbox. And give me back my colourful sand molds that you took away from me (vehicles, race items, legendary items)			"

												I bought the game in 2013 when the game became available, and it looked good and promising. Now, 3 years later, it is labeled ""released"" but is pretty much all the same we had then, sans the ""good and promising"" part.The game had not much to do initially - the usual ""explore, dig, fight"", but was kinda bad, shallow and repetitive at the latter two. Fast-forward: still nothing to do.One version after another devs just keep shuffling stuff around; without adding any gameplay value.  Remove hunger, add hunger. Add buffs, nerf buffs to the point you won't bother with them. Add lots of different weapons, dumb down armor mechanic so different weapons don't actually make a difference, just raw DPS. Remove asteroid bases, remove jetpacks, remove half of the techs, nerf the other half, remove crossbows, remove, remove...Multiplayer sucks at multiplaying: most of the gameplay is legwork, and it is more rewarding to play alone, because leggin is no faster no matter the party size and you'd have to share, and you can do all that alone anyway.  Locations of interest are easy and enemies don't respawn there, so you actually spend more time finding a dungeon then running one. Some versions of combat used to work with team tactics, like front-runner with a shield covered by a gunner - I found that to work poorly in 1.0, now it's ""smash and blast and shoot everything wildly"".Monsters in general are scarce and not a challenge, and underground trips are even less a challenge because mobs are stupidly easy to avoid (compare that to Terraria with teleporting, wall-passing, rainbow-spitting monsters). In fact, 1.0 has much, much, much less monsters with ranged abilities then previous version, which is distressing.They also made a huge chunk of furniture non-printable, also a form of content degradation. Oh, and high-tiered furniture - all gone.I may missed some more points, but it's already ridiculous enough. BORING. Stay away.			"

												The game still feels very unfinished, and I find myself frustrated more often than having fun. The earlygame weapons are weak, and monsters do a ton of damage: you spend ages grinding resources for healing items just so you won't die constantly. Especially when you don't have invincibility frames: a group of enemies pouncing you at the same time will simply decimate you immediately.I heartily recommend Terraria over Starbound, even if you have played it some years ago already.

												Bought this during early access because I thought it was going to be like terraria. Exploring sandbox with some roleplaying, great music, combat, bosses and so on. What I got was something... completely else. At least what it feels like.Where do I begin? A cons pros list?Pro:Music is fantasticA lot of planets(somewhat) living world with NPCs giving you questsBuild a colony on a shipLots of instrumentsModsLots of biomesCons:Combat is awfulMovement is awfulSidequests to make a colony are very very repetative (kill x, transport this, talk to this guy, find and craft x)Main story is SHORT. And by short it's really shortBoss fights aren't even engaging, it feels like all bosses are pretty much the sameLast boss is just a bulletsponge. Nothing remarkeable, it's just the same pattern over and over again with other monster spawns. There is one boss (the first) who has at least a unique way to defeat it. The rest is just whack it until it diesUnskipable cutscenesWeapons barely differ. There are only a few weapons that actually are different and even then, the armor is what makes the big difference of weapon strengthIt takes only a few hours to get the best armor in the game and thus almost maxing your damage output and character progression (Get 2k pixels, buy 1 fire and 1 ice fluffalo, kill some enemies for a living root and poison sample, you can now access all EPP'S and thus get all ore within a 2-4 hours)Monsters aren't that... diverse. It's pretty much the same over and over again with a new enemy model.The shallow combat, boring bosses, fast character progression and the repetative just does not make the game fun at all. I found it pretty comfy to make a base in my ship but that's about it. Mods might make the game better but it's just not good enough on its own.			"

												Ahhhhh, Starbound. You're finally out. 2 and a half years in Early Access. But I'll try not to dwell on that time period for this and focus on what the 1.0 update has brought so far.The good:They've focused on the story a little more since the last EA release. There's more pre-determined guaranteed stuff in your starting world, and a little intro quest that helps out newbies. It was alright.The bad:Unskippable cutscenes are my favorite! And they added a hunger system that was originally removed VERY early on in the development of the game because it was downright frustrating (and still is). The default difficulty also will have you drop all of your food, blocks, and other important items. You keep only your weapons and armor and a few other basic things, from what I've seen. It's not fun and there's no easy way to get back to your corpse at all. There's an extra arbitrary layer to crafting anything now because you need a special crafting bench to craft other kinds of crafting benches and everything requires slightly more resources. Making armor seems to have been bumped up a decent amount in resource requirement, and to get those resources, you deal with tedius mining, or enemies that deal far too much damage to start out with. Otherwise, customizing and building things is... kind of fun, but feels pointless on planets because you know you'll be leaving and you could just make room for farming on your ship, so the only thing you'd need is trees (which you can find on any planet). All in all, the 1.0 update is actually among the bad ones the game has gotten, and it was more fun the last time I played it. Even then, it was easy to burn out on.And just a small reminder, but if the devs say something'll be in a future patch even now after release, don't bother hoping they'll deliver.			"

Stopped playing for a little bit before 1.0 after they just got in the mission system and boss battles.Now after 1.0 the UI changes are absolutely terrible.  A lot of getting in and out of the inventory, 6 buttons? Really?Survival mode is just your attending to your hunger bar while you quest/grind for 5 hours before you can play the game proper.While I admire the effort I can not recommend this game... it's just too dull, boring, and tedious it's first few hours to be truly enjoyable.

												Let's not kid ourselves, guys: The progression in this game basically stops after completing the first system and then just repeats itself until the end of the game. The first sword you built that was capable of dealing with Tier 1 enemies is going to have an almost identical version of it in the next crafting tier, as is every other piece of equipment. The enemies being randomized sounds cool and is as far as the sprite-mixing goes, but it really just results in a bunch of nice looking enemies with boring and mixed up attack patterns and pretty much guarantees that the planets in the next system aren't any more difficult outside of a fairly dull stat scaling. This randomness makes the game's progression dull and samey and creates most of the issues that make the game boring to play. Unlike Terraria, there aren't any dangerous and well planned out locations to explore that are tied to the game's progression; If you're lucky, you'll manage to get 6 hours out of it before seeing all the unique content. If you're luckier still, you won't have stuck around after that 6 hours trying in vain to find the cool, limitless content that the developers promised but never delivered on.Here's to hoping that they fix it. They certainly could, and the game does have potential, but at this point it looks incredibly unlikely.As of 1/2/2016:The above is still true. The game has been made *marginally* less boring through some additions to it's design, but it's still as bland as ever on the content end of things.As of release:It's a little more bearable to play now but hey ~You'll never guess what still hasn't changed~!I rate this game 2.5 out of 5 broken development promises.

												[This review is currently lacking information due to being pre 1.0, disregard until it is updated]This is my review, take what you will from that thumbsdown or press read more to see my judgement at the bottom of the review.Let's make things simple, I will put down everything I experienced by owning this game.I played for like 3 days straight when it first launched. No mods, just vanilla. The vanilla version back then was fine.(if only lacking in replayability) I had gotten all tiers of armor and been about my merry way through the universe. After killing the bosses that were meant to be killed, things got boring. I played with friends maybe once or twice. Those times either dealing with server problems that would randomly pop up or simply just pass away the time. I come back a few years later and see this game still has not penetrated the barrier of early access. I check the recent updates to find the bosses are mostly gone aside from Dreadwing. Sure, they added in some other ones that don't just poof in out of thin air like the echirus crystal thing. And on the subject of boss changes, there is a quest system now. (though it's mostly, ""go get x for me"") Overall it just feels like the game's progression has become more padded than a room in a mental hospital. I honestly hope that the game is better than this whenever it actually gets out of early access. I have to say though. Starbound fell a far bit from how it was before, even if that previous build was not perfect it was better than this.Now for the part you read through all that crap for. Buy or not? The answer is no. Until this game actually makes it out of Early access and has some substantial changes to make the game have some replayability. Otherwise, it will just be another game that you maybe play with your friends once in a while or only check when it has a ""big update"" with some ""new content"" to look at.Ultimately the decision is yours. While it may only be 15 dollars that you spend, keep in mind this game had 1 million+ in funds. Maybe you should support a game with a slightly more in touch dev team.PS. Mods shouldn't count towards the game's score, neither should unstable dev builds.			"

								This is one of my favorite games in a long time. There is so much to do and it's only in the beginning stages of beta. I am excited to see more treasure and more races come along. Weapon stats are random and give longevity to the game; and ship size will be expanded in order to store treasures. I am really excited about the game and waiting to see how far it will come. There are a lot of bugs right now, but it is very much playable and 15 dollars for the time being.			"

								Large as an ocean, deep as a puddle.I liked the first few hours, but it goes stale fast. There's no goal or lore to keep you going with a purpose. Exploration boils down to: Destroy everything you can use later with your overpowered mining machine of death. No unique gear to search for, just weapons with a random name, stats, and ability that all of the others can have. A shallow colony system. Pointless ship expansion (I have all the crafting stations i'll possibly need, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of chests to store anything I don't wanna carry, and I expanded once.Side note: I put 6 hours into building a colony to look as beautiful as possible, and im rewarded with a little bit of cash and assorted fruits from my residents for my efforts. I love the idea of making towns and populating the savage lands, but make it rewarding and fair. I can't even make an ocean planet colony on the islands with having tons of enemies swarming the town.Other side note: You can pick Terraria for like $2.99 (on sale) and get over hundreds of hours on it (like I do) versus $10 for 20 hours. Buying it now is like an investment for a game that actually becomes great later.Ideas to fix it's current state: Add more unique weapons (like Terrara's wide arsenal). Make colonies give better rewards and make areas with residents less likely to spawn mobs. Add actual lore.			"

Update to 1.0 somehow managed to turn a boring game into an absolutely tedious game.Let me start by saying I supported this game in Early Access.  I love the idea of Terraria in Space, and I've had a lot of fun playing the beta over the years.  But you have got to be kidding me.Remember how the hunting bow wasn't really powerful enough to kill anything in less than three hits?  Good news everyone!  Now it still takes three hits, but you have to lead your target because you can't just fire at an enemy right in front of you, you ALWAYS have to do this stupid indirect fire ballista thing no handheld weapon has ever done in real life before!  Oh, and you can kill five enemies in a row and it still won't drop any meat.Remember how they tried everything they could think of, from making wooden platforms randomly collapse to bribing the player with resource veins that lead back to open tunnels, to stop players from drilling straight down to skip past the tedious, tedious intro planets?  Good news everyone!  Now they suggest it right there in the tutorial, but because wooden platforms now cost PLANT FIBRE, you have to♥♥♥♥♥♥around on this useless planet for literally days of RL time just to grow any.Remember how virtually EVERY scripted sequence in Starbound history, from the ""build an item to summon a mini-boss"" phase to the release of the zombie moonbase, was always an exercise in painfully linear frustration that instantly brought the crafting and upgrading to a screeching halt?  Good news everyone!  Now the game STARTS with one of those, and you literally CAN'T GET YOUR MATTER MANIPULATOR until you go through this stupid intro sequence.  There's a ""skip intro"" button, thankfully, but why isn't there a ""skip the game's artifically-imposed limitations"" button?Remember how the Man of Steel movie ruined the Superman franchise forever by making Superman pretty much powerless to prevent millions of people from dying?  Good news everyone!  Now YOU'RE that useless hero!  The intro sequence said so!How is it possible that no matter how much blood sweat and tears the developers pour into this game, it just keeps getting worse and worse?  It's not that hard, Chucklefish.  We just.  Want.  To build.  Stuff.  In space.  That's the entire premise of the game.  That's all we ever wanted.  To build stuff in space and maybe find a cool gun every once in a while.Every single update they keep piling on more superfluous early game garbage that prevents you from starting up a new 'verse and getting your hands dirty.  And OF COURSE your old data has to get wiped because why wouldn't that happen?  So you have to work harder and harder to skip past the useless boring tutorial section and it just keeps getting longer and more boring and they keep putting in more poinless missions for you to waste time jumping through hoops and dying until you're magically allowed to progress through luck and luck alone because the combat is so dodgy.  You can't grind.  You can't level up.  You can't tech up.  You just have to jump through the hoops the stupid game tells you to.ZERO FREEDOM.They took a game that was boring and they made it tedious.  They took a middling crafting game and they turned it into a terrible action game.  ALL the ingredients were there.  They could have made this good.  They could have made this fun.  But instead, they chose not to.They put tons of awesome hand-drawn items into the game and then slowly stripped away your ability to craft them.They invented a diablo-style loot system and then won't let enemies drop weapons.They split the duty of a basic crafting table into so many pointless extra structures that instead of needing a wiki to figure out the right structure to build, you'll need a wiki to figure out the structure to build the structure to build the structure.Not since Mighty No. 9 has the big release of a side-scrolling shooty game been this disappointing.  Not since Reddit have you needed mods this badly in order to have a worthwhile experience.I really used to like this game.  I really miss liking this game.  Why won't you let me like your game, Chucklefish?I just want to build stuff in space. ;_;			"

			What a winner. ALARM! This is the exact same video from my other channel, I just want it over here so they can all be together....forever.		

Lots of new unique monsters found throughout the galaxy, each with their own special abilities and behaviors-Still cosmetic.  Nothing really new.Monsters have clearer ‘telegraphing’ to indicate when they are about to attack-For those who never played a video game before.  Remade shields and improved blocking mechanics-Useless since range is king.  Once you find a gun, melee is useless.Replaced electric stun status effect with Electrified, which periodically damages other nearby enemies-Stunlock is bad, m'kay? One of the few things that made melee acceptable in the older versions.Hostile monsters now damage the player on touch-Change that to all creatures minus the small rabbits and goldfish.  Passive creatures now damage you as well. -Did I mention that melee is useless once you find a gun? It's also useless because getting into melee now is even more of a negative.New system for player-controlled vehicles which can be spawned and despawned using Vehicle Controllers (acquired at the Outpost)- Previous feature of being able to construct and edit your vehicles? Dropped.  Was one of my main reasons for getting the game back in 2013.  Not that it was in place yet anyway.Colonists now occasionally give players new procedural quests to help improve their house or social standing-No exploring.  No variety. Fetch quests only. Final destination.Too many new objects, items, costumes, colony tenants, etc. to list-Chucklefish spent time on the candy instead of the meat and potatoesToo many bug fixes, item tweaks, and balance changes to list-Chucklefish is too lazy to list everything "

Well prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥ed at by a girl who thinks she can never be wrong. The game is a grindfest. Every mission is just a repeat of the last grind plus some, and a different boss. Honestly, don't trust these people rating the game as positive, the absolutely have no idea what goes on beyond building their little houses. Did I mention the dev also asked reddit for help with coding some simple 5 lines? Incompetence all around. Plus the guy bragged about making 6 figures a mointh, so there is where your money is going.

								I don't use the launcher and would probably already have over 1,000 hours if I did. This game is pretty much the definition of procedural/random generation. The weapons are random, the enemies are random, the NPCs are random, the terrain is random, even the color of the dirt is random. Y'know, except for some important bits that aren't random. And it's only going to get even more random as it updates.And it can get even MORE random with mods. I would know; I've written mods myself. And it's not too hard to reverse-engineer the game files and write your own mods, either. Almost makes me wish Minecraft or Terraria modding was as easy.If you've played either of said game, or pretty much anything sandbox-like, you'll feel right at home here.			"

								I honestly struggle for words here... I want to give Starbound an amazing Review telling you all how wonderful this game is, but I fear I cannot do that. When I played Starbound for the first time, I explored many worlds with my friends. The subtle music played in the backgrounds as we leapt through fields of Grass, Hills of Sand and Mountains of snow. At one point we simply stopped, lifted our torches to the night sky, and saw the planets in the background as snow gently fell from the sky, casting shadows in the distance through the light of our torches. We stood there and watched the snow fall and eventually, we agreed to each other: ""Dude, this game is perfect...""The best part about Starbound, is that it isn't even finished yet. It is amazingly enjoyable, already has a multitude of amazing Modifications available from Starship editing to custom Races (You can be a frigging Philosoraptor!). I can only deeply recommend Starbound to everyone. See it for what it is: A Masterpiece.			"

								OLD REVIEW:""Hands down, really good game!""NEW REVIEW:That was my review back in the day, before I realised that this game sucks (in its current state). Let me just elaberate on it. In 2013-2014 I played this game like crazy & loved it so much, I had so much to do & everyday I would play. But one day for the first time, I experienced character wipes. Everything of mine was erased, even my saves. When this happened I felt so dissapointed & regretful. I wasted around 66 hours playing this game (mindlessly) all to get my character wiped. I thought it was a bug of some sort, I was wrong. This character wipe accurs every single update they have. So every single (I think major) update they will erase everybodys SB accounts so that they can experience the new update. After that shady incident, I tried playing again & the game becomes even harder(not in a good way). Before the big recent updates the starter ship use to be fully operational but you would have to fill up the ships power to make it flyable again (which was wood cole & uranium, no biggy). It was a great begining because you can then explore the world you are currently on wile being on a task. Now when you start a new game, your entire ship is broken & you have to fix the ship peice by peice (im pretty sure it was 3 sections of the ship). & you have to find some dumb f*cking element called 'core fragments' & I can barely find them & its even worse cause everything you have is pretty much nothing (character wipes dont help either). So you would have to spend more time digging your♥♥♥♥♥off then actually having fun. More grinding than variation gameplay, & usually you can get everything back with the simple creative mode mod, but now the mod cant support the newer version of SB, so thats useless now. This game was ""hands down really good game"" but unfortunately I just cant say the same about it anymore. The only good thing to say about this game is it has a wonderful soundtrack. Other than that I dont think anybody should buy it, at least not untill its out of damn early access.Do I regret playing? A little bit, but I have to say I had some really good memories when playing mindlessly. I met new people, gained new relationships, I experienced a new way of playing a game. So thanks SB but no thanks.			"

												Back in this game's beta, I really enjoyed it, as it was a game purely focused around exploration and making sure you didn't die while you did it. It had so much content I could even look past the persistant windowed mode bug (I couldn't change the game to fullscreen). Now that the game has released, so much of the content based around exploration has either been immensely watered down, or cut from the game. And I might have continued to tolerate these horrible changes, however, the fullscreen bug persists, even in this fully launched version of the game, and I cannot seem to fix it. None of the suggestions I found onlline have worked, and since the top bar of the window blocks the action bar at the top of the screen, and the quit button is impossible to click since my cursor leaves the game and moves onto the toolbar when I try to click it (I have to CTRL + ALT + DLT out of the game), the game is extremely frustrating to play, and is no longer fun. I kinda wish that I had refunded the game while I had the chance, however, why would I have done that since it used to be fun in it's beta and alpha versions.			"

Early Access Review
								A fun game with a lot of promise, Starbound has enough content and enjoyment that I was not disappointed in playing it. However my dissapointment comes from the promise that Starbound and its development once had, now bogged down in a lack of updates and content that has never evolved past the ""early access"" it is supposed to move forward from. On the one hand I had a lot of fun with my ""Terraria in space"", but on the other hand this is the game that put me off on the concept of ""early access"" as a whole.UPDATE MAY 10 2015Alright, I decided to give Starbound another go, so let's have a Revisit Review.So, in terms of stuff they have added, there have been improved microdungeons (a lot more common with some unique stuff to find), as well as a streamlined progression; The game is a lot more linear than it previously was but the upside to this is that there is a lot more focus. You have missions to complete, boss levels you can work on, and some unique areas to visit from this. The downside of this is that the open-endedness of the game is lost, and as such you essentially HAVE to follow the path the game gives you in order to progress; You can't go onto irradiated worlds that have the ores you need until you complete mission A, B, and C in that order.There is also an interesting hub area in the game, an outpost area that provides smaller missions  and the main ones as well, as well as opportunities to buy certain items from shops. This area is nice but feels tacked on at this point, as apart from the missions the items there (with the exception of the signs and the teleporters) are pretty much common.Hunger and temperature have been removed from the game, which I feel the game is less for. With the aforementioned missions giving you the ""shield"" to arbitrarily protect you from cold or heat, with going on these planets without the shield being boiled down to the same status effect as the poison. Without hunger too the food feels a lot less necessary, and the variety and cooking that you can do with all the food in the game having no purpose except for what you choose to create (stims and health packs heal much better than food).There are a few more additions and removals from the game, but essentially what I have described are changes that have fixed the symptoms but not the problem that this game faces. After completing my missions I was right back to the same endgame that I experienced prior to the big overhaul, with nothing to do and very little variety to find. As before, my main goal was to build a Coruscant-like planet, but had to abandon it when the game's framerate went down to a crawl (don't really want to fault the game for that although it was just for my homeworld). Basically, the game still doesn't have a sense of direction or identity that it wants to be. It started out as open-world but have become quite linear with the missions that were added. It has a lot of items and enemy variety aesthetically but practically there are only a few different types of enemies and items. Mining and exploring are still a chore, with too much time staring at your character drilling into the ground for anything large-scale you would like to do. And it is still early access; this has been a very long time with very little progress throughout. Although they have done a fair amount of overhauling in the recent update(s) it has now started to slow back to what it was, which is troubling.Although it is a great game and I do feel I got my money's worth, I still cannot recommend the game. There is just too troubling looking at the developer's progress and the lack of direction with this game. Although it can be a great distraction and is a good game, it is hard not to see the promise and potential that this game once had.			"

												From my personal experience thus far, I have concluded that there are two broadly inclusive categories of people who play Starbound: people with very low standards, and sexual deviants. Speaking as a person with relatively high standards, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its present state.To begin with, the basics: Starbound is a side-scrolling crafting sandbox. From the presentation and gamefeel perspective, it's put together decently well. The graphics are charming, the items look nice, characters are cute, some of the tilesets and planet backgrounds are really well made, jumping and running and hitting things and being hit feels all good and proper - on that front, I really have no complaints. The interface is a little♥♥♥♥♥backwards - it took me a while to figure out exactly how to use items from the inventory, and various functions that could have been assigned key bindings are instead done through tedious mouse movement and clicking (to give an example, in order to assign items to quick use slots, you must click on them in your inventory and drag them to the slot in question. I would have preferred to simply hover over them with my mouse and press the quick slot's key in order to instantly reassign. It seems so incredibly obvious that I do it every time before I realize that the developers hadn't thought of this and I must instead waste my time with this piddly cockamamie bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm sure you're wondering - they do it that way so that you can still quick swap while your inventory is open and your mouse is on it, right? Well, you'd be wrong. They do it because they're bad at making games. If there is an item held in your cursor (which is the only reason you'd ever open your inventory) the quick swap keys just do not work.)My second major complaint is with the performance - for what it is, this game runs like grandma's♥♥♥♥♥ Stuttering and FPS drops are common even on screens which don't have a whole lot going on. It feels like the only time I hit 60 is when I'm deep underground, with no other entities within the immediate area and only a single light source. On big colonies with a decent number of characters, sub-20 is common. Bear in mind that this is a 2D side-scroller and I'm running a 390. And this doesn't even have the excuse of Dwarf Fortress, which calculates the anal circumference and life aspirations of every character in the universe every time someone takes a step.What breaks this game for me, however, is the gameplay. To begin with, it's all good and fun. You dig deep, collect ores, build stuff, upgrade your old stuff. The starting world plays just like you'd expect of a game of this genre. Once you reach a certain point, you're ready to fix your marooned ship and go to other worlds. On the other worlds, you make a beeline for the ore that you couldn't get on the previous planet in order to ascend to the next tier of equipment that immediately eliminates all challenge from your present surroundings. You repeat this three more times and then the challenge is gone from the game as you acquire the highest tier of gear that makes any combat encounter in the game an utter joke. Once you've gotten the highest tier of stuff, likewise, there is no reason to continue exploring, as your reasons for doing it thus far (getting better stuff) will have evaporated.There are other aspects, as well - you can build colonies, which consist of you building nice homes for people who will give you money in exchange for taking your fps. They will be altogether happy with plain old rectangles made of dirt bricks and a lightbulb each, but any player of such games will naturally surround their plain dirt rectangles with grand architectural monuments of immense scale suitable as to impress their grubby proles. If you're anything like me, by this point in the game your exploration of other worlds will be driven mainly by your desire to acquire new furniture for your home base, as if you were some sort of savage space pirate from a race of honourable and warlike interior decorators. After a while, however, it becomes evident that there's not really a point to the whole colony system - you can contribute more effort, but you don't really get anything in return, your tenants continue to behave entirely like bumble ♥♥♥♥ idiots that just stumble and wander all over your nice place, and it becomes clear that nothing of risk or consequence will ever happen involving your colony.As I've mentioned, there's exploration, too, but once you've reached the top tier, the only thing that reaching some new tileset or setpiece will give you is the inherent satisfaction of seeing a new tileset or setpiece. You have no way of interacting with inhabitants or environments outside of dismantling, trading and whatnot, and nothing of consequence can happen as a result of your exploration - you don't learn new stories (unless you pick up a book somewhere, in which case the story will be rather short and not very well written), you don't get new things to do, and any sense of intrigue or mystery that might blossom is immediately crushed by the shallowness of the mechanics. There's very little in the sense of player stories, by which I mean when a player goes ""oh man I went to X planet and found this dude who told me Y so I went and did Z where Φ happened and it turns out that Λ was the case all along."" You know, the narratives that players create naturally as a result of interpreting events in the game. This is because there are only three things that happen in the game - killing a thing with your overpowered weapon, picking up or dropping furniture and terrain with your magic matter gun, and watching cutscenes. Other actors or the unseen game director lack agency entirely and have no power to complicate or interfere with your experience, making the game BORING. In fact, the only stories are those told by the devs through cutscenes, which are boring because every player will see the exact same thing, in which they're not able to participate in the same way as with emergent player stories.There is a story, by the way. You have to collect the six chaos emeralds in order to seal away the ancient evil that wants to kill everyone. That is figuratively it. This game doesn't need a story. It needs threats and challenges and things that can happen, new mechanics and random events. If not that, then at least something that can breathe some new life into the cycle of dig - fight - collect - upgrade - repeat, like, say, an endgame. Until the issues I've listed are addressed, I strongly recommend that you AVOID this game unless you can pick it up for $5 or $10 or however much you think is fair for an OKish crafting sandbox with an extremely short expiry date.

												I'm a little disappointed with the final product. It's not too different from what was in Early Access, but they got rid of some things in the game, like the bubble that prevents fall damage or the upgrades to your suit. Now you have to build items to be able to survive on radioactive planets or planets with no atmosphere, and I'll admit, it's fairly annoying. The suit upgrades after beating bosses were much more preferable. The food spoiling system is a little annoying but once you get fridges it's not too bad anymore. The crew system is cool though. And now I find myself actually caring about how much pixels I had, whereas I used to just ignore them since they didn't really matter. Disappointed in the fact that some items drop after you die, unlike in Early Access, but there's a Workshop mod to circumvent that so it's not too troubling.Still, I recommend this game for anyone who likes Minecraft or Terraria. Super fun and enjoyable!			"

												Starbound used to be my most favortie game to play before 1.0 Iv got 203 hours clocked in. But after the release of 1.0 iv completely lost my passion for this game. What used to be a non-linear space exploration game with different races you could play as each with different backstories to them has become completely linear and is not even enjoyable for me anymore. The main problems for me are that Before starbound 1.0 they had hotbar system which in my mind was excellent you had 10 slots and these also acted has inventory slots you also had two slots for your left and right hands but they have completely trashed that system in 1.0 (god knows why) instead going with a system where you have 8 slots and each one holds two item and none of them can be used as extra inventory slots. My other problem with the 1.0 release was that it also introduced an opening scene now at first i really liked this but after playing the game for 5 minutes i realised that this also throws away all the cool backstories for the races before 1.0 was released. the opening scene was ok but i feel it would have been much cooler if they had an opening scene for each species that were based on their original backstories would have been much more interesting. For now i dont even bother touching the game i have uninstalled and re-installed the game atleast 4 times hoping to get back into it but every single time it just lets me down. so to any of the developers at chucklefish who actually find this review heres two things you need to seriously do1: bring back the old hotbar2:maybe add race specific opening sequencesif they actually do both of these then i will totally play this game again but for now it'll just be a sitting in my library collecting virtual dust			"

												Let me just say, I'm saddened greatly by this game. I bought it years ago, when it was in early beta and I watched as it grew and evolved. I wanted so desperately to love it now like I did back then, it was unfinished, unpolished and generally a bit lacking but it actually ran. Now after official release it just won't run. It's a slide show. I've tried everything from messing with Vsync, playing it on a couple different system and it's just not optimized. Somehow it got worse from late beta to release. It's literally unplayable in this state so I hope Cucklefish fix it someday or hire someone to fix it. From what I've gathered over the past few years the dev team is mostly artists so perhaps they could have a third party come in and help them get it together but until that happens I'm gonna shelf this and would recommend you do too. Hopefully we get a return to the glory days but I'm not holding my breath.			"

								I love games that are forever early access. I love games that advertise themselves as being near-complete on their website, only to release and be obviously still deep in alpha! I remember their website, I remember the roadmap, the list of features they had with various progress bars all 90% full or more before the game launched. They straight-up advertised the game as being close to complete. Of course they deleted the roadmap. Why wouldn't they? The game was an utter wreck when it released.I wish I could refund this. I got it off their website years ago and they've refused refunds for just about everyone. What a huge mistake this was. At this point, even if the game is out of early access and fun, who cares? It's been years and years.			"

												I played a lot of Starbound two/three years ago and I just started playing (a lot) of it recently. So here is my two cents about it.At its core, Starbound is pretty much Minecraft in 2D and in space. It's an open-world survival sandbox game that lets you visit 18 quintillions star systems (lol). The big feature here is the fact that you can visit 80-90% of the planets in these systems. Each one has a dominant biom, a level of threat and specific day and night cycle. Each planet can spawn a variety of monsters mostly procedurally created. And each planet has its own set of, backgrounds trees, vines, dirt etc. Each planet can also be inhabited by one of the races you can start the game as. All these races have two sets of NPCs you can meet on the planets: an aggressive one that you encounter mostly in procedurally generated dungeons, and a friendly one that will give you small quests, that you meet in villages.-Regrets from the past:I would say that the early access builds were more heavy on the procedurally generated content and sandbox gameplay. The planets were not systematically inhabited, the dungeons where less identical, and there were not much interactions with NPCs. Now you have the pre-made monsters that you can find in systems far away from each other which is bizarre, the main quest that ""forces"" you to find and analyse each civilization (even when you already met them before the main quest arrives at that point) and it's almost impossible to find a planet without at least one camp with NPCs in it.That last one in particular is kind of jarring because part of the fun of exploring in Starbound came from the unknown; you were not sure you would find something, so finding something was a big deal in itself. Now it's more about finding exactly what you are searching for, not about finding something at all.-Enjoyment from the present:On the other hand, I think the team did a pretty good job balancing the light traditional rpg aspect of the game with the sandbox game-design of the beginning. The content is still plethoric and wether you are more about trading goods to make money, farming (litterally), exploring, building, Starbound is a great playground for all of this. The main-story, though a bit (to be nice) shallow makes for nice little pouches of more linear gameplay from time to time, with dungeons and bosses made by the devs themselves; even though I don't like the fact that you can't mine in these dungeon, they can give an enjoyable break. They also bring in more backstory for the races which can help for roleplayers that like the scientific part of the game. In that type of game, I love to make a huge base where I catalog all my findings; with a gigantic greenhouse for the trees and plants, a zoo for the monsters, a museum of natural history...and I can do that in that game. One thing that I really enjoy in that regard is the excavation mini-game that lets you find a variety of fossils you can then put in you own little display stands. I always get a kick out of finding one while mining, because you can't know what you will find until you get it out of the wall. And getting it out of the wall is not always easy. It adds to the exploration and gives me one more reason to go down caverns to mine stuff.And the interactions with NPCs, that can accompany you in your ship or that you can put in colony, or that you can work for in some (admittedly) mmoesque fetching and killing quests, all these helps having interest in the lore of the game. If it isn't a priority for you, you don't have to do it  except for the very start of the game that will give you a couple of interesting abilities. Once you have your double jump, your morph-ball and dash, you can do whatever you want. I think the main quest is overall a good addition for people who need a bit of focus to evolve and start doing stuff in that type of open games. And since it isn't required at all (weapons and upgrades can be found anywhere else while exploring) it's not much of a problem for the rest of the players. So the game still is really system heavy, and roleplaying comes both from the player's realm of possibilities and from the traditional, surely a bit bland, narrative and social interactive part of the game.Oh and did I mention that you can capture the unique creatures of the game and use them in combat? That's pretty fun too!TL;DRThough I don't know if I love Starbound now for the exact same reasons I loved it when I first played it two years ago, I still thinks it's a fantastic game. A couple of things bothers me in the released game, it still is my favorite Minecraft-like game. There is so much to do I just lose track of time, and playing it with friends is an absolute blast. I whole-heartedly recommand it!			"

												Disclaimer: this is my first review, and the reason I'm writing this is that the line between ""good"" and ""bad"" game is not so visible to a person who is not familiar with Starbound, and therefore I feel obligated to end my juorney with Starbound like this.OverviewStarbound got into Early Access in 4th of December 2013. Before that, the lead developer Tiy had formally announced Starbound in February 2012, and a kickstater-esque pre-order opening was launched on April 2013. Starbound was released on 22 of July, 2016, when it had been on development for over five years. SynopsisStarbound sets you up in a planet with no other resources except your ingenuity and a Matter Manipulator, a clever tool used to harvest wood and ore for your use. As you get familiar with the crafting, you notice that the interface is a bit clunky and finding what you'd like to make gets harder as the game progresses and you are given more crafting recipes. The planet you're on contains many secrets, such as dungeons and chests for you to explore. The procedural generation gives a noticeable difference to all planets, and even though certain biomes on different planets look the same, there is a difference in my opinion. After you have explored the planet you're on, you can teleport back to your ship and find a new planet in your current system, or use space fuel to travel into other systems. As you progress, your stuff gradually gets upgraded from medieval style to sci-fi.The game progressionStarbound has many different resources obtained trough different ways, like farming and mining. Although all the planets are beatiful and have something to explore, the player wants to progress in the game; getting better armor and survival gear is necessary. However, once you notice that making some armor requires cotton, your nice and perilous adventure in the planet's core isn't as nice as it was. It's good that Starbound doesn't hold hands on telling you where to find certain items, but that brings me to one of my strong points on my critique: exploring isn't fun if that exploration doesn't guarantee you to progress, and on the other hand progression is meaningless if nothing changes. Unfortunately Starbound achieves both of these bad points, even though it seems that it tries so hard not to.There is no guarantee that a dungeon has something rare for you, or if it does, it's stuff like one or two pieces of matter manipulator modules. Which you need a lot more if you hope to upgrade your manipulator. On the other hand, when you find your items you need to progress, you're thrown into more dangerous planets but the premise is still the same: find out what stuff you need to upgrade your crafting stations, dig deep, don't die. Return, notice there's a resource you need but don't know what that is, get frustrated. Also, building shelter / a fancy house to yourself serves no use, as you need to switch planets to progress; meaning you need to bookmark that planet to return to your nice dwelling.Starbound tries so hard to not be repetetive it's almost funny. I understand that these procedural concepts are really hard, but that is not an excuse if you have five years to polish your game.DevelopmentThe story of Starbound is like a children's fairytale to indie developers. There's the good things, the bad things, and the moral of the story. The good things in my opinion are the promising setting, full mod support and enough customization to feel that you are truly unique.The bad things: Let's just say that I don't want myself to get cencored by Mollygos or Tiy. There is evidence of that, there is evidence of Tiy shilling the game in reddit with alternate users, there is evidence of people getting banned in the official forums for asking how their product is progressing. I strongly suggest every reader to dig bit deeper into this, it's actually pretty funny how this thing was managed. Like the combat system was revised at least three times. Also, the design failures that had been reflected to Steam include a period where Starbound had not had a patch in one year. When Starbound was in Early Access. The excuses to this include stuff like moving into an office in London and what have you. Some games stay in Early Access for a year and they get released. Starbound was in early access for almost three years.The moral of the story is that you should respect your playerbase, keep your promises especially if you receive money for a product that doesn't exist yet, and that doing freelancer work without any guarantees is a coin flip. I do not personally feel this way, but Tiy has been described from various sources as being ""egomaniac"". Take it as you will.Should you buy this game?If you like repetetiveness, go ahead. If you like illusion of progression, go ahead. However, Starbound is still to me an unfinished product with broken promises of features, and most likely will be forever. My own personal opinion is that you should not buy this game, or any future titles from Chucklefish without those titles being of exceptional quality, and nominated for Game of the Year in mainstream reviews.

Early Access Review
								I have originally wrote a review a year after it launched in EA and nothing have changed in that year. For the best.. at least, but seriously, nothing at all. What was broken, was still broken.It was an ambitious project, an interesting one, promising new experience and fun gameplay. Lies. They couldn't deliver the game, but right after beta release and a ton of feedback showing that basically every mechanics in the game was broken completely or not fun, they got all high and mighty with their bans for any critics on their forums or in Steam discussions. Instead of listening to people and trying to achieve same goals, they alienated themselves and hopefully (for them) got a massive praise and defence of blinded fanboys, that enjoy listening to more lies for years. ""Only 3 more versions and we're done"".Basically it's a story of a huge pile of money that went into wrong hands of amatures who were to damn lazy not to f*ck everything up.Upd. 03.12.2015.I forgot about this review completely, but, hey it's 03.12.2015 already and it's not close to release yet.Was I wrong in 2013? Nah.Yeah, I'm well aware of that ""only 3 updates to release thing"", but in 2013 it was also ""close to release"".I wish I could have a refund.Upd. 22.05.2016.Wow, they actually get to ""1.0"" version, and still - survival is barely here, and still barely implemented. Combat still sucks balls with all the problems it has for 3 years now. Planets are still RNG boring crap that serves Zero purposes, except for additional resource grind, boring quest stuff and I wonder if anything else. Wearable armor and weapons were great on paper and in the end don't have any feel behind them, no satisfaction from their usage, no power. Bases serve Zero purpose, so basically most % of stuff in the game can be thrown into trash bin. They worked hard to add as much tier walls and grind as possible for no purpose, except for sucking out the fun it still had.You can still use mods, but that has nothing to do with developers at all, those modders made MORE features and stuff in the damned game in a few month in beta, than these jokers could add in 3 years with a sh*t load of money to cover up the possible expenses of this game.This was the 1st major example of Early Access, that tought me much, at least for that I'm greatful.Avoid like a plague.

												Starbound is one of many Terraria clones out there, with a lot of ideas going for it, but lacking the content and polish to fully realize them. This game has been under development for years at this point, and with an initial release date set at ""late 2013"" I personally don't think it's ever going to leave its ""early access"". When initially pitched, I'm sure it had lots of innovative ideas and solutions that Terraria lacked, but as the years passed it by, it's gotten left behind by the very game it's based on. What Terraria has that Starbound lacks is firstly consistent theme, a reason to progress, a natural progression of gameplay, a difficulty curve, story and motivation for constructing things. These are all core pillars of the genre, and why I don't recommend you pick up Starbound for anything but a 75% off deal.The game is very much unfinished. There's nothing storywise connected to the gameplay, so you just gather what you absolutely need to get to the next set of armour and crafting tables, ignoring 99% of everything on the planet. When you reach the quest hub, game content takes a complete nosedive as it devolves into fetching seemingly random items for NPC's. If you divide the game between starship upgrade levels, you might conceivably spend five to ten hours on the first upgrade level, then maybe two hours on the second, then you'll spit out the rest in under an hour, easily. That is, playing the game for the first time, without knowing what to do, without reading ahead in any wiki or forum, without playing/talking with someone who's played the game beforehand. ""But wait, that's a lot of hours, still"" you might say. Consider what those hours entail. Not constructing anything, not fighting epic battles, not exploring vast underground caverns to uncover mystical artifacts. It's digging a hole to find the next level mineral. It's planet jumping to run around on the surface in search of the correct medieval village of bird people to get a certain placeable. It's all the busywork with none of the satisfaction.There's just nothing holding you to any one world, and since you constantly need materials from other worlds you end up jumping solar systems, never getting the feeling of belonging anywhere. Since you never stay in any one place, you never get to build up a base, which nullifies the vast majority of all items you *could* build and place, except for the space you've got on your starship, which works as your main hub for storage, crafting and traveling. Also, since your ship is personal, you can't show it off to people unless they're invited to your party and specifically go there, so you can't land your ship on a planet and have it work as a base of operations for your entire team, nothing like that.The difficulty curve of the game is a complete flatline. You never need to worry about enemies, the only thing to look out for is falling damage and lava pits. There's a lot of monsters, but in reality there's like four or five different kinds but with tons of reskins, all of which are fought in the exact same manner of hitting/shooting while walking backwards. There are challenge rooms, but they're not in any way connected to the stated difficulty of a planet, they're just randomly chosen from a fixed set, all made so a character starting from scratch could finish it. These challenge rooms also don't contain loot bound to the stated difficulty of the planet, so you will enter a challenge on a ""difficult"" world, breeze through it with the character implants you've acquired, then get 6 bandages, 40 pixels and a useless, common weapon. After realizing this, I stopped doing challenges entirely. Bosses are another problem, where they're not in any way connected to the actual game itself. You literally start a scenario where the boss is located, fight it and teleport out. The difficulty curve is way out of whack, where me and a friend died to one of the early bosses multiple times but breezed through the last couple, some we killed before even realizing *they were the actual boss of that map*.There's a huge problem with the tone of the game, where the majority of doodads, just atmospheric stuff like equipment, placeable objects and interior/exterior are not science fiction-themed. It's chiefly a medieval-themed game, like Terraria, and that's a BIG missed opportunity to set itself apart and draw inspiration from. The robot race is themed after Arthurian knights and squires, the aquatics are themed after feudal Japan. The bird people seem to be themed after the Maya civilization. The humans are based on modern times, which I guess is better than nothing, but having the apes as the only race that are future-based is so disappointing in a science fiction game.Starbound also completely lacks a story to cling on to. I read on one of the wikis that the story is ""you're escaping from your planet being blown up"". That's never addressed in the game itself. The story could almost literally be anything, as it's got zero impact on the gameplay. In Terraria, atleast, you progressively fight and build your way to a boss, prepare for it, fight it and then react to the changing world around you. Bosses were integrated in the game itself, ""go to this area to find this boss"", ""gather these materials, go here and summon this boss"", ""talk to this guy in this location"". That's a story being created around you as you play. In Starbound you dig, gather some resources and move on to the next planet. *That's* the story. In conclusion, Starbound lacks the motivations for building stuff, the cornerstone of the genre. It lacks interesting fighting mechanics, another genre cornerstone. It's a sci-fi game, but almost everything in it is fantasy. It's atleast three years in the making and it's not nearly finished, dropping heavily and progressively in content after the first chapter, ending abruptly with nothing concluding what-so-ever. It's ""early access"", but it's been sold both on Steam and in preorders for years now, the developers have started multiple other game projects, and it's had an initial release date of late 2013. I believe it's never going to be officially ""released"". It's been released, and this released product is unfinished, with the finished parts unpolished and dated.If you haven't played Terraria, buy that game instead. If you have, then *only* get Starbound if it's on sale, like 75% off.Release addition: After playing through the game again with the 1.0 version, the arbitrary patch that Chucklefish decided to call the release version, I still cannot recommend the game. There are some things that have been improved, like the boss scenarios that have been given some insular story and platforming. Also on the positive side is that the main quest line now has a real ending, with an end boss to fight. However, the boss itself is a big disappointment, as is the ending.The release patch also brings on a couple of problems. In this version, I had much bigger problems getting a dedicated server going for myself and my friends, much more so than when we originally played Starbound. Also, the game lags. Badly. It's a new problem, slowing the game to a crawl as soon as you get colonists walking about one of your builds. It's very frustrating and should not happen, did not happen in previous versions.  In conclusion, I'd say the 1.0 patch is an improvement overall, but the performance issues in colonies, camps, bases and dungeons drags down the enjoyment. My original recommendation stands, pick it up only if you're a fan of the genre and it's 75% off.			"

												tldr;Just buy Terraria, its slightly cheaper and has alot more content. Listed under is all the hate I have for Starbound.-I played through this game with a friend and I would like to say that multiplayer is not ""stable"". If you ever start the main questline in multiplayer, it will completely ruin your singleplayer experience with that character. You become unable to continue the questline in singleplayer and unlocks related to those quests become limited to the server you were playing on (I have not tested this with multiple servers, but it may just be the same.) Another big complaint is the amount of loot in multiplayer. Theres only enough loot made for one player per server, so have fun trying to play with 4 people. This can encourage players to explore other planets on their own while on another persons server, which kills the purpose of multiplayer. -Bosses in multiplayer are too easy, not that they weren't already easy. Theres no scaling which makes them easy to take down with 2+ people. Boss achievements are also only rewarded to whoever gets the killing blow.-Combat in Starbound is clunky, and sometimes just boring. Sometimes swords don't hit enemies properly, but that might just be the fact that smaller enemies have incredibly small hitboxes. I've experienced my spear not being able to hit enemies if they are too close. Then theres the energy system, oh how I loathe it. Energy is used for special attacks and is a replacement for ammo when using ranged weapons. With no way to easily regenerate energy during combat, you will have to sit out of battle for a good 3 seconds to wait for energy to recharge if you use only ranged weapons. This is even worse with the delay you experience when switching weapons that won't allow you to attack for another 2 seconds, crippling ranged weapons even more. Ranged weapons generally do alot more damage then melee, so it kind of evens out, but the attack delay is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥-The main Questline revolves around playing Where's Waldo, but is alot less fun. You need to run around with your scanner in an exotic settlement to find things that are glowing green to scan. I had to explore 3 planets to complete the first part of the quest, which I considered to just be a waste of time. Rinse and repeat 4 more times, fun.Other quests are have no variety, it either requires you to plant seeds, kill some cultists, or is an escort mission.-Other-Because of how Starbound's hotbar works with left-hand and right-hand slots, it makes you only able to hold 6 different sets of items(not including the matter manipulator). To fix this issue, they allow you to access a 2nd hotbar by pressing ""X"". I'm not sure why they couldn't just fit 10 slots on the hotbar like any other game.The idea with the dual wielding is nice, but the hotbar systems definitely needs to be reworked.-Food items cannot be stacked because of their individual rot timers. This needs to be reworked as well. there is a mod that fixes this, but I shouldn't have to install mods to fix a simple problem.-Crafting can take a LONG time. Want to make 200 peices of glass? Oh ok, that'll just take a second each. REALLY? REALLY? Is it so wrong to make crafting instant? I dont want to sit here and wait as my character makes a few hundred peice of glass or healing salves. Some late tier armour can take a good 30 seconds.-Vehicles are hard to control, (with the exception of the boat) and are utterly useless. On top of that, vehicles are some of the most expensive items in the game. There are only 4 vehicles available for purchase, and 3 of them are the same hoverbikes that are just reskinned.-Dialogue from NPC's cannot be skipped or fast forwarded. You must wait until there is little prompt notifying you to press ""E"" flashing on the dialogue to be able to bypass it. I usually end up reading the text 3 times over before I can continue.-There is no way store pixels(game currency) without atleast losing a portion of it in return. Vendors in game are generally expensive enough so that pixels earned from killing normal mobs and from the ""pots"" are meaningless. The only way to earn a good stash of pixels is to sell cosmetic items and weapons.Game should've never left beta.			"

Early Access Review
								For your average gamer, I may not recommend this title, at this time. Considering the game is still in 'beta' development stages, there are new updates and content added, extremely often. With Character and World wipes coming, this will make it difficult for most players to do anything that they may get attached to, such as, developing a home world, or collecting rare, high tier items/weapons/armor.That being said, for a gamer who may like to experience the raw nature of an early access title, this one is right there. Nearly as many things broken as working, and a flood of new items/monster behaviours/events to experiment with at any given time. Being able to have your input considered, during these crucial development stages, is one of the nice things available to players at this point.While it keeps the traditional feel of the mining/crafting genre, it adds a few fairly straigtforward sets of goals to accomplish in order to progress in the game, allowing players who could not get into the driveless feel of games like minecraft, to get into this genre and still have a sense of actual progression.When Starbound emerges from beta, and into full development, it is a game that will be hard to match in terms of shear explorability, and potential replayability.All in all, another highly recommended title.

								Save your money, do not buy this game, wait until it's finished if it ever is.To give you an idea exactly how bad Chucklefish is, the modding community released promised features ages before chucklefish even got started, a mod is typically created by one or two people and that is apprently enough to show up everyone who was working on this game.I won't sugar coat it, they are being as lazy about updates as they can be without completely abandoning the game. Because if a few people can create over a thousand different gameplay elements in less time than it takes the actual dev team to change the fuel system for ships, it's a really bad sign.As I am writing this, Starbound has not been offically updated for over 2 years and it's still in early access, the only ""updates"" they release are unfinished beta builds that may never be released into an actual patch.Again, do not buy this game right now, buy some thing better.Doesn't matter what, just buy something else and wait for this to be finished.

												I want to give a positive review for this game, but there are just too many downsides. Nearly any good aspect of the game I can think of is accompanied by a major drawback. Here's just some examples off the top of my head;Procedural quests abound! :Dbut hardly any quests in the outpost D:New storyline :Dthat has no impact whatsoever on the rest of the universe D:Crew members :Dwith practically no customization (and arguably next to no individuality) D:Procedural monsters :D""oh look, this one's blue this time..."" D:A decently wide variety of weaponry to choose from :Dyou'll only ever use that one two handed sword you found three literal days ago D:That's not even mentioning the performance issues that so many people, myself included, have encountered playing this game. I literally got 15 max FPS during the credits. In my opinion there's no real reason to play the game again as one of the other races if you've already beat it once. The only thing that will truly be different is your ship and the planets you fly it to. Everything else is practically identical, and that's one of the bigger concerns I've seen over space exploration games (to be topical, it was a major concern about No Man's Sky when they started talking about it months ago)Do I think Starbound has potential? Yes, and it has a lot of it! Would I recommend this game now in its current state? Only if you aren't afraid of disappointement. And yeah, you could probably still get a good 20 hours out of the game at least (not including time spent during other versions of the game), but after that there isn't anything to do unless you mod it.

												The UI has gone from clunky but serviceable to clunky and awkward. The combat is sluggish and more of a chore due to the   mechanics not taking into account spawn rates. The harder than casual difficulty levels are more frustrating than challenging. The game has thresholds that must be overcome in order progress yet relies on randomnimity to avoid endless grinding. Overcoming the threshholds leads to more grinding. It looks nice, and nothing else.			"

												I started playing this beautiful game in 2013.  I was amazed by the worlds I could visit and the depth of the exploration that could be done so early in, what was at the time, an alpha release.  I stuck with the game after endless character wipes and bugs and resets.   I saw the changes to the open universe exploration go from random worlds of different difficulty, to a thin-veil of 'quadrants' of difficulty to the current 'star colour = difficulty of all planets'.     I played through the unskippable 'quests' that seemed in place for no other reason than to force players to go through a simple maze I am sure someone felt very proud to have spent 6 months making.    With a penguin boss, ha ha.  And now, 3 years later...its finally out of development.    So where are we?Pro:+Wonderful soundtrack.  Seriously, goosebumps at some of the music*+Beautiful planets to explore**+if you are creative, you can build nearly anything***Cons:*They will loop a lot.  **Beautiful planets to ignore ***Easier to build in Terraria, and you will not abandon the planet-Linear.   You are forced into a linear path that you cannot deviate from.  Why, in a building sandbox game, is their a linear quest path you cannot avoid?!?   I have found (well, last patch anyway) mods that I could use to skip this...but why isn't this an option from the get-go?-Repetative.  Go to any planet, what will you want to find?     Wonderful scenery, Strange creatures, Stunning aliens!   What do you actually find?    The same 2 dungeons generated on a desert world, a green world, or a rock world.   Guarded by the same AI that will drop slightly different guns and swords.  And some color swapped monsters that have poor hit detection and all drop the same 2 types of item, regardless of what planet they are from or what type of alien they are.-Detatched:  In terraria, you have your world.  If you go left, you find a desert (or a swamp, or the castle...w/e  its your world)   but you KNOW its there.  Starbound, you jump from planet to planet, and with each jump...you have less interest in where you have been or where you are going.  Your ship (see linear quests) can be expanded and built on, but it feels like a camper van.  Only good for getting from A to B and holding the stuff you find (that looks great the first time you see it...but why am I looting this again?)-Pointless items:  I admit I collected all the pokemon, gathered many a hat in team fortress, and generally try for all the achievements.   But really, why should I want to travel to a half dozen different Giant flower biomes to get a Bee costume?  Also, they added a cat to my ship.  Why? tl;drWho should buy this game:   If you love terraria and want to play in space.  Wait for a sale, but get it.  Who should not get this game:  Anyone else.  Go play Terraria or Stardew Valley.  They are just better. "

												This game had so much promise when I started backing it, and it still has so much promise. Sadly, despite five years in development limbo, it does not deliver.Cast your minds back, three or so years if I recall correctly. I was an innocent young lad going about my day to day business, when my friend sends me a message telling me about this new game in development. It's called ""Starbound"", and it looks like Terraria in space, but with so much more to it - an endless, infinite universe. I'm entranced, and I buy the crap out of it. Playing through early versions, I can tell it's rough but has promise, so much promise.I check back every now and again, seeing how things develop. Things are looking good. I play a few hours here and there, but there always seems to be something missing. Something missing which, I assume, will eventually be added in.Fast forward to today, and there's still something missing. I still can't quite put my finger on it. Haven't played very much of the new version, since my characters were all wiped (after being promised this wouldn't happen, but hey, these things happen).Anyway, good things first. Starbound is a game with a fantastic atmosphere. I love the art style, the music is grand and the snarky comments on every single item in the game really pull me in to this living, breathing universe.Sadly, everything else pulls me right out. The controls are floaty, so I fall to my death over and over again. The combat is absolutely awful (and others have already elaborated on that far better than I could). The UI is a joke, and contributes to maybe half of my (many many many) deaths as I frantically try to swap to a sword and end up limply patting my enemy with a stick of corn. I've experienced recurring lag with enemies, even though I'm playing singleplayer (I'm taken to believe this is a fairly common issue).The universe is massive, yet so shallow that it could probably bring a tear to Todd Howard's eye (take that, Bethesda). There's no reason to stay on any planet for longer than necessary, essentially making every planet an identical ""fetch what you need and move forward"" half hour outing (simultaneously removing the feeling of slow-paced wonder that comes from exploration). Dungeons aren't very interesting, in my opinion. Railroaded linear quests absolutely destroy any sort of natural progression which is usually fairly necessary in an open sandbox game.That's not to say I haven't enjoyed Starbound. There are moments of absolute brilliance tucked away in the game. Exploring new planets can be awesome if you tune out the fact that it's only cosmetically any different from the last one - the massive amount of varying art assets are a high point, and I give immense credit to the game's artists. The same goes for building a base (though in earlier versions I always used admin commands to give myself an unlimited amount of construction materials). I like the ability to make homes for settlers, and build a large town.All in all, Starbound had so much promise. Promise that seems to have been more or less wasted in favour of working on small additions and not really working on the major 'feel' of the game, if that makes sense (I mean, spaceship pets? Really? Why?). I still have hope for the future of the game (especially with mods), but at the moment it just feels empty. I love the game, and loathe the game. I've gone on for quite a while now, so I should probably end here - Starbound is a brilliant concept badly realised. I wish the devs luck on improving it, but it seems like it's too far gone by now.One small caveat: Starbound isn't as similar to Terraria as many are saying. For one thing, Terraria is consistently quite good. "

												I first played this game when it was in early acces, so I didn't play much of the game after it was taken out of early access. Most of my playtime of this game after the full release was spent grinding resources for the missions. I played through the first three missions. My only complaint for this game is the boss fights. The ones that I played through seemed to followed a pattern: 1. Dodge the boss' attacks 2. Make them vulnerable3. Attack 4. RepeatThe third fight even skips step 2. The boss fights alone were the reason why I stopped playing after the third mission. I just didn't feel rewarded for all the grinding that I had to do, and this is coming from someone who has over 800 hours in Terraria.			"

								I may be the only person on the face of the planet that absolutely loathes Terraria and still likes Starbound.  While the concept of Terraria sounded appealing to me, the interface, controls, lack of any direction at all gave me no motivation to play and I ended up more frustrated trying to figure out how to do things and spent more time with that than actually playing.  I could have given it more time, sure; but, with hundreds of other Steam games in my library, I put my time elsewhere.Enter: Starbound. That tiny bit of a nudge in giving you a direction and motivation to do something (even if it's to cook meat) was all the nudge I needed.  Even if I spend hours ignoring a quest objective, just having it there points me towards caring about something in the game.  The interface is a lot cleaner in Starbound as well, and recipe management for crafting is done leaps and bounds better than Terraria.  Some people I know that have played this don't see much difference between Terraria and Starbound, and I can understand that on some level; but I see a phenominal contrast and it's a contrast that makes this game both playable for me in the first place, and highly enjoyable.And the music in this game is essentially worthy of its own review... it kicks the immersion up levels above most anything else in my game library.  And this game is still only in early beta... I can't wait to see more.			"

								Amazing that this game is still in early BETA! So much playable content and DEV's are being super thoughtful of their early acess players by limiting character and world wipes! Just so much content and no where near enough time! Played over 500 hours and still can't get enough! You get bored of one world, simply warp to another, simple as! Cannot wait for further updates and definately CANNOT wait for pixel earning ""jobs"" that teh DEV's have been talking about!  "

												Starbound is a game which takes the 2D sanbox genre and puts it in space. While a simple concept, it works and the game is very enjoyable. A heavy focus of this game is on mining and like most other game within the genre, you will be doing a lot of it if you want to progress. The mining is done mostly with the Matter Manipulator, althought there are alternatives. The mining isn't too monotonous and the underground mini-biomes give you a sense of exploration and discovery. That is until you've seen everything. The unfortunate part about this game is that once you've seen one desert planet, you've seen them all. Once you've seen a certain mini biome, you've seen every other of that same mini biome. The only reason I kept exploring and searching was so that I could find certain structures for building. Speaking of which, the building in this game is fun and the amount of blocks and furniture at your disposal allows for the creation of many different types of buildings and settings. Another aspect of building that works well are colonies. Colonies can be created by placing housing permits inside of buildings. These will attract unique tenants based on the type of furniture used in the home. This allows for players to create thriving towns and cities and liven up their builds. This is something starbound does much better than Terraria, as that only has a select few tenants. Another thing that's (as far as I know) unique to Starbound, is its story. Unlike most other games, Starbound has a story which you can choose to ignore or follow exclusively. While the plot isn't the greatest, it certainly isn't bad and provides something for players who want to know about the universe of Starbound. Lastly, combat. The combat in Starbound is unique, and works intuitively. The combination of 1-handed and 2-handed weapons and secondary abilities allows for different combat strategies.TL;DR, Starbound is an enjoyable game and is certainly worth the price for anyone who is a fan of the 2D sandbox genre.

												Super fun addictive game. It is one of the best open world / sandbox / crafting 2D games out. Easy to learn, easy to play. Save and exit the game at any time. I had purchased this game for my kids a long time ago in its early stages. I have to say the devs have done an amazing job with it, and I had to get my own copy.If you are looking for a fun game you can play off and on, or lose hours to each day this is it. The dev team is amazing, you wont be let down with this title.			"

												This game is amazing. So much to do and so many things the discover and craft, you'll be playing this game for hundreds of hours. With millions of different planets to explore (each having their own unique animals and plants), you'll become addicted to planet hopping, with each visit rewarding you with a new experience. There are planets home abandoned bases and castles, temples and mine shafts, the list goes on. There so much to do and for a price like this, its a steal.			"

												Honestly, this is one of my favorite games on steam. Its so creative and when playing and exploring planets you feels so free. Even though the story is technically optional (after the first main mission) its amazing to play through it and to learn about the game's universe (other than the novakids, you dont learn much about my favorite race).For all the people who say ""Oh is just a terraria rip off""/'It looks just like terraria, why not just get terraria"", I don't see where you're getting that from. The game gives you so much more freedom and things to do. Especially when it comes to world generation. In terraria it takes ages to create new worlds, while in Starbound the universe expands to nearly infinate proportions. Besides that, you can find so many more unique items within the game, you can interact and get missions from NPCs endlessly, you can get other people to join your ships crew. Theres also dozens of different types of worlds in Starbound, while in Terraria theres literally only 2 types of worlds.Otherwise, hands down a great game.			"

												I've been playing this game for some time now, I got it while in early access back in 2014.At first I was worried that the developers had abandoned the game to work on other ones.However they came back and continued to develop, eventually we reach 1.0I love the game in the current state despite some issues and bugs.The new story mode is nice to have. Some features they included could really use enhancement.As a previous user mentioned, there is a ""broken loop"" within the game. However, I'm sure the developers will continue to work on this title and I hope to see so in the future.			"

								Best Sci-Fi Game sound track ever!!! This game has sucked more hours away from me than DayZ.  But it does it in a non intrusive kind of way.  Unlike DayZ where you feel every second of every minute of every hour of the day.  Starbound eases you into a false sense of control, what was once a quick 11pm mining run, easily and unnoticeably turns into a 3am dash for cash to the center of the earth.Been playing a little of the single player campaign to learn the ropes and get a feel of the mechanics but this game really shines with a few mates online in a locked down server working together for hours and hours on end crafting, building, hunting, looting, cooking etc..   Many a times have we seen the sunrise while playing this game and thought to ourselves ""Another day at work with less than 3 hours sleep...... totally worth it!"".			"

Early Access Review
								This game is VERY good. While at the time I am writing this, the game is is an early beta state, the gameplay is still quite good, and very fun to play, more so with other people. As a survival game, this one sets itself apart from the saturated crowd, with a cool sci-fi setting, and quirky sense of humor that doesn't take itself too seriously. However, there are a few bugs, and the devs occasionally wipe saves when larger updates are implemented. However, this game has a very devoted developer team, who are constantly fixing bugs and adding new content to the game, and I can only imagine how good the game will be once finished. If you are okay with playing a beta, and you don't mind the occasional hiccup or character wipe, this game is a very worthwhile purchase. If you however, are not okay with the wipes/updates, as I imagine some people would not be, I would wait until the beta enters a later phase, or until full release.			"

So much to see, so much to do...I've clocked 132 hours in a small number of days and I'm still finding new things to explore and discover, and that's not mentioning the creative aspect of the game either.

It's also very smooth when it comes to moving, placing blocks, and animations. There are probably already 20x as many building blocks allowing you to create a wide range of structures.Even though it's in beta, and early access. It's already way too good to be there.Overall, it's Terraria on steroids.did I mention my spaceship is a flying Castle-Prision?			"

								So I've played for almost 100 hours as of the time of this posting, and I DEFINITELY recommend it.First off, you start in a space ship and beam down to an unlimited number of planets where you can mine, build, and be killed by murderous little teddy bears, while the monsters with razor sharp teeth purr like kittens and want to be your friend.The second thing I have to say is that you can be an ape man who runs around with no pants.  10/10And the last thing I would say is that I would recommend this to anyone who liked Terraria or Minecraft, as it's similar in the whole build/mine/kill aspect of it, however, there is so much more that you can do in this than the others (except for Minecraft when modded).One of my favorite things is that you mine in a 3x3 area unless you hold shift in which case you only mine 1x1.  Also, one thing that annoyed me about Terraria is that if you wanted to place a block in the background, you had to build new blocks that were specifically made for the background.  In Starbound, you just right click and it places in in the background.My only complaints about this game is that one, there aren't many mods out there (which is to be expected of a brand new game so this isn't that bad), and two, I don't like how the loot in even the tier 10 planets still sucks.  I've died hundreds of times because I have a pistol that does 2,000+ damage, but the monsters have 10,000+ damage...But, those two complaints aside, this is my new favorite game, and it's even better with friends.

								This game is incredibly diverse in it's content. Although all aspects of the game are not yet finished, Starbound has potential to be one of the best games in it's genre. If you've played Terraria, it is worth mentioning that Starbound is about jumping from planet to planet collecting unique items and building a city on a ""home planet,"" whereas terraria is very much a digging game. You can dig in Starbound, but it is much more valuable to explore the surface of foreign planets. The amount of unique and decorative items are impressive, combat is difficult but rewarding, and planets are rated by difficulty so that the player can keep the game challenging. I would reccomend buying this game primarily if it is on sale.			"

								This is a beta game that I can highly recommend. If you enjoyed Terraria, then you'll instantly fall in love with this games environments, characters, and crafting tools. It's all very familiar to the previous game yet it's far more exciting. With the ability to jump between planets and discover new worlds, and alien life, the content in this game already feels limitless. Since it's still in beta, you can expect there to be the occasional crash. After 14 hours of play time, I have experienced 2 such game crashes.

								Let's assume to start with that you've played Terraria previously.. Starbound is made by some of the developers who worked on Terraria (and that's probably horribly obvious from the visuals/gameplay). The difference here is the sheer level of expanse on the different levels of what Terraria contained. Right now (beta) this isn't a finished product but already it shows signs of being an amazing game. The different races, different planets and moons throughout a (near) infinite universe give a whole lot to be done and to see so get a couple of people together and go and explore space together! See you in the Stars ~			"

												This game used to be awesome. I loved the mystery about who you were. All you knew was your species and you woke up in a spaceship. Every single planet used to be a new adventure. Now i get bugs such as UI pops, sometimes gets so bad the UI goes away and dosen't come back for like 3 minutes. (This REALLY SUCKS during boss fights) I get crashes and loads of others. The random generation for the planets isn't as good as it used to be, and you really need mods to make the game good again.6.5/10 I miss this game.			"

												I've been playing this game for some time now, I got it while in early access back in 2014.At first I was worried that the developers had abandoned the game to work on other ones.However they came back and continued to develop, eventually we reach 1.0I love the game in the current state despite some issues and bugs.The new story mode is nice to have. Some features they included could really use enhancement.As a previous user mentioned, there is a ""broken loop"" within the game. However, I'm sure the developers will continue to work on this title and I hope to see so in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								The Beta of StarDrive allows players to explore the expanse of the universe in glorious, pixelated 2D! Part of the recent emergence of ""Mine, Craft, Explore"" games, a trend ignited by the advent of Minecraft some 4 years ago, this game will seem familiar to players of those type of games, in particular Terraria.You will scavenge for resources, mine your way into the earth with increasingly costly mining tools, and fend off creatures with a wide variety of different weapons. Much like it's other 2D brother, Terraria, the focus of Starbound seems to be concentrated more on the combating of Boss characters, or it's variation on hostile-infested dungeons. Although mention must be made of the extensive list of different decorative items the game sports, allowing you to build any number of marvellous space-bases and underground compounds.The game's biggest draw seems to be the thousands upon thousands of procedurally generated planets, that the player is free to explore at will, provided they have the resources to make the trip there. Each planet comes with different climates and a diverse set of unique creatures, procedurally generated from many different physical traits and abilities, that inhabit the world.With all of that said, it would seem that Starbound should be an amazing experience, with a near endless arsenal of new experiences, creatures and tools. The reality though, is that once you've seen 2 or 3 worlds, you've seen them all. The procedural generation may lead to an innumerable amount of different variations, but the worlds end up feeling very same-y, and you'll find yourself barely taking note of the nth iteration of 'bunnies with lizard tails'. The only thing that's genuinely worth discovering after a while are the different dungeon areas, and I imagine that novelty will wear thin once you've found all the different 'types'.The weapon/tool/gear progression can be a bit tedious, having to rely on collecting tons and tons of resources to craft the next tier, or on sheer luck of finding a chest with something that isn't terrible. You'll spend a lot of time digging up what you need for the next armour set so you can advance to a higher difficulty planet where you repeat that process again. On the upside, there are a lot of unique weapons generated in dungeons making those even more exciting and valuable to find. Especially early on, though, you'll spend a lot of time in the ground.With the game in early Beta, and the developers still working hard on improving on the many aspects of play, Starbound could have a bright future ahead of it, but it definitely has some hurdles to overcome to transcend being simply a novel variation in a genre that's seen better, more streamlined experiences.

								Best Sci-Fi Game sound track ever!!! This game has sucked more hours away from me than DayZ.  But it does it in a non intrusive kind of way.  Unlike DayZ where you feel every second of every minute of every hour of the day.  Starbound eases you into a false sense of control, what was once a quick 11pm mining run, easily and unnoticeably turns into a 3am dash for cash to the center of the earth.Been playing a little of the single player campaign to learn the ropes and get a feel of the mechanics but this game really shines with a few mates online in a locked down server working together for hours and hours on end crafting, building, hunting, looting, cooking etc..   Many a times have we seen the sunrise while playing this game and thought to ourselves ""Another day at work with less than 3 hours sleep...... totally worth it!"".			"

												Starbound is a game which takes the 2D sanbox genre and puts it in space. While a simple concept, it works and the game is very enjoyable. A heavy focus of this game is on mining and like most other game within the genre, you will be doing a lot of it if you want to progress. The mining is done mostly with the Matter Manipulator, althought there are alternatives. The mining isn't too monotonous and the underground mini-biomes give you a sense of exploration and discovery. That is until you've seen everything. The unfortunate part about this game is that once you've seen one desert planet, you've seen them all. Once you've seen a certain mini biome, you've seen every other of that same mini biome. The only reason I kept exploring and searching was so that I could find certain structures for building. Speaking of which, the building in this game is fun and the amount of blocks and furniture at your disposal allows for the creation of many different types of buildings and settings. Another aspect of building that works well are colonies. Colonies can be created by placing housing permits inside of buildings. These will attract unique tenants based on the type of furniture used in the home. This allows for players to create thriving towns and cities and liven up their builds. This is something starbound does much better than Terraria, as that only has a select few tenants. Another thing that's (as far as I know) unique to Starbound, is its story. Unlike most other games, Starbound has a story which you can choose to ignore or follow exclusively. While the plot isn't the greatest, it certainly isn't bad and provides something for players who want to know about the universe of Starbound. Lastly, combat. The combat in Starbound is unique, and works intuitively. The combination of 1-handed and 2-handed weapons and secondary abilities allows for different combat strategies.TL;DR, Starbound is an enjoyable game and is certainly worth the price for anyone who is a fan of the 2D sandbox genre.

												Super fun addictive game. It is one of the best open world / sandbox / crafting 2D games out. Easy to learn, easy to play. Save and exit the game at any time. I had purchased this game for my kids a long time ago in its early stages. I have to say the devs have done an amazing job with it, and I had to get my own copy.If you are looking for a fun game you can play off and on, or lose hours to each day this is it. The dev team is amazing, you wont be let down with this title.			"

With millions of different planets to explore (each having their own unique animals and plants), you'll become addicted to planet hopping, with each visit rewarding you with a new experience. There are planets home abandoned bases and castles, temples and mine shafts, the list goes on. There so much to do and for a price like this, its a steal.			"

												Honestly, this is one of my favorite games on steam. Its so creative and when playing and exploring planets you feels so free. Even though the story is technically optional (after the first main mission) its amazing to play through it and to learn about the game's universe (other than the novakids, you dont learn much about my favorite race).For all the people who say ""Oh is just a terraria rip off""/'It looks just like terraria, why not just get terraria"", I don't see where you're getting that from. The game gives you so much more freedom and things to do. Especially when it comes to world generation. In terraria it takes ages to create new worlds, while in Starbound the universe expands to nearly infinate proportions. Besides that, you can find so many more unique items within the game, you can interact and get missions from NPCs endlessly, you can get other people to join your ships crew. Theres also dozens of different types of worlds in Starbound, while in Terraria theres literally only 2 types of worlds.Otherwise, hands down a great game.			"

								This is a beta game that I can highly recommend. If you enjoyed Terraria, then you'll instantly fall in love with this games environments, characters, and crafting tools. It's all very familiar to the previous game yet it's far more exciting. With the ability to jump between planets and discover new worlds, and alien life, the content in this game already feels limitless. Since it's still in beta, you can expect there to be the occasional crash. After 14 hours of play time, I have experienced 2 such game crashes. When I reloaded, all of my content was still there so it was a minor annoyance at most. Definitely pick this up if you enjoyed Terraria.			"

								This game is incredibly diverse in it's content. Although all aspects of the game are not yet finished, Starbound has potential to be one of the best games in it's genre. If you've played Terraria, it is worth mentioning that Starbound is about jumping from planet to planet collecting unique items and building a city on a ""home planet,"" whereas terraria is very much a digging game. You can dig in Starbound, but it is much more valuable to explore the surface of foreign planets. The amount of unique and decorative items are impressive, combat is difficult but rewarding, and planets are rated by difficulty so that the player can keep the game challenging. I would reccomend buying this game primarily if it is on sale.			"

								This is a great game. I don't know why this game is getting hate. it is in early beta and you can do more than a lot of games that are fully developed. there are countless things to do in starbound. There are different sectors and types of terrains and worlds with amazing randomly generated structures. at night it gets colder and different enemies come out and you need good armor to survive. on the moon you have to have something that gives you oxygen and have really good armor because there are lots of ores on the moon. all of the terrains and world have their pros and cons. there are really good designed monsters with some neutral and some aggressive. there are differnet types of weapons with different stats, they have guns in this game. and you have to use a bow or hunting knife to get leather or food. if you use another weapon you get pixels a currency used in the game or used to craft things. 10/10, would play again.

								Starbound is a very fun game with cute characters, npcs, a large open galaxy to explore and tons of different armor and weapon variations. I had a ton of fun with this game and enjoyed playing more than I did Terraria, I don't think Terraria is bad, but for me Starbound is more fun to pick up and play than Terraria was. Although after I had good armour and weapons, My save file disappeared and my poor character was never to be heard from again. This is a big problem, as starting again won't feel the same as the first time. Not to mention having to mine thousands of materials just to get back where I was before. So I still love Starbound for what it is, but it is still in beta and has problems like this that can frustrate players who took time to make bases/armour etc. So I still recommend it, and I give it a 7/10.Hope this was helpful, and for the price tag of 14 euros, I think it's a good buy.

												This game used to be awesome. I loved the mystery about who you were. All you knew was your species and you woke up in a spaceship. Every single planet used to be a new adventure. Now i get bugs such as UI pops, sometimes gets so bad the UI goes away and dosen't come back for like 3 minutes. (This REALLY SUCKS during boss fights) I get crashes and loads of others. The random generation for the planets isn't as good as it used to be, and you really need mods to make the game good again.6.5/10 I miss this game.			"

The vast world and amount of this you can do, in the beta stage, covers up for the few problems. I love this game and have been playing it non-stop.

												There is no point in lieing about it. I. Love. This. Game. There is always something about this genre of games (Survival Sandbox) that has a soft spot reserved in my heart, but I'll try not to let this be a biased choice (even though this is a positive review)First off, Veterans of Terraria will feel right at home here. The gameplay is very similar so if you burnt out on Terraria, this game may not be as entertaining unless the differences are enough to get both your feet in the door.Version of game Where I am reviewing: 1.1.1What are the goods?     -The Randomization is amazing. You have thousands of planets across hundreds of solar systems. Each planet/moon are different in how it's shaped, the colors of the dirt/stone, and even it's trees. The enemies you encounter are different and those who do look similar, may not act as such.     -The music is fantastic. Anyone who has played this game will notice how the music brings out the explorer in you. I would definitely recommend buying the soundtrack! It's also a good step that the game has 'battle music' for when you engage in a fight, this is something Minecraft or Terraria have not done.     -There is SO MUCH STUFF. No seriously, you could be playing this game for weeks and still find something you haven't seen before.     -The game has a Story now with loveable characters.     -Steam Friends can join you at any time!And what do I have against this game?     -Unskippable cutscenes at times. (sucks for replayability)     -Some escort NPCs do not run away from fights and stand there to get killed.     -Members of a colony that you spawned can be recruited by other people in Multiplayer. (minor gripe)     -This game eats up a lot of my time. :I (not really a gripe)Overall, I still recommend this game. So if you enjoyed Terraria, you will enjoy this game! The transition to multiplayer via steamplay is very welcoming and I find me and my friends playing this without any hiccups.			"

								I bought starbound in 2013 and wow has it changed since then! When I first started playing I will not lie I had lots of doubts, but as I kept playing the game just showed real potential, the devs have been updating this game on a regualr basis since even before I purchased this game, coming up on4 years ago. Starrbound also has a truly amazing fan/player base there is someone for everything. So, if you want a space exploration, story rich (soon, sorry I've spent ""some"" time in the nightly build) game that is always improving than starbound is the game for you. And launch of 1.0 is just around the corner just 2 weeks away!			"

								Get it!Starbound is such a good, fun, exiting game and is definitely worth every penny. Starbound is like terraria but in space and soooooo much better as you can have a home planet and a home on your spaceship. You can craft, mine, fight(monsters minibosses and bosses), build and much more. There are many different planets to explore collect resources and make homes with beds, chests, windows, lamps, pictures and lots more. Overall a definite 10/10 and must buy. If this review has helped then give it a thumbs up so other people can see!			"

								Just to start off THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Ranging from the vast worlds and randomly generated, weapons, creatures, environments, planets, plant life and gravity this is a space adventure you will surely love. This game will bring a taste of star trek, doctor who and other sci-fi adventures to the gaming table. Couple this with an amazing soundtrack and nostalgic 16bit style platforming and hack n' slash gameplay and you've got the masterpiece that is starbound. Being its in early beta phase the promised story mode has not been added. Instead you simply start out on your own ship hovering over a random planet. Your space ship will also have 0/1000 fuel meaning your going to have to collect fuel if you want to travel to another planet (get it from coal and put in the box near your space ship commander♥♥♥♥♥♥pit) once you have that you can blast off and begin exploringall the randomly generated goodness!

								This is a great game. I don't know why this game is getting hate. it is in early beta and you can do more than a lot of games that are fully developed. there are countless things to do in starbound. There are different sectors and types of terrains and worlds with amazing randomly generated structures. at night it gets colder and different enemies come out and you need good armor to survive. on the moon you have to have something that gives you oxygen and have really good armor because there are lots of ores on the moon. all of the terrains and world have their pros and cons. there are really good designed monsters with some neutral and some aggressive. there are differnet types of weapons with different stats, they have guns in this game. and you have to use a bow or hunting knife to get leather or food. if you use another weapon you get pixels a currency used in the game or used to craft things. 10/10, would play again.

								Although a lot of people compared Starbound to  a wannabe Terraria, it is actually pretty different. It feels similar and has a same basis, but has many new and improved features. The big thing that Starbound tries to do differently, is everything in the game is made randomly, not just the enviroment (which may consist of purple dirt and pine trees with cloud needles), but also the weapons and their stats, the creatures that you battle, and some of the other aspects. It expands by adding in Research trees for equipment, so you cannot jsut find a meteorite and have mid-game gear early on. It also adds in survival mechanics that add more depth, you need to stay warm, and eat to survive (although there is no real penalty for not doing so other than respawning at your ship) Also, in a similar fashion to Terraria, it is going to recieve content updates and patches over a long period. It adds a quest system, friendly and enemy NPC's, and rather than building your town, there are different faction villages scattered around. It is everything you would love in Terraria, pumped up on steroids, and then loaded with a lot of new features. Definitely worth the $15!9.5/10Edit: It has already received three major updates after being out for a week (at 500-700 Mb a piece, and the game is only 2.5or 3 Gb) They fix any issues very quickly and are adding new content at the same time			"

								READ! : Warning at the bottom. Read it, it is very important!--------------------------------------------------------------If you like Terraria, an endless(almost) universe, building, boss fights, space and exploration all in 2d pixel art, this game might be for you.The universe is a host to all the world seeds available. You will find that it is impossible to explore every world. Each world is different from the last in some way, be it biome, sub biomes, npc's or structures.The building has improved on Terraria's. The placement of blocks is smooth, and there are many more types of blocks to find. There are also many types of decorations, including apex propaganda posters, toxic waste barrels, and skull pikes. The boss fights are a bit of a cheese at the moment, but will hopefully be improved on later.Space is vast, and exploration of many worlds is encouraged. You get a bad starting planet? Gather some coal and go to another. The travel sequence is probably one of the best loading screens I have ever seen, your ship enters light speed and you can continue to move around the ship. The pixel art has its charm, and the monster desings are adorable, and randomly generated from existing parts! It's like a ditto had an accident with its ability.  Each playable race has its own types of architexture, and feel. The Hylotl are japanese with a large emphasis on water, the Humans are typical mordern styled architexture focusing more on stranded penal colonies and research labs, the Apex are highly advanced and have testing facilities scattered throughout the stars, the Florans have flower huts and are very tribal, the Avian are mayan inspired(of course with a focus on the sky), the glitch are Robots stuck in the medeival era due to a glitch in their programming *GASP*, and the novakid which aren't in yet are going to be based on the wild west.All of these things make a good game, and with more features coming I can only forward to, I can see this game becoming great.. This game has already taken 31 hours of my life and I can safely recommend this game.Warning:This is a BETA. This Beta contains all your normal beta things, such as balancing issues, incomplete features, character wipes, people who think you have read all the forum posts, poor performance on some machines, community feedback(good and bad), fanboys, and more bugs than you can shake a stick at!  If you are not alright with any combination of these and refuse to put up with them, then you are much better off WAITING. You have been warned.			"

								This game is brilliant. Take Terraria, put it in space, and throw a ton of weapons, items, mobs and worlds at it, and you get Starbound. Despite it being in Alpha, there are no bugs I have encountered. Play it. Just play it.			"

												It was better a year ago. Chucklefish, in all their efforts to finally reach 1.0, gutted the game and threw some glitter on it. Not only that, but features that were in the game YEARS ago are missing. However, that's not the worst of it. 1.0 is unoptimized trash. I used to be able to run the game perfectly, but now im lucky to not get FPS drops when running on the lowest settings possible. Mouse acceleration is absolutely atrotious, good luck actually clicking on what you want to. This game had so much potential, and it was great- I had a better time with the buggy nightly builds than I ever will with 1.0. Sad.			"

												Five years spent making this game. I've only been following it for two, but the number is still amazing to me. 5 years spent developing a game, with updates taking maybe once or twice a year. That would indicate the developers putting a lot of thought and love into the game, right? Wrong. Wrong, wrong, WRONG. Absolutely wrong.Starbound 1.0 has been in development for most of 2016, and I was exicited for it at the beginning of the year. The past two updates were amazing and left me wanting a full game. And now, it's here. The full game. The beta builds before this were better in every regard except story. Every single regard. Better sprites, better gameplay, better action bars, better inventory, better online capabilities, better progression through the game, everything. Every single thing was better in the betas. And they weren't even complete. That's how much Chucklefish ruined this game with 1.0 dropping.The first of many issues is the development team. They're somewhat incompetent. They definitely had the best intentions for this game, but so many of the development choices they made while making 1.0 were garbage. Absolute trash. They should have been focusing on making the game better, but it feels like they just broke the game more in trying to do that. There were a few complaints here and there that female breasts were too prominent on any outfit, but now they're basically invisible. You can't tell a male character from a female character.It feels like they wanted to streamline the stories, but in doing so they completey rewrote what story already existed in the game, instead of taking the separate stories for the 7 races and making them go down one linear path. They wanted to make the hotbar more efficient (Though it already had what I consider to be one of the best hotbars in a game) so they split it into five sets of two slots, and if an item is two-handed, it takes up two slots. Previously, the game had a hotbar that had 5 slots on either side of a pair of buttons that corresponded to your mouse buttons. They made the inventory, which originally had three tabs of storage, have four tabs of storage. But now, items are locked to a specific inventory tab, so while it seems you have more space, you actually have much less space. Now for the biggest issue I have with the game: It won't launch anymore. I've reinstalled it three times now, and nothing. Every time, the Chucklefish logo loads, and then it crashes and closes. I can do nothing about this. What was previously one of my favorite games has been rendered unplayable by an ""update"" that was supposed to make the game better. I only know what I know from my friends who have been able to get the damn thing to work, and a few hours put into Unstable.I noticed something interesting when I navigated down to the store page to write this review. The game's been marked down since its early access days, from 20$ to 14$. This puzzles me, as I would have expected the price to go up. (Though I'm glad it didn't.) This leads me to an interesting conclusion:The developers literally stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game. They realised that their 1.0 release was garbage, so they brought the price down so that people wouldn't complain about it being overpriced. If that's true, Why, Chucklefish? Why force out something you know isn't worth the money when you can spend more time and make something that people would like and find to be worth the price? Even with that in mind, I can't recommend this game. Back in early access, I would absolutely have left a shining review of how great this game was and how much potential it had, but now I can't. To tell you this game is worth the 14$ price of admission would be a lie. I really do hate to say this, as it is one of my favorite games, but it's the truth. The developers ruined this game. I would uninstall it and forget about it, except for the fact that I've become a moderator on an RP server that I'm incredibly fond of, and I can't stand to abandon that server and the friends I've made there. Chucklefish, thank you for giving me the chance to meet people like this, but screw you for ruining your game.			"

												The hunger system is a bit over the top, it simply depletes to quickly, and rotting food is quite annoying to get rid of.I remember a lot of fun tech that let me fly around the world, i felt fantastic doing so, all that has seemingly been removed.Performance seems to also be quite poor, I'm running a i7 3770k, 970gtx and 16 gigs of ram, and the game still chugs regularly when in a fight with 5-6 spell effects, furthermore the chunk loading can't keep up with me walking left or right without interruption, so hoverbikes are completely pointless and so are boats.Terraria still reigns supreme, by far, if anything starbound has gotten worse since i last played, the only positive change i can mention are the addition of the Primary missions where you discover/scan all the factions and fight bosses throughout.I'd recommend getting Terraria instead.

Taking out craftable pickaxes made this game excruciatingly slow. Maybe I just got a bad seed, but I want the last 3 hours of my life back.

Early Access Review
								This latest update has changed Starbound completely. In a good way, of course.There is so much new, everything shown in Starbound news, everything the team was working on!I've been playing around 12 hours non-stop and can only leave a positive review to this.Sure, there are bugs and crashes, but again, this is in beta version and will further on improve!Now, to the review itself:You start in a broken ship which you have to fix up in order to start travelling. Before you travel you gather resources and minerals that are needed to fix up the ship so it can move. This is basically your first quest which involves exploring of your starting planet and digging from surface down to the core of the planet.You then are sent to a mysterious gate that leads to an outpost where you see a gathering of multiple races, such as glitch, human, avian, floran, hylotl, apex who give you quests and missions that let you proceed further into the game.The entire concept is mostly exploring. You get all your gear through mining for ores and occasionally bumping into chests which have a rare chance of having a rare weapons and cosmetics which makes the game more fun. Besides, if you explore further down, you may find some small labs of sorts that have these chests and other items aside!Some of the quests involve finding an item, such as an Avian Moon Emblem which can only be found at Avian Tombs which take time to search for.This kind of quests is ideal for Starbound due to the fact that it forces the player to explore non-stop in order to proceed further through and upgrade their gear, matter manipulator and even the ship.This was about gameplay.Races:There are 7 races - Glitch, Human, Avian, Floran, Apex, Hylotl, Novakids.All of them have their own styles of gear and ships, later on will also have special race abilities!Planets:Before you randomly click on a planet to travel to you are meant to see how dangerous it is, you can't just go on a planet with high radiation while wearing only iron tier gear!They divide in following difficulties: Harmless, Mostly Harmless, Moderate, Dangerous, Extreme.You start on Harmless, it also however has almost nothing on it, apart from weak monsters and some trees. Mostly Harmless has stronger gear, monsters and even dungeons you can visit. And so it goes on... There also are different types: Forest, desert, arid, ocean, snow, snow ocean, jungle and extreme planets with lava on surface with no air to breate with enormously high temperature. There also are moons where you can gather up with fuel for your ship! They however dont have any ore.Other than that, all of these have their own weather. An example would be sand storms in desert, rain in ocean and forest, snow storm in frozen planets, etc.There is still some stuff lacking however. It can't be called a FULL game, but it can be called a descent game. Even though the updates aren't so frequent, why do you people just whine about it? Starbound isn't the only game in the world, why keep so many hopes on a single early access game?As for the new winter update content itself, there is a lot you can talk about, but it is always better to play the game to see it all yourself!

												As it stands, this update has been really bad.  I was willing to wait for 1.0, but apparently Chucklefish decided to act out of character and rush their♥♥♥♥♥♥well before it was ready to go.  Unless of course, you like that RICH STARBOUND LORE.  Go forth, graduate space cop high school and watch the gym teacher get violated by tentacles.Not only are many unable to actually play it, but the game as of this update not only performs slower, but the gameplay itself is paced out slower and the menu navigation will definitely slow you down.  It makes sense, considering the development period behind this game.  I'll play more to see if there is any redemption in it, but so far it's a waste of time.By the by, I was a backer before there was a playable version.  It was a good game before.EDIT: I beat it.  I cringe.  Anyway, figured out they implemented V-Sync and you can only toggle it off through the starbound.config file.  The difficulty eventually becomes absolutely trivial (alone, even) with final boss resembling the final boss of Borderlands. An eldritch monster that appears as a threat while actually posing very little, with a weak payoff.  The reward is a mediocre sum of money and upgrade components that didn't actually amount to much good.  The closest thing to a challenge it gets is a mission that basically gives you a gauntlet of enemies to fight, which begins to feel repetitive.  Oh, and then you fight the bone dragon.  I love flying enemies.  This game could have benefitted from focusing on performance, and more importantly, creating a challenging game for their gameplay changes which otherwise just make the game feel tedious.It wasn't a HORRIBLE experience, but it was definitely disappointing seeing this game descend into something less enjoyable than the unfinished product.  I'd consider trying to download an older build in the future for nostalgia, but I doubt I'll log much more time in THIS game as opposed to the one I actually liked.  I LIKED being forced into a hole, shooting arrows at a penguin-manned UFO trying to get a mustache ride from me.  It wasn't that dreadful, but now you can just wing the fight.			"

												Upon booting up this once perfectly fine game, I noticed that my FPS was significantly lower than it was in beta. Once I realized the tutorial was a lengthy experience because of this, I deleted the character who was trapped in there and decided to skip it to see if my ship would provide a better framerate. No such luck. After I managed to stumble my way through the dialogue and navigate my ship (a good 5 minutes for what was once maybe 30 seconds), I managed to beam down to the surface of the planet I was in the orbit of. My frames shot up to about 20-30, which was actually playable, but shortly afterwards dropped to back to 5-15, with frequent dips to sub 3. Combat and NPC interaction would also hurt the framerate, and whenever I opened some kind of menu, the game would hang for half a minute. Building a basic wooden shack was a 15 minute long ordeal of slowly watching trees fall and lagging through the pickup notifications (because those count as menus), slowly navigating the crafting menu to make planks, navigating another menu to make a door, and then finally giving up when I was unable to fight back against the 4 or so hopping dudes who got in before I could place the door. Wait for optimization updates if you don't have a gaming rig. Otherwise, from my experience in beta, it should be very enjoyable.UPDATE: Almost a full year and still no optimization. Why not?			"

												I learned very early that there is no pause functionality in this game. You have to save & quit and then reload the game. Your character goes right back to where you were before. It doesn't take long to load, so it only takes a few extra seconds to do that. It's really not that bad.So I was doing the first instanced mission today, and I'm woefully underprepared for it. I'm in there for almost an hour, when I have to get up and go do something. ""Hey, I'll just save & quit the mission and come back pretty soon,"" I think. I get up, go do stuff, and get back to pick up where I left off in the mission. Only now, all of my mission progress is gone and I'm back in my space ship.I immediately quit and uninstalled the game. I can't be bothered to play a game that doesn't have the most basic quality of life feature. I might revisit the game if the developers add pausing (or at least saving mission progress), but this experience left me pretty disappointed.			"

												Ive played this since early access. What is most frustrating is it feels like older versions of the game were better than this one. The story is there, but its luke warm. ""Go explore X, got to Y and get Z""(Repeat 5 times). The new characters they introduce mean nothing to you in the long run. Half of them are useless, the other 2 sell you things you have no use for because by the time you really get into the game, you have everything you need.The inventory system is better now than it was before, but not by much. Exploration is there, but since most planets are just reskins of others with a little bit of variety thrown in, It wasen't immersive. It was bland. If you loved Terraria, theres a great chance you'll hate this.			"

												Don't buy it.Why?As someone who's pre-ordered this game and had it since early access, I can safely say that Tiy has done nothing with this game in the past years of development other than diddle around with his thumb up his♥♥♥♥♥ ""Thick and fast!"" they said. Then e had to wait MONTHS for an update after that statement. Not only are the devs childish, banning people who critisize them on their forums and delete negative reviews, but they are also incompetent. One of the main programmers left the team years ago, and Tiy didn't tell anyone until months later after his departure. This game is a game of disappointment, lies, and what could have been.The gameplay is a stale grind, mining ores and searching as many planets as you can for the upgrades you need to progress. The combat is clunky. The enemies are pallete-swapped messes with a special ability tacked on, as are the weapons. Sure, they added enemies that are unique, but who cares? They don't have anything rewarding about fighting them. No unique drops. No super-special devastating attacks that'll leave you breathless saying ""Wow! I better watch out for that guy!"" They even removed the occasional mini-bosses, that dropped unique weapons and items.The bosses are a step in the right direction, but until they can get what Terraria nailed with combat, such as all the enemies being really unique and not RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, then I'm gonna stick with my opinion of the combat being stale and repetitive.The exploration is supposed to be the real kicker, but it kicks like a crippled Kangaroo.The planets are all the same biomes, palette swapped yet again, and have been that way since early access. The different types of stars and planets are pretty nice, but they still feel very repetitive. The exploration isn't fun. Whilst Terraria has deep cave systems brimming with discovery, the caves of Starbound feel like the same dirt tunnel, with maybe 5-10 ores, and an occasional generated structure with no loot to be found.The quests? Who cares. Shallower than Skyrim's. That's quite the feat to achieve.Core gameplay mechanics are broken, too. I played some Multiplayer with my friends, all with new characters. Returning to my singleplayer world, I noticed I was still on the same quest, halfway through the game, and half my outpost was locked off, never to be accessible on that character again.The game feels empty. The progression doesn't feel rewarding. Some might argue Terraria had much more time to be developed, but at this point, Starbound is falling very far behind compared to what Terraria had some years ago.Get Terraria instead. It's cheaper, and doesn't require any friends to tag along to be fun.			"

								Many people compare this game to Terraria. And yes, it looks very similar. Pixel art graphics,blocky world and other features from Terraria may be found in Starbound. But this game isunique. It's different. You're not limited by having one world per character. Here, you can explore the wholeuniverse. And that includes bazillion of planets in various galaxies.          But hey, it's still in beta. When Terraria was in beta it wasn't even half that good. However, this game still needs a lot of balancing (8.12.2013, new updates may fix it) and therefore it makesthe game really hard at this moment.So overall, great game. If you loved Terraria, you'll definitely like this game as well. Building in this game is fantastic. Combat is good as well but needs some balancing.9.6/10.0 game, atleast for me. "

												Starbound is ; FTL, Terraria, Borderlands esc (different named guns), and minecraft all combined! You start in a ship and are given quests to make progress through the game, you can fuel up your ship and go to other planets and pick your race. Overall this is a very colourful game with quriky monsters and always something new to explore.			"

Early Access Review
								Right now the game has plenty of content but not all that much to do other than visit one planet, see what is on it and try moving from system to system hunting gear/tech upgrades.That said, the game is a lot of fun, it's just like Terraria in terms of play style, but with more added depth from things like Minecraft such as having to eat and tools deteriorating over time, but so much more has also been added it would be a shame to pass this up at this early stage just because of it's lack of content.This isn't like Terraria with only one world to explore, there are plenty of planets and systems all with randomly generated inhabitants, enemies, natural food/plants and resources.From random science labs, to camps to castles, what you find is completely random and without help could take a long time to do so.Also another plus is the game is totally open to modding so people can create custom ships, blocks, weapons, pretty much anything goes.All in all I would highly recommend it since the game will only get better, but I do advise you to remember this is beta, it is still buggy, you will experience random lag from tiem to time or something just going wrong, and a fair few in game items are still without descriptions which can be annoying but other than that it is definately worth the £12 on steam or £9.50 on the Devs official website.

This isn't a rip off of Terreria it is a very good game in its own right. The variety of encounters, weapons and planets is simply stunning and the soundtrack and graphics are amazing. The developers have done a really good job on this one and they should be very proud of themselves.

								Laughing about all the negative reviews with 50-600+ hours played on record. My favorite is that it's ""boring"". If you spend over 50 hours on a $15 game you weren't bored. This game is a hoot and the scale is boggling. Today my little brother and I (on a personal server) explored and dug to the core of an ice planet. Standard ice/snow biome form with plenty of white stuff. One in-game night we wander around the other side of the planet and it is a ridiculous spectacle of biolumencent light. We would have never seen it if we just sat on the first half and dug around. Some may call it simple novelty but even simple variations in colors and design keep things fresh. People want to constantly compare it to Terraria but Terraria ""suffers"" the same linear feeling after a few characters. Half the play time in Terraria is spent checking the wiki and the other half is grinding to get the armor and weapons to beat the boss so you can get the new armor and weapons to beat the next boss. The only difference in Starbound is you aren't wandering aimlessly and don't have to own multiple monitors just to be able to do what you want to be able to do. Terraria is the same linear path every playthrough. Make a character, build a house, explore/mine for better things, get some NPCs, fight the EoC, fight the Corruption/Crimson boss, go to the underworld, fight the WoF, enter hard mode, the same hallow falls over the map, the same enemies appear every time, and so on and so forth. And I LOVE Terraria. Talking as if the games are vastly different is silly, though. Starbound simply choses not to let you trick yourself that you're really in a sandbox from the start. Starbound lets you settle in and make colonies and build and destroy as you like and move onto the next thing. I guess it might not feed to the obsessive natured player as much. It's less of a sandbox and more of a beach full of sandcastles. Build them up and leave them behind because you have millions of other worlds to tend to.  "

Build your settlements, raid entire solar systems and drain planets of resources to build up your character to explore the universe. You have a large amount of different weapons and tools in your arsenal to aid you on your quest. Maybe you want to be a pacifist, just playing with your friends? No problem, grab a electric guitar and start a band instead! So much stuff to do...Get this game!			"

												READ BEFORE BUYINGIt is completely fair to connect this game to it as it shares more than enough parts to be classified in the same genre and also shares its lead developer as he was a former developer for TerrariaI loved terraria so when I found out this game was coming out, I pre ordered it as soon as possible. I followed it for 1 year prior to it being released, checking everyday for an update or their news blog. I became a part of the forum to satisfy my craving to play this game. I was met with nothing more than a very, very strict, open world terraria. I believe in their quest to out do terraria (and thats what it was, dont believe me, look at the developers(spoiler alert starbounds head dev left terraria to make a ""better game"")), they lost the sense of what made terraria a good game in the first place. It brings me great sadness that I have to critque them like this, but its the truth. Believe me when I say that I searched high and low for positives in this game.Pros:-Beautiful, extremely bountiful randomly generated environment-Random from weather to dirt color, amazing-Very large worlds, inside of very large solar systems, inside of galaxies, infinite planets-Large amount of vanity and places to explore-A handful of difference races, all with unique and difference building styles and weapons-Dynamic and beautiful lighting engineMajor Cons:-Little to motivation to work for lootRather than grinding and trying to find ores underground, players find it much simpler to explore and find ruins which have the already smelted and refined bars in abundance to say the least, there is zero motivation to delve underground other than to seek death and the occasional useless ore that you could easily find thousands of bars in the house at the planets landing spot-No motivation to settleThere is zero reason for a player to settle on any landmass other than to simply store items, which your ship is more than capable of completing this task on its own. You can but dont need to grow crops, nothing. This inspires nomads to simply move from planet to planet stripping the surface generated dungeons for high tier loot that would take hours to find below ground(Ties into first con)Trivial Cons:-Races hold no dynamics other than building styles(Fish cant breath under water, ect)-THOUSANDS of colors of dirt, that all take different inventory slots-Infrequent and disgraceful updates-Weapons range from useless to insanely over powered with no inbetween-Land on planet, look on surface for dungeons, leave, zero connection to lands-Very little graphics settings, in which npcs and enemies inspire the worst lag I have ever incountered (bad coding)-Enemies range from pathetic to the devil himself in terms of difficulty-The rarest of loot is found in the barns on the planets surface, instead of the planets core-Planets are waste lands filled with empty caves and npcsTo be frank it just feels empty, early access or not. There is no motivation to do anything, no loot isnt special or ""rare"" because it can be found in any given house on any planet. I found the main reason I even wasted my time playing this game was spent searching for terrains I had not yet seen, for simple wow factor. The game was in short, a total failure and not what they had conveyed from their original plans. SURE it's early access, try again in what they have put up to be in terms of updates in a year or two.			"

												In its current state Starbound is, for all intents and purposes, a husk of its former self; while the early access showed us a grand potential, a colourful and vibrant world punctuated by creative mechanics and a foundamentally interesting and dynamic gameplay, the current iteration of the game (1.0) is a stale, eviscerated shell lacking cohesion and a focused vision behind its misguided path into mediocrity.Sadly, much of what made this game fascinating and enjoyable to play during its earlier iterations is gone. Numerous mechanics, items and abilities have been utterly stripped away; resulting in a tedious repetitive gameplay loop, devoid of any creativity.What remains is an underwhelming and thoroughly repetitive main storyline, an insuffiìcient and dull combat system lacking proper weapons and movesets, hours of bland repetitive exploration through the same environments, a complete lack of any ship customisation option, nightmarish inventory management and a laughable excuse for a progression system.

								Interesting and great in all. It is a great space exploration game with elements of story that lock you in place just long enough for you to get sick of the starting planet.

								It's Terraria in space. With more original stuff. That's the most simple explanation I can give you. In reality, it's a whole lot more than Terraria.The content isn't even entirely in, and we have unique races, unique dialogue for the races, unique dialogue between races, space travel, more weapon possibilities than a lot of other games (Borderlands maybe being the only exception), lots of ways to decorate yourself, and a pretty decent soundtrack.What's bad is little, and that's mostly because people are usually having problems they caused entirely by themselves. It's still nowhere near done, so there is a lot of content to look forward to. Not like we don't have enough already.			"

There are trully limitless possibilities for you to explore and the procedural generation of almost everything results in an unlimited replayability value of this game. Multiplayer is very fun and generally speaking this game is VURRY polished for beta.I DO believe this game has tremendous potential and a massive amount of features are already playable. Highly reccomend this game to ALL sci-fi lubbers out there and RPG players alike!!! Guys, this is your dream game. Buy it now, plz.Sincerely (-ish xD) Greg :)			"

								I can safely say after following the game for more than a year I can see the game heading in the right direction. Alot has changed from my last review on Starbound (where I could not recommend it) and I can safely say the  grinding for pixels and mobs  have come to an end. Starbound provides enough content now to keep you entertained, and even longer if you have an imagination; such as roleplaying across different characters on multiple planets with the new NPCs introduced in the colony update. I even love the fact that the starting galaxy is shared across all characters like a central hub. The new planet biomes are fantastic and now have structures randomly generated for different NPCs to inhabit based on furniture, weapons now vary vastly cosmeticly/statisticly and can be carried across different tiers with the armor new stats. No longer will you find an item you like from teir 1 or 2 and have to abandon it by teir 4 or 5. I can only hope more developers listen and respond to the feedback they recieve like Chucklefish has.I look foward to future updates chucklefish has in store.			"

												It's painful to give a bad review, because I'm a dev myself. I want to like Starbound because I loved Terraria. Played 60 hours during early access, but came back today palyed for 1 hour and quit.Controls in 1.0 is abysmal. It felt like they were trying to map a controller hotkeys onto a keyboard and mouse setup. The hotkey bar was labelled and they added ""R"" as a special hotkey for mining. I was constantly trying to hit ""4"" to switch to mining, then wondering why it didn't work. Many hotkey bars allows for a second slot (left and right click). Visually this is very confusing. My brain looking at the UI, expects the items to be mapped from 1-9, not 1 (left / right) 2 (left / right) etc.There were a lot of other introductory pacing issues too. Enemies on the ground floor being too challenging behavior wise, paired with a flawed starting sword with a cooldown. But these are all secondary compared to the controls issue.Please fix. "

I got the game a couple days after it was released on steam, and even with the character wipes I thought the game was awesome. Then 1.0 hit. I can't even start it up anymore, and the same goes for many others. Chucklefish, if your reading this, put more effort into a smooth launch next time instead of turning off so many people by making the game literally unplayable and not having a fix ready.			"

								This game is what I would call ""One in a million""... It's depth and bravery to allow players so much of what the current gaming scene wants is uncanny... with elements of the multi million pound proffiting successor of Minecraft and elements of Role playing and tower defence, as well as a dungeon crawler and a whole universe with millions and millions of planets to discover just seems like it's biting off more than it can chew, but in actual fact its all executed absolutely brilliantly so far!This is in its Prognitory stage of development which is still stage 1 of 3, which for me, being a buyer since day 1, has been overwhelmed by with the feedback of developers, the community and the astounding plans what are in place for its bright future! It's content crazy with so much to do, all the time! Even without its story and quests in place, or any other of the MAIN features I have played over 200 hours of this game and counting! With another update AGAIN this morning with more content almost every other day I just can't get enough of this absolute delight of a game.Buy it, its crazy how cheap it is when I look at my playing hours!

												Getting your ship up and running takes *hours*, and *must* be done for *each and every character* you make.Doing the story missions *is required* in order to get to the actual exploration.Mining is still boring as hell, and still frequently required.Enemies do damage on contact, instead of just when attacking, which the devs had previously said *would not be the case*.Your weapons are still generally too weak to be useful against more than one or two enemies at a time. Meaning you have to run away far too often.Enemies still do too much damage, meaning that cheesing the AI with the terrain is still the only way to explore in any kind of safety. Which makes combat incredibly dull.They removed the option where you only lost money on death, which just makes the terrible combat even more punishing.Starbound is nothing like what was promised.It might have merit for some, but it is *not* the game that was advertised when I bought it.

												I used to like this game when it was in the early stages, it seemed rich in content and was enjoyable to explore this randomly generated universe, finding abandoned bases, dungeons, loot and playing with friends. So many character resets and updates later we have the finished game and I'm not too keen.The game is a lot harder now and sometimes feels punishing while inventory management feels like a complete mess. On top of that a lot of content has been stripped down and outright removed leaving the finished project feeling more barebones compared to the alpha.Even the sandbox elements feel toned down to make way for the story and quest content which for the early stages forces you to take part in before you can so much as use your ship or explore the game world(Oh and you have to do a rather hard quest first hand and good luck finding decent gear at the start). Another issue is melee weapons have been seriously nixed and are now extremely slow and delayed meaning enemies can bum rush you between attacks resulting in a lot of annoying deaths.The crafting is also sluggish now and even simple items like doors(Which should be there from the get go) seem to require upgrades and extra items before you can unlock them, so have fun playing hours before you can build so much as a mud hut in your space adventure game.It feels like a shame because the game had a lot of potentional and when the alpha builds have more content than the finished product, something's wrong.

Early Access Review
								As of this writing, Starbound is still in Early Access. That said, I am impressed by the experience already available through the game. The premise is simple: you are the captain of a now-defunct spaceship stuck orbitting an unknown planet and must travel to its surface in order to gather the materials to survive and bring your ship back to working order. Doing this can seem daunting at first, but you will quickly learn how to use the resources of the planet to obtain the weapons, tools, and armor needed to defend against alien creatures, stave off the elements, and deal with the planet's native residents as you see fit. Before you know it, you have what you need to return your ship to the stars. This is where the true experience of the game begins, as you realize that there is an unlimited universe stretched out before you filled with infinite worlds ripe for exploration. You just need to decide where to start.As for the more technical aspects of the game, Starbound puts truth to the adage 'less is more', making use of every pixel in its 16 bit era-inspired canvas to paint a remarkable scenery, beginning right out the gate with the character creation process. Surprisingly extensive, it gives you a choice between multiple distinct races and countless options for hairstyle, clothing, colors, and even posture to give your character a unique, personalized look on a level that I would have thought impossible with the limitations of the format. Beyond that, the environments themselves boast a charming, otherworldy appearance that varies from world to world as you hop around the galaxy. Purple dirt and thirty foot tall flowers? Why not!Exploration of the grid-based worlds becomes somewhat routine after the third or fourth planet, though the variance in content--ranging from ruined temples of seemingly ancient civilizations to sprawling castles filled with anachronistic robots--gives you something new to find each time you touch down on a world. Though some worlds you find may be desolate desert-planets worth only the minerals to be unearthed below their surface, others will be crawling with civilized life, friendly or otherwise, for you to interact with. They may react to your presence differently based on your race and their own, as well as by your actions on the planet, to some extent. In any case, you yourself are free to befriend, ignore, or decimate any such inhabitants you may come across.The crafting system in the game is extensive beyond my exploration of it so far, allowing you to make armor, swords, rifles, chairs, safes, lanterns, pickaxes, drills... the list goes on and on, but to keep it brief, it is a vast terrain worthy of the interests of explorers of such devices. For those interested only in the core features of crafting required for progression through the game, the whole system is gated by Starbound's universal tier structure, keeping the system from being overwhelming. I find myself somewhere in the middle, capable of appreciating the many choices I am given, but often putting them aside to engage in other activities.While there are, of course, flaws in Starbound, I am reluctant to detail them in any extensive detail. This is in part because, as mentioned before, the game is still in Early Access and Chucklefish has done well so far at keeping the game consistently-updated, but also because these flaws are largely overshadowed by the strong points of the game. Were I to point fingers however, the major culprits would be the oft-finicky multiplayer mode and the lack of content depth that is inherent in most any procedurally-generated construct.In brief, Starbound brings many welcome additions to the gameplay of the sandbox adventure genre that has become so popular in the past few years. The game performs well in its many facets--sandbox gameplay, item farming/crafting, 16-bit graphics--and I can earnestly recommend it to any fans of those gameplay elements.			"

								Captain's log stardate 4Cw4Fts23456.233.532.554356#234@561!55234#:Today I met a bunny. He shot lazers at me until I fled to a nearby cave. I found 16 coal within the cave, meaning I only need 23 more to make the rocket boots I've been working towards for 5 days. My only fear is that I will need to use this valuable resource to transport myself to a new planet with new possibilities for exploration before I can create my boots. I would like to return to the surface and explore the other side of the planet but... the bunnies scare me. They require 4 good hits with my Hammer of Infinite Pain and Death, but my Armor of Ultimate Protection mk1 only allows me to survive 3 of their attacks before I must rest for 9 hours to restore my stamina. Still I trudge on, for what is life without challenge.Captain Eparttub signing out.			"

Early Access Review
								Starbound is a game that had a lot of press hype, steam (no pun intended), and promise. After a while it turns out that it just isn't that great. While riding the coattails of a game similar to Terraria with more worlds and opportunity, they managed to miss capturing the magic that made Terraria great. The charm isn't there, and all the promises, last I checked, were left untouched and unfinished. Here's a hint: Bosses shouldn't be ""kill or be killed,"" or determined in the first 3 seconds if they will be able to be killed, this lead to very lame gameplay (shooting through a single brick so you can't die, etc.)			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, this game is early access. If you've seen other early access games that stay in this pre-release state for extremely long periods of time like Minecraft or DayZ, you can get an idea of where this game is headed. From what I've seen of the few changelogs that come to Starbound, the developers have no intention to complete this game any time soon. They are stuck in this indefinite time of ""Gimme $15 and maybe I'll finish the game someday...""Due to this incomplete state Starbound is trapped in, there aren't large amounts of things to do, and there are also holes in the gameplay where it seems like a certain function or addition should be available, but it hasn't been implemented. For example, Hylotl villages and dungeons. The Hylotl, a playable race in Starbound, were strangely unique in the fact that there were no villages or dungeons that are Hylotl themed, while every other race has its own form of village or living space. Although these constructions are around now, they were simply hyped for many, many months while the developers consistently and non-officially told us about them. This is simply one example of the shoddy update schedule and unclear idealogy of Starbound as a whole.Another thing that really peeved me and my friends was the advancement of tiers and the gameplay balance. In Starbound, there are several different ""sectors"" comprised of a seemingly infinite amount of solar systems with planets in them. You start in the Alpha sector and work your way up, Beta, Gamma, and so on. Each of these sectors has a few different tiers of weapons and armor in an established hierarchy of worst to best made of different materials that you mine up and craft into these tools. It starts of innocently enough, copper, silver, iron and the sort which don't require TOO much of each of them for a full set of armor and a shiny new weapon. However, once you to get to some of the later sectors like Delta and the legendary final ""X"" sector, the crafting materials are completely unforgiving. You must mine dozens and dozens of one of the new special ores in these late sectors and mine dozens and dozens of ANOTHER ore and combine these both together. Maybe then you'll have a pair of boots. The problem with mining is how agonizingly slow the fastest and best pickaxe in the game, the diamond pickaxe (creativity right there) mines these ores, the ores that are almost crucial you dig up and make into armor so you don't get one-shotted by the average hostile genetic mistakes that inhabit the late-game sectors.Don't get me wrong, me and my friends had quite a bit of fun for several weeks while playing in the lower sectors, as reflected in my playtime. However, the gameplay balance is almost as broken AND comparable to the endless grinding in many MMOs, which absolutely ruins any fun set by the standards of the lower sectors and turns it into barely scraping by in a corrupted world. According to the blue words above my review, this game is in early access and should be fixed in due time. But the due time could be a couple more years. I'd say Starbound definitely isn't worth the $15 pricetag, $10 is more appropriate, although there are other $10 games that are more worth that money like G-Mod and Terraria. If you're thinking of buying this game, just wait until it goes on sale AND is full release in a few years.			"

												This game's premise has potential but it was wasted.Pros:-Music is good.-Pixel art is pretty.Cons:-Everything else.I'm sorry but this game isn't fun, it just... Isn't.The planets are samey, the quests are lame, the plot is linear, the combat is boring, the loot is drab.I've been playing this game since early alpha, the whole time I've been waiting for it to ""Get fun"" hoping that it was just one patch away from ""Clicking"" and I'd finally see the vision that the developers had for the game.What vision?It's terraria in space with worse combat and slightly improve pixel art, honestly Terraria is BETTER.And for the LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD! Can we please stop with the Resource Treadmill progression system?Who loves mining? Who here has dreamed of being a miner as a wee lad or lass? Who can't WAIT to get out into that big open universe to do some good ol' mining!?Seriously, stop it, no wants to ****ing mine, stop tying progression to the least fun aspect of your game please?This could have been avoided by having an XP system that gave you an equal amout of XP no matter what you did... Explored a new planet? XPFighting Creatures? XPCrafting? XPBuilding Bases? XPMining (For whatever reason)? XPThe same generic XP allows you to level whatever you want so you can progress in any area by doing what you enjoy when you feel like it.But no.It's just another case of get X to make Xa, then use Xa to get Y, then use Y to make Ya, then use Ya to get Z, then use Z to make Za... You getting the picture?They call these ""Tiers"" I call it... A waste of my time.It's ****ing lame, it's Soooo bad. I don't understand why they thought this was a good idea. It ISN'T!I can only assume they needed some gateway to keep people from skipping to the end of their ""content"". Which basically just boils down to mining Sh** so you can make better gear to mine more Sh**.This game is a mess, a perfect example of what happens when a team has a solid idea for a theme, but a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor development plan for making engaging mechanics and enjoyable progression.I'd rate this game a D-.And I'm only holding back on the F because of the music, which is good. Just cut out the middle man and buy the soundtrack.			"

												Terraria but better? Not quite.I went out on a limb buying this as I got slightly hooked to Terraria after not playing it for years and looked for something similar, now whilst the games are quite similar I just can't get into Starbound.It felt like the story started out quite positive then kind of lost it's way when you get to your first planet ""Find *Item name I can't remember* usually deep underground""3 hours later and about 300 deaths I still haven't found anything but bland caves and annoying combat.Starbound I feel has it's place for a lot of people but I just feel that Terraria does it a bit better, I felt the Starbound caves to be bland and the combat to be a bit lackluster and frustrating. Unfortunately not for me, don't buy it thinking you'll love it just because you like Terraria, do a bit of research.Sadly I do not recommend, I really tried to get into it but just can't at this time.

												Now I am giving my personal and honest review about Starbound, and that being said I have reasons I have to dislike the game. Now just want to say I love the game all around for it's unique gameplay and ChuckleFish always bringing out great long lasting games. It has lots of content, cool building mechanics, lots of adenture and things to see, and overall a good narritive storyline. Controls, Sounds, Effects and Workshop content is incredible. And just honestly love the game.Now the reasons why the game frustrates me and makes me have to dislike it. And that is the Cooperative hosting and connections to play with friends. Invalids/Errors and Dedicated Issues that create lags and unable to connect with others. I bought this game specifically to play with friends, but this game in all of my attempts have failed for me to play along with others. And I don't care, ""You have to punch in their IP's"" use programs such as Hamachi or Evolve Client, or ""Open Ports"" for your dedicated server. I know this, tried it and has not worked well, also to add to that I should not have to struggle to do all of that to play with my friends in this simple little game. And for the life of me I been having the hardest times trying to play with my friends when I do try these things, and I get the endless loading icon, or clientserver errors or worse if we do get together the game lags feverishly. And me and my friends should not have to go through all of these hoops to just play together for a couple hours, and not have rely or configure to go through all of these 3rd programs or inputs just to play with everyone to have that Co-op experience. The Workshop content also interferes when wanting to play together, so than we have to subscribe to the worshops contents, or when they become glitched or outdated that to can cause problems to host and join eachother's games. And everytime I host or join it is always some kind of issue with this game. This is definitely a major issue in my opinion that needs to be done for this game. And I even posted several times on the Forums how this stuff is too complicating or can't join servers and got no professional responses at all. So until this is fixed the game is a lonely solo adventure. Cause so far the Cooperative experiences I wanted when I bought this game originally has now become downright frustrating. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed so it's simple to join eachother's games just like they did with Terraria. Good game! Bad Server hosting.			"

												This is one of my most favorite games of all time that I feel it has so much more than Terarria (Sorry, had to be said.)Even though I took a break off of it I do enjoy the idea of jumping into a random world, fully kitted out and fully upgraded, just to build some mega city for all forms of live to live in peace, then go off looting other planets of it's treasures and resources. Hell I feel like a crazed American/Eagle hybrid for draining a single planet of it's oil content and leaving it a dry crusty rock in space.There is a lot to explore including portals, communities, hostile fortresses and even your friend's ship for a random space party. The variety of weapons and items are pretty unique and could very well expand more. The best day of my life when I can buy a space chocolate bar from the intergalactic space station.I do get annoyed with hostiles slaughtering me over and over and knowing I am not equipped well enough, but that is still part of a challenge and it could be a great victory, even if the hostile bandits or robot knights have little loot.So yeah, I love this game and I do hope there will be so much more to offer in the future. Play it with friends, play it for challenge, play it when you're bored, buy it for a friend even if you'd like. The most fun you'll ever have when you're flying around in some crazy space ship in a shape of a train whilst being an entity of living spark life dressed like a drifter of the old space west.Oh yeah, I hope there will be hover bikes and crazy highways someday. Heh.			"

												About 2 and a half years ago, I was a few months into my freshman year of college. I'd lost my 3 closest friends from high school (the only friends I've ever really had), was tanking my classes, and was going through a period of alcoholism and depression. I spent my nights alone. Even my roommate told me I was too depressing to be around, and would avoid any attempts I tried to make at becoming friends. Then I discovered Starbound. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ did this game blow me away. The sheer amount of exploration, the utterly free and non-restrictive nature of the construction system... It was like I was immersed in my own universe. I finally had a place to do anything I wanted. I made myself a vast system of cities, complete with merchants and civilians. I'd go into this more, but it's impossible to describe with words how much fun I was having. The best part? I actually stopped drinking, because the game was more fun when I was sober. Hell, my grades even started improving as a result. After the first major update when outposts were added and systems were wiped, I was really bummed. But it wasn't a huge problem- the update added plenty of stuff to do, and polished combat and construction, so I didn't really mind all that much. It was just another start for another adventure. This time I made a system of planets with societies- on one of the lava covered planets, I successfully constructed a HUGE housing system under the lava. And on one of the ocean planets, I made what I thought was a pretty good recreation of the first level of Bioshock 1. That was about 6 months ago.This update took what was probably my favorite game of all time and crushed it. The interface is horrible. The systems were wiped AGAIN, and this time it feels like it was for no reason. Nothing new or groundbreaking was added. It's all just gone. I guess the game would be fun for me if I just picked it up today. But knowing what it once was, and knowing I'll never experience any of that joy or wonder while I play this ever again, it's pretty terrible.			"

												The game I was looking for since day one.I found Starbound on an article about Terraria's devs. A new game with the same spirit, I was hooked, even better, a sci-fi game! Since it's announcement I followed the news, the blogs, the forums, they had me, and they did not disappoint.The game is fun, the art is charming and beautiful, it's got a decent story, the combat is diverse, the boss fights are challenging and rewarding, lots of loot and exploration and the progression is balanced and well paced.From start to finish you find yourself blasting through planets, mining for resources, getting quests, upgrading your gear and ship ( which is a big aspect of the game) and progressing through the story. All of that is great the new random planet system is a fun twist on the survival genre, much like a 2D No Man's Sky but this time good, you'll encounter different planet types, ores, and fun, whacky and fearsome alien life forms, all of these complement the sense of discovery and uniqueness. And that is where Starbound shines. The combat and exploration. But when it comes to building things get a little complicated. The ship system I mentioned earlier is great, your sort of mobile base where you take all your gear and crew with you, it can be upgraded and buildt into, fully customizable and it is great. But since you are constantly moving and traveling the galaxy you don't have much of a ""home planet"". Sure the game gives you the ability to bookmark planets and to plot down teleporters to get fast access, maybe it's just me, I'm not a great builder but I just can't settle down, planets are not personal, on Terraria (Which is a very different game but has sort of the same purpose) you only have that one planet, the one you are spawned in although in Starbound you've got the ship that comes with you wherever you go, building doesn't seem practical or fitting. But it is great to have it and builders will be pleased and come up with awesome builds.On a final note Starbound is the best in the market of 2D survival sci-fi games, fun, creative and refreshing for what it is a very very good 9/10, get it now! You won't regret it, even more when the game starts to get free updates, it is a fresh release and much like a good wine or Terraria, the older the better.			"

								I can safely say after following the game for more than a year I can see the game heading in the right direction. Alot has changed from my last review on Starbound (where I could not recommend it) and I can safely say the  grinding for pixels and mobs  have come to an end. Starbound provides enough content now to keep you entertained, and even longer if you have an imagination; such as roleplaying across different characters on multiple planets with the new NPCs introduced in the colony update. I even love the fact that the starting galaxy is shared across all characters like a central hub. The new planet biomes are fantastic and now have structures randomly generated for different NPCs to inhabit based on furniture, weapons now vary vastly cosmeticly/statisticly and can be carried across different tiers with the armor new stats. No longer will you find an item you like from teir 1 or 2 and have to abandon it by teir 4 or 5. I can only hope more developers listen and respond to the feedback they recieve like Chucklefish has.I look foward to future updates chucklefish has in store.			"

Game has kept me entertained, and even moreso entertained while in multiplayer the crazy gismos people find, create. This game should not be compared to Terraria because the two CANNOT BE COMPARIED. This game is tons of fun, storyline, easier ways to build things, a recipe book, tons of things Terraria didnt have. I tried to convince some friends to play this game also, but they wont because they are assuming its like Terraria. Dont be like that, its a lot of fun. So for perspective, I couldnt play terraria no more than 10 hours in over a few months, I played this game more than 20 hours in a week. . . Enjoy			"

												What was one of my most anticipated games of all time many years ago. When the early access beta released back in 2013, I finally got a chance to play the hell out of this game. Obviously, the game didn't have a lot to stand on in that state, but was still reasonably polished and had a functional progression system, with long hours to be spent getting to high tiers.Somehow much of the game's content that was present back then was simply cut from the game. Even closer to the game's release, there was far more content. Weapons are a joke now, very little randomisation from the procedural generation, no procedurally generated armors, racial armor bonuses were oddly never implemented (in fact much of the racial exclusive stuff was simply removed. why?), biome generation is, incredibly, rather stale and similar, all the cool movement techs and mechs were removed, and to hit the final nail on the coffin, the main story was awfully implemented.Let me tell you, the 150+ hours that I have on this game are very misleading. Around 140 of those hours were spent in the early access versions of the game. I spent probably around 20 hours with version 1.0, and within 10 of those hours I had the best armor and weapons for my specialization (melee/tank), and almost 5 hours later, I had the best sword in the game, as well as two pistols that were boss drops that are highly overpowered when coupled with a staff that can place an energy field (otherwise every gun in this game is pitiful because of the energy consumption). The rest of my time I spent just standing around on planets because this game has the redeeming quality of being absolutely gorgeous.tl;dr I can't recommend it, because so much of the old content has been stripped, and it feels hallow and bare. Only mods and future content patches will save this game really. If you never touched the beta, you might enjoy it.			"

								I bought this game 2 years ago after playing terraria, it was in early acces then.  Fast forward it's still early access.  It's games like Starbound that make the public think early access games are a scam to get your money for an unfinished product and gives the developer no incentive to finish(already paid).   Everytime the developer is asked about a completed game they bring up a giant list of things needed to be implemented, and it is just lip service at this point.  Like ""we're trying for a new mission and biome we are going for 6 missions.""  2 years ago the game had 6 missions   Stop hiding behind early access and put out a finished product.  -post big winter update section- Just played the BIG WINTER UPDATE  was fun missions were cool,  was still extremely short.

												Let me start off by saying that this is the second time I've played this game, the first time was in EA (early access). TL;DR version. Don't buy this game. It starts off alright, and for the first 20 or so hours it's good, but then dies down.Now for the meat of the review. Starbound was a game that went through hell, mainly due to the developers leaving the game dead in the water for over a year, trying to fund personal games before getting back into this one, and ""fixing"" it. Not that the game is in 1.0, and no longer an Early Access game, it seems to have gotten worse. During the times of EA, the game was fun (albeit boring at times with no direction.) The combat was easier, all you had to do was hold down the fire/attack button (MB1) and evade. Now you can no longer do that, you have to let go and start the process again if you want to deal damage. While this might shake things up, you'll find yourself getting hurt a lot due to it, and it becomes boring after the first few minutes.  The game use to have interesting ideas and concepts, but now those have been thrown away. For instance, there use to be a protective bubble you could use to remove fall damage, that has been removed because the devs deemed it ""over powered."" Now we're left with a sphere mode that does nothing for the game besides traversing dungeons. Dungeons are another big problem. Game like Terraria allowed you to create your own boss area to fight them in and be prepared, this game forces you to one area each time you need to face a boss to progress the ""story."" The story is lack luster, uninspired and has no meat to it to even care about. But that's just it, neither does the game itself. After 20 hours or grinding, going to planets for ores and weapons, you tend to just give up and no longer care. First you seem to be excited, just itching to explore and find new things, but there isn't much to the game to be able to do so, so the limited amount of items and exploration die before you face your third boss.The only upgrades worth anything are the manipulator upgrades to help you mine, that's about it. Tech cards no longer feel like abilities to help you out, now just a chore. Speaking of upgrades, the game has no way of letting you know what to upgrade or how to create items. It you want to upgrade your anvil, then you better look online, because the game has no guide like Terraria, so it doesn't inform you on what you'll need, or how to get certain items like batteries or copper wiring. You'll have to do it all on your own. Don't bother with colonies or side quests, NONE of them are interesting. There's 3 types in the game. Go kill these people somewhere, get me this and that, or escort. That's it, all of them are like this, on every planet. The same with colonies. Same quests, nothing new. Weapons are no longer fun, and you'll stick to one or two and sell the rest, none are worth keeping, unlike with Terraria where you'll want to keep rare loot. What the game does right is in the first 20 or so hours, the sense of wonderment and exploration is great, but becomes tedious and over whelming. It also has great visuals and a killer soundtrack, but that's it, it becomes boring hearing the same background music on every planet. I remember the game being more difficult, yet easy to understand. It also felt like everything you collected had worth, not anymore. Let's not forget that the wiki is no help, since you'll never gain useful information on it. That's more of a con with the players though. And here's the kill point, the part where you decide to buy the game or not. Every time an update came out in EA, you had to restart every quest you've ever done, it would wipe out your progress. Now? From what I can tell, you start EVERYTHING all over, including making your character. When 1.0 came out, it wiped all characters, so if you spent 100+ hours perfecting a world and all, you're SOL.Again, the beginning of the game is fun, and really builds up you getting off the planet to explore the universe, until you do and release it's the same thing on every planet. The bosses are boring, the dungeons to them are exactly the same, the loot is ""meh"" at most, nothing really cool. The NPCs are annoying, the side quests are all the same, the main quest lacks any emotion, and the fact that in the next update they might wipe your character out (since they have for all the other updates) means that your progress isn't even safe.While I enjoy this game, I can't recommend buying it knowing your saved character might be gone the next day, or all the progress will be reset. My advice? Buy Terraria, or look into some new games.			"

								Starbound is an incredibly unique experience. Even in its unfinished state, this game is extraordinary. All of the weapons are unique; there are thousands and thousands of procedurally generated pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, swords, spears, hammers, and other various weapons. Each planet is unique, from its visual appearance right down to its gravity amount and day length. I can't wait to see what's to come from this game in the future. This very well looks like a completed game at the current time. "

								I will start off saying that yes, this game still has problems, even with the Pleased Giraffe update which was last night. One of the the major things that bug me is not haveing a quick stack option in chests or the quick stack to all chests option like Terraria has. Speaking of which, a lot of people like to compare this game to Terraria, which is a good comparisson but it does have it's differences.Though it seems there is some really negative reviews below mine, I personally thing the game is great. No game is ever going to be perfect for everyone. It seems like a lot of people that like sandbox games don't like to wait and complete objectives in order to continue the game.I really like having the quests that NPCs give. The Boss stages are a nice touch because I'm not a fan of a boss coming from nowhere and destroying my home. Being able to start my own village is pretty cool and there is a lot of options for decoration. Different weapons to suit your fancy for different combat playstyles. Different armors to suit those types of playstyles. It's pretty fun being able to fix up your ship and fly to other planets to loot and spelunk. I'd say the game is deffinitly worth a try! "

Its the perfect mix of space simulation, sandbox, and platforming you could ask for, the only minor complaints I have with the game so far are the minor bugs here and there aswell as the length of the game, which will all change once the game is actually released and I CANNOT wait for it to release.

												When the final release has less content than the last year and a half's worth of updates, you know something went wrong.When a good portion of the mods on the workshop revert features of the game back to older iterations, you know something went terribly, horribly wrong.I honestly kind of feel bad for the devs. They worked their asses off for 5 years trying to make this game a reality, and when they finally try and release it, even their most deticated followers and fans are (to put it extremely lightly) unsatisfied with the result. Not to mention when my friend got a copy of the game after release he was furious to find that he, like so many others, couldn't even launch it.This is quite honestly one of the most massive flops of any product release I've ever seen, and it makes me incredibly depressed to say that.

												The main problem is the absolute lack of polish. There's so many issues that I couldn't possibly remember them all, but the basic gist is that the game is annoying to play. You can't pause the game. Whenever you switch weapons there's multiple seconds of delay. Your inventory is forced into five different tabs you can't look at the same time. Trying to find the right item when you want it is always a small chore. The multiplayer is completely unoptimized. Balance is bad, especially early on. Achievements, a driving force for a lot of players, are completely hidden in the Steam interface and don't include descriptions. Several of those achievements are needlessly grindy for no reason. Wildlife on planets are a nuisance and discourage exploration. There's NO way to mitigate falling damage. Food doesn't stock. Food rots over time. When it rots you have to move it one piece at a time to a different tab to get it to stack. Food rotting, hunger, and lack of teleporting when there's a roof over your head REALLY discourages exploration. For some reason the final tier of the anvil is made by adding one of three addons which give you different items to create. You can't have all the addons in at the same time to see what's available at once so you have to tediously replace them each time. You can't do much with the grapple hook because everything useful like mining or using the matter manipulator uses two hands, so you better get used to CONSTANTLY be making platforms.The main storyline is a lather/rinse/repeat every tier. Grind out new ores -> Build new armor/weapons and upgrade breathing device -> Do the ""Scanning"" quest for whatever Species the Tier is centered on -> Do the Dungeon for whatever Species the tier is centered on. -> Repeat for every tier.There are some neat things here. Building and colony management isn't bad. But there's just too much in here that seems designed to be unfun and annoying for me to recommend this to anyone.If you ignore this warning and decide to play anyway, I recommend playing on ""Casual"" mode. It removes a lot of annoyances like the Hunger mechanic (which continues to deplete during unskippable cutscenes. Players die during those), reduces currency loss on death, and allows you to beam back to your ship from anywhere.If you like crafting survivals and haven't played Terraria before, just go play that with a friend instead.

								Everyone compares this game to Terraria and with good reason, they look and play pretty similar. Everyone also says that if you like Terraria, you'll like this, and you probably will. I actually don't like Terraria, I find it obtuse and that's why I do like Starbound. Starbound provides a minor level of tutorial that is completely lacking in Terraria that will help you understand the basics and even more or less walk you through the first 2 or 3 bosses. Then again, maybe I like Starbound more than Terraria because I am getting in earlier. Terriaria (I am guessing) has so much stuff in it that if you haven't been playing awhile, you may not have any idea what to do. Starbound will grow with content, but since I will have been playing it from so early, learning will only need be incremental.			"

								As an avid purchaser of Early-Access titles, I will admit that the system failed here. Too much hype too soon, and not enough product when released on Steam. Gaming is my main hobby, and so I try to play as many games as possible. I bought StarBound (several copies actually) and had to deal with character wipes for several months following. HERE IS THE THING: the situation may be different now, but there was a window of oppportunity where my attention (and money) was present - that time is gone now. Now I am off to other titles. To quantify actual in-game stuff I didn't like: it was too similiar to Terraria (at least when I played it), the code was horribly optimized, and the art was 'meh'.			"

												Starbound is a mediocre game, it promotes itself as a deep exploration game with lots of content, however much of it is superficial. First of all I would like to say I’ve been following development since before its early access phase and I am less than impressed by the result.Let’s start with gameplay. There are three difficulties, casual (which I use) where death causes loss of 10% of pixels (currency), moderate (or whatever it’s called) where I think you lose a little more of your money and drop some items at the place of your death. There is also a hunger system which may or may not be annoying, I’m not going to try it anytime soon. Finally there is hardcore mode, where after you die, you lose your character. One thing I would criticize is tying survival aspects to difficulty. It could be nice to be able to use survival elements on easiest difficulty or permadeath without hunger.You have basic genre elements like digging, farming and crafting, and right now they are fine. You can upgrade your main mining tool, building new things is easy, for crafting you have a few basic crafting stations which you can upgrade, which also lets you access more advanced crafting stations. You have a spaceship which you can use to travel between planets. There are some differences between them. For example the usual arctic and volcanic planets where you need to use protection pack to survive the climate. Moons where you get most of your starship fuel if you like running from immortal ghosts protecting it (if you don’t, you may just buy it from one of the shops at the hub world where you will get fairly soon). But to use most of your ship you will have to go through two or three story quests to repair your ship. My two biggest gripes with this is that planets aren’t really interesting. Sometimes you can find a village there, some structure filled with things that want to kill you and that’s it. Usually you will not find anything special, besides furniture that you will be later able to replicate. I think the most interesting thing going for planets at the moment are different weather types that you can find there, because protection packs are straight upgrade from one another and protect you from everything at the end. So there is not much differences between exploring a moon without breathable air (besides obviously low gravity, which I believe should vary more between other planets) and frozen wasteland.One of the more interesting things are races. Or would be if there was any difference between them. Because right now they’re mostly reskins without much to offer besides different ships.Weapons you get are mostly boring, however one handed ones are much more boring than two handed (because the latter get a special attack). There are three kinds of weapons: melee, ranged and magic (or techno-magic or something). Most of them use your energy, magical staves to do their magic things, ranged weapons to fire and melee weapons to use their special attacks. Also some of the techs (or special skills you acquire through quests) use it. Also there aren’t any clearly better or worse weapons since all of those things scale with your armor. So even a great weapon is weak with one of the first sets. I also wish they went with normal ammo for ranged weapons. Because right now they’re like two-handed melee weapons, only they shoot things (technically some melee weapon specials also shoot things), I believe ammo system could be used to add some depth to it. Also magic weapons are similar, but they shoot slightly stranger things. Crafting weapons and armor isn’t too great either, at the beginning you get a linear progression and then a choice between three upgrade paths. One for melee, one for ranged and one for magic. However since all armors give bonus to health, energy and damage there isn’t much difference (although I secretly hope I missed something here), also as far as I remember when you get those path-upgrade choices for crafting weapons and armor you get basically 2 armor sets and about 2 weapons per path, not much variety, also I believe you don’t get to craft guns unless you’re playing as a novakid race.. Sometimes you can find “unique” weapons, which are basically rare and strange in what they do. However I’m not really sure about what makes some of them unique. For example there is a flamethrower that’s considered a unique weapon.There is also a possibility of making colonies of planets, which allows collection of rent that consists mostly of pixels (currency), plant seeds, healing items, some weapons (usually not good for anything but selling) and possibly some rare cosmetic items. Using specific furniture when building homes for your colonists may yield you some specific ones, like merchants and guards. They also give some quests (about which I will write about later) that may make them available to add to your crew, which sometimes gives you some bonuses (depending on what their class is). But that’s it. You build home, place colony deed in there and *BAM*… colonist. They don’t do anything special, just walk around interact with other colonists. You can’t really do anything with them, and there isn’t much control about what they will give you. It would be nice to assign them some tasks after summoning them. Like miners, woodcutters, farmers, explorers and so on, which would at least have some impact on what their rent will be.Preformance after launch isn’t the best, many people found out that the game was prone to stuttering and slowdowns even on better machines. But since I basically use a potato to play I’m not going into this argument. However as someone found some elements of the game code could cause slowdowns (like quest tracking, which is supposedly fixed as of time I’m writing this review).Visuals are as you can see a pixel art style, however some designs I find ridiculous for example higher tier glitch armors look stupid. But on the other hand it’s not bad.Finally let’s talk about story. I’m not saying that plans to make a specific story to fit each of the player races was a better idea, but I’m not saying it wasn’t. However considering writing of current story it wouldn’t get any better.You basically get a typical save the universe story. Which makes absolutely no sense. The formula for questline is basically this:1.	You look for a clues to get to a premade location.2.	You go to a premade quest location and do what you need to do.These quest-instances are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are fun, sometimes you wonder why someone thought it was a good idea. In each of these instances you also meet a boss, some of them are fun to fight against and the other are easy or boring. Some also spawn minions which I personally don’t like and view as artificially increasing difficulty of a fight. However when you have a good weapon and a ton of healing items you can pass through these fights easily.	In the end I guess the best thing about this game is the integration of steam workshop and modding which allows some creative people to fix things in game and add variety. However I’m not going to rate a game because some people are willing to upgrade it for free, I am rating a product I paid for.Edit: Also developers are blocking mods on the workshop they don't like.Edit2: Fishing doesn't help. It's still trash.			"

												When this game first came out on early access it was one of my favorite indie titles of all time.  The sense of exploration was greater than any game I had played at the time, the unique randomly generated worlds were interesting and randomized items and creatures were all quite well done.  There were good systems in place like a temperature gauge that factored in to things like being on a cold planet.  I would carry around my camp fire materials and sleeping bag and have to warm up when it got too cold.In typical early access fashion though, they worked hard to design an awesome base for a game, then dilly dallied for years pushing out tiny updates here and there that gradually just kept making the game worse and worse, until by the time ""1.0"" came out, they removed everything interesting from the game and just made basically a linear game with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story mode.  No more are there things such as temperature gauages.  Bosses come from quests instead of having ot explore the different types of worlds to gather materials and summon them.  You can just buy everything with pixels instead of exploring the crafting tree.  Randomized weapon effects are gone.   The game is just so boring and lackluster now.  Why are so many indie game devs destroying their games these days?  I honestly wish Early Access was never allowed to even be a thing.  I often wonder if the devs had to develop the entire game with the hunger they had before their first early access release, how awesome that game would have been?  I have yet to see any game really actually improve after going onto Early Access, and Starbound is unfortunately an example of yet another promising EA title that just stagnated.  I guess some people are impressed by 1.0, I'm not sure why honestly.  It's just plain frustrating to me the way EA is treated.			"

Hundreds hours played in its many early version, the final game is now here and it was worth the wait.The content is endless, and what ever way you go and whatever you do your hours will fly by. What can I say more...Its finally here. Play it !			"

												The game has always been great, even with some bugs in beta, but now that its been fully release its one of the best and most polished titles on Steam AND the devs are awesome.All the creativity of other voxel games, but with a TON more atmosphere, depth and character. That theres also quests and direction only enhances it. The only downside is that it can leave you wondering what you should do next to improve your charecter, but thats also a good thing. The game isnt so formulaic as to hold your hand through every step and can be QUITE challenging.All in all,  Starbound is a must buy title in my opinion!			"

												Starbound is a mediocre game, it promotes itself as a deep exploration game with lots of content, however much of it is superficial. First of all I would like to say I’ve been following development since before its early access phase and I am less than impressed by the result.Let’s start with gameplay. There are three difficulties, casual (which I use) where death causes loss of 10% of pixels (currency), moderate (or whatever it’s called) where I think you lose a little more of your money and drop some items at the place of your death. There is also a hunger system which may or may not be annoying, I’m not going to try it anytime soon. Finally there is hardcore mode, where after you die, you lose your character. One thing I would criticize is tying survival aspects to difficulty. It could be nice to be able to use survival elements on easiest difficulty or permadeath without hunger.You have basic genre elements like digging, farming and crafting, and right now they are fine. You can upgrade your main mining tool, building new things is easy, for crafting you have a few basic crafting stations which you can upgrade, which also lets you access more advanced crafting stations. You have a spaceship which you can use to travel between planets. There are some differences between them. For example the usual arctic and volcanic planets where you need to use protection pack to survive the climate. Moons where you get most of your starship fuel if you like running from immortal ghosts protecting it (if you don’t, you may just buy it from one of the shops at the hub world where you will get fairly soon). But to use most of your ship you will have to go through two or three story quests to repair your ship. My two biggest gripes with this is that planets aren’t really interesting. Sometimes you can find a village there, some structure filled with things that want to kill you and that’s it. Usually you will not find anything special, besides furniture that you will be later able to replicate. I think the most interesting thing going for planets at the moment are different weather types that you can find there, because protection packs are straight upgrade from one another and protect you from everything at the end. So there is not much differences between exploring a moon without breathable air (besides obviously low gravity, which I believe should vary more between other planets) and frozen wasteland.One of the more interesting things are races. Or would be if there was any difference between them. Because right now they’re mostly reskins without much to offer besides different ships.Weapons you get are mostly boring, however one handed ones are much more boring than two handed (because the latter get a special attack). There are three kinds of weapons: melee, ranged and magic (or techno-magic or something). Most of them use your energy, magical staves to do their magic things, ranged weapons to fire and melee weapons to use their special attacks. Also some of the techs (or special skills you acquire through quests) use it. Also there aren’t any clearly better or worse weapons since all of those things scale with your armor. So even a great weapon is weak with one of the first sets. I also wish they went with normal ammo for ranged weapons. Because right now they’re like two-handed melee weapons, only they shoot things (technically some melee weapon specials also shoot things), I believe ammo system could be used to add some depth to it. Also magic weapons are similar, but they shoot slightly stranger things. Crafting weapons and armor isn’t too great either, at the beginning you get a linear progression and then a choice between three upgrade paths. One for melee, one for ranged and one for magic. However since all armors give bonus to health, energy and damage there isn’t much difference (although I secretly hope I missed something here), also as far as I remember when you get those path-upgrade choices for crafting weapons and armor you get basically 2 armor sets and about 2 weapons per path, not much variety, also I believe you don’t get to craft guns unless you’re playing as a novakid race.. Sometimes you can find “unique” weapons, which are basically rare and strange in what they do. However I’m not really sure about what makes some of them unique. For example there is a flamethrower that’s considered a unique weapon.There is also a possibility of making colonies of planets, which allows collection of rent that consists mostly of pixels (currency), plant seeds, healing items, some weapons (usually not good for anything but selling) and possibly some rare cosmetic items. Using specific furniture when building homes for your colonists may yield you some specific ones, like merchants and guards. They also give some quests (about which I will write about later) that may make them available to add to your crew, which sometimes gives you some bonuses (depending on what their class is). But that’s it. You build home, place colony deed in there and *BAM*… colonist. They don’t do anything special, just walk around interact with other colonists. You can’t really do anything with them, and there isn’t much control about what they will give you. It would be nice to assign them some tasks after summoning them. Like miners, woodcutters, farmers, explorers and so on, which would at least have some impact on what their rent will be.Preformance after launch isn’t the best, many people found out that the game was prone to stuttering and slowdowns even on better machines. But since I basically use a potato to play I’m not going into this argument. However as someone found some elements of the game code could cause slowdowns (like quest tracking, which is supposedly fixed as of time I’m writing this review).Visuals are as you can see a pixel art style, however some designs I find ridiculous for example higher tier glitch armors look stupid. But on the other hand it’s not bad.Finally let’s talk about story. I’m not saying that plans to make a specific story to fit each of the player races was a better idea, but I’m not saying it wasn’t. However considering writing of current story it wouldn’t get any better.You basically get a typical save the universe story. Which makes absolutely no sense. The formula for questline is basically this:1.	You look for a clues to get to a premade location.2.	You go to a premade quest location and do what you need to do.These quest-instances are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are fun, sometimes you wonder why someone thought it was a good idea. In each of these instances you also meet a boss, some of them are fun to fight against and the other are easy or boring. Some also spawn minions which I personally don’t like and view as artificially increasing difficulty of a fight. However when you have a good weapon and a ton of healing items you can pass through these fights easily.	In the end I guess the best thing about this game is the integration of steam workshop and modding which allows some creative people to fix things in game and add variety. However I’m not going to rate a game because some people are willing to upgrade it for free, I am rating a product I paid for.Edit: Also developers are blocking mods on the workshop they don't like.Edit2: Fishing doesn't help. It's still trash.			"

												When this game first came out on early access it was one of my favorite indie titles of all time.  The sense of exploration was greater than any game I had played at the time, the unique randomly generated worlds were interesting and randomized items and creatures were all quite well done.  There were good systems in place like a temperature gauge that factored in to things like being on a cold planet.  I would carry around my camp fire materials and sleeping bag and have to warm up when it got too cold.In typical early access fashion though, they worked hard to design an awesome base for a game, then dilly dallied for years pushing out tiny updates here and there that gradually just kept making the game worse and worse, until by the time ""1.0"" came out, they removed everything interesting from the game and just made basically a linear game with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story mode.  No more are there things such as temperature gauages.  Bosses come from quests instead of having ot explore the different types of worlds to gather materials and summon them.  You can just buy everything with pixels instead of exploring the crafting tree.  Randomized weapon effects are gone.   The game is just so boring and lackluster now.  Why are so many indie game devs destroying their games these days?  I honestly wish Early Access was never allowed to even be a thing.  I often wonder if the devs had to develop the entire game with the hunger they had before their first early access release, how awesome that game would have been?  I have yet to see any game really actually improve after going onto Early Access, and Starbound is unfortunately an example of yet another promising EA title that just stagnated.  I guess some people are impressed by 1.0, I'm not sure why honestly.  It's just plain frustrating to me the way EA is treated.			"

												If you wish the decorating and building in Terraria was better and that was what you wanted to spend your time doing then Starbound is great. If you came to this game for anything else (combat, exploration, crafting, etc.) then it isn't worth your time. The combat is frustrating, the exploration isn't rewarding, the controls are uncomfortably bad, and the crafting is not satisfying at all. The creation aspect in terms of building is really good though. Overall I can't recommend it. The decorating and building is secondary to me in these types of games, and the core mechanics just don't carry Starbound enough to make it worth playing.			"

								This game is purely amazing. While only being still early access, the game in a way, already feels ""complete"". The combat system is nice. The weapons and armour are very nice. There is so much to do. The music in game is absolutely beautiful, and the music for combat situations is very fitting. Multiplayer is extremely fun as well. Playing with your lads to clear dungeons or build something cool, or perhaps trade, is very fun. Now with EVERY game that has multiplayer, there are pros and cons. The only real con in starbounds multiplayer, is the fact that people install mods, which allow them an unfair advantage. One minutw you are sitting there, with your PvP set off, and all of a sudden a yellow gas hits you and kills you instantly, even with the best armour (I know from experience). Overall, the game is great and the community and players for the most part, are really swell. My final rating for the game is a 9.7/10. This is subject to change though, as the game is only in beta, and many major alterations are going to be made, whcih could make the game better or worse. All in all I recommend this game to anyone. I forgot to mention it's better than Terraria!			"

												It's very similar to Terraria, but better in almost everything:- Lore and main storyline, with characters giving you quests and sidequests in outposts, villages, etc.- Procedurally generated planets with different biomes which means different environments, enemies, ores... pretty much everything.- Better implemented RPG elements. You can cook diverse food recipes and you need to eat to stay alive in 2 out of 3 of the difficulty levels. - You can dual weild weapons, and use combinations like a 1-handed sword with a gun. Pretty dope.- Incredible soundtrack.- Addictive as it gets.However, it also has some stuff that needs to be polished like the UI. Fortunately though, the game supports mods right from the get go, and since the game's been out in the form of early access for a long while, we have a lot of mods to fix this for now and further enhance the amazing gameplay.

												Ugh, what a mess.A mess is a pretty good way to describe this game.To start, I'm mixed about this game. While I'm infuriated by the amount of padding and poor design choices in this game, something kept me playing the game the whole way through.To be fair, I'll start with the things I enjoyed with Starbound. The game aesthetically is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good looking. It's the kind of visuals that other garbage Indie titles with pixel graphics should try to do. This game's also decently fun when it tries to be. Specifically the third and fourth quest areas are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing fun. Some of the randomly generated buildings are pretty cool as well, at least until you see the same building for the fourth or fifth time. It's pretty fun to build things in this game and it's pretty simple to get furniture that you like when exploring settlements. Oh but is there so much wrong with this game. Firstly, this game should be called Space Grandma Scavenger Hunt. The whole game consists of some ♥♥♥♥ing Space Grandma sending you to go take a bunch of pictures of things so she can progress the plot. This is the least bad thing though since it's only really annoying if you get bad RNG and can't find whatever race she tells you to.This game also took the stupid idea to have that awful Borderlands weapon system in which every weapon is boring and has no uniqueness at all except the ultra rare ones. Thanks for that Borderlands.This game also has the same garbage that Stardew Valley had with the mining, in that it doesn't need to ♥♥♥♥ing be there. I'm sure there are people who enjoy mining and stuff, but this is a space exploration game. I mainly have a problem with it because I never actually had to do it. There are enough materials in boxes in the fun sections that you don't ever need to. I don't get why they didn't just cut out the horrid random underground and made more unique buildings and dungeons that actually have some level of creativity. And it pisses me off the most because I know that this had to be a feature that was put in because similar games had mining and not because they wanted to do something new with it.Oddly enough, this game came from the same publisher as Stardew, so maybe it's their fault.Speaking of which, they just imported the entirety of Stardew farming into this ♥♥♥♥ing game. And again it was just put in for no reason and has absolutely no depth whatsoever. It's just there because ""Oh people liked fermin' in Stardew let's slap that♥♥♥♥♥♥in here.""This game also has boring space travel for a space game. It's obviously paying some level of ""homage"" to FTL but doesn't put in any space combat or space exploration, just clicking on a planet an taking a one minute loading screen to get to it.I think the thing I hate the most is that it has those awful blocky worlds and buildings and no other geometric shapes. There are tons of cool platforming puzzles they could have done if the world had more shapes, especially with the morphball and jump types. It's a problem caused by the fact that they wanted to have these super ""diverse"" random terrain generation that just makes all terrains to look the same in a biome. Overall, I still had fun playing this for sure. The modding for it makes it fun in that way the Skyrim is in which the game is garbage but there's always mods to have fun with. But overall this game is not complete, and I don't see it getting completed by the devs anytime soon. Definitely don't get it until you've looked into it and decided you'd enjoy the game.			"

												On top of the fact that it's so bug ridden I can't even get off the menu nowadays, this game had quite a confusing starting game, and as many have said; features have been cut without reason.The developers should be working on fixing game breaking bugs instead of.. whatever they're doing.

								First Step: Kickstarter for Money.Second Step: Hype the Community and promise Features if tons of Money is pledged.Third Step: Give Early Access for more Money.Fourth Step: Do nothing to improve the Game for Months and dont care for leaving the Alpha/Beta-Stadium. Implement the work of others (Mods) and gain more Money.I bet the next Step will be for the Players!			"

								I hate Terraria. Lemme preface this review by saying that. I was extremely pessimistic for Starbound when it was first announced as it contained nothing that really drew me in.But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it there is not a single game out there that makes me stay up every single night until 2 AM playing it.While a lot of mechanics are extremely similar to how Terraria works, the presentation is really what sets this game a league above.Whereas Terraria's retro art style contains larger pixels that allow for easier and simpler shapes to be made, Starbound opts for a smaller pixel style which gives increased detail to everything the game has to offer. This is especially apparent when you find out just how much customization this game has to offer.For starters, having 6 races (plus an upcoming 7th) allows for more diversity amongst the playerbase. Each race is also planned to have different ""racial armor abilities"", which will increase the diversity as players either flock to the aesthetics or the abilities.The housing and building in this game is magnificent as well. There are so many different varities of furniture and devices and doodads and neat looking shiny things, all from different time periods to suit the races (Glitch as Medieval, Apes as Futuristic). You aren't restricted to your own time period either. You can praise Big Ape as a Floran if you wish, thanks to customizable ships.This game does combat extraordinarily well. Adding an extreme weapon randomization system (think simplified Borderlands weapons) allows for each gun to be drastically different in not only stats, but as well as art style. Where the animations for combat were very basic in Terraria, Starbound's combat is much more tense with dodging and double jumping and the like. It's definitely a lot more of a fast-paced combat game than Terraria was.But even after all I've said above, every player can have their own niche thing to like. You don't have to just build or mine or fight, per usual. Personally, I find the instrument system well worth the $15, which allows you to import songs for you and your friends to play together. Nothing beats playing ""Friend In Me"" on accordian with a microphone and violin backup.If there were any flaws I could state about this game, it's pretty buggy. There have been plenty of crashes, but due to the relatively fast startup time and instantaneous ship arrival, you can get back into the game very quickly after crashing. The developers have been very active to responding to almost every player question and bug fix they have been sent though, and take suggestions very heavily based on how the community feels about the matter.All in all, this was an extremely worthwhile purchase. Even though my character will be wiped soon for the update, I can't wait to play as his successor and explore more of what this wonderful wacky world has to offer.			"

Early Access Review
								I have a love/hate relationship with this game.When I first bought it way back, It was very open world, with some clear objectives to unlock progress. But then those goals could be done at your pace, on your own schedule. Back then, it was mainly exploring. A seemingly endless universe. A 2d minecraft, except that you have endless planets to explore, build on, and self roleplay with.I played hundreds of hours, when suddenly an update deleted my save file. I was DEVASTATED. Didn't try the game again for a long time.Finally I decided to try it again and start over.In the current state of the game, things are a bit more linear. But... Not enough to ruin the open world experience. The same core sandbox can be felt. But there are more bugs now to go around. For example in my current save fuel buying bugged out for me with no fix. I now have to use console commands to give myself fuel, which feels like cheating, yet with even more hours into a new save I'm not about to start over....again. The music is AMAZING. And the overall atmosphere is just perfect.I wish I could still play the older version of this game. But even still, with it's flaws, it is simply my favorite game OF ALL TIME. That's how good the atmosphere is. That's how amazing the exploration and creative pull is. I can count on one hand how many games have rivaled the immersion I get from this game.			"

												I bought Starbound when it very first hit Steam at the end of 2013. I had enjoyed Terraria greatly and got swept up on the hype bandwagon by some friends who convinced me to get it. I played about 60 hours of it back then some how.  At the time the game was resoundly in an early Alpha state, though the devs hid this by marketing it as ""Beta Phase 1"". There was quite a lot of variety in envionments, places to explore, and most of the races in place. Combat, armor, and weapons were entirely unbalanced and they hadn't even settled on combat mechanics. Music instruments were useable, NPC towns existed, and the barest beginnings of the quest system had started to be put in place. It was not a terrible experience.I was still rather bitter about being decieved by the initial Steam release (and it was one of the first Early Access games I was ever burned on so I was extra salty about it) so I hadn't planned to play 1.0 any time soon, but was once again cajoled into giving it a try.  After another 25-ish hours of game play I have only a resounding ""meh"" to give to Starbound.It's not a bad game.  The races are interesting and varied.  The envionments are still pretty.  The biomes are numerous.  Digging down you can find all manner of strange places like forgotten warehouses, tiny gnome towns, grotesque bone and flesh caverns, slimy tunnels, and more.  The problem is that all of these things existed in 2013 as well.  I instantly recognized the gnome towns as totally unchanged.  Most of the weapons seemed to behave roughly the same.  The new main story line offers some sense of direction to the universe, but is just flat out uninteresting.Starbound suffers from a lack of drive beyond the art department to which I must give credit where credit is due.  The game looks amazing.  If $15 is trivial for you it's probably worth the buy on that alone.  If you're buying Starbound looking for gameplay... you can do better. The ambition from the designer is there, but everything else is just half-hearted and phoned in.  Even if you love this game type, which I do, it's absolutely crippled by a few key things, one of which is the atrocious inventory management. This type of game encourages you to gather all of the cool things, bring them back to your planet and make a fantastic sprawling city, but I quickly reached a point where I just couldn't find anything.  At one point I got an upgrade for my EPP and set it aside because I had no idea how rare or valueable it was.  I wanted to find it later and after checking some 30-odd crates and boxes I just gave up.The 'techs' which effect your movement abilities are bland with your typical air dash, double jump, and morphball. Fall damage occurs from a height barely higher than your double jump and is crazy high for a game that's all about exploration.  The interface is mediocre at best and outright clunky in some places such as building (ex. an item in my hands which is not on my hotbar is instantly thrown back into my inventory if I close it to get a better view of what I'm building).Starbound has been polished some since I last saw it in 2013, but not nearly enough for three years of dev time.  I have to wonder if they wanted to push out 1.0 ahead of No Man's Sky to try and snag as many additional sales as they can manage before it's too late.  For a game that could be so good, the end result is so resoundingly mediocre and uninspired.  Maybe they just need another three years of dev time.			"

								CF simply has not given substantial updates to this game in an exorbitant amount of time. Every ""release"" date they conjure up they fail to meet. They delete and ban negative posts where they can. Save yourself some money and wait for them to fix it(If they ever do). It might be a really long wait. Sorry folks - I loved this and snagged it fast because the hype sold me. Don't let the hype sell you on something you'll beat real fast and then hate like I'm doing right now. The procedural generation bit that they sell attempts to mask the fact that youre actually doing the same exact thing for most of the game. Get that Ore for the next set, finished? nice want to enjoy it? You can't because one level higher planet later and its obsolete as hell and you'll need to be hunting the next ore to gear up once again. Which will repeat the process of being overpowered for that planet and not good enough for the next. Horrible progression. Avoid. My hours are decently high because I fall asleep with the game running all of the time. Just a thing I do. Early access in general has really let me down in the past two years. Most of these companies are not and seemingly can not meet their own deadlines or even fix play killing bugs. So make your own decisions but don't kill your wallet on a giant piece of guesswork that has been historically screwing people left and right. Take care all. -Dark			"

Disappointed by No Man's Sky?Look no further. Starbound had NMS beat a LONG time ago. This game plays like a smart mix of Little Big Planet and Minecraft with a space-y theme which allows for a lot of diversity. Since the release a lot changed from the beta and I've noticed a few minor annoyances which weren't there previously, but otherwise I can't recommend this game enough if you're looking for something new to play with your friends.

												A great example of Early Access developers taking the money and running leaving only a skeletal amount of updates in the past two years.Edit- After the official 1.0 release the game is still lacking in many of the promised features. Everything was simplified from before to fit a short linear quest that revolves around an unfinished hub area. Still has a couple of critical bugs like items dissapearing from containers. It might be fun for a few hours but not worth the full price nor the time it took to get to this state. A complete embarrassment to early access.			"

								Starbound brings an interesting setup to the table : an unending universe completely open for the player (or players) to explore of their own free will. While still in beta, Starbound is still completely playable and has various routes open for people to take. Space adventurers can dabble in agriculture, undertake small- or large-scale construction, traverse the foreign expanses, and including, but not limited to, visiting established colonies and/or creating colonies of their own. Add this combined with the never-ending limits of peoples' imaginations, and Starbound becomes a bountiful and fruitful sandbox where nothing is holding anyone back. "

												This game has had so many issues since release, I can't possibly write a good review. The last update was over 2 months ago as of this writing, and there are still a lot of issues people are seeing that haven't been addressed. For example, they still haven't fixed crew randomly duplicating themselves, and beyond that, fuel becomes an entirely useless commodity once you find the right crew member and have your fuel effiency over 100% (Yes, over 100% is possible). The gameplay is extremely repetative, and you'll often find yourself flooded with extra resources that you have nothing to do with. If these issues get fixed, and something gets done to the late game/end game to make it more interesting, then maybe this game has a chance of being on par with Terraria, but as it is, it still feels like its more of a Proof-of-concept than a full release.

								Guys I get it, it's been in early access for a while. It's not ""completed"" yet and that pisses a lot of you off. However, there are a LOT of amazing things about this game. First of all, let's get this out of the way. The art style is amazing, I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack and the game runs very fast. Second, this big update redid the whole progression system. I think that with a few more tiers, this could be a better progression than any other survival game, although it already surpasses most. When the update came out me and my bro immediantly downloaded it and thats where most of my time  came from. I also have a lot of hours in the unstable which I belive those are seperate from the hours I have here. I've done about 3 characters if you're including the two before the update, and I already have 66 hours. Also the looting system is AWESOME, it's not RNG unlike games like terraria. When you find a chest, which trust me you will find a lot of, you're almost guarenteed to find a weapon which power is determined by the tier planet you're on. The gameplay is ridiculously fun, although I'm not a huge fan of the missions. The game also has some big background lore if you're into that kind of stuff. There is an amazing crafting system with just so many options, espicially in the lategame. If you don't want to, you don't even have to build a base unlike most survival games, you can get the ship upgrades, which are all different depending on your race. Also let's not forget the sheer size of this universe. There are SO many planets, it forms in a certain pattern, and it would be simply impossible to explore the whole universe. You can fly anywhere inside your solar system for free, but you can hop to another system using fuel, which you will most likely use liquid etherium, found on moons. I could go on forever about this game, but there's too much to love. I know that the game isn't finished, but it's 15 bucks and you can get SO much time in it. Just try it, you won't be dissapointed.			"

Early Access Review
								Is this a good game? Is it worth 15 dollars? Probably not. This game had so much potential when it was released nearly a year ago, but since then little to no updates have occurred.The devs had promised fast and substantial updates, but little has come to fruition. They keep teasing updates on twitter that never seem to be delivered. The ability to unlock different sized ships was supposed to be released months ago! The only reason this game survives is because there is a modding community. I've put in a ton of hours into this game because i had hopes that as it would develop so would my toon. This is clearly not going to happen. My little Apex pilot has been sitting in his space ship awaiting my return, but unless drastic changes happen soon this is likely never going to happen. "

												In short, the developers of this game pulled off the good ol' Bethesda. What does that even mean, you ask? That the game by itself is boring, lacking quality of life features, and just not fun in general. However, it IS easily moddable, and the community is already making really good improvements that make the normally bad game worth playing.I don't recommend buying the game by itself, but if you're willing to put some effort into it, by making it shine with tons of mods... It can be worth it.Either way, if you are considering to buy and mod it, I'd STILL recommend waiting for more/better mods, and maybe official content updates. The devs canned many interesting things to release it at once, so who knows, maybe now that they released it and got a stable base, they'll slowly add the content they canned.			"

								I was never really a big fan of open world exploration games. I have never tried minecraft, and my terraria has only 1h+ clocked. Despite this, I really wanted to try out starbound after hearing wonderful reviews of youtubers and friends. After downloading it, I realised the gameplay is very similar to that of terraria. However, simple changes in mechanics, like being able to mine 9 blocks at once, really made it enjoyable to me. I am now searching through the depths of my planet, hoping to find the best equipment and more pixels.I greatly recommend this game as it will be extremely enjoyable after that boring first 30 mins of looking for basic equipments. That copper armour will never be enough and no depths is unreachable. I haven't tried out multiplayer and will be looking forward to mining with my friends.""This is one of those games where you simply spend hours on."" -Day9			"

												Just finished the game and am really disapointed. This game has no progression. you upgrade your ships and build a colony that has NO purpose other than give you quests to do and gather items that you need to level up your techs or your Manipulator. Which you usually find in chest ( oh...look... another of those purple items ...yay..) You get absolutely no suprise loots, even from the damn bosses. Changing planets are just basically you, trying to find a new biome. That's it. Terraria gave meaning to the land you were on. Combat is boring, progression is absent and the end game goes nowhere. Go play Terraria right now and be amazed at how many hours you'll sink in the while still having surprises all the time. I don't recommend Starbound at all.			"

								Starbound is an amazing game. I honestly don't know why people call it a ""Terraria"" clone, and judge it unfairly. This game has a GREAT potential to be an AMAZING game! The fluid gameplay... I absolutely love it! The game is still early access, so a few bumpy things here and there, but this definitely was worth the $14.99. I'm sure the majority of the hate on this game is from Terraria-fans that never actually tried this game give it all their hatred. Don't hate me just yet, I have both Starbound & Terraria on my account, and I intend no bias. This first thing I noticed in this game was how many things are animated and great, such as... The Player can use the arrow keys to express themselves to other players!! The trees! They wobble and fall realisticly! This game is set into a future setting, where advanced technology is available to The Player. Heck, you can choose between being an alien or a human as your character.Definitely pick up this game, I give my vouch.			"

								I don't feel like reviewing Starbound is worth my time, so instead, I'll tell you the story of a tiger; a glorious tiger named ""StoundBar"".As a cub, Stoundbar's bright colorful fur astounded everyone, and shined bright against all the other tigers around her. Tigers everywhere thought she would be the legend among them.As she neared adolescence, her outstanding talent showed itself. Were there already fast tigers in the community? Sure, but Stound was faster. Were there tigers who were experts at hunting? Sure, but she brought in more game than anyone else. It became clear that she had potential.And then it happened...A circus came to her habitat and was swiping up other tigers, but when they saw Stoundbar, they stopped in their tracks. They released the other tigers and took her instead. Off to the circus. The circus... named ""♥♥♥♥leChish""At ♥♥♥♥leChish, her talent was displayed. Her best qualities; her running, her hunting skills, and others were all showcased for small audiences at first; introductory gigs where people got an exclusive glimpse of Stoundbar's excellence. Other acts, performances; other animals fell in her shadow. All people wanted to see was Stoundbar.After awhile, ♥♥♥♥leChish began a fundraiser to develop Stoundbar's talents even further. Apparently, word of StoundBar's unique talent and glory had spread internationally, so their fundraiser raked in millions. By that time, they had their own place for their increasingly popular shows, but they decided that, with these new funds, a change of location was in order. Over almost the course of a year, they moved to a new location, and excitement for StoundBar waned the longer they took.When they finally moved, however, ♥♥♥♥leChish Circus' popularity died, and with it, Stoundbar's did too.And then came the abuse...With Chucklefish--err, I mean.. ♥♥♥♥leChish seeking a desperate revival of Stoundbar's audience and notoriety, they began to beat and batter the last remnants of her brilliance out of her over time. They spent months at a time between shows pumping her with harmful steroids and hormones to try and boost her lore. Enhancements which seemed amazing on the surface were soon revealed to be harmful for her in reality. For about a month after Stoundbar, with her brand-new enhancements, were exposed to the world, her fans returned to the stadium. However, they got bored and stopped attending shows once again.Eventually, ♥♥♥♥leChish fell into a depressing pattern; a downward spiral of desperate enhancements for Stoundbar which slowly began to kill her. The fans, however, rush back temperarily (in increasingly small numbers) and then retreat to other shows in only a matter of weeks. Stoundbar's fur suddenly didn't seem so bright;Her talents.. no longer special.Starbound's era passed prematurely, and for that... all thanks can be given to the poor management of Chucklefish.I was one of her fans; there from the first show she gave to the massive, cheering crowds.. and now all I can say is.. show's over kids, now it's time to move on to the next great act.EDIT: 1.0 drops soon, and I will play it. If it's good, I'll change my review, if not, I ain't changin' a thing. Also, to anyone who might be confused by all of my hours in this game, it's because I've had it since the day it came out and I played every update and played a lot with my ex girlfriend and Steam friends. I've had a lot of fun, but I still don't recommend someone buys it now as it was actually more fun when I got it and got 10 runtime errors in that same day than it is now. They've put a leash on the freedom that this game once had, so I say you shouldn't touch it now.			"

												it was so good. emphasis on was... but ever since the update it has been horrible, like to the point i haven't wanted to play it. for several reasons:1. it doesn't seem to work on any computer made before 2016, so none of my friends can play with me. (the only reason i can is because i got given a shiny new pc)2. half the things that made it a good sandbox game are gone. wanna make a character to role play as? well you can't anymore because you have to jump through like 17 hoops just to unlock tech.3. THE TECH, all the good ones are gone. like ""screw being able to have 7 jumps in a row. but oh! everyone wants to wall jump or have a maximum of 3 jumps"" no one even asked for that. it was fine before you messed with it.4. starting mission? what? oh? i'm a college dropout or something? wow, now my character is less ""me"" and more some guy who found a portal gun or something.5. all my old characters are gone, it removed all the characters i spent time on. can't even get the items from them or anything. gotta start fresh with our new horrible mechanics.i have been playing this update for about 30 minutes, i came on to make a character for if i ever got to play it with friends again but no, you have to go through a lot and i'm not jst talking about the ""optional"" starting mission. no more just spawning things in and getting to make your own story. they have taken out everything good and replaced it with stuff that has be so overhyped that it is stale. the hell even is a fuffalo and why is it better that being able to jump high enough to actually get out of trouble.i used to love this game. heck i have like 100 hours or something, i dunno how many, as it stopped loading through steam. but now it is terrible, would not recommend. y'know those parents that give you a half decent phone then replace it with a brick, it's like we are being punished, we had so much fun and now we have to go back to dull, mundane, average games. it's not even ""oh, you're just not used to it yet, it the same"" because it isn't, like i said, you were able to have about 5-6 consecutive jumps, now the max you get is 3. you were able to dash across things lighting fast, now the fastest you can go is a gentle sprint. you used to be able to summon a shield to protect you from fall damage, now your only options are turn into 4 different types of ball, like in metroid. i fail to see how being a ball that can pass overwater is better than having a shield that protected you from any fall.thanks starbound, you really did us all a favour! gg no re. 10 / 10 best game. except not really, its so bad now.

												Great, this game again.One of the worst early access games ever, but atleast it's past that point.This game has a few issues, mostly relating to combat, crafting, the internal decorating and the lack of anything to do after three hours of saying ""wow, that looks cool"".The combat is sluggist and unpolished. It's unbalanced and lacks alot of content. The weapons are usually guns and melee weapons, but on the off chance it could be one of those useless wands. The guns require just about as must energy as the delorean with a time machine in the back and the melee weapons either have a stupidly long swing time or deal no damage at all.The planets and biomes are just about as unique as the people who praise this game. The biomes appear in unsuited planets, or planets appear in unsuited solar systems. I managed to find a few floran villages on a planet raining fire... The biomes get old after a while and only serve the purpose of looking cool for a handful of seconds.The races make no sence, and have just about as much background as a sticker on a brick wall. The choice of your race means nothing other then the appeal of said choosen race. You can come with the amazing comeback relating to the weapons and armour the races get, but it becomes void as it means little to nothing since the benefits of the armour are so little.The UI design is horrible. It's messy, unsorted and completly terrible to look at. The hotbar is fiddly and the inventory sorting they ""tried"" to make works no wonders. The inventory appears in front of your character rather than the sides which really adds to the fun involved with getting mobbed while sorting your now unorganised inventory.The idea of setting up base on a planet is once again made useless, as everything other then colonisation is easily done on the ship. The whole colonisation thing is useless, as you'll never reap any benefits from it other than the fun ""go kill someone quests"", or better yet the ""go fetch an item for me"" quest.The crew system is another pointless addition to this burning pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The crew mostly laze around doing nothing, as nothing has been made for them to do  and the only point in having them is to increase the size of your ship, which can be easily avoided with the super, easily obtained fake licenses.I don't have much to say about the fossils and the little thing that hovers around the ship, mostly because those ""features"" serve no purpose.The game is an ocean with the depth of a kiddy pool and lacks any sort of reasonably good features. Maybe if the game had good features like hailing, systems on the ship, encounters in space and many others I might of recommended this game, but in its current state i can't But hey, this project still has 8 more years of run time, so maybe it'll be different later, maybe.

When I purchased this game I lived in my mother and father's basement. I spent my time out of college playing this game and Team Fortress 2 with friends. It was a fun time until the promised update never came. I type now and I need to say that in that period of time. I married the woman of my dreams, I went through my first loss as a man, and I own my own house. Both my wife and I are settling into careers. And the game is STILL IN ♥♥♥♥ING EARLY ACCESS.			"

								This was an awesome concept when it first started. They waited forever to release the game in beta. They went from awesome looking monster to something that looks like tamagachi aliens.It's been over a year and instead of stabalizing the game for release, every update they have ever put out just keeps breaking the game further. Instead of working on the core game to get it out, they keep adding useless vanity items that proceed to cause even more bugs to iron out. They're main focus? Adding crap that breaks more crap so they can keep it in early access so they don't have to worry about a ""scam"" of it being a broken full release.I followed this game for years, was one of the unfortunate many who pre-ordered it (kickstarted it) and they haven't done much of anything useful with that money except waste time.God forbid you go on their forums. Oh no, you have never in your life seen a more fanboy fueled message board in your life. You aren't allowed to say anything negative about the game. If you're not stroking the ego of the developers of jumping on the love Starbound band wagon, you'll be ridiculed for your opinions, your ideas and your requests. Have something negative to say about the game and why? Expect to be banned for ""trolling"" and my favorite, ""smack talking"".Edit: 1/2/2016  lol I apparently bought this 3 years ago.

												I'm sorry, i gave this game a chance. I tried 17 hours of it and i've only had around 2 hours of fun.It's boring, there's nothing there. I shouldn't say there's nothing there, i should say that everything in this game means nothing.Adventuring - Nothing is there that you want or would need. You only need to adventure to find colonies where you left click on everything or get extremely boring and monotonous quests of sending you on a wild goose chase to get to the fun parts of the game which last around 1 hour each quest and there's 6 of them. So i've spent roughly 14 hours adventuring and i've only gotten 1 hour of actually fun content from it. Great game right?Building - This game does give you one thing though, and that's cosemetics and blocks. Both of them are useless. Cosemetics don't add anything truly substantial to the game and the blocks are just useless. Lets put it this way, they give you an infinite number of worlds to ""adventure"" in. By that, i mean an infinite number of rocks in space that mean nothing to you after you leave them. Sure you can build on them but what does it matter? they're forcing you to fly from planet to planet anyways. You can't stay on one planet at all. So you must be able to build on something right? You need a base. Well they give you one for free that automatically expands itself. You can't expand it though and there's almost no room for any fun building to be done. You HAVE to build your crafting stations and storage in the ship, you literally cannot make anything cool or substantial in the small base that they give you. It's been 17 hours and i've only gotten one expansion to it.Quests - The quests are mainly the only game you'll find. But the only fun quests are hard to find or they're the main story quests. Imagine WoW's quests... now take away every ounce of fun and effort from them and make the reward a dog turd. You made a starbound quest. They're short, boring, and do nothing but give you money to eventually buy a new weapon that's replaced by an item from the main story quest anyways. Now this ""main story quest"" is not only where you find your items but it's the only motivation for playing this game. Basically, they're quests where you get sent on a wild goose chase for colonies where you have to adventure around on planets, which gets boring really fast, and you pray to god that you didn't waste 10 mintues on another planet. Once you finally finish the first part of the main story quest, you get sent to a fun dungeon. The items were great, the dungeon was fun, the enemies were challenging but not impossible and it was something new. Then it ends after around 30 minutes to 1 hour. And if the story is correct, you do this 5 more times, and then fight the final boss.TL;DR - The game is fun, if it allows itself to. There is fun in the game but it's hidden under hours and hours of monotonous, tedious, boring, lifeless, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests which give you nothing. You can adventure, but there's nothing gained form it. You can mine but there's nothing gained from it. You can do quests but they're boring. The only thing fun is the main story quest, but that can be boring also. I just can't recommend this game after taking 17 hours to have around 2 hours of decent content. It's just not good. It doesn't matter what game there is or what i missed, if i played and  did almost every aspect of the game for 17 hours and finished a sixth of the main quest, i should have gotten somewhere or had fun at some point. If i've missed something ""fun"" then tell me, I really want to enjoy this game, but it's a huge disappointment as of now.			"

Early Access Review
								According to my account details I bought this game in 2013.  I had been really enjoying Terraria and I felt enthusiastic about this as something I would be able to enjoy in the same way.  I hadn't been ripped off by Early Access games back then and I was entirely optimistic.  Shortly after beginning the single player version of the game I had to answer a phone call and my character died and I lost a bunch of progress because I couldn't find a 'pause' button.  After some research I discovered that 'pause' was a widely requested feature that simply didn't exist,It is now 2016.  Since the 1970s a 'pause' feature for single player games has been widely accepted to be one of the most significant advancements in video gaming.  But not in Starbound.  The developers seem to consider that their precious game should take priority over anybody elses lives in any and all respects and that is basically the story of this project that I now very much wish that I had not supported.The game remains in Early Access.  Large amounts of time has passed where nothing has happened.  Large amounts of time has passed where mechanics have been implemented only to be abandoned or scrapped and entirely reworked.  The game always had plenty of potential, I'm simply really pessimistic at this late stage that it will ever achieve it.The game has become far laggier in its years of development, and it is starting to look dated before it is even completed.  It doesn't have the depth of Terraria in supporting different playstyles and it doesn't have the creativity in arranging various mechanisms to help acquire materials and beat bosses and so on.  There is basically just one way to play the game and progress, while most of the additions to the game have ended up entirely cosmetic or amounted to gimmicks.  Many of the 'improvements' add tedium rather than fun - who wants to worry about watering crops instead of going exploring?  It often feels like the game is going backwards in development rather than forwards...The game isn't terrible and this does make me feel bad that the review system is as simplistic as 'yes' and 'no'.  There is a significant amount of content to explore and it is far more complete and entertaining than similar projects such as Edge of Space and Darkout.  But for a game this far into Early Access it is basically a textbook example of project mismanagement and in its current state I honestly couldn't recommend it.			"

												Summing up this game after it left EA: Led astray by a misleading community and developed by egomaniac artists. It has great graphics and neat features but with a repetetive, dull, and lacking story. Unprofessional, shady, and questionable interactions with the community as a whole. A real shame because so much of this was cool: the endless space exploration, farming, and building... but all of this is hindered and optional, and doesn't add much to the experience. Combat is one of its weakest points with a mediocre AI and clunky melee. They have unique abilities, which is cool but doesn't make up for its shortcomings. Despite having a huge array of generated loot, you are given a very limited set of weapons you can craft, which is just lame.To be fair with this review, I'd like to list it's major strengths and weaknesses. Like mentioned, it looks great and some in depth features; building and farming had a large amount of appeal because, well, you do can do so much with your own creativity and that drew me in, not to mention colonies (non-essential and kind of a bother unless you want extra work and don't care about what you get in return.) It however has a bland story, with a somewhat interesting basis, but a terrible execution relying on a dull, repetitive pre-mission quest. It does still have a number of bugs it needs to iron out as well a few random performance problems.I might be blunt but I can understand how people can overlook the shortcomings of this game and enjoy it. I however do not recommend it. Watch some gameplay before you decide on this game. However, Terraria is more worth it than this game.			"

												Unfortunately this game suffers from the same problems that a lot of games that rely on procedurally generated content have: a vast, infinite universe that is full of the same thing, over and over.This wouldn't be so much of a problem, particularly for $15 at full price, except for the fact that all the quests, including the main storyline is the same thing over and over. It becomes an issue of whether or not this game is worth your time, and ultimately I think it is not. To progress enough to fight each boss, you have to ""scan"" i.e. click on a few dozen items from one of the universe's cultures that you will spend several hours looking for. They'll be spread out over a number of different worlds, and it will take lot of searching for generally. Once you fight the boss, you're assigned another culture to scan items for. I've made it through four cycles of this and I'm uninstalling. There's quite a few more to go and I just can't do it again.It's a shame, because there's a lot of decorative stuff to build a base with, at first it seems like just a ton of content to explore but each planet is disappointingly similarly composed, despite cosmetic differences.At the end I'm left with the impression that I just don't care what the next boss is like, and making me scan more items makes me want to smash my head on the keyboard.

								The stock game hasn't changed much in the YEARS its been in early access.  Start with nothing, mine materials, and upgrade your gear and ship and face a boss to move on.  Repeat cycle until the last tier.The ONLY thing that has made this game worth investing 200+ hours in was the mass availability of mods through thier site.  (Workshop would have been better)  I was a mod author my self through a couple of versions of the game, but got tired of updating it every patch, since the game wasn't really progressing any.There are MODs that make building colonies on plantes fun, or adding crew to your ship, different race packs, and tons of other features.  Sadly I think the dev's are relying on the MOD authors to actually flesh out content for the game as there hasn't been a significant change to the core in years now. TL;DR:   Buy for the ability to mod, and enjoy what the community has put together.  Don't buy if you are actually hoping the DEVs are going to finish the game.			"

It lacks many features that were promised in a full version, it's a lifeless version of Terraria, it's a stereotypical survival grind and there just isn't much to explore due to the planets being largely similar to eachother. Mass Procedural Generation is not a good answer to solid level design, and Starbound's universe when held up to the smaller worlds Terraria and even Minecraft it just falls flat.			"

								This Review is from the ""Winter"" Update and doesn't reflect any updates since February 2015. I do plan on picking it up again and will change the review to reflect new content.I find it hard to truly recommend Starbound. Is it fun? Definitely, and the update really brought a lot to the table. But the game really boils down to;Go to new planet.Dig down to mine new ore.Craft new armor.Get new mission.Beat mission.Get new tech to survive harder planets.RepeatI found myself painfully aware of this scheme after doing it for the third time. While many games do boil down to repitious tasks, this game did little to hide that fact.I've been to roughly 20 or more planets since the update, and while they all look different they feel very, very similar. The same goes for the beasts. I don't believe I've run into the same mob the entire playthrough, yet I feel I'm fighting the same creature every time.This fact greatly lends itself to the overall repetitive feeling the game portrays. All I'm saying is don't hand me an apple you just painted purple, and tell me it's different from the apple you just handed me five minutes ago.Another point of contention I have is the insane amount of items in the game, many of which do absolutely nothing. I found myself constantly visiting wiki sites to cross reference the item for crafting/building purposes only to find that it is what it is and nothing more. For a game that seems to center around crafting, there are way too many ""found"" items that, to me, take away from the crafting aspect. Maybe in a future update the items will have some further purpose, but for now it seems as if the devs are spending way to much time making new sprites and not enough time programming. <--HahaEnough negative though. The game, overall, is actually very enjoyable if you can look past the repetitive nature of the game in it's current state. Exploring is fun. Picking out random planets of the vast cosmos of star systems is exciting. Employing different fighting styles out of the numerous weapons/guns you will find feels purposeful, and always changing depending on the enemy you are fighting. By that I refer to npc enemies, not beasts, whom you will tire of fighting after the umpteenth planet you visit, and thousandth ""creature of unspeakable horror"" you obliterate.Overall I don't think I can give this game a ""recommend"" just yet. With games like Terraria out there, there are just better alternatives. Unless you already own Terraria, and Minecraft, etc, in which case I then say ""maybe.""			"

												I played this game much longer than most games that I lose interest in, but probably because I put down fifteen bucks for this one. The music is lovely, and being able to mine multiple blocks simultaneously is great, and the -idea- of being able to planet-hop made this sound so much cooler to me than Terraria ever did. However, I enjoyed Terraria better in every way aside from its music and single-block-at-a-time mining, such as the single planet meaning anything I built, I could re-visit and it had more purpose and felt more like home, whereas in Starbound, if you took the time to build a house, chances are you'll never come back to that planet again, so putting care and interest into building structures and making them nice has little to no draw in Starbound.Starbound claims it has quests, which is does, but they're just fetch quest garbage that did not entertain me. There is a main quest, but it quickly turns into a ""find all 6 (can't recall the #) McGuffins across the galaxy"" before you can continue thing. That worked on the NES with The Legend of Zelda, because you literally could not find anything better to play on NES in terms of scope and quality at the time. However, fast forward a couple decades or so, and that same ""plot"" (gather all the items, period) doesn't work in new games today, without clever twists, so when Starbound had the audacity to demand I do the same thing after I was already hoping to find gameplay elements to hook me longer, I lost what remained of my interest immediately.Once I passed about a dozen hours of gameplay, nothing interested or excited me, and I simply wasn't having fun. Now a friend wants me to play this with her, so I'm having to bite the bullet and trudge through it all over again, and I'm having even less enjoyment a second time around.			"

												Four years. A million dollars and a complete development team.Four ♥♥♥♥ing years, a million ♥♥♥♥ing dollars and a complete godamn development team and the result is a mediocre edge of space clone that runs like crap.The game had a lot of promise, but the developers got so much money from pre-orders and early adopters they overdosed on hookers and cocaine and forgot they were supposed to make a game after taking the money.Long periods of inactivity combined with procrastination led to disjointed updates and developers so utterly disconnected from the community that the majority of old time players who gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game left and only the fanboys remained.The game started out with an intresting premise. Multiple differenct races each of them explore space for its own reason with its own goals, it's own allied and enemy races creating conflict and generating and truly living breathing world, its own tech and it's own special abilities, exploring to find the reason why they left their planet in the first place. You could be a pirate, a researcher, a space bandit fighting for your own cause beacuse your own reasons.Sounds intresting no?Well, what we got now is everyone is happy, everyone is united, no conflict, part of a united federation type deal, and your character is the newest graduate out to save the world with the other graduates from cthulu who hates all live and wants to see it gone because it gives an evil boner or whatever. (ORIGINAL PLOT ALERT, DO NOT STEAL).How do you save the world from cthulu? Do 5 incredibly drawn out, tedious fetch quests, 5 nonsensical dungeons and then you fight the boss.All races are the exact same with the only differences being cosmetic. (As opposed to earlier versions where you had unique armors with abilities and special weapons)Since beta from more than half the special abilities or techs (like nullifying gravity, flying, teleporting, FTL dashing, mechs ect) got completely removed , a massive ammount of custom/unique racial weapons in the game got gutted for no reason at all, the game went back to use a terrible ""Damage on contact"" combat system and the racial armors turned from unique special sets with different abilities to 12 different reskins of the exact same item, and ontop of that all, all the unique racial AI was removed in favour of everyone using the human one! WHY!? Also, in the 4 years that it has been out the devs never gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥to properly optimize it so it'll run at more than 10 frames per second on high end gaming PCs.But all that could have been easily excused.IF THE GAME WASN'T IN THE GAME FOR 4 GODAMN YEARS WITH A BUDGET OF OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS!Honestly, I cannot in all honesty give this game a positive review, because it does not deserve a positive review.The developers took people's money, develivered a product that's even remotely close to what they promisd and took 4 years to do it. It's a mediocre game in a sea of mediocrity.If you're just learning about it without knowing any of its backstory or anticipation, hype or wait you might like it though.			"

								I played this game when it was still in development, and stopped when they continuously had issues with the character/world saves. The developers didn't seem to have a good grasp on how to retain player data while updating the game. This prompted me to stop playing until Starbound was more developed.Fast-forward to a few days ago, when my friends prompted me to play on the Nightly build: I was actually enjoying many of the changes made and was looking forward to the latest changes being released. However, once more my player and world saves were erased (they claim with this latest wipe that it's temporary). Needless to say this has made me regret my purchase. Nearly a year later and I can't play this game without fear of losing my in-game stuff. I would not recommend this game in its current state. Play Minecraft or Terraria. Don't play this game if you want to keep what you've worked for.			"

								Starbound has somehow managed to polish a rough gemstone into and even rougher one with it's recent updates. They seem to be adding in things and are seemingly pointless and outclassed by things already existing the game. So thus, those other things get nerfed. It's a seemingly endless cycle. They've somehow manage to make the game even worse update by update. This game has godawful progression, grindy as hell gameplay, and the touted ridiculous amounts of planets are simply pointless when you realise they're all in essence the same. There is no reason to build due to the ship upgrades other than the colony system, which in itself is just a distraction before you realise that there's nothing to this game. You go through 4 boring questlines which consist of mining in a new system that has a new meaningless gimmick and then entering an instanced dungeon with a poorly made boss at the end. This system of progression only serves to remove the little sandbox freedom you had.Get Terraria and forget about this broken mess that will likely never be fixed with updates, and perhaps will get even worse.

After it is released it gets some updates here and there then... where'd the updates go? Almost as if the rookie devs made bank and ran off to Hawaii to never be heard of again.

								Love this game. Terraria may seem to be more ""complete"" in terms of content expected, but this game has so much more potential to it to try to fill. It plays across a universe for crying out loud, what couldnt be implemented in this game?			"

After beating the game 2 times now, I have a better understanding on it´s strengths and weaknesses. A first Impression of mine when I first started was: Wow, this is like terraria in space!Oh Boy,was I wrong. This game simply cannot be compared to Terraria,even it´s artstyle is quiet similar. Terraria from my experience is more centered around exploring dungeons,fighting epic bosses and getting loot. Basically, a mix from dungeon crawlers. Action Platformers like Castlevania and other cellect em all games. Starbound however is more focused on the idea of Exploration, Building colonies and... that´s pretty much it. Since the 1.0 Version,they have introduced Bosses and ""Story"" missions,but they are all pre made and not randomly generated like other planets.That means you cannot influence the battle Arena like in terraria and have to fight the bosses and defeat the ""Dungeons"" as intended by the developers. A pretty big weakness if you ask me.To even ""unlock"" These dungeons,or better called ""stages"", you Need to scan various objects from all the races (except Novakid), to Progress. It might encourage Exploration,as you Need to visit various planets and ""starsystems"" to find them,but due to the randomly generated nature of this game, some times you find These villages of the certain races you are looking for right away or after a hour of visiting planet to planet. It can get tedious really fast and put the game on a stopping Point.One Thing to note is that all planets and Systems have a certain Level rank. It effects the Levels Monster and weapons you can find in chests. All fiery stars for example are the highest ranked System and contains the strongest enemies and also highest Level gear in the game, while gentle stars are the lowest leveled System and Serves as the starter System you will randomly spawn in. Might be a safe way to Balance difficulty in the game,but it gets boring after a while, since the planets on These stars have a pattern in which they are randomly generated. You will quickly notice the limited generated Patterns and get quiet bored with it.After you reached this Point in the game, I would suggest starting to build a colony on any Kind of planet. the more dangerous a planet is,the higher is your pay,that you receive from NPC´s that inhabit your colony. I would suggest starting of in a Level 1 planet, just to learn how the crafting works and after that move on to any other planet of your choice.So far, with the 1.2. Version out and soon an update promised, this game is still worth it´s pricetag, despite it´s flaws I mentioned. The game has a lot of potential with it´s future updates and current modding community, but don´t buy this game if you are looking for another Substitute for Terraria. They are both different games with different objectives in mind.			"

								This game is awesome. I love being able to pick a race/species to play as, and the different planets and worlds are just great. id give this game a 9.5/10.----------------------Won't even start after the newest update.Score is going to take a hit, now a 6/10I'm still going to recommend though because the game is fun.
