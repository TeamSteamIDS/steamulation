												I honestly enjoyed most of this game, which is why giving it a negative review bites. The problem is, the back chunk of the game is atrocious. You're suddenly going from what I referred to a couple of friends as ""Hard-Mode Portal"" (same 'solve the puzzle room' gameplay, with two-button controls, even if it's opposing magnetic polarities rather than holes in time/space) into a terrible action title.I was going to recommend this with a caveat of ""By the end, some puzzles become irritating due to the checkpoint system, where you may have to restart chunks of stage if you mistime a polarity swap or make a slight field mistake on some items"", but no, when you suddenly have to begin juggling explosives to kill massive sahaguin and all sorts of tentacled beasties* whereas you were previously free to take time and puzzle things out? Ick. The final stages are the worst: one involves distracting and repeatedly-bombing a behemoth to reach an entrance within sight, and then the finale is an irritation because it combines waiting for enemy patterns with dodging instadeath and making precarious platforming leaps.If you wanted an unpolished puzzle game, the first half or so is solid with little to no hand-holding (so it's got some brain-teasers for some of us). The latter bits, though? No. Nope no good no siree.* I only mention this because while I was blind to the latter half of the game going all Cthulhu, I'm told the marketing heavily sold it as such? Either way, multiple people assured me it wasn't the spoiler I assumed.			"

												Ok so yes i will admit why i bought this game first,i am a huge H.P.Lovecroft fan and allways have been (read all the stories he has written and found that i enjoy his works but THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH and THE CALL OF CTHULUH and probablly me favorites) and thats what first intrigued me about this game.MAGRUNNER is very similar in play style to PORTAL,whereas in portal you have the ""APERTURE HAND HELD PORTAL DEVICE"" (god thats a mouth full) in MAGRUNNER you have the MAG GLOVE which fires 2 coloured charges.1 is green and one is red (push and pull mechanics come into play here-1 attracts and 1 repels) and it plays in much the same way as the ""APERTURE...........oh lets call it the portal gun (its easier and doesnt take as long to wright) does in both of the PORTAL games.The graphics in MAGRUNNER are good and the music and overall feeling of dread that something may be coming for you at any point is quite intense at some points during the game.The story is told with gusto and never lets up (i havent finished yet but i am enjoying the story so far and i love the LOVECROFTIAN-(is that even a word DUH)-overtones in trhe story),as what starts out ot be a sci fi story about energy comsumption and finding new power sources soon turns into a horror induced nightmare and you find out why you and the other MAGRUNNERS are there and your purpass in the greater story is revealed.The main character is called DAX WARD and this sounds a lot like a character Lovecroft created himself CHARLES DEXTER WARD (any relation to this character is not know at this point as i havent finished the game just yet),DAX will no doubt before the end of the game encounter more similarities i dont doubt and will come across more of the horrors that Lovecroft created on the way.I like this game and it is good to see a developer investing in a Lovcraft based game as there is not a lot (if any) out there (or film,tv series or any other medium for that matter),i would also reccomend that if you want to play anything inspired by Lovecrofts work also search out the game CALL OF CTHULUH : DARK CORNERS OF THE EARTH (also available on steam) as that is one of the best survival horror first person games i have ever played (finished it on the X BOX and going to play through on steam as soon as time permits).So in closing if you loved PORTAL you will more than likely enjoy this and if you didnt steer clear and probably try DARK CORNERS OF THE EARTH instead as that game really does grab you by the throat and doesnt let go.

												Magrunner is too long for its own good. But it's a good game that deserved more recognition because it's in many ways similar to Portal and Q.U.B.E.But instead of using portals or cubes you'll be solving puzzles using your Magtech glove, a glove that allows you to magnetize stuff. The puzzles are creative and challenging (most of the times) but there are just too many of them. About 6-7 hours in I got bored. Some of the puzzles just take too long to solve, which, as a result, made me lose interest.Before that happened I actually had a great time with it. If you love FP puzzle games I'm pretty certain you'll love this one, too. It has nice visuals, good gameplay mechanics and a fun story. What's not to love?[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Magrunner: Dark Pulse is a really good first person puzzle game where you have the power to magnetize objects such as platforms and cubes to assist in getting from point A to point B. The magnetic aspect works reasonably well most of the time, but there are several instances where it is easy to get frustrated. During some of the later levels, the game starts to throw monsters at you in which you either have to kill or evade. The puzzle difficulty seemed to ramp up pretty well. Some of the final puzzles were indeed very tricky including many platforms with rotational paths that made them feel roller coaster like.Calling the story weird is an understatement. I think it comes close to the lines of Zeno Clash weirdness. But it comes off as very entertaining and keeps the suspense going throughout. The unfortunate aspect is that the story does not bring closure to a lot of things and the ending is basically up to the player to interpret.There are many elevator sequences that seemed a bit excessive basically moving you from one level to the next. That seemed to be the primary method they chose to inject a lot of the narrative. The atmosphere during the final chapter is pretty amazing including Cthulhu himself.If you are a fan of the first person puzzle genre, Magrunner: Dark Pulse is definitely a title worth picking up.

												Magrunner: Dark Pulse has been called Portal with magnets meets Cthulu. It is an apt description, but not quite fair. It is portal only insofar as it is a FPS puzzle game, the feel is reminiscent of Portal, but it has it's own unique charm. A little more work on monster animations would have gone a long way, and the final ""boss"" is ridiculously difficult until you have the ""AHAH!"" moment, then the whole area can be completed in under 5 minutes because it isn't immediately evident what you need to do. The game is great fun, and quite original if you can push Portal out of your mind. Some of the puzzles are brilliantly put together. If you like Portal, buy it. If you like Cthulu, buy it. All I can say is:Ia Ia Cthulu Fhtagn!			"

												I wanted to like this game but it's... absolutely stubborn about making me dislike it. It's fun in theory, but in execution it's just a more physics heavy Portal with less cleverly designed/more tedious puzzles.First off, the story. Is way too instrusive. In acts 1 and 2 you have elevator segments between a large portion of the levels that takes up a loading screen for essentially a cutscene... that is the same every time, just with a different person talking to you. The plot actually affects the gameplay very little in the first two acts, other than to make things take longer. All characters communicate via a hologram popping up over the magnet gun, but don't actually do anything. Sure, the scenery gradually degrades more and more, but that's about all that happens plotwise that is the slightest bit relevant to gameplay. Well until the third act when monsters start appearing.Another issue is the tedium in the puzzles; there's a lot of waiting around for things to be in the right place and making mistakes can sometimes set you back quite a bit even if you don't die. On top of that there's a lot of trial and error involved (far far more than Portal) because of the physics engine, which is unfortunately not perfect enough for this kind of game. There's inconsistencies in how objects behave on occasion and it's often hard to predict what will happen until you test it. Some of the puzzle rooms are pretty big as well while also lacking in direction, leading to confusion not even part of the puzzle. The game also doesn't have a large enough variety in obstacles to keep things fresh; at some point things stop evolving (aside from the monster segments) and the puzzles start to get rather repetitious. Maybe digging deeper into a concept explored previously but it's not fresh enough to hold the interest. The game probably could've benefitted from being shorter, especially in the second act; that segment of the game took up probably 60-70% of my initial run playtime on its own.The monster segments are also entirely out of place; they're alright when you know what to do but until you do they're largely trial and error, often almost expecting you to know what to do if you want to survive at all. There's not a large number of them and they're all confined to the end of the game, but they still really aren't a good fit for the formula. The final boss especially, since it is entirely possible to have the game autosave mere fractions of a second before you die, forcing a level restart. Plus there's a needlessly difficult platform hop involved. I thought we agreed that first person games and intense platforming are a combination that really has to be fine-tuned or excluded period. It's only a single hop done twice but it's a pretty fast moving platform and failure means death, soooo.The game's on the whole not terrible, it's an interesting concept and there are some good puzzle designs here but there are far more bad puzzles than good and I wouldn't recommend it over its peers.

												Do i recommand this game? Maybe!It took me 10 hours to finish the game, a third of that is playing, another third is thinking, and the last third is dying.This game is a « portal » copycat, with magnetism as game engine, but the physics are often imprecise.It remembers me another game, bad rats, when you think the solution correctly, you build the solution correctly, but it may fail just because of some pixels offset, or even worse, won't do the same result between two identical simulation!A puzzle game can be hard and challenging, it's not the problem, but it shall not be « hard » to build the solution, it's just annoying and not enjoyable.I give three situations you will encounter in the game:- Sometimes you need many tries ( deaths ) just because the timing of platforms or cubes ( how hard is it to detect the peak altitude of a cube when you are riding it and then perform the correct imprecise jump!).- Often (very often), and despite of the zoom feature, you will send your « newton » (a castable magnetic point) instead of setting the magnetism of a device, because we are talking about pixel aiming here...- Sometimes, with the exact same configuration between two tries and when 3 or more magnetic points are involved, the result will differ, making you think your solution was bad at first. It's even worse when it happens on « catapults » because the cubes are snapped to the same precise position, so it's not even a targetting problem.When i play a puzzle game, i don't wan't to be blocked because a piece don't fit well, i don't call that a hard puzzle but a glitched puzzle.Anyway, the physics are also almost realist, it means when you expect to « capture » a charged object by using another object in vinicity, it will or not work depending of the momentum and the distance of the moving object, wich means some situations are complex but previsible, and added to the pre-existing points, you will be able and will need to place your own point (one at time) on almost any surface . In term of complexity, it worth the speed and direction conservation you have to master in portal when you use big falls to make big or long jumps ^^ This was the feature that made me go on to see what challenging puzzle was waiting for me in the next level, despite of the « glitches » i mentioned before.The graphims are okay, and clear enough to focus on activable objects.The story is a joke and the Cthulhu background is just a pretext to glue the puzzles together, don't expect epic fights ( there are only 2 kind of monsters, and they basically just walk towards you and you die on contact... the screenshoot are kind of lying btw. i suspect in early versions they just planned to use a countdown to add some stress) or deep story, everything is incoherent and not fun ( opposite to portal story), and the cutscenes are unskippable! ( remember i said you will die often not because you are not clever, but because of the unfair difficulty to build the solution, expect to see the same cutscenes often ). You will feel alone till the end.There is a decent chance you won't finish the game because you won't enjoy it till the end, or even because it's too hard.You may enjoy it if you don't mind loosing half of your play time because of the game and not because of you, the other half will show you how clever you are.

Posted: January 4, 2014
												Overall Rating: 6.5 out of 10 What happens when you put together Portal, Cthulhu Mythos and magnets? this is what you get. In fact, that's precisely what you pay for, and that doesn't disappoint in that regard. Magrunner: Dark Pulse is an interesting first person puzzle platformer. If you've played Portal or Quantum Conundrum, this is the style of gameplay but instead of portals or changing the dimension the room is in, you harness the power of magnetism. The gameplay is centered around using a Mag Glove to manipulate platforms, cubes and stationary objects to finish a level. This allows a level of thinking similar to other puzzle platformers, but the method was not explored until now.How Does it Play?The game is a real mind bender and has the player execute platforming skills while solving the puzzle on the fly. Not only are you switching the magnetism of something(attract/repel) but you're usually jumping along something at the same time. It usually works. However, the limits of the physics that the Unreal Engine has means now and then there will be moments where the physics will go hay wire and make you redo part of a puzzle again or kill you if you're dealing with explosive cubes or pit falls. Each puzzle takes about the time of what you would expect, about the same as a Portal puzzle room if you try it the first time. The difficulty curve is gradual and does not erratically change back and forth when progressing. One feature of the game you recieve mid way through the game is Newton, a robotic dog you can attach to most surfaces that has his own magnetic pull(or repel depending on how you want to use him), I found this an interesting way to make the puzzles more interesting, changing the entire thought process on beating a level. However, I found Newton to be really hit or miss. Sometimes his magnetic pull and radius of it to be too small in some instances, when you have to guide along a cube on  wall to get it to the other side of a pit, sometimes the angle on which you're looking to move Newton will mean the cube is just barely out of reach of the ""New"" Newton, and you have to redo that part of the puzzle again(as in the cube respawns at a set point, not restarting from a checkpoint) Another point of dismay with Newt is you might end up spawning him when you don't want to, which can destroy progress on certain puzzles, which can be frustrating. The Mag Glove itself, I must add, is responsive and easy to use, especially with the zoom feature that makes sure you're hitting the right thing when you're in larger areas, you can even hold down one of the mouse buttons to have it paint a laser over where you want to shoot, making sure you're always landing your charge changing shot where you want it.Despite Newton helping you along and the precision and reliability of your Mag Glove, the physics do not feel right in this game. While puzzles work as intended, it feels like the pulling strength is weaker than the repelling strength, which can throw off a players timing and how they are going about solving a puzzle. It also sometimes flat out doesn't work, sometimes you must ride a cube up a shaft or sling accross a chasm on one, and sometimes it just fails with no fault on the players end. Why this has yet to be fixed, I have no idea. Explosive cubes also sometimes blow up in the players hand for no reason, especially on the final boss fight.Speaking of, (spoiler free!) the final boss/puzzle is, interesting. It's not bad, but because of a flaw with saving, it can become impossible. Explosive cubes are thrown at you if you're not fast enough stunning the one who's throwing them at you, and right when you die, you can pass through a save ""gate"" on the platform(s). If this happens, the level must be restarted. This segment of the final area feels tacked on as if they forgot they needed to make a final boss. The save system in general is wonky, you cannot save manual, and it only saves once you reach certain parts of the map, but since the levels do not progress in a set pattern or line, you may find yourself activating a save gate when you didn't want to, meaning, when you do more of the puzzle and die, you go back further than normal, as the gate does not activate again with the exception of a couple levels.All in all, it is perfectly playable, but rough around the edges. If you're a fan of puzzles and platformers, and of course, Portal, then the game is for you. Now, onto the other bits of what the game offers.How's the Story?Bluntly, not good. It feels extremely cobbled together, as if the only thought of the entire development was ""Portal x Cthulhu!"" While an interesting premise, the execution falls flat on its face. None of the characters are likable, the dialogue feels wooden and unconvincing (especially form the antagonist) most if not all character interactions are done from holochat, basically the characters are projected above your mag glove, which is cool, and talk to you, nice idea but it doesn't help much with the story, especially when you die and have to listen and look at them over and over again.The concept of a utopian, globally linked world with Cthulhu Mythos is interesting all the way through, but usually only through the imagery you actually see as you play through the game, later levels have a giant vision/hallucination of cthulhu, in a dark backround while you solve puzzles, it looks utterly incredible and scary. But it does not help the plot, the plot feels extremely shallow and cobbled together, as stated before. I can't emphasis that enough, the game really feels disjointed because of the story.How Does it Look?Great! The game runs on Unreal Engine 3, while aged, still manages to look great with this game, the texture work is fantastic. The latter levels that take place in space are awe inspiring, the nebulae, galaxies and planets swirl around you, the petrified/statues of hidious eldritch nightmares(and the living ones, too!) have real texture and a sense of slime to them. I admit however, the character models aren't that great, they seem modeled well with a good poly count, but they aren't animated very well, including all the people who holo chat with you and the Deep One monsters you encounter(the fish people), are not animated very well and are pretty unconvincing in their movement.The game is fairly easy to run and should run fine on low end computers too. However, if you're playing at a high resolution(1080 p or higher) you will experience some incredible screen tearing, whcih can detract from the set pieces and overall look and flow of the game. Interestingly, vsync can be turned on to mitigate this, but you must do so through the config files, as well as AA, ambient occlusion and motion blur. Why these graphic options are not in the menu, I have no idea.How Does it Sound?Decent. While not the best audio work i've heard, the music is fitting to the level at hand and the eerie and strange tone of the game, while keeping that futuristic, techy feel. The sound effects are great, the clank of a falling cube, the destruction of a wall, the sound of platforms sliding/being activated, the impact of the player as he lands on the ground.Sadly, as mentioned before, the voicework is poor. Not only is it poorly acted, it feels very static when played and not mixed well into the overall sound of the game. For example, when you fall, Dax makes a yell/scream, but it's mastered so low you probably won't hear it unless you have headphones.Good game but flawed, needs work in quite a few areas. You'll get about 10 hours of gameplay your first run, and is enjoyable if just for the first time. However, wait for it to be on sale, $20 USD is a bit too much for this game, $12 feels more fair to the quality, content and length. Take it for what it is, and you'll enjoy it :)			"

												Magrunner is a game that uses gameplay mechanics similar to Portal, you use primary and alt fire buttons to control objects, namely magnetic objects. The puzzles can be fairly challenging and there is a story to follow with characters that show up throughout the game. The acting is a bit cheesy and the main character is too often yelling, but if you're into low-budget sci-fi then you might like this game.This game took me around 11 hours to complete.			"

												If you liked the puzzles in Portal, you'll probably like the puzzles here. I had a fair bit of fun solving them over ~8 hours of gameplay.Don't buy this expecting the personality that Portal has, though. No real humor. The plot makes no sense at all, and the script is pretty corny. Suprisingly, the voice acting wasn't bad, if melodromatic.All in all, a pretty good puzzle game. The Cthuluesque theme really didn't come into play until near the end of the game. It felt tacked on for 2/3, and then in the final 1/3, finally actually became a little more relevant as monsters were introduced. They were a reasonably difficult challenge, as you had to be quick in your reactions.			"

The magnetic gun creates a magnetic field -+ which you use on objects in a logic way to pass the puzzles.

												Have you ever wanted to save the world from the dark forces of Cthulu using nothing but your wits and a magnet gun? Then this might be just the game for you.First off it’s a puzzle platformer that’s very similar to portal but instead of wormholes it uses magnets to propel you around each stage. It takes a little getting used to but after a couple tries you’ll be an expert at it. The levels range from super easy to figure out to hair pullingly tricky, and with the addition of timed achievements there is a lot of replay value if you get stuck and miss the deadline. The gameplay is simple and fun allowing you to traverse the environment with ease and making you feel pretty clever when you figure things out.The characters are not the most developed but I enjoyed their interaction, as Spartan as they are. The world in which the game is set on the other hand is pretty interesting. A super corporation run by philanthropist billionaire who hopes to save the planet and explore deep space using magnets and his own version of Facebook, sure I’ll bite. And wouldn’t you know it; Cthulu gets summoned and crashes the party.The stage design is pretty awesome as well. It starts out in a giant clean and efficient facility specifically designed to test magnets, just as it should be before it all goes wrong and everything descends into chaos and disrepair. Then when you finally get settled with the creepy underbelly of the facility the game jumps the shark by teleporting you into space and surrounding you with monsters both petrified and living. All the while aforementioned Cthulu is ever present watching your every step along the way.Over all it’s not a perfect game but it is well worth buying if on sale or at full price if you love the genre. The game is fun, the world is interesting and the lore is pretty deep for a puzzle platformer. Portal this isn’t but it’s great none the less.Have Fun ^_^			"

Short preview: (+) Short puzzles. Easy to redo if you missed something. ✅  (+) Enough frequent checkpoints. ✅  (+) Good story and the main characters did a good voice acting. ✅  (+) No fall damage so, you can concentrate to slove the puzzle. ✅   (-) Chance to get headache ✗ (I had got three times.)  (-) Not exactly good fight actions. ✗ (It it matters to you, read below.)  (-) You may find the puzzles are too easy if you are smarter then ordinary players. For example me. ✗  Crashes / Bugs / Glitches:Only one time it frozen, in seventeen hours gameplay, when I replayed it. It seems it doesn't like to load too much maps without restart the game.  My personal opinion:Although, I had liked only two puzzle games in my life, the 'Soul Reaver' 1 and 2, but, something caught me in this game. I guess it's a puzzle game for ordinary players. I worried about the puzzles because I'm not too smart player. But, I could beat most puzzles. Only three times I cheated and watch a YouTube walkthrough video to see what is the solution. I found it I like to play lazily, release the mouse and keyboard and just watch the screen and thinking. It was a nice and good experience for me that how nice could be a FPS puzzle game. After I finished the game, I started again for I can concentrate only the story. It was also good to play it again, although I had already remembered the most puzzles. The story's atmosphere was a bit weird for me because of the puzzle part of the game. But, I didn't find it would have been bad. So, then it's good weird!  Recommendation:I recommend this game to those who;  Not hate the FPS puzzle games and want to try one.  Want to try a FPS puzzle game but, don't feel yourself enough smart or clever for it.  I guess I may recommend to those who like the puzzle games. I'm just not sure that a talented puzzle gamer would enjoy it or find it's boring easy. I don't know.  Like to play with magnetic!  Achievement hunting:All achievements unlocked well! Without any delay. The hardest achievement is the;  Chosen of CthulhuPass Act III without dying  It's easy to fall into the endless deep, which means die, or be killed by mystical creatures. But, if you know the trick, you could make it a bit easier.			"

												Who could 've thought, that we'll see another great puzzle game? Well here it is! Portal and Magrunner, briliance in it's best! And the best part of it; Cyberpunk meets Lavcraft mythos, and both at very high quality, Play this, if you like puzzle games like Portal and Cube, play this if you love Cyberpunk, play this if you like Lavcraft.

												Recomend. I started playing this game with GT610 and had to use lowest settings, but now I have GTX750Ti and decided to play it again. Graphics is great, especially on space levels. I am noob in gaming, but I really liked it (the graphics). Puzzles are hard sometimes, which I also liked. It's a bit scarry, as some levels have living things that can kill you. Overall, this was the second game after Portal that I really liked. Higly recommend, especially on the Summer sale!			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic puzzle platformer based on what I've played so far. It has already gotten mentally taxing in under an hour, and based on what others have said it's only going to get more challenging.Press the F button, though, and it will make a lot more sense.Also: You can press the mouse buttons repeatedly to skip dialouge. Not sure if it says that somewhere in game, but I didn't see it. It's very useful, though.			"

												Although some riddles are kind of fiddly and you smack your head against a wall several times, it is an enjoyable game. When the more...mysterious things happened  I screamed like the little girl I am and said I would never touched it....and was back at it after an hour or so. I recommend playing it in small segments, to get a break and come back with a fresh aproach for the more frustrating levels. Or  use the time to look at a guide, cause some essential things are easyly overlooked. And forget the  ""magnets of the same colour should reject each other"" thing-> maybe those arent magnets! Xander could have some mumbojumbo put into it! Great game, great story. Still I thought I would be able to play as different Magrunners but it wasn't such a letdown since Dax grows on you and you want to get him through this endless maze of madness.  If you liked Portal and Quantum Conundrum you should give Magrunner a try!			"

												It's Portal + Cyberpunk + Lovecraft. That probably sounds great, except it doesn't (and probably can't) have nearly the polish that Portal did. It follows the Portal formula closely enough that I was regularly comparing the two games mentally. This comparison doesn't really come out in Magrunner's favor, given that Portal is one of the best games ever made. However, the plot is somewhere between ""acceptable"" and ""interesting"", and the central game mechanic lends itself to creative and challenging puzzle design. Overall I recommend it, but I'd definitely wait for a sale.			"

												*** NO SPOILERS ***First off this is NOT a PORTAL clone. PERIOD.With that said, here is my first impression (as I have not played it all the way yet). Magrunner is a genre of first person puzzle games, similar to PORTAL. Like most of you, I was/am a PORTAL junkie. Preferred the 2nd one, but both were great. Then I played them again. Went looking for a clone, could not find one, then played some more. You know the song - sing along! LOL One of the clones I played and was instantly hooked (until I saw the end) was QUANTUM CONUNDRUM. Tough puzzles, very long game, very satisfying - at least until the end - I will alway hate the dev for doing that (no spoilers). So back to PORTAL i went :-), Then tried THE BALL - never finished it - did not have that - ""gotta move on"" motivation - so, back to another game of PORTAL (see, I'm a junkie). The first time I saw MAGRUNNER, I put it on NOT INTERESTED and moved on. It was the cover art that made it look stupid (IMO). And never looked back. Recent I was looking for a time-waster puzzle game - and would you know - MAGRUNNER came up! So as not to spoil the game, I only watched a few levels (2 to be exact) and just had to get the game.Once I got it, I knew I was hooked. Just like QC and PORTAL, it uses devices to solve puzzles. MAGRUNNER is more akin to PORTAL in that it only uses a binary mechanism, in this case a polarity gun. Using the gun you magnitize platforms and cubes to either attact, or repel or neutral.   This is what gives it that PORTAL feel. But that is as far as the PORTAL goes. The puzzles are ""weird"". I mean that in a good way. Farther you go, the more diabolical they get with no clues, and to make things worse, they put objects and hints that are wrong. So you REALLY have to use your noggin to figure them out. The weird part is, that when you do figure it out - they are ""kick-yourself-in-the♥♥♥♥♥quot; simple. Like DUH! simple. But one thing is for sure, these puzzles can be so hard, that there is a great sense of accomplishment when you do figure them out.Graphic wise is a mutt. While the eniroment is amazing, the biologicals just look stupid (to me).  The faceless (robot image not withstanding) GLADOS, made the character seem somewhat real, while in MAGRUNNER the people made me want to run and hide - they were just hideious. I would much rather prefer a loud speaker or intercome with ""voices"" speaking to you instead of those holigrams.  But thats just me, and it didnt really deter me from the game.I would say if your a PORTAL junkie (and who isnt), MAGRUNNER is a MUST HAVE! When you play it, it feels more like a compliment to PORTAL. All the while I was playing, I did not once feel like I was playing a PORTAL CLONE. It was natural.As far as the story, it feels forced to me. While GLADOS (and WHEATLY) got off on testers, and that was pretty much the premise, and QC you were just trying to find your uncle,  MAGRUNNER has a bizzare story. And it always felt like they were making the player ""feel"" what wasnt there. Rushed. To me, all the surprises were NOT. They were expected, or popped up for no reason, as you didnt know the history to understand the punchline.  There was no character devlopment. So I really didnt give too hoots about anyone, I had become a GLADOS - with a HURRY THE HELL UP AND GIMME THE NEXT CHALLENGE.  But thats OK, as I know they will fix that in the next release There will be one right?Anywyas, regardless of the price - you like QC and PORTAL - GET THIS! You wont be disappointed.			"

												This game left so deep a mark on me I felt compelled to write a review, for the first time. I would like to recommend the game, since a lot of work apparently went to it. Alas, I can not.After finishing, most of my memories of the game are of frustration and annoyance. I rarely do not finish a game I've started, and in the end I finished even this one, however not without a need of walkthroughs and a few day cool-down break from playing.Gameplay:The main gameplay mechanic is nice and easy to comprehend. There is almost no relation to how magnetims works in real world, buy that would hardly make for a fun game, so no problem there. The problem is that the the mechanics are quite apparently hacked on top of some physics engine, quite often don't make sense beyond the basic scenario (e.g. if you're catapulted on a top of a cube, and pick the cube mid-flight, you immediatelly lose all your momentum), or are downright broken (e.g. if you put two cubes on top of a catapult and leave the top one without a charge, the whole thing does not work). You're often reduced to trying all combinatorial options, because there is no telling how the components will interact without trying. Story:Taken as a Cthulhu mythos story, it's the worst I've seen, and, foremost, is not a horror. The high-tech sci-fi does not mix well with the eldritch. Also once the plot is revealed, there's not anything in the story to wait for.The story progresses by the main character shouting at some other characters via a hologram here and then, is ridicullously cheesy (""I've never told you the truth about what happend to your parents""), annoying and the game would be better without it in my opinion. The voice-over and the lines are so annoying that I was muting the sound in the later stages of the game to avoid it. There's one exception, and that's the narrator of the story. If the story was only third-person narrated, it would be also better off I think.Design:The worst problem of the game. First, there's no logic to the design and it shows fast---at one point you escape ""test rooms"" by exiting through a hole since the door are blocked by rubble. However, if the rubble was not there, the test would be pointless---you could have just easily leaved it. It's not a big problem but illustrates the bad design. There is no mental challenge to the puzzles. ""Wait, what, you said you needed a walkthrough"". Indeed, there are three other challenges:a) As already said, more complicated interactions do not make much sense (e.g. elevator field works only on the elevator platform, but the platform interacts with a cube) and suggest a lot of ""if-then"" programming. Then there are buttons, which are pretty much a joker element. You have no idea what they do until you press them. It could be anything. It could literally summon Cthlulhu in this game for what it's worth.b) Pixel-hunt. Some of the levels are easily 10000 square meters big or more. You know what is necessary for the level, but you can't do it, because there's some field emmiter hidden in the hole in the corner and you only see it if you stand at the right spot and look in the right direction. And you can't FRIGGIN' RUN. c) Jumps. Often you need to jump on small, sometimes tiny, moving objects and if you miss you have to walk from bottom back up. And you can't FRIGGIN' RUN.  d) ""You said three challenges"". Yes, but I was really annoyed about running. Most of the gameplay time I had was uselles walking. SLOW. Don't tell me that did not come up in the playtest. Hardly there was a feedback like  ""You know what I liked about your game? All the walking back from the start after missing a jump.""Graphics:Nice visual effects and nice models. The levels were build up from components, there's no ""soul"" to the individual levels or sense of progression on a small scale. On a big scale you have three completelly different environments, and they are nice. Shame that the game does not support selecting a GPU so I had to play it on the lowest setting since it auto-decided to render on the integrated co-processor of my CPU instead of my NVIDIA 660 GTX, but that's the least of the problems.Overall I can't shake the feeling that this game was created by some guy with money, who had all these *great ideas* and wanted all the *cool stuff* and totally had to be the lead designer, and got some skilled people people for that, who were ""if you wanna get you're wage, then shut up"" at any time they tried to point out that some things do not really work.

												You are tired of shooting a brown man but it’s fun to just run around and jump in first person so what do you do? You play Super Metroid Prime and Mirror’s Edge and Portal and then lament because you have to go back to simulating murder. Don’t get me wrong there are highlights to murder simulation but sometimes you want to play a pretty looking game and go HRMPH! when you jump or shoot something different.Magrunner: Dark Pulse stomps into the room and makes a brutal affront. Packed with shooting such things as platforms and jumping on them in beautiful First Person, Magrunner lives up to its name in every respect. You are in control of the Magrunner: a snarky kid with a knack for computer glove and jump voice clip. Pick up a cube unlike any indie cube you have ever picked up before in this year’s breakout Run-It-At-Full settings feast for the eyes and brain.Got stuck? STEAM OVERLAY your way to guides cheater (forget that early spiral level what’s that noise?) but consider thinking about it because the mind puzzle is a treat.Story & Talks: (no spoiler)The Magrunner is running and you experience what you think is portal. But surprise surprise it’s portal. And then it’s still portal? What an experience. Good voice acting. They bought a real microphone.Looks & Appeal:Pretty when it needs to be, which is usually. Gets dank.Arboretums and Grass: (As seen is Dank centerfold)Enjoy majestic foliage elevator that changes with your very mood!!!!! Gaze at the throbbing purple bud generators. Zero actual grass, really dropped the ball.Overall the Magrunner is a dank game and I nearly pooped myself when it was magnets and not magics.10/10 A++ Ornamental Horticulture -- Home & Garden MagazineLet’s see the skunk squad try to peep on this:3....   out of 5   --Xplay Magazine Show5/10    “sucks it ”*teabagging joke* *sidebar and ad larger than article*    --IGN6/10   “No hug pillow.

												(Minor spoilers ahead)This game is just Okay. There are much better Lovecraftian games than this and there are much better puzzle games than this. I am a big Lovecraft fan and I love all games Lovecraft. But this game just seems to ride on the Lovecraftian genre instead of adding anything to it. The story is underwhelming, however I must admit that it is really cool when♥♥♥♥♥♥starts to hit the fan and you hear some weird voices talk about Cthulhu. But other than that, the nouance dies out pretty quickly and becomes lackluster. Like I said prior, it doesn't add anything to the genre, it just abuses Lovecraftian fans to sell more copies.But this game is not bad, it is just nothing special. It mashes together lovecraft and magnetic puzzle game mechanics. The puzzles are hard at times which is nice but they get kind of boring and that is the whole gameplay, if your entire gameplay gets boring and your story is lackluster, then you don't have a very good game. There are also a few stupid things about the game. In case you did not know, magnets work by opposite polarities attracting. OPPOSITE! This game has the same (color) polarities attracting and the opposite (color) polarites repelling. That may be picky, but it is just really dumb and I cannot get over it. Also, at a certain point in the game (minor spoiler) you get to put the magnetic polarities anywhere you want to (rather than just changing the polarities of found objects) but the object it gives you when you shoot an area to put a polarity object there, is a ♥♥♥♥ing robot dog. It is so stupid. They ruined any horror aspect they had right there by putting a stupid♥♥♥♥♥robot dog WHERE EVER YOU SHOOT AT! The game Portal gave you a cool portal when you shot a wall, Magrunner gives you a robot dog. It is so dumb. Who's idea was it? ""Hey I know! lets make it so instead of something cool when they shoot their magblaster, lets have a ♥♥♥♥ing DOG appear every time they shoot at anything! haha it is soo ♥♥♥♥ing LOVECRAFTIAN!""Putting my rant about the stupid dog aside, this game is just all around disappointing. Get it if you really like puzzle games similar to portal. But do NOT get it if you are an H.P. Lovecraft fan, It is simply not worth your time nor money.			"

												I honestly would give this a neutral rating if I could. Steam needs a scale for reviews.6-7/10, depending on your preferences.This is basically Portal with magnets and Lovecraftian elements. The puzzles are decent, though there a few levels where you have to run from monsters while puzzling, which aren't all that enjoyable. The narrative was intriguing at first, but falls flat on its face with cliches and so-so voice acting. Lacks polish in certain aspects, but has good graphics and pretty solid gameplay.Overall, 80% of the levels were pretty fun with the other 20% being mildly annoying. I'd say play this if you like action puzzle games like Portal and/or if you love all things Cthulhu.Side note: if you're looking for puzzle games like this and Portal, I can't recommend The Talos Principle enough. Incredibly well designed and has an excellent narrative.			"

												It's obvious that this game was only playtested by the developers.  Outside of the very basic mechanics (magnetic attraction and repulsion), very few are adequately explained as they are introduced to the players: mirrors are introduced with just a cryptic image, block-powered magnetic fields aren't at all.  Unlike in, say, Portal or Quantum Conundrum, the environments are very visually busy, meaning that when something new is introduced, it's very easy to mistake as just part of the set dressing.  And overall, the game just isn't very fun to play.  You move infuriatingly slowly, meaning that when you inevitably need to backtrack to retreive a block you accidentally sent flying, the time you are in transit is longer than the actual time it takes to solve the puzzle.  The story seemed interesting, from the part I saw, and the voice talent was pretty good.  But my interest in how the story played out was swiftly outmatched by boredom and frustration.			"

												Portal-like mechanics and a cyberpunk setting meet the Cthulhu mythos. I must say, I was intrigued, especially since I had never heard of this game until a year after its release. I grabbed it on discount for less than a latte. I was surprised at the production value. For an indie crowd-funded game, the graphics surprised me and the gameplay was tight. I am a bit disappointed that it's over, but I will admit that for the price, you can't expect a 60-hour long game. It didn't seem like a rushed ending though, so I am left fulfilled. If I had to point at anything bad, it would be that some mechanics are not introduced before becoming crucial... so you can be left in a position that you simply do not know what to do, especially when they add a time factor. On a few occasions, I had to turn to a walkthrough just to get an idea on what I am missing and then I would be good for a couple more levels.			"

												This is a fun little environmental puzzle game that borrows from some of the puzzle solving traits of Portal. The environments are pretty unique and the graphics are very nice. Controls felt perfect using Mouse and Keyboard. The story and dialogue are somewhat disjointed and the main character seems to be a bit bi-polar with his relationships to the NPC's who constantly seem to want to talk to him. That said, it gets the job done and mostly explains the change in environments.  If you're in the mood for a fun puzzler, check it out. I had a lot of fun playing it.			"

												Magrunner exists to make you appreciate Portal.  Yes, the graphics are good, and yes, the magnets are an interesting gameplay mechanic, but the storytelling is thoroughly second rate.  Unskippable cutscenes are everywhere, character development is worse than flat (some of my allies are actually repulsive), and the voice acting and dialogue are clumsy (no one talks like that).  This game has less emotional impact than a companion cube.  I'm left feeling that Cthulu is a crutch, an almost desperate way to try to make me care about the story by using someone else's cool ideas hoping they rub off.Even trying to put up with the story, the gameplay left me frustrated.  It's a steep learning curve, and again because of poor delivery: they just expect you to know things.  Trial and error can only get you so far when you have to perform yet another new maneuver they haven't taught you.  Recipe for frustration.After a couple hours of Magrunner all I could think was how much I wanted to go back and play Portal instead.  So I did.			"

												Nice ! The story is so so....but the puzzles are quite cool. Basically, mix the mechanics of Portal and Q.U.B.E. together, add Unreal Engine 3, try to put some crazy story together and you have magrunner.The magnet interactions were a nice change from the portals or the stuff you found in Quantum Conundrum. In a way, Magrunner is still different from all the others. It is no masterpiece but it is definitely a good puzzle game. Enemies will also come in some levels to put you some pressure, and the puzzles change enough to keep you interested. The story though (if there is one) is what it is....but better than nothing I guess, and the game has still atmosphere and is polished enough to be enjoyed. 12 Hours to play everything and get every trophy. Get this cheap and go past the beginning that looks a bit lame. 72/100			"

												Magrunner = Portal with a Cthulu story. Sorry but it just is. Magrunner is nowhere nearly as superbly designed and polished as Portal, but it is a very solid effort.Visuals are good and the story is not bad. The puzzles are interesting because of the novel ""magnetic fields"" (but weirdly work the opposite way of real world magnets) - unfortunately sometimes the puzzles do tend to cross the thin ""unfair"" line  (eg. puzzle pieces are usually subtely hidden) - then again some puzzle fanatics love that ( i don't until i solve the puzzle and then I might). This one is for people who can't get enough of Portal or who simply love interesting FPS puzzle games.			"

												Magrunner is ♥♥♥♥ing garbage that tries to ride Portal's ""physics are cool, right?"" with generous helping of Cthulhu mythos' ""Old ones and tentacles are scary!"" and then proceeds to♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed by being terrible with both.Now, take a look at those screenshots. Artstyle looks colorful, yet clear perhaps? Level design seems to have it's own distinct style while still managing to hint where you are supposed to go maybe? Well enjoy it for about 15 minutes it lasts, then it's sewer levels all the way down. If you spent money on this game, hopefully you thought that Bloodlines' sewer level was pinnacle of level design because oh boy, do we got linear sewer tunnels for you to walk and carry boxes around in.After a short jog through the sewer tunnels, you'll emerge into massive rooms, still in sewers and wish you could go back to the tunnels because for all their faults, at least it was clear where you had to go. Not so in sewer rooms where any given rotting catwalk or brown smudge can be the ledge towards which you must hop.The game also doesn't bother teaching you mechanics at all. While Portal would present a mechanic, let you familiarize yourself with it, show it again in puzzle or two and so on until you have mastered it and are flying across the gaps at mach 1, Magrunner on other hand just drops you in front of a puzzle and lets you wander around in confusion. Now before you fly off screaming ""Finally! A game designed for a thinking man instead of a tiny baby!"", take note that the solution is usually shooting up anything that looks new to see what it does and/or spotting the hidden box/button/brown smudge behind the dark ledge. More than physics puzzle, Magrunner is hidden object game.Only place where the game bothers to explain anything is the loading screen tips. Thankfully, there's plenty of these as the game is apparently incapable of loading more than a single room at the time.But certainly what a game like this needs, is good physics engine. Magrunner seems to draw it's inspiration from other highly popular games for it's physics modelling. Namely, Bad Rats and Transformice. Fifth time in row when you try to use the moveable platforms to guide a box into place you need and instead cause it to rocket around the room at mach 1 when you activate the magnets, chant 'Eye of the Tiger' and draw strength from your Bad Rats King achievement. Perhaps all this could be avoided if you could throw the boxes or at least jump with them but that probably would have resulted a puzzle where you have to throw them across the room and have them stay on a ledge so perhaps it's for the best. This also ties wonderfully into the horror part of the game, as when you realize that you have to jump all the way down to the start to pick up the box and then realize that not only you have to climb the whole puzzle again, you first have to walk around the room pulling all the platforms into place because nothing resets on it's own, you will understand the futility of it all and welcome the return of the Great Old Ones. Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn, please eat the people responsible for the sewer puzzles last.Also, when the game advertizes itself as ""game in which technology confronts the Cthulhu Mythos, as imagined by author, H. P. Lovecraft."", I personally imagined that the horror would be slow to reveal itself, manifesting as subtle changes in the world, haunting whispers from seemingly nowhere, impossible environments. Things that at first make you question your memory, then your eyes and finally your sanity. Mad, horror filled run to desperately escape the maze that is the Cube and you are the rat, only for that last mind shattering revelation that getting out is escape from nothing and all you have managed in getting back to society is to find slightly bigger trap to die in. Instead, what we get is *static*CTHULHU FHTAGN*static* from radio almost as soon as we are past front doors and then a Deep One runs in and punches you into♥♥♥♥♥♥So overall, bad game, ♥♥♥♥ me for wasting 10$ on this♥♥♥♥♥			"

												OH, I hated to give this game a thumbs down. The first part if fantastic!Let me explain. The first part of the game is a Puzzle Game and the second part is an arcade game.For those of you that don't know the difference, I'll explain.A Puzzle game (PUZZLE) gives you a situation that is placed in front of you to solve. You have all of the information that you need up front and you can take your time to intellectualy solve the puzzle.A simple example are the kinds of puzzles on MillerWorldInc.An Arcade game on the other hand is a puzzle of sort BUT it doesn't give you all of the information up front. They were designed to make people keep putting quarters into a video game machine to ""Keep Trying Things Over and Over"" in order to figure out what the Software Designer wanted you to do.Does the Mario Brothers ring a bell?And OVER and OVER is the key word here. The second part of what could have been a fantastic game is reduced to the repetitive Trial and Error crap that was designed into the arcade machines of the past who's main function was to keep you putting quarters into the machine to learn just a little more each time before you were killed by whatever.And this is where Magrunner falls Very Short for puzzle solving people.Like I said, in the beginning you are presented with puzzles for your mind to solve.By the end it unfortunately just turns into an adolescent arcade game.BUT>>>For the few bucks that they are asking, I would still advise PUZZLE PEOPLE to buy the game and just play it until it turns into an arcade game because I think you will still enjoy the beginning which will bring you hours of entertainment.

												In terms of gameplay Magrunner is a solid puzzle platformer with a very polished feel and nice artstyle.In terms of story Magrunner is a B-game. Sub-par voice acting, Ludonarrative dissonance, Disjointed pacing, Corny writing, Clichés and an overall lack of originality. However, if you like that sort of thing or If you are the sort of person who doesn't care about story and just want to play a good puzzle platformer; This game if for you.			"

												Finally finished this. Pretty good game, but the puzzle mechanics don't feel as intuitive (at least for me) as other games in the genre like Portal or The Turing Test. I found myself, mostly on the later levels, looking up a tutorial video only to smack myself because it seems so obvious in retrospect. The physics aspects of the game don't really help here, though they are generally pretty good with the exception of a few annoyances (like the platforms on circular tracks).Other reviews mentioned it, and yes, two or three levels at the end have you running away from monsters. Even though it fits with the plot (it would be weird if you never ran into them), it doesn't work very well with the game mechanics. Those levels are not puzzles like the rest, but obstacle courses with a big tentacly time limit. Luckily, there are only enough of them to remind you that the minions of C'thulu are still around... But I still feel it detracts from gameplay rather significantly.Someone also mentioned having to dodge insta-death on the last level... It's really not so bad. All you have to do is  place Newton when he throws a bomb, it'll get deflected no problem. "

												Good portal-like game with an interesting twist. It is not a portal ripoff/copycat, but a new take on the first person puzzle game genre.Warning : in the late levels of the game, there are ""fights"" and ""platforming"" elements, and you don't have as much time to observe and think as in the earlier levels, so don't expect a quiet puzzle solving walk in the park all the way through.

												As far as fictional trope genres go, horror is a close number two to my love for scifi (sorry fantasy).  Anything from slasher to paranormal usually gets me excited and interested, and one genre of horror I've always been in general orbit around is Lovecraftian.  Due to a lack of bandwidth or maybe just poor choices on my own part, I've only dabbled in this area of horror, but have a pretty good idea of how some of the more popular concepts and characters work (spawning all KINDS of shoggoths in Super Scribblenauts back on the Nintendo DS!).  Magrunner: Dark Pulse starts out as the gleaming, pretty, Mirror's Edge style universe, with nods to Tesla and Facebook all over the place, that after the first hour or so quickly devolves into this grimy, rusted, supernatural, Lovecraftian romp.  I almost kind of wish they hadn't peeled away the fancy futurist style so quickly, because aside from the early and late chapters, you're left with this rust tinted, more decayed set of maps.  The futurist stuff was probably the prettiest part graphically, and using it so minimally just didn't do the assets justice.  The level designers could have taken some more nods from the Portal series and slowly peeled back those layers (remember how crazy those last few levels of Portal were?).  The final levels are just crazy and wild and nonsensical, and will tickle anyone's Cthulu curiosity if only briefly.Speaking of Portal, as a first person puzzle game with different rooms/puzzles/chambers/situations for each level, there will always be a lot of comparisons to what many will argue is the best benchmark for this type of genre.  Mechanically speaking, the idea of using attracting and repelling magnetic fields on props in the map sounds like a simple binary solution mechanic you find in the Portal series (blue and orange portals vs red and blue magnetic fields), but Magrunner's difficulty curve turns it up to 11 as the narrative proceeds, so if you're looking for a challenge: Have. At. It.  Magrunner actually implements the one thing I always craved in a Portal game though, in that there are levels where you have to outwit enemy AI and cause their untimely demise using your magnetic glove and props on the map.  This is a lot different from the stationary turrets of Portal-land, and can be a lot more intense when the oogie-boogie is trying to grab you relentlessly if you miss that jump.    The story has a basic setup for why the protagonist is doing what he's doing, and dives into the ""what the heck even?"" of being thrown into the mix with a Cthulu-death-cult that comes as the standard reaction for anyone who hasn't been exposed to this sort of stuff.  There's nothing outstanding about the narrative, the cut scenes in between acts are told via animated paintings and get the jist of the basic plot across in small bite-sized pieces, while virtual interactions with NPC's do the rest of the heavy lifting in that regard.  The universe itself has some interesting pieces that never quite get explained, like why magnets to do what the Zuckerberg anagrammed benefactor aims to do?  Or what's the deal with mutants in this society?  What happened to the other testing candidates? And what even happened to put Earth into the state its in (to avoid spoilers) after the last level for the epilogues final cut scene?  Maybe if I was more up and up on Cthulu stuff the ending would make more sense, but I've become used to accepting the wtf endings that horror narratives provide so I'll leave it.If you're big on Lovecraftian themes, or are looking for a challenging first person puzzle game with a unique and challenging set of puzzle mechanics, be sure to give this a look when its on sale.  If you're only here for the story you'd be better served looking elsewhere.  As it stands, I can't hold any of the games flaws against it TOO hard, since it does most of what its trying to do competently, and it has a really weird mix of genres in a single place I wasn't expecting to find in the first place.

												This game is boring and low hanging fruit at every level. There's no real sense of suspense, the puzzles are disappointingly obvious. Several times during gameplay you'll find yourself trying to set up some kind of real interesting interaction between world elements only to realize that what you actually have to do is once again ride a platform in a straight line to the obvious exit. I was attacked by fish monsters in a cutscene I guess, but the game is nowhere near as action packed as any of the promotional material would have you believe. Combat is non-existent and the monsters, such as they are, represent no threat to the player.Extremely boring.			"

												This game is a FPS puzzler and has the look and feel of portal but not the excution,humour and story.I will get to the story first which is completely bizzare where you are one of the choosen 7 to complete a set of puzzles to go to space and after about 7 levels all Hell breaks lose and the story starts referencing cthulu. It is complete bonkers. I did not pay anyatention to the story not that I do generally for games but this one I completely ignored.The game has a great atmosphere though sanitised lab environments at the start and hellish atmosphere a complete contrast after about 1 hour in the game.I liked the atmosphere and creepiness of the later levels.Now coming to the gameplay which basically has just one mechanic where you have a glove of sorts and you can magnetise objects,demagnetise them. There are 2 colours for the left and right mouse button and like colours attract and unlike repel.Thats about it you use that to pull platforms,levitate objects to get to your destination. there are a few other obvious mechanics introduced very early and in between there are enemies introduced and other objects like switches,exploding blocks and so on. The game does not explain any of the new objects but it is pretty easy to figure things out.Coming to the puzzles there are relatively simpe and no walkthroughs should be needed. With the mechanics so bare bones it is simple to figure things out. My biggest gripe with this game is that the game is too long and becomes boring after 3 hours or so as the same thing has to be done over and over again and no new core mechanic is introduced at all. The game should have been 3-4 hours at max but it stretches to about a 8-10 hour walkthrough. Playing this game continuoulsy is not recommended as it gets very repetitive and boring. I would recommend this game in short playthroughs.The last few levels introduces some enemies which you have to think fast and solve the puzzles but they are very very simple to figure out.Recommended to people who like puzzle game but are not looking for a significant challenge and are okay with short playthroughs.

												In a world where everyday physics puzzlers are commonplace, Magrunner tries to fit in. As you might be able to tell from the title, Magrunner is a game about Magnetism. A funky, everything-works-opposite-of-reality magnetism, but magnetism nonetheless. Much like Portal has two different portals (an in and an out) Magrunner has two polarities (Red and Green). Like polarities attract and opposites repel. There are also two different SHAPES of charges. Most items have a spherical charge but a couple of items have a cylindrical charge. By manipulating the items' charge you move around the environment trying to get to the end. Fairly simple, right?Well, not exactly. The puzzles, for the most part, fall into three categories: blindingly obvious and boringly simple, frustratingly obtuse, and frustratingly obtuse until you've solved it and realized that it's actually quite remarkably elegant (you just solved it in the hardest way possible).The last two I lay entirely on the feet of the developers. Where Portal taught the player each mechanic in a multi-step process, where it would be hard to fail to notice the specific technique they were teaching you. Magrunner doesn't. In fact the puzzles often throw several new concepts at you within a single puzzle with absolutely no indication of what's supposed to be done. Sure, if you watched the trailer you'd recognize the cube whose sides are independent of each other and can thus be ""opened"". But the one time you see it in-game before being tasked to use it in a puzzle is from the INSIDE. In a location where you cannot see the cube together or even, really, the sides at all. This is but ONE mechanic and ALL of the mechanics are equally poorly communicated.That's not to say the game isn't fun. When the puzzles come together and you manage to see the steps to solve it they can be great fun. There's a lot of potential here; it's just up to the developers to learn how to educate the player as clearly and effectively as Valve did with Portal.If I have any other complaints it's that it's just too long. The game overstays its welcome by about a third of its length. There are 36 puzzles, many of which can be quite involved and take some time to figure out. If the game were 20-25 puzzles long it would be a perfect length (about as long as Portal was). As it is I had to push myself to finish the final ten(ish) levels.I'd also like to call out one of the later levels: this game has the best ""running"" level since Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth's second level. Seriously, get in a groove in that level and go.			"

												This is a game for those that like Portal and Portal 2, a decent plot and a gameplay mechanic revolving around magnetic polarity. Might not be on the same scale as Portal 2 but...what do you expect for a game that costs 1/2 as much as Portal 2 when it was first released?!It also has a few Doom 3 ""scare"" moments, so this is not for the faint hearted or those with health problems that are made worse by ""Jump scares"" or similar plot devices.It does ease you into it before it gets challenging, don't expect a sharp near-vertical ""Dark Souls"" type difficulty curve.For those that are into First Person Puzzle games, go buy this.

												This is a puzzle/horror game which I really enjoyed. Take your time solving the puzzles and sit back and enjoy the atmosphere.I just want to set something straight: A lot of people are comparing this to Portal, except this game doesn't deal anything with portals. It's got its own approach of using magnets. The only similarity between the two is that they're both first person puzzler/platformers. I just wanted to make that clear.I only wished this game had a time attack mode or something to make the 2nd and 3rd playthroughs more interesting/challenging. Oh well, but it was definitely a fun distraction.- Edited for spoilers.			"

												Did you like Portal? How about Antichamber? QUBE? Quantum Conundrum? I could go on... Magrunner: Dark Pulse is one in a large recent trend of first-person puzzlers, where guns are not so much taken out, but repurposed to do something other than kill♥♥♥♥♥♥But what sets M:DP apart from these and other titles?M:DP's puzzle element is ""magnetism"", you give metal objects in your environment (all suspiciously orange, for easy identification) one of two charges (coloured either red or green). Like charges attract, opposites repel. While being the opposite of how the actual forces of magnetism function, it makes sense in terms of game-play. It would be much more confusing if opposing colours attracted, and the similar colours repelling. So you have the perfect set up for lots of Portal and QUBE style puzzle rooms, but, as usual, things don't stay confined within test chambers for very long.Unlike the reliance on humour in Portal and Quantum Conundrum, M:DP's hook is a futuristic narrative with a Lovecraftian horror twist, and it works pretty well. You begin as a superstar test subject, go on to discover crazy cultist conspiracies, and often provide a mobile snack for some very fishy monsters. Questions of sanity vs. the horrific truth arise often, and in the end you are left wondering.So the downside? The physics are quite temperamental. The mix magnetism and momentum work in some quite jerky ways depending on the strength of the force and the speed you travel. Try and create a makeshift elevator too close to a repelling force, and you can be catapulted into a pond of deep-one infested water. Yes, you will die often, but frequent quick-saves prevent too much irritation.In terms of difficulty, some puzzles are devilishly tricky, despite often simple solutions. I had to use a guide for a couple of puzzles that stumped me. The game is quite long, with roughly 35-odd puzzles, taking me roughly 11 hours. It can keep you entertained/frustrated for quite some time.On the whole, Magrunner felt that it was outstaying its welcome during the first half of the game, which spends too long with similar kinds of puzzles (possibly a similar feeling for anyone that has played Portal 2). However, the second half gets a bit meatier and much more dangerous. If you stick with it, you end up with a puzzler that is quite fun, challenging and rather hair-raising.			"

												Comparisons to Portal have always been inevitable, but I wish they had learned from Valve somewhat as far as the puzzles are concerned. I've found them to be fairly inconsistent - you can have one map that's hairpulling-ly inscrutable and then one that's babby's first block puzzle. They also seem to introduce concepts without giving the player any idea of how to interact with them or what they do. Also, the magnetic effects seem to be somewhat unpredictable, in a way - platforms will still drift if they're neutral; using a  jump pad with two boxes launches you high rather than wide, etc. It really does seem difficult sometimes to gauge how different cubes and platforms will work together whether they're red, green, or neutral.In a change from Portal, you can interact with monsters - and by ""interact,"" I mean that they will try to chase you and kill you. At first I didn't care for it, because it didn't seem apropos for a pure puzzle game to add ""running away from monsters"" into the mix, but it actually adds a bit of interest and it doesn't happen that often anyways. The Lovecraftian stuff is done quite well. Like Portal, you start off with pristine, shiny test maps and then start moving down into collapsing, disheveled environments. Except in Magrunner, they're that way because of eldritch horrors busting into the world. It's quite creepy and effective. I also like that you can fall from any height without dying (as long as it's not into a bottomless pit). The voice acting is completely cheesy, though. All in all, I'd say it's worth checking out if it's on sale but some of the puzzles may frustrate.			"

												You can't help but think of this as Portal with Cthulhu. Few mechanics are the same (surreal puzzles, no fall damage, focusing on the effects of inertia under surreal conditions, etc) but atmospherically it is very different but equally as great. The puzzles at times are difficult because it isn't clear what is and isn't possible, trial and error.Short like Portal, fun like Portal. Different enough to not feel like custom Portal maps.			"

												Portal-like game with a twist: Cthulhu's minions take over the testing facility and you have to survive. It's a nice and fresh little addition really, and since I didn't read about the game before playing it came out of nowhere when they appeared ingame. Great puzzles, challenging levels, and a nice atmosphere. Recommended if you liked Portal and Quantum Conundrum.			"

												Very interesting and intricate game.Obviously heaevily Portal inspired, but not so much in an obnoxious way.Either way, it is a great game, very enjoyable and rewarding.I don't think this game gets enough credit. Perhaps if it was made by a more experienced set of developers, had a better, smoother engine, and a more original storyline, it would get a lot more notoriety.			"

												Magrunner is one of those games you can't quite fathom unless you have actually played it.  A lot of people have compared it to the acclaimed Portal series, rightfully so.  Both of them give the player command of an odd two-mode device that interacts with the environment to create solutions to get past various puzzles in each level.  Even so, in reality, Magrunner and Portal have more differences than similarities.  Magrunner puts you in charge of a device that toggles positive and negative polarity.  There is no teleporting in this game, which constrains the player a little by how magnetic polarities interact within each level design.  However, the developers actually built in more than one solution into many levels, which are particularly innovative, given the tools available to the player.  The storyline, although not very complex, is well devloped and interesting.  Of course, the H.P. Lovecraft source material goes miles to add interest to what could have ended up being a fairly mundane plotline.  For that reason, fans of Lovecraft will almost invariably love Magrunner.  Even those who have no exposure to his works will find the story interesting.It's difficult not to notice the haunting music and top not look and feel to the game as well.  Immersion is at a premium here.  The developers went to great lengths to bring solid, convincing graphics to the table.  I can't imagine anyone would disagree that their efforts show many fold.  The game absolutely screams virtual reality, and I couldn't stop from thinking during the first half how amazing it would look to play this with the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift.I would have to say the length is just about right as well.  However, if it weren't for some really creative puzzles in the last act of the game, some might get bored of the setting.  Personally, I didn't think it was a problem, as the puzzles are so well done in the last half, my attention never even once waned.  I also felt like the difficulty was just about right.  I like a good challenge, and although there were a couple of moments in the game where I almost turned toward a walkthrough, I stuck it out and was able to solve all of them without help.The game is also enhanced by a changing environment that keeps adding new problems to solve and fresh moments of tension that do not feel like constant deja vue like they do in games like Doom 3 where the lights go out, a wall falls, and monsters jump out.  Instead, Magrunner takes you on an epic ride where you are constantly trying to figure out what's going on while staying out of trouble.  Overall, Magrunner combines a number of winning elements into something that feels suprisingly creative and new.  It is a game I would recommend everyone try, and those who mesh with the gameplay will agree with me that Magrunner deserves honorable mention in a sea of new releases that often feel like nothing more than a glorified version of a previous game.

												This game started out lame enough; another portal clone/alternate with overdone voice-overs, lazy looping speach animations for characters (even when they only appear on-screen) and a whiney main character, Dax. also an ill-explained backstory and poor characterisation early on despite the extremely lengthly opening cinematic.The graphics are nice, the colours are... interesting, and the level design is actually really decent. It's a pretty-looking game, and the puzzles are genuinely fun and at times honestly challenging.The first few levels were easy enough, adding new mechanics only one at a time so you still have a chance at solving the puzzles without getting too lost. The ""guy in charge"" insults our main character Dax a lot in the early levels and he responds under his breath with a few of his own whitty come-backs, giving the game a light-hearted feel from the beginning. But just when you start to feel like you're rubbing your new found skills in the face of your doubters, the games's tone takes a complete 180. You go from being made to feel like you're being treated like a child, to the organisers of these challenges begging you to save them. This game got real dark, real fast.This game is creepy if you're already aware of the cthulu mythos, and potentially moreso if you aren't since your imagination can fill in the blanks then. There's suspense, chase-scenes, high-pressure challenges while you're being chased, and tunnel mazes filled with beasts in a Minotaur and labrynth style. Solving challenges in space with cthulu chanting from above while a creature from the deep is speed-walking ever closer to punch me to death from behind with its bare fin-hands is not my forte, so for me some parts of this game got feircely challenging, while other parts felt dissapointingly easy.So in summary; this game has a good foundation, fun levels ranging from ""was-that-really-it?"" to ragequit material, pretty graphics, over-acting that kinda grows on you, situational horror that's worse the more you know, and moderately difficult levels.Definitely worth your money, this game certainly met my expectations.

No guns, no way to defend yourself except using the environment, a very creepy atmosphere, occasional terror and running away, all while slowly going insane. I would recommend it.			"

												TLDR An uninspired portal clone with boring gameplay. Spits in the face of lovecraft and his works. Gameplay - Like portal if you stripped out all fun and creativity. The puzzles are a slow chore. The mechanics are awkward and tend to be either overly simple or frustratingly finicky. The majoritfy of gameplay revolves around slow moving platforms. It's like someone designed the magnet mechanics and realized you couldn't make any interesting puzzles with them after the fact. Story -  Fails to deliver on every count. Terrible acting. It attempts to work in the cthulhu mythos and fails to capture what makes lovecrafts' work interesting. Easily the most underwhelming portrayal of cthulhu and his related themes I've ever seen. South park did a better job. All information is given as exposition dumps. Characters seem to change personalities at random. Visuals - This is really dissapointing because the game starts strong. The bright, colorful aesthetic of the first thirty minutes is very appealing, with cool lighting and reflections. It tries to do the same trick as portal though, and the rest of the game has the ""behind the scenes plumbing"" look. This means a lot of drab for the majority. The outer space stuff at the end looks good in screenshots but is ugly and stiff in practice.			"

												Magrunner is similar to Portal, in that both are puzzle platformers with one central game mechanic that is used both to get through levels and (occasionally) defeat or avoid enemies.  But that's where the similiarites end.  Magrunners is set in an interesting future utopia (or dystopia, depending on your point of view).  It's early visuals are appropriately bright and cheerful for the setting.   However, as the game progresses this  gives way to horrific landscapes and an unsettling atmosphere.  Magrunner delves fairly deeply into tropes of the Cthulhu mythos, but combining it's cultists and nightmare creatures with a futuristic setting and puzzle platforming creates something fresh.  The art direction is fantastic, and the Lovecraft inspired creatures and settings are appropriately unsettling and awe-inspiring.  The few characters you interact with are interesting, and their voice acting is fairly good.   That being said, your interactions with these characters are  fairly limited.  Magrunner creates an interesting world and characters, but it feels like you barely scratch the surface of exploring either.  On the birght side, that leaves lots of material for a sequel.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  I reccomend it to any fans of puzzle games, platformers, or HP Lovecraft.			"

												Comparisons to Portal have always been inevitable, but I wish they had learned from Valve somewhat as far as the puzzles are concerned. I've found them to be fairly inconsistent - you can have one map that's hairpulling-ly inscrutable and then one that's babby's first block puzzle. They also seem to introduce concepts without giving the player any idea of how to interact with them or what they do. Also, the magnetic effects seem to be somewhat unpredictable, in a way - platforms will still drift if they're neutral; using a  jump pad with two boxes launches you high rather than wide, etc. It really does seem difficult sometimes to gauge how different cubes and platforms will work together whether they're red, green, or neutral.In a change from Portal, you can interact with monsters - and by ""interact,"" I mean that they will try to chase you and kill you. At first I didn't care for it, because it didn't seem apropos for a pure puzzle game to add ""running away from monsters"" into the mix, but it actually adds a bit of interest and it doesn't happen that often anyways. The Lovecraftian stuff is done quite well. Like Portal, you start off with pristine, shiny test maps and then start moving down into collapsing, disheveled environments. Except in Magrunner, they're that way because of eldritch horrors busting into the world. It's quite creepy and effective. I also like that you can fall from any height without dying (as long as it's not into a bottomless pit). The voice acting is completely cheesy, though. All in all, I'd say it's worth checking out if it's on sale but some of the puzzles may frustrate.			"

												First of all I would like to get the big elephant in the room out of the way.Many people will tell you that this is a reinterpretaion of Portal, and while I can see where they are coming from I disagree.  This is strongly inspired by Portal 2, and to me that is a big difference.  In Portal one it was a puzzle game that gave you flexability to solve the room puzzles creatively, with some solutions being better, faster, or more fun.  In one case the devs even purposely left in a clever shortcut to practically skip one room through a very clever trick.  In Portal 2 the puzzles are set with one solution, sometimes letting you do parts of that solution in a diffrent order, but essentially only one solution will pass the room.  This is the puzzle design in Magrunner.  It doesn't make it bad, but in my opinion, like Portal 2, it scores lower than it would.Unlike Portal, which has AMAZING voice acting and writing, MagRunner has Good or OK Voice Acting and Writing.  The script could have used allot of work, but is not bad or terrible.  If you can suspend your disbelief it is still entertaining.The Art style is sometimes very unique and at other times looks like a mod to turn another game into Portal 2.  Soem examples of content inspired by other things is the ""Mag Glove"" your character uses, which is inspired by the demon summoning glove Rasputin wielded in the first Hellboy Movie.  Another is the catpults from Portal 2.  The puzzle design, a bit poor in some places, was fun and diffrent enogh from ""Thinking with Portals"" that at my  first sitting I was finding myself wanting to do room after room.There will be solutions that will make you groan, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way.I like this kind of game and the beautymarks cancel out the warts enough that I can just go by the quality of the actual gameplay, which is pretty good, so I recoment this			"

Sometimes frustrating as the later levels give no hints when introducing new ""gizmos"", but still nice.The story on the other hand was not engaging and quite confusing. The voice acting was ok, but the lines were poor. The npc's in the ""holo"" communicator was so cheaply animated (just one animation loop used for everything) they might been better if they just used a static image instead; then I could have imageined them as real people.It feels like the spent a lot of time creating an interesting puzzle game, then rushed to add some kind of storyline, add some very thin characters that I didn't care about at all.Still if you like puzzle games like portal, I still recommend it; just don't expect to be impresed by the storyline.

												The following is a quick overview of Magrunner: Dark Pulse for a full review please check out my website at - {LINK REMOVED}http://ausiejamster.wix.com/ausiesgamingzone#!magrunner-dark-pulse/clx1Magrunner: Dark Pulse is a singleplayer only first-person shooter puzzle game where you must you brains over brawn to overcome obstacles in your path. The platforms the game is currently available from includes PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. Finally Magrunner: Dark Pulse is the only game of the series. The modelling, texturing and animation are very impressive even if there was an issue within one of the cut-scenes. The music is also pretty solid even if it isn't too my liking. The voice acting, however, is very good but also has some issues in some areas. The storyline of the game is pretty damn solid and gives the game quite a bit of depth while at the same time being quite believable. The content hasn't ever been updated and probably never will be, however, it is very polished and there is no bugs or glitches that I have found within it. Therefore, updates and DLCs aren't really needed unless they wish to add any new content. As the game is also available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 the PC version does offer full controller support. The difficulty within the game is actually pretty tough, and therefore, the puzzles take some thinking and planning adding massive play time within the game. Normally puzzle games become repetitive after a while but the addition of Magtech glove upgrades, Magrunner: Dark Pulse becomes not only harder after the completion of each objective but a little different which also massive increases play time of the game and player satisfaction. As Magrunner: Dark Pulse is only a single player game the only way for the game to be competitive is for players to compete with speed runs. Overall I gave the game a 7.8/10 final rating as there are very little flaws within the game and it is very well developed. I think Magrunner: Dark Pulse is a very welcome addition to the first-person shooter family but its difficulty and lack of advertising may of hurt its popularity.			"

												The first thing you have to know about Magrunner:Dark Pulse is that it falls into the 'First person puzzle-platformer, with a twist' category that has become so popular since the release of Portal. I'm talkin' Antichamber, QUBE, Quantum Conundrum, Twin Sector... the list goes on. If you aren't a fan of that style of game, I doubt you'll enjoy this.That being said, Magrunner is an extrodinarily impressive take on the puzzle genre. The core 5-10 hours of gameplay revolve around using a special glove to influence objects through magnetic-like properties. You have red and green charges (or red and blue if you choose). Same-charged objects attract, while different-colored objects repel. So basically the opposite of actual magnetism. Surprisingly, there are an impressive number of interesting, brain-busting puzzles you can create with this simple mechanic.Beyond that, much like Portal, there's an overarching story that unfolds beyond the simple test chamber in which you begin your story. That's where the similarities to Portal start to decline, to its detriment. Whereas in Portal, humor and intrigue act in tandem between segments of puzzle-solving, Magrunner focuses primarily on intrigue through Lovecraftian horror, feeding you bits of the unfolding story while you work from one area to the next. While this could work in a story with a number of twists and turns, the plot isn't that deep, so it can be a little boring when you're working between sections of the game. The voice acting itself is a little flat at parts, and the music (if there was any) was so forgettable that I legitimately can't remember if there was music. It also can be a bit buggy, such as when the final boss just stood there pointing at a block half-way through the battle, leaving me to wreck everything unopposed. Oh, and achievement hunters? Most of 'em are easy pickings, but there's one achievement that is REALLY hard to complete. You'll know it when you see it.Point is, if you're a fan of the puzzle-platforming genre, and perhaps a fan of Lovecraft, you'll find quite a bit to enjoy about this game. I'd almost say grab it at full price, but maybe wait for a bit of a discount.			"

It definitely wears its Portal influence on its sleeve, but adds some new twists, and notably an interesting story (I'm looking at you, Q.U.B.E. Though I haven't played the Director's Cut, maybe that added more narrative...). Highly recommended (so far) if you enjoyed the Portal games, and doubly so if you're a Lovecraft/Cthulhu fan!			"

												This is a game for those that like Portal and Portal 2, a decent plot and a gameplay mechanic revolving around magnetic polarity. Might not be on the same scale as Portal 2 but...what do you expect for a game that costs 1/2 as much as Portal 2 when it was first released?!It also has a few Doom 3 ""scare"" moments, so this is not for the faint hearted or those with health problems that are made worse by ""Jump scares"" or similar plot devices.It does ease you into it before it gets challenging, don't expect a sharp near-vertical ""Dark Souls"" type difficulty curve.For those that are into First Person Puzzle games, go buy this. (cash permitting)			"

												TLDR An uninspired portal clone with boring gameplay. Spits in the face of lovecraft and his works. Gameplay - Like portal if you stripped out all fun and creativity. The puzzles are a slow chore. The mechanics are awkward and tend to be either overly simple or frustratingly finicky. The majoritfy of gameplay revolves around slow moving platforms. It's like someone designed the magnet mechanics and realized you couldn't make any interesting puzzles with them after the fact. Story -  Fails to deliver on every count. Terrible acting. It attempts to work in the cthulhu mythos and fails to capture what makes lovecrafts' work interesting. Easily the most underwhelming portrayal of cthulhu and his related themes I've ever seen. South park did a better job. All information is given as exposition dumps. Characters seem to change personalities at random. Visuals - This is really dissapointing because the game starts strong. The bright, colorful aesthetic of the first thirty minutes is very appealing, with cool lighting and reflections. It tries to do the same trick as portal though, and the rest of the game has the ""behind the scenes plumbing"" look. This means a lot of drab for the majority. The outer space stuff at the end looks good in screenshots but is ugly and stiff in practice.			"

Re-do Review:I'm going to state my opinion of Magrunner's Gameplay, Story, and other miscellaneous bits that I feel are worth mentioning.Story:The story show promise for the first few hours. An introduction with beautiful art illustrates our main characters, and also delivers a bit of back-story on what today's hottest events are about. The first area the story fails to grab with is by not giving enough character to the characters. They show emotions, and say words, but it doesn't feel like what anyone says is important to more than moving the story forward. To put it loosely: it's not enjoyable to hear.(SPOILERS FROM HERE ON TO THE END)Cthulhu enters scene, and he proceeds to step on a stone and fall on his face. Honestly, why couldn't the developer/publisher just have left Cthulhu out of it until we found it out in the story.Promotional screenshots, trailers, literally the first sentence of the store description informs the buyer/player that the Cthulu Mythos is revelent to this game. WHY? It makes the actual reveal lackluster.However, for a positive on the story, when we do start to leave the facility, and hints of Cthulu, and the unknown are present; the setting is truly un-nerving because it's that contrast of hell and high-class facility that keeps you on edge for a while. I also found the third act having been devoid of dialogue a bit sad. Though the mad scientist was fun to see! Crazy buggard.Gameplay:The gameplay is something I would call rough. The ideas are all there. The puzzle have a lot of thought put into them, and the challenge is pretty high, and unlike some I liked the wide/big enviroments, because the art/designs of many of the rooms were pretty rad.The mechanics are cool for the first half of the game. They involve using a reverse magnetism with like polarities attracting, and opposites going away from one another(They most likely did this so if you wanted to connect more than two objects there wouldn't be any conflicting issues with two objects being the same, and one being opposite, and everything flies everywhere) There's a lot of pieces that are involved in solving the puzzles, like: platforms, pendulems, boxes, smaller boxes, and what I'd consider the worst addition to puzzle solving: the entrance of Dex's dog Newton. All puzzles until the introduction of this dog had you using boxes and platforms in your environment. And also by changing their polarities and locations to then reach an end. This dog however changes everything. It lets you place either polarity basically anywhere. It's like if in Portal you could place a white-portal-placing-wall anywhere for solving puzzles. It would be a nightmare.Speaking of nightmares, I don't remember the name of the level now, but I skipped the entire level by falling off an edge and onto the environment. I did so out of pure frustration for the amount of ""things"" present for the puzzle. similarly the rock design of space created a lot of situations where I could be stuck, or just shimmy around the environment, like it felt as if I shouldn't be allowed to go to those areas.Last bits on gameplay: The puzzle difficulty really ramps up around the middle, and some of the latter puzzles are downright evil in design, and left me wondering if the developer just thought we'd know that we should carry boxes on the under-belly of platforms that are transfered from another platform.Graphics:I really do love the graphics on this one. Just because it's unreal from 2013 doesn't mean it doesn't look good. I'd love more non-sense effects like depth of field (present for a short while after entering a room) motion blur, better anti-aliasing, and bloom (please don't shoot me if these are actually present) As it doesn't seem to have that 110% C I N E M A T I C presentation of a 2016 game, because it isn't one. But, act 1's clean facilities are a beaut to see, and the design put on show would be breathe-taking to actually see in person. the second act feels a bit to old and rustic without much change over 3 hours, but that was probably the intention. And, by act 3 we hit full space-on-Cthulhu action, and some of the locals in this act are pretty dang-on fine.The animations are a mix of great, and iffy: The human's movements are great, and add what little character the characters need into place, but the animation on The Old Ones doesn't feel weighty enough. It kinda looks like someone did a mo-cap for it, and didn't edit it afterwards.The models look great. From Gamaji's multiple appendages flying about, to Xander's blood soaked face in the third act; All the models are of high quality, and look like actual people.textures could be better. Other Thoughts:-Cthulhu is hinted far to early, and too obvious, as the transmission in the subtitles clearly shows the first and second part of the name cthulhu with the sentence shown. -Second also is that we see Xander once or twice, and the reveal of him being mad doesn't have enough punch because of it. Maybe a bit more interaction with the main character, would've benefited the development.-More tips. Maybe it's because I was on an SSD, but I only saw 2-3 tips that were barely relevent to solving puzzles. mostly just on the basic controls. So, more text-boxes or explanations on the physics of the game would've made the second and third act ride on smoother.-Sometimes the physics work, and sometimes they don't. A lot of it relies on calculations, and numbers that we as players literally cannot see in the code. It's infuriating for a platform to fall down, down, down because it was a hair away from connecting WITH THAT DAMN DOG.Final note:An interesting gameplay mechanic, thrown in with Cthulhu, but ultimately both pieces are on the rough side. So, I give it an average 5/10			"

												Physics tools and scripted object combinations allow ‘Magrunner: dark pulse’ to stand out from genre corner-stones like Valves portal series.  Players enjoying first person plat forming and puzzles should swipe right.  With few faults and a sale price of $2.50 I was definitely pleased and should community tools ever appear I would expect to revisit magrunner often.I spent about 8 hours within the campaign, which opts for a discovery based introduction to mechanics in place of a formal tutorial.  The story isn’t the strongest but its clear the developers put a lot of work into fleshing out an alternate future worthy of interest and steeped in well modeled Lovecraft figures like dagon, shub-niggurath, and of course Cthulhu.  While the story starts strong and finishes resolved, at some rare plot points in the center narrative felt a little jerky. Players might find the characters making snap conclusions without proper pretext or delivered from danger without cause. These bumps aside I often felt compelled to push on into the night far more often then I felt I needed a break. Magrunner is also well voiced.  Every member voice cast does a great job of conveying the emotion and urgency core to the plot.  However, the performances at times feel slightly disconnected from each other giving the impression that the cast may have recorded independently.Magrunner is often a good looking game, making proper use of some of Unreal’s strongest tools to great effect.  The graphics are scaled surprisingly well and players running on high and low settings alike can expect pleasing experience.  It’s not to say the settings are indistinct, only that the texture masking and engine optimization is done so well that players scraping the minimum requirements need not fear.  Only in few rare sections were the game tries to convey aged and dilapidated environment did some of the textures and geometry feel a little rushed.I really enjoyed magrunner’s simple yet rewarding mechanics.  Magrunner uses a combination of point physics and scripted objects like cube stacks, catapults, and conveyors, to generate puzzle solutions. The added utility of using any object as ether an attractor or repulser generates addition diverse game play, often with multiple solution paths.  I understand some people might feel more rewarded solving puzzles with distinct and singular solutions.  However, I felt the addition of sometimes rigged solutions via flexible game play elements, intended or otherwise, were a welcome addition to the genre.  There were definitely times we felt we stumbled across rigged solutions, and couldn’t be happier.  I also might have enjoyed more horror driven elements.  While I understand that outright combat would have betrayed the genre a few scripted jump scares and more threatening wards would have felt right at home.  In terms of design I could only find a few things I could do without.  For one magrunner’s polar projectiles move way to slow for my taste and adds an extra layer of execution to game play that I found more frustrating than rewarding.  Why they didn’t use hit scan I’ll never know.  For the most part though the game play is easy to execute and navigate.  In terms of visuals the disembodied platforms were the only thing that ever felt consistently cheap, and stylistically independent of most other game assets.  While I understand sometimes tough visual sacrifices have to be made, I found said platforms to the only glairing visuals blemish on an otherwise spotless title.Magrunner is mostly designed for a single pass.  There are a few speed running achievements to draw you into a second, much shorter, go.  But we doubt this will be reason enough for most players to make a second pass  We completed the campaign in a little under eight hours and don’t expect that grabbing those last few loose achievements will push us much past 10.  However, should a level editor or community workshop be added….Oddly enough we have to note one last thing. Some of the marketing elements on the store page may not be accurate.  I was only able to play 39 levels, not the video advertised 41.  Unless I missed a few hidden levels, and even if I did, most players should expect a 39 level play through.  Secondly store page screenshots appear to have been rendered out of game using in game assets.  There is no third person perspective and I was unable to recreate some of the lighting effects as seen in the screenshots.  These variations while small give the sense that the game is slightly more intense and more widely animated than it is.  Though I doubt any misleading was intentional, and surprising given how good the game actually looks. We suggest you watch game play first before buying.Pros and cons weighed I suggest grabbing Magrunner next time you see it on sale.  For the achievement gamer however we think this game is a fairly priced at $10.  Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you find a game you’ll enjoy.-Bandersunke			"

												So it's magnetic puzzles with Cthulhu, basically. Normally you'd expect magnetic fields to attract fields of opposite polarity, but not here - here opposites repel, it seems. I guess that when we're talking about alien horrors that drive you insane, this is what we mean now.All things said and done, though, this is a competently executed puzzle game. I'm not great at puzzle games and I got stuck a few times, and some of the puzzles rely less on planning and more on timing than I'd like, but overall I found the difficulty fitting for a casual puzzle player. The story is fine overall, though some of the voice acting is a bit wooden, and the ending is actually kind of interesting, though it also features some fashionable criticism of social media that feels unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the game. Cthulhu likes to sit on the edge of certain maps and growl his name at you over and over again, which is cool the first time but quickly gets kinda weird. Seriously, Cthulhu, we get it. Calm down.Overall, a decent game though not really outstanding by any measure. Give it a shot if you like first-person puzzle games!			"

												First off, it ain't no Portal.The story, and voice acting, are average at best but the solving of puzzles is satisfying enough to keep you going (so far). I actually turned the voices down initially but found I was reading the text instead which was distracting).If you can get it cheap and can handle the frustration (and frankly♥♥♥♥♥♥poor animation) in the latter stages of the game then get it. Those factors got the better of me so I ditched it with only 3 levels (of 36?) to go. Some of the learning curve leaves a lot to be desired - at various stages you are left to make radical leaps in understanding as to what needs to be done (but that's what walkthroughs are for, right?).this is one of those 'less than £4 games' that you can afford to dislike (or get a refund) "
