												One of the most atmospheric games I have played in recent years. The story is great - and this is what this game is all about.It is a game which takes itself seriously. If you haven't notived by the visuals already, this is not your usual Monkey Island type of adventure. Compared to comic books, this could be entitled graphic novel.The voice actors are very well chosen, as they deliver the atmosphere very well. Looking at the graphics, they are for sure not high-res SSAO 2xAA 3D whatnot. But that doesn't matter, the 2D pixels are perfect for this game.The puzzles are most of the time very well thought through, but I must admit that I've taken a peek into the walkthrough sometimes, as I got impatient following the story as I couldn't figure out the solution fast enough.I havent noticed any bug, so kudos to QA as well.

												Gemini Rue is a non-linear adventure game that succeeds in narrating a compelling story. It uses the topics of identity and nature in order to tell the profound parallel story of one Delta-Six and Azriel Odin. 7 hours in and I am left dumbfounded by this masterpiece.After finishing the game, here are a few things I liked about it..- Excellent voice acting. Shelly Smith-Shenoy who plays one of the female roles does an excellent job of playing an innocent and insightful individual.- Deep concept. The game plays with fire by toying with the idea of something as profound as identity. It opens up a lot of possibilities right from the moment of the opening scene.- Interesting puzzle presentation. Some of the puzzles in this game put an emphasis on a macro-level understanding of the environment. You are tasked with solving puzzles which then require you to go through more layers in order to complete the objective.This is a great example of a game with a strong premise. It's the type of adeventure game you are compelled to take the time to understand. I strongly recommend this to anyone who would like some mental stimulation (the good kind).			"

												I would highly recommend Gemini Rue for someone looking for a game in the vain of Snatcher and Blade Runner. I was hooked from the get go, the dialogue was great, the puzzles where logical and didn't have insane solutions to them, the atomosphere was amazing and the game didn't suffer from any serious pacing issues.5 out of 5.

If you have any difficulty in solving any puzzles or you want to complete 100% achievements, many detailed guides are just waiting to help you.不要因为这个游戏的画面显得粗糙就错过这个游戏，它本是一个80年代的科幻冒险小说风格，精彩的故事不容错过。游戏配音很赞。如果有谜题不会，或者想100%全成就，有很多很详尽的攻略在等着你。此游戏为目前玩的剧情最好的。			"

												Gemini Rue reminds me of the good old days when Lucasarts was dominating the market with Point and Click adventure games. The graphics in the game are exactly the same as the old Lucasarts games. Gemini Rue has great art, interesting story that has many twists and turns and great voice acting and music. Must play for adventure game fans!			"

												I HIGHLY recommended Gemini Rue for anyone who's looking for an old fashioned point and click adventure, with challenging but fair puzzles, and a fantastic story.Everything about the game's presentation is absorbing. It has an old film noir, Sci-Fi Blade Runner feel to it with gorgeous artwork that feels retro and fresh at the same time. The premise and feel reminds me of a story straight out of Cowboy Bebop, with twists that anyone paying attention to should enjoy. Voice acting and music (very moody and dark ambiance), was also spot on.I really found the puzzles engaging as well. A lot of point and click adventure games I have trouble getting into simply because their ""gameplay"" is either much too easy or just too vague in telling me what I am exactly supposed to be doing. I didn't think Gemini Rue had this problem. There were puzzles that were easy solve, and others I had to think about for long minutes before coming up with an answer. The Easter Eggs and achievements spread throughout the game was also a plus for me.The only problem I had with the game was the fact that it felt too short, and that after all is said and done, the characters are technically confined to two basic areas throughout the whole game when I wished there had been more to explore... But honestly the game did take me quite a bit of time to beat, and as for the lack of a wider world, I just enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end. "

												I constantly find myself torn by games like Gemini Rue; on the one hand, they exude aesthetic and narrative charm, with lovingly crafted characters, worlds, and stories, which are always the main reason I and many others are drawn to them, but on the other hand they are almost always a desperately frustrating gaming experience, bogged down by puzzles that are long, disjointed, and (in many cases) narratively inappropriate.The latter issue is what bugs me the most, and what makes playing these games so frustrating. For example, there is one particular puzzle where you need to call a guy using your communicator and try to get some information out of him. If you don’t choose the specifically correct dialogue options when speaking to him, he hangs up. This is quite believable and is probably what an actual human would do. Of course, this game being what it is, you can just call him again and again and again and try a different set of dialogue options each time, and every single time he responds as though you’re speaking to him for the first time. It doesn’t matter how many times you call him – even on the fifth call, he responds as though you’ve not just spoke to him four times previously using ever so slightly different variations on your script. If this were an actual person speaking to another human being, calling the person again and trying the same script with tiny variations would get you laughed at and hung up on immediately.The above kind of puzzle is narratively inappropriate because it is just not how a human being would behave at all. The playing experience stops being a nicely flowing story of which you, the gamer, are an integral part, and becomes an arbitrary clicking exercise, jarring you out of the narrative. The above puzzle is also guilty of another puzzle design sin: it seems to exist solely to pad out the game. It isn’t hard, don’t require much thought, and just involves trying different combinations over and over again, wasting a lot of time in the process. I wish I could say this was the only example of this, but it sadly isn’t.Many of the puzzles in Gemini Rue aren’t game ruining, and they aren’t completely nonsensical (unlike other infamous examples from this genre: the rubber ducky puzzle in The Longest Journey, anyone?) but they are generally quite wonky and boring. At one point you have to find a Carbon Ray Stabilizer to fix your lockpicks (why a Carbon Ray Stabilizer, I have no idea). Rather than buying it from a vendor or asking someone where to find one, you have to search around an abandoned building with some crates hidden towards the back. It’s not even easy to get to the crates – you have to get someone to help you. You have to see the crates when exploring, think “hang on, they must be really important” not “they’re just some old crates at the back of an abandoned room” and then go out of your way to work out how to get to them. Lo and behold, there’s one in the crates. Why is it there? I have no idea. I was just aimlessly exploring because I had no idea what to do next and just so happened to stumble on the solution. That’s not a satisfying solution to the problem, and it makes absolutely no narrative sense. The strange thing is that I often feel like I’m crazy for feeling this way; support for old-school point and click games seems overwhelming, and any critical opinions seem to be drowned in a sea of nostalgic rage. I seriously want to love games like this, I really do, but their puzzles make them a gargantuanly frustrating experience. If you’re willing to have a walkthrough in one hand at all times and you’re willing to suspend your disbelief through some poorly designed puzzles, then I would probably recommend this. Unfortunately, I felt frustrated more than I felt enjoyment, which is not something I want to experience in a game.			"

												Excellent noir atmosphere, it's full of Blade Runner references, including some Cowboy Bebop aswell. The story catch you in a way that you won't sleep before unravel it all. The scenarios are dark, perfectly made, voiceovers are perfect and the rain... Man, the rain. A bunch of pixel particles falling over my screen never meant so much.This game could be easily compared to a perfect snowflake. It surrounded by similar ones by each side, appearing to be ""one more of the same"", it's small, it's fragile, but a careful look will reveal its perfection and uniqueness.Gemini Rue is a result of only one guy's work and worth every dollar/real/pound/dinar you put in it. Buying it on a sale is a no-brainer. I really mean it. A masterpiece of its own kind, this point and click adventure has only one flaw, its length. The game is short, very short, like the very nature of the snowflakes from my example, melting into nothing (water, actually :D). So short that makes you beg for more like a guy smashing a door of a Krispy Kreme at 2 AM for one more sugar shot before bed. I really hope that this great game comes into your library someday.			"

												Gemini Rue is an impressive point and click game that was developed by Joshua Neurnberger and published by one of my favorite point and click games publisher Wadjet Eye Games.This game has a very good story with a special twist and a nice gameplay. It is a point and click game but it has some gameplay elements such as the shooting mechanics. I found the shooting mechanics odd in the beginning but after playing the game I liked it.The visuals are good but the game has some bugs. When you save the game while your character is standing in a rainy area and then try to load the save file, half of the screen will be black and invisible. This bug doesn't affect the game experience because it can be fixed by saving the game after going into a room or moving your character to somewhere else and then go back to wherever you were in the beginning.I highly recommend this game and think that it is a good opportunity to buy it now since it is being discounted by 70%.

												I was surprised by how Gemini Rue creeps under your skin while you play it, thanks to its brilliant sci-fi story and Blade Runnery atmosphere. It is a very simple old style adventure game, stylistically and gameplay wise, but the plot and the dialogues are well written, puzzles are not too simple but always logical and finally it is a welcome, brief, return to the mythical golden age of the genre (late '80s - first '90s).Don't expect next-gen graphics or 100 hours of gameplay, and probably you'll hate those shooting sections like I did, together with too much locations' recycling, but I would like to see a Gemini Rue 2 in the future, that's for sure! I hope the author will be able to find the time and the budget to make that happen!And finally, two thumbs up to Wadjet Eye for finding these little gems in the indie adventure panorama, after Resonance I was striked again, keep it up!

												Another great WadjetEye Game title. The word I would describe this game is cold. The color palette used for this game uses cold, harsh colors and it is a cold and harsh world that this game takes place in. The story is deceptivelly simple. I can't say anything about it except to say nothing is what it seems. The voice acting is well done as well as the pacing between two storylines. I loved how they tucked the crew from the Bebop in here. Even if they are just Easter Egg appearances, I got a kick out of seeing them. This is a game that teaches interesting lessons about society. It could definitely stimulate a discussion about our role in society and what makes a person etc...Wadjet Eye continues to show solid storylines in different kinds of point-and-click games.  "

												Started this a long time ago and left it alone for some time. Picked it up today and couldn't put it down. One of the best cyberpunky point and clicks games I have played since Blade Runner..of which it lends a lot of its dystopean world from but with great effect. Sinister plot and pretty good voice acting, pick this up if you want an immersive story that will last a few hours. Graphics are old skool 8bit but it works for the style they go for, voice dialogues have a portrait present when characters are speaking.Puzzles are pretty easy if you pay attention to the dialogue and stay on track, otherwise future tech and machines won't have a context. Medium difficulty puzzles with unskippable combat sections that are also pretty easy. Play it for its story.			"

												Now this is good story-telling and story progression.  It's also a mighty fine example of how good audio-acting, when included, can truly make a game come to life.   Overall, Gemini Rue is like some long, lost, unpublished sci-fi detective PKD novel come to life through a 16-bit video puzzle-solving adventure game.  It stood strong and compelling from beginning to end, and unravelled nicely throughout--right up to a great end.  The graphic scenery really sets the moods throughout, from ghetto and dirty, and dreadful and oppressive, to sterility and tranquility, and to openness and lonliness.  Every aspect of this game blends very well with each other.  The developer commentary scattered throughout adds a nice, revealing and funny touch.I highly recommend Gemini Rue to all gamers who enjoy an adventure game with a solid story, that knows how to tell that solid story, and contains audio actors that breathe life into the characters that create the solid story.  Truly, this is one you will not rue over.			"

												I was never a big fan of classic adventure games, though Gemini Rue did manage to grab me.  While a small game, it is very well-made with a good story and voice acting.  Gameplay is a bit clumsy as adventure games often are, requiring actions to be performed through an inventory menu rather than having separate keys for separate actions.The best part about the game is the well-balanced puzzle design.  One of the big pitfalls I've found with adventure games is making the puzzles too difficult to understand while others make the game so simple that there's hardly any player interaction required.  This one manages to find a good balance though there are still a couple parts that get confusing.  It is one of the best examples I've found outside Amanita games though.The really big disappointment for me was the ending.  I don't want to spoil anything but the ending just didn't make sense to me.  I like how the story ended up, but the way it was done just didn't seem right.In any case, it's a high quality adventure game that doesn't succumb to common adventure game pitfalls.  Don't expect amazing artwork though, being made in an ancient adventure game engine with very low resolution, low bit depth color graphics.			"

												Good pointandclick adventure with an engaging, mysterious storyline that gives you a few unexpected twists. The non-linear gameplay, while understanding it's purpose, is not my cup of tea - I simply played the section I was on until the game swapped me to the next segment. I enjoyed this game, it's my favourite genre and reminded me of the old school Lucasarts games that I grew up with (especially Beneath a Steel Sky) so it had a nostalgic feel. However I do have one huge gripe - name me another pointandclick with a combat system? ... Can't think of one? There's a *reason* for that - because it doesn't work! The combat is annoying, ungainly, ruins the atmosphere and adds nothing to the overarching themes of identity and what makes us who we are. If you are looking for an original adventure with a good story, try this one but do yourself a favour and put the combat on easy to save yourself a headache.			"

Also game mechanics are not the best but they are fine. What is REALLY good is the story. And STORY makes a good PAC game. We are talking here some deep nietzschean philosophy about who we are and do we have to be like that. So I really really like this game, but can not recommend it to a newbie point and click player. Also it needs several playthroughs to get all the achievements and the game is long - that is actually good. Long games are a rarity nowadays. So thumbs up. Very good game.			"

												About an hour into the game, Gemini Rue makes a massive misstep in the fusion of game mechanics and narrative which wrenched me out of this initially immersive little world. I do admire the creators for introducing gun fights into a point and click adventure. Gun fights where you can actually lose your life, and for a moment they introduced some tangible excitement and danger into the story. The game drills into you the idea of conserving your ammo, putting yourself at risk in order to get a more accurate, deadlier shot and therefore save a few bullets. And then it happens. You're in a corridor, you have 8 bullets, with enemies on your tail. Your character gets behind cover and a shootout ensues. An enemy is leaning out and firing wildly, but you're patient, calculating the timing of your enemy's shots. When you spot a window you lean out, and you focus your attention on just this one shot, not a bullet to waste. Of course you're exposed as you do this; it's a risky action. But you can't fire with wild abandon like them. You have to save ammo.Your pursuer leans out. Bang. A bullet in his head. It feels good, you've bought yourself some time. You and your partner run down to the end of the corridor to make your escape. And then you - YOU - your virtual persona. The character you have been inhabiting, controlling and roleplaying for the last hour forcibly stops at the foot of those stairs which lead to safety. He turns back towards the corridor. The computer has taken control of you. The story kicks in.Your avatar: ""I've got to hold them off!""bangbangbangbangbangbangbangExactly 7 shots. You counted them. Every last bullet, fired pointlessly into the ether by the computer. Your character then turns up the stairs and thus begins a dumb timed puzzle where you have to break down a door before a bad guy bursts in and shoots your stupid, defenseless, magazine-emptying idiot of an avatar. If only you could have just kept running up those stairs and saved those bullets for when the bad guys followed you up there. I died a few times and had to replay this scene. Each time I performed a bit differently during that first shootout (where I had control) and I used up a different amount of bullets.The real kick in the balls here is that the game programmatically counts how many bullets you used up, and then once the computer takes over control it fires the exact amount of rounds that you had remaining. They actually did that. They coded that. This is something worse than terrible game design. It actually feels like being trolled by the developers.			"

 Gemini Rue First impressions: A game where you become a ""Blade Runner""-style cop in a ""Blade Runner""-style world. Seems uninteresting? At first it's boring. I admit it. But then, as soon the game's cryptic nature slowly unveils: a symphony is played. The plot is the real thing here, for IT IS THE GAME. Everything lean on it. This detective story is not an ordinary one, it's more a tale than a noire. There will be a plot twist, but it's a twist that is not trivial at all. It is a fight between light and dark, good versus bad in a corrupt and decayed galaxy (cyberpunk-theme). Cons are the puzzles, they are too easy and gunfights are a little clanky, nevertheless these are just two little faults on an overall masterpiece.Let's get down to brass tacks:Genre: point-and-click/sci-fi/cyberpunk adventure/noireAI: irrelevant.Difficulty: easy (there are no real challenges, it's more a tale than an actual game).Plot: great plot. Playing this game is like reading a solid sci-fi book. Atmosphere: dark and decayed. This game is great mainly because it uses ""ancient"" graphics ('90s) through which is difficult to convey emotions. The dev team achieved this and for this they have to be commended. GREAT JOB!Graphics: voluntarily outdated. It's more a game with substance than appearance. It has a lot to talk about so graphics is not a core value.Audio: voluntarily old. This serves just as the ""thing"" that glue-up together atmosphere, plot and ultimately fun: without voices and/or sounds the game would be boring in my opinion.  FUN FACTOR: investigating an ever-raining-mining planet under the guise of a cop while at the same time another person tries to survive within a space station. Well, it is adventurous is it not? Thus we can say it is...FUN! Conclusion: a game that focuses on both atmosphere and plot. ""Substance is what it counts"" it seems to say. Are you interested in exploring a dark city and try to beat the odds? Did you like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner? If yes then: get it!Thanks for reading. "

Outstanding adventure game.I didn't realise that classic adventure games could be so immersive! I enjoyed latest Telltale work, but I would hardly place them in adventure genre. Gemini Rue on the other hand is a real classic point-and-click adventure game, though you could say that the biggest flaws and offenders of the genre were left out. You won't find any illogical obstacles and puzzles, pixel hunting or absurd item combining. What you get is a great sci-fi noiresque story, where you are a detective looking for his lost brother on some god-forgotten planet. Later the game opens up and lets you switch between the two main characters, the detective and the missing brother. It really does feel like you're detective, getting dirty and doing the groundwork: asking around, getting true identity of people, searching information about them in database. Top this with action sequences where you can cover and shoot at your enemies and you really get an exceptional adventure game. Voice acting and writing is astounding and the story itself is intriguing and suprising. All of that in a indie game made by the handful of people! I did enjoy the visual style of the game and I think it befits the game, but I guess some people could argue that the resolution is too low. Overall, superb game, highly recommended. A great reminder that the adventure games are a great way to tell a story and don't have to be obscure and plagued with bizzare puzzles.			"

												I think this is one of the greatest science fiction point-and-click adventure games you could find on steam. It's got old school pixel graphics and just great voice acting all-around. The puzzle elements are also a lot of fun. The story behind Gemini Rue may seem derivative. It's set in a universe like the TV show Firefly and it's movie counterpart Serenity, it has the tone and feel of Blade Runner and has the plot of Total Recall. But it never made it bad. It's just taking the good stuff on what I like about science fiction.You play as Azriel Odin, an ex-assassin that is looking for his brother on the planet of Barrucus, which is part of a Gemini Star System, a system that won it's independence after a war and is now run by a crime syndicate known as the Boryokudun. The other character you will get to play is Delta-Six whom is a patient of a mysterious facility. This is all I can say about the story without going into spoilers.Throughout the game, you talk to characters, solve puzzles, do detective-like work to learn about things and occasionally go on shoot-outs. There's an interesting shooting mechanic in the game that you will learn how to use. All of the characters in Gemini Rue are well written and feel real. The philosophical themes of identity and memories are also explored in this game and is pretty much what the game wants to explore and talk about. There are a couple downsides of this game. Some of the puzzles are little too difficult and the fictional universe that is offered in Gemini Rue remains mostly unexplored with the exception of a single city on one planet and a facility somewhere else.But I recommend this game to Science fiction, cyberpunk and story adventure fans. It's definitely a must-buy!			"

												This game is incredibly fun. It is a point and click so sometimes you need to be patient. There are times I was getting ahead of myself, where I would try to perform actions that are 3 ""clicks"" away yet. The audio in this game is fantastic. The game is playable without audio, but you really need to hear the voice acting to get the whole experience. Above all though, the story is what keeps me coming back to the game.			"

You could make a single pixel into 4 effectively making it 1280p but what's the point? It would look the same. 640p doesn't make it any worse, better imho, you can run it on pretty much any machine. I played on a laptop and had no tech issues whatsoever.			"

The fact that the game is influenced a lot by Blade Runner is a huge bonus too. I highly recommend this game even if you are not a fan of point and click games.			"

SpacetacularWadjet Eye Games as done it again with yet another point-and-click puzzle adventure.I feel no rue for have gotten this games as the game looks and feels amazing, plus the even included the crew from Cowboy bebop.The storyline is quite good and will catch your hungry eyes from the very beginning, the soundtrack/FX are super good.The combat system is definitely unique, and i know i know, ""i´ve heard this so many times before dood"" you say, but trust me, its really REALLY unique, and very odd too, but in time you´ll find it quite amusing.As i try not to spoil much, you play as Azriel Odin, later taking control of Delta-Six and Sayuri to fight against Center 7, a rehab center where top criminals go, later to have their memories erased and rehabilitated as a new person, with a new name, new past and a new job, but things dont go as the old Director from Center 7 wants it too.But to truly know the entire epicness of this game, you have to dive yourself in this epic space adventure to know more, you wont feel any rue.The game is on sale and it waiting for you.

												I love the atmosphere, music, voice acting, and story presented in this game, but I have come across several bugs that cause the game to crash, at least one of which makes it so I can not continue playing the game.  I emailed the developer (his email address is provided in the text manual that can be found in the game's directory) but he just blew me off.  I've tried contacting Wadjet Eye Games both via their forums and their contact email, but never heard anything from them.The developer doesn't care and the publisher doesn't seem to either.I really want to recommend this game, just as much as I really want to love it, but I can't.  These crashes are infuriating and the lack of help from the people behind the game is very off putting.Save yourself the frustration and money, don't buy this game.Edit: I was able to fix the crashes using the ""ags_shell.dll"" file from version 1.0 of the game, with out help from the devs.  I still can't recommend buying it until this is fixed officially.

												An engaging and immersive cyberpunk point n click adventure game with a great story and likeable characters. The story has interesting themes and is portrayed in an interesting fashion. The voice acting fit the characters well and they were all unique. I also liked how the music was very understated and complimented the scenes nicely. It was definitely satisfying to play through to the end and see how the story unfolded, leaving a very satisfying conclusion.The graphics are beautifully drawn and make the world feel immersive. Some backgrounds are only seen for a few seconds yet are still richly detailed and almost breathtaking to look at, so I commend the developer for that.The puzzles hit the right balance between challenging and logical, there weren't any weird and crazy parts of the game's internal logic. Some areas of the game can be a little tricky and annoying to figure out which part of the map to go to next as you backtrack through familiar areas a few times but nothing too egregious.There is combat through gunplay. Instead of just pressing the use button on gun and clicking on an enemy in a traditional point n click style, there is combat where the player takes cover, aims, and has to time their shots in the minigame. While it isn't very complex, it breaks up the puzzles and provide an interesting way of doing action in a style of game like this. I noticed a couple of glitches such as when a sprite in the background would be placed on the top layer in front of my character in the foreground, but this only happened twice.Definitely recommended for people who enjoy interesting sci-fi cyberpunk stories with good voice acting and story, especially considering that the majority was drawn, written and programmed by just one student, so props to him for making such an engaging and interesting game. Worth checking out, especially for the really neat easter eggs.			"

												Gemini Rue is a pretty nice old-school point and click scifi adventure. It's not really cyberpunk although someone has tagged it as such. Quite atmospheric and the plot has some mind♥♥♥♥ery.The game has some action sections with cover based shooting, which is sort of meh. Not too annoying, but not exciting either. There are a few tedious action scenes where you can die a bit too often, but overall they don't ruin the mood of the game.			"

The game offers also really great atmosphere. The only problem is, well, gameplay itself. Half of ""Gemini Rue"" is opening doors and using elevators (i.e. right-click, click on hand symbol, click on door, move into, right-click, click on hand symbol, click on panel, select floor and so on, and so forth.

												Difficult, Sci-fi, Noir, point and click adventure.Hand drawn graphics; somehow blurry, simplistic and yet detailed at the same time. Excellent sound and voice, perfect fit.Game play for the most part is mouse point and click movement, with a few keys thrown in for gun fights. I did not have any difficulty here, once you learn the timing of the enemy it is a breeze. Finding my way to the next plot point was challenging at first, some areas are linear but most need attention paying to investigation and a bit of trial and error. I was only frustrated at one part involving combining inventory items and had to search for the answer which turned out to be simple but not intuitive.For me, the real draw of this game is the story. Well thought out plot, characters and a satisfying ending.I encountered a few graphical bugs on reloading saves at gun scenes, but it did not crash and I was able to play through them.Achievements are fairly easy to 100%, though you will likely need a guide for a couple of the more obscure ones.I got my copy in one of the five cheap bundles it has appeared in so far, so for me it was good value.

At the end of my second playthrough, I am pleased to say that my experience was the exact opposite.The gameplay is fluid and easy to pick up, challenging at times but never frustrating. The artwork is perfect for the setting with a noir feel that helped draw me into the storyline and continue engaging to find out what would happen next. A must play game for point & click fans, and I recommend giving it a try if you are new to them or returning to the genre.			"

												Gemini Rue ReviewA Noir-sci-fi point and click adventure game, Gemini Rue is the project of sole developer Joshua Neunberger. headlining hand-drawn backgrounds spanning several planets and locations, and an expansive story, Gemini rue has won numerous awards for its story and style.The story drags you in right from the start, beginning with a man in a chamber (i won't say any more than that) and then immediately switching to someone waiting under a shelter in the rain. The atmosphere is thick, accentuated by the quiet Noir soundtrack and the ever-pouring rain. The puzzles are good, with the occasional frustrating pixel hunt. With two story threads, and the ability to switch between them, the game never really gets boring; if you get tired of one character, you can easily switch to the other. The game has voice acting, which is surprisingly good for an indie game. The dialogue is decent, and the pixel art suits the game. Once you have finished the around 6-7 hour story, you can enable developer commentary, which gives you an inside look at the development process as well as some funny bloopers. I played first on Windows, but i decided to try developer commentary on mac, and discovered how buggy it was. The cursor stuck to the edges of the screen, you had to option-click for right click, and you couldnt scroll your inventory. Now for the pros and cons list.pros:+Excellent atmosphere+great, engaging story+passable voice acting+decent artwork and style+good developer commentary+ambient noir soundtrack+different main characterscons:-slightly clunky interface-some puzzles are mindless pixel hunts-buggy on macfinal score:9.5/10			"

												I wouldn't really call myself a point and click adventure fan but this game really drew me in with its unique story and nice atmosphere. I am a huge sucker for cyberpunk detective stories such as Blade Runner or Snatcher so of course I loved this one.The art design is most likely a result of a budget, rather than an artistic choice but at least it looks like its actually a game released in the past unlike so many other ""retro style indie"" games with artists just being lazy. But there were a few times where the graphics were unable to convey an image, so I got stuck in a couple parts where a few pixels were supposed to be an object I could interact with. These were the only parts where I couldn't figure out what to do and it felt unfair in the wrong way. The rest of the game was pretty well designed though. I gotta say, it doesn't feel like an indie game to me, it feels like it was an actual regular game just released in 1991.The voice-acting is surprisingly good and the music and sound desgin was top notch as well.I actually wanted to know what was going to happen, so I consider that a good story. Point and Click games often have well written plots (for video games) and lots of dialogue, this one is no different.I heavily recommend this game to fans of sci-fi or detective noir stories.			"

												Gemini Rue is like a 90s adventure game, for good and ill. For good because it stylistically fits right beside games like Rise of the Dragon, Dreamweb and Beneath a Steel Sky. It’s nice to see the style be kept alive.Unfortunately the game also plays like a 90s adventure game. The controls and interactions are clunky, with none of the streamlining you’d see in newer games. Something as simple as getting up on a box and climbing a ladder involves 4 clicks and 2 keyboard commands, sometimes even more.The story almost pulls off what it’s trying to do. In terms of mood there’s nothing wrong with it. The music, sound and visuals work together well. The problem lies with the dialog, which especially towards the end don’t deliver as strongly as it needed to. It’s so close, just another few editing passes might have done it. It doesn’t ruin it, it just stumbles across the finish line. I thought the conceit of the story was done ok. It’s not the best take on the concept, as I thought Dollhouse for example did it much better. But I thought it was alright for what it is.The game isn’t a must play. It's good, but not as brilliant as it could have been. But if you feel like playing something that's 90s style, this will deliver, pixel hunting and all.			"

												I got this game on sale and was very satisfied with it.Pros:- If you're into the whole sci-fi existential thing, this is your storyline- Retro feel and pixel art is spot-on (I appreciated the various nods to point-and-click games of old)- Immersive atmosphere with great soundtrack- Gameplay is not that longCons (mostly technical):- I played on a Mac, and to right-click you have to use option+left click instead; it was a pain- Walking from place to place repeatedly can be a chore, more so than most other point-and-clicks I've played (though there is a function to skip the walking with the esc key)- Clunky combat system- Voice acting a bit choppy at parts- Some players found the twist shocking, but I guessed it halfway through so the big reveal wasn't as impactful as I'd hopedThis game isn't for everyone, but bottom line is if you like a good sci-fi storyline with secrets to be uncovered and you appreciate the retro point-and-click vibes, you'll probably enjoy Gemini Rue.

												I really liked this game! The story starts off interesting enough and really ends with a bang.. The art style works for the game really well and I thought the voice acting was spot on. You can also run into the whole main cast of Cowboy Bebop in game which was really cool.The gameplay on the other hand is a mixed bag, sometimes it works and other times it can be really confusing. You'll find yourself stuck because you failed to do something as simple as stand on a box or do a sequence of clicks in a specific order, and there are no quest markers telling you where to go or what to do next. So I strongly recommend referencing a guide for the game, that way you can skip over the tedious game play and enjoy the top knotch story.			"

												It's really not worth it.Alright, so the game isn't even that bad. The puzzles are decent, the production values are all there, and the premise certainly sounds fascinating, doesn't it? How could I possibly dissuade you from purchasing and experiencing this promising sci-fi title?Thing is, the story just fails to follow through. The ""twin"" plotlines resolve in the most obvious way possible (a development that is telegraphed HARD by the appearance/voice of a certain character), and possibly the most fascinating aspect of the story -- being an amnesiac in a prison of amnesiacs -- is similarly resolved in the least interesting way possible. I was very hyped to see what kind of intrigue this game would bring to the table; turns out it brings almost nothing. I hate to be the guy to say something is bad because it's predictable, but it really was that disappointing.I would be more lenient, because as I said it's well put together; art and atmosphere are solid, voice work and soundtrack are on point, etc. But there are similar games in the same genre and/or offered by the very same developer that are so much more satisfying in their storytelling (Technobabylon, for instance). In the end it's by far the most disappointing Wadjet Eye game I've bought, and that's coming from someone who's liked pretty much everything else they've released.If you must disregard my warning, dear reader, then buy it on sale and temper your expectations.P.S. The developer commentary for this game is one of the absolute worst I have ever forced myself to listen to. Completely dry, minimal insight, utterly tedious. My god.			"

												Gemini Rue is a solid indie point-and-click adventure. The puzzles are a little obtuse at times, it can be difficult where to go next. After playing through the game twice, the second time in commentary mode, it was very insightful to see the design decisions made by the designer. The story and atmosphere are what takes the cake in this quick, semi-non-linear Blade Runner-esque masterpiece. Lookout for inspirations from Cowboy Bebop as well. It is hard to play through in one sitting as that is helpful in bringing a fresh look to puzzles.			"

												I really liked this game! The story starts off interesting enough and really ends with a bang.. The art style works for the game really well and I thought the voice acting was spot on. You can also run into the whole main cast of Cowboy Bebop in game which was really cool.The gameplay on the other hand is a mixed bag, sometimes it works and other times it can be really confusing. You'll find yourself stuck because you failed to do something as simple as stand on a box or do a sequence of clicks in a specific order, and there are no quest markers telling you where to go or what to do next. So I strongly recommend referencing a guide for the game, that way you can skip over the tedious game play and enjoy the top knotch story.			"

												Gemini Rue is a solid indie point-and-click adventure. The puzzles are a little obtuse at times, it can be difficult where to go next. After playing through the game twice, the second time in commentary mode, it was very insightful to see the design decisions made by the designer. The story and atmosphere are what takes the cake in this quick, semi-non-linear Blade Runner-esque masterpiece. Lookout for inspirations from Cowboy Bebop as well. It is hard to play through in one sitting as that is helpful in bringing a fresh look to puzzles.			"

Even the combat system, though hardly on the level of a fps or somesuch, fits perfectly with the feel of the game.If you're at all interested in a neo-noir sci-fi game with an amazing story, this game is far and above worth 9.99.

												Gemini rue is a very atmosperic quest and acts well as a nostalgie-activator for those who played old quests like Full Throttle (even GUI is very similar). Although it depends on today`s players` demand and therefore has quite casual and simple ""puzzles"", I recommend this game. As for me it is a nice game to spend a few evenings.Pros:Quite interesting story idea.All characters are charismatic.All the puzzles (except one) are quite logical.Really splendid atmosphere in the first half of the game. Lots of raining etc :)A 90s like style!Cons;The biggest one - there are quite few characters and locations so story scope is narrow and in my opinion it is the reason why the game`s world starts being veeeery small to feel in the second part of the game. In the beginning you can feel a respect to the way how developers have worked out the world. And it feels really pity when most of things appear to be just a text. So you just meet people, see locations and when you go away you dont feel like they continue ""living"" and ""existing"" after you. SPOILER! The game becomes much more dull after you cripple Balder. The last location where I really enjoyed the game was the weather tower. After that all the chars are already well-known and all the world dissapears in the space infinity.As a huge fan of telltale games series i feel a lack of taking decisions :)Spoiler: In my opinion the story should have covered ""dont believe anyone"" note in the beggining of Delta-Six part better. In fact it is always obvious whom you should believe and whom not.Spoiler: Some story details feel to be a little strange. For example, why did Matheous say that he doesnt know where the station 7 is? This could make his way to the revenge much shorter.As you see all pros and cons are about story and atmosphere. So you wont play this game if you are in search of some action.To sum up - I really enjoyed first half of the game. I WOULD replay it once when I forget everything in a couple of years :P ;)As for second part, it was slightly less cool. I played it just to reach the end of the story.			"

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: Gemini Rue Review 

			Views: 51		

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/80310/ Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming		

Gemini Rue is excellent sci-fi, noir adventure game with some technical problems, but this must not stop you from enjoying it.The game takes place in 23rd century within “Gemini System”, a star system recently declared independence after 10 years of devastating war. After that crime sindycate named Boryokudan takes control much of the system. At the start of the game you take control of Azriel Odin, ex-assassin now turned to cop. He's searching information on planet Barracus about his missing brother Daniel. Through most of the game you will play with Azriel, but at some point you will take control of Daniel. I don't want to spoil the plot since this is the best thing in the game, but i'll say it includes conspiracy, memory wipe, superb twist, in other words – briliant story. Of course the good writing helps a lot. The ending is quite philosophical.Gameplay wise is pretty standard for the genre, with one exception. I'll talk about it later. You click on a hotspot and choose which part of the body (eye, hand, leg or mouth) or item will be used. After being stuck on 1 or 2 places i quickly realized that the leg icon is quite usefull for moving forward the story. Most of the adventure games i played don't have similar thing. Maybe the most important feature in adventure game are the puzzles. For me they were ideally tough, but veteran players probably will breeze through them. Maybe just 2 or 3 times i was stuck for a brief moment. Puzzels always have common sense and they are tight quite nice with plot. And because of this they are obvious, just listen the conversations. Puzzels include speaking with someone, start a machine, search for information in terminals and some have not the most elegant solutuons – shootng lock, breaking window and so on. The only thing missing is combining stuff in your inventory. Like i said the puzzels maybe easy for those who is looking for a mental challenge, so keep that in mind.The exception i meant was gunfights, Yes, it's a bit strange to have such a thing in adventure game, but they fit so well in the story and you won't mind them. They are total 5 or 6, so don't, it' not a side scroller shooter. The gunfights proceed like this: you stand behind cover, then you press A or D to show yourself from the left or right position of the cover and shoot. The enemy is doing the same thing. But you can one-hit kill the bad guys. There is a bar on upper left corner and by pressing a button you will concentrate and when it reaches the green zone it will guarantee headshot and quickly ending the shooting. And you can choose their the difficulty at any point. The game is autosaving before life-threatening situations.The graphics. Some parts are great, others – questionable. The game is a nod to old school adventure games and I like pixel art, space cutscene are good, character design and movement are good, but the backgrounds are bland. The levels are okay. You are on the rainy streets or inside a building. Just little more details in the environment won't hurt.The sound design is great. The voices for the main characters are great, but i can't say the same thing about some of the secondary. Most of the game doesn't have any music, but when it does, it's great. It's starts and stops abruptly and this is unfortunate.The biggest problems here comes from the technical side of things. The game runs at max resolution 1280x800 and it's locked at 40 frames per second. Sometimes Esc doesn't work. When this happen press Space bar and then Esc again. For me this is fixing the problem, i think. When you load save game half of the screen is black, until you move away from that scene, but this happen only 3 times through my whole playthrough.Gemini Rue is fantastic adventure. Right from the start the game intrigued me and i was glued to the screen, until i saw the end credits. It offers fantastic story, gritty sci-fi atmosphere, gunfights, light puzzels, but it suffers from some unfortunate technical problems. One more thing. Almost the whole game is made by a single person. This is quite impressive. I highly recommend it.			"

												A dystopian cyberpunk point-and-click indie game with atmospheric art direction and excellent sound design.Playing as a former assassin you're placed in the raining wet city of Pittsburg at night. Throughout the game you uncover more details about your mission and backstory, picking up details from characters and items within each area.While the gameplay is quite linear and less opaque than some point-and-clicks, situations sometimes require a bit more experimenting to discover the correct way to progress. Some of the scenes could also have been more fleshed out in the variety of things to be interacted with, as some locations felt they could have used it.Altogether Gemini Rue is enjoyable if mostly for the art and soundscape, especially the latter which carried the game for me. The hand-drawn scenery and sprites suit the game's dark vibe and are clearly drawing (no pun intended) from cyberpunk influences.One minor issue I had was with the voice casting. While the dialog can tend on the cliched side I felt the voice acting could have been better cast, with many characters lacking an immersive delivery. The protagonist however is better suited to the voice, and is easily the best match.The game is quite short,  and can be completed in a sitting or two depending on how much time is spent on progressing through scenes. I completed it in Steam's Offline mode, so my actual play time isn't displayed publicly (note to devs: make it work for such singleplayer games).For those looking for a similar experience I'd highly recommended the Hideo Kojima classic Snatcher for the Sega CD. The voice acting, characters, dialog and humorous respite work together to make a very well-rounded and satisfying game.In short, I'd recommended Gemini Rue to those looking for a short, well-made and atmospheric cyberpunk-esque fix, and are open to the point-and-click style of gameplay.

												Gemini Rue is a solid adventure game, probably the best one I've played in years.It's well rooted in the point and click genre, but it uses a few mechanics that are a bit unual alongside the tried and true arsenal: a communicator which you can use to interact with other characters and/or computer terminals, a combat mini game (somewhat similar to the one found in the Indiana Jones series) and the ability to play with multiple characters. These are nothing new, but they are used well and break the monotony that sets in from hours of pointing and clicking.The graphics are good (but the pixelated look may be a problem form some) and the art direction is great, there is little confusion about what to do, everything is cleverly hinted at. Sadly, this makes the puzzles seem a bit easy, but on the good side there are very few instances of pixel hunting and when is does get used it makes perfect sense in the context of the scenes.The first part of the story is very good, I liked the mood and the mystery surrounding the events, sadly the big twist becomes apparent about halfway through the game and I kept hoping for something out of left field which never came. Overall it was a good experience, with great music, great voice acting and a nice, although predictable, story.			"

												I really liked this game. It felt like a sort of modern old school point and click adventure. The story is great, the athmosphere is amazing and I really liked the graphics (despite being really sick of pixel art in general). There is something hypnotic about the background animations, like water dripping from a drain pipe etc. Great detail.There where a few down sides though. There is a bit of pixel hunting, which comes with the territory I guess. Also, the entire game spans only a few locations. It works well, but it does feel a bit reused at some point. I like the contained setting all in all though.			"

												Gemini Rue comes with more than what a typical cyberpunk graphic adventure game meets the eyes. It also foments a classically deep philosophical question for the adventurer to reflect about. Overall, it's an excellent game which not only dances with nostalgic elements but also stings with epiphanic messages.			"

 Rate 7/10	 Gemini Rue is definitely a good game. Catching story (with many turns of events), nice settings and good grapics (of course if you like ""old-fashion"" style games). Puzzles and screens are not so difficult but neither too easy, with gunfights and timed tasks to give gameplay some rhythm. Despite it's phylosophical approach it's in the end a short game (it took 8 hours to finish it) so some of the interesting topics of the plot (of wich i won't talk to let the gamers discover it by themselves) could have been inquired better, some characters more developed, otherwise i could give it a better rating. Bought on sale, definitely worth it.			"

												It's an interesting world, the characters are quite compelling and the way the story is told is quite unique  to this, my original review simply touched on the fact the game looks pretty good, and since I love futuristic worlds (like this one) it's something that pulls me in more.The mechanics are pretty simple, though not explained fully at times and the movement isn't restrictive yet it feels like you're limited... the cover system for gun battles isn't well done, but it's pretty different from any other game, in a good way that works for this game.The main story at times made me relate to the characters and though I haven't finished it I feel as if it'll be a good game to pick up. I received my key as part of the Humble Bundle ages ago, and can't recommend this game enough. I had thought I wouldn't like it as much as I did.			"

												Loved the dystopic setting and the great story.Few recommendations for a probable sequel/spin-off: - use a better engine, less muddy pixel graphics. Face portraits could have been much sharper.- some things were really hard to find (e.g. hole in the wall in apartment)- handling (rightclick->choosing action) was a bit annoying sometimes+ really liked the voice and mood of the main characterAll in all a definite would-buy-again!

												Reminded me of ""Under a Steel Sky"" or some of the old Sierra quest-games. In any case ,it's certainly worth a play-through. I liked the feel of the game and most of the challenges are reasonable, such that you might be briefly stumped but won't need to refer to a walkthrough. Additionally, given its price, it's a great value.			"

												Wow, just....wow.What did I just play? I need to sit down and contemplate the complexities of the universe for a little while.Really awesome old-school point and click game with challenging but not over the top puzzles and really great voice acting. The story is fantastic, a really beautiful and thoughtful contribution to science fiction that I could easily find myself coming back to. If you're a fan of the old LucasArts games and enjoy some good sci-fi, I highly, highly recommend this.			"

												A dystopian cyberpunk point-and-click indie game with atmospheric art direction and excellent sound design.Playing as a former assassin you're placed in the raining wet city of Pittsburg at night. Throughout the game you uncover more details about your mission and backstory, picking up details from characters and items within each area.While the gameplay is quite linear and less opaque than some point-and-clicks, situations sometimes require a bit more experimenting to discover the correct way to progress. Some of the scenes could also have been more fleshed out in the variety of things to be interacted with, as some locations felt they could have used it.Altogether Gemini Rue is enjoyable if mostly for the art and soundscape, especially the latter which carried the game for me. The hand-drawn scenery and sprites suit the game's dark vibe and are clearly drawing (no pun intended) from cyberpunk influences.One minor issue I had was with the voice casting. While the dialog can tend on the cliched side I felt the voice acting could have been better cast, with many characters lacking an immersive delivery. The protagonist however is better suited to the voice, and is easily the best match.The game is quite short,  and can be completed in a sitting or two depending on how much time is spent on progressing through scenes. I completed it in Steam's Offline mode, so my actual play time isn't displayed publicly (note to devs: make it work for such singleplayer games).For those looking for a similar experience I'd highly recommended the Hideo Kojima classic Snatcher for the Sega CD. The voice acting, characters, dialog and humorous respite work together to make a very well-rounded and satisfying game.In short, I'd recommended Gemini Rue to those looking for a short, well-made and atmospheric cyberpunk-esque fix, and are open to the point-and-click style of gameplay.

												Gemini Rue is a solid adventure game, probably the best one I've played in years.It's well rooted in the point and click genre, but it uses a few mechanics that are a bit unual alongside the tried and true arsenal: a communicator which you can use to interact with other characters and/or computer terminals, a combat mini game (somewhat similar to the one found in the Indiana Jones series) and the ability to play with multiple characters. These are nothing new, but they are used well and break the monotony that sets in from hours of pointing and clicking.The graphics are good (but the pixelated look may be a problem form some) and the art direction is great, there is little confusion about what to do, everything is cleverly hinted at. Sadly, this makes the puzzles seem a bit easy, but on the good side there are very few instances of pixel hunting and when is does get used it makes perfect sense in the context of the scenes.The first part of the story is very good, I liked the mood and the mystery surrounding the events, sadly the big twist becomes apparent about halfway through the game and I kept hoping for something out of left field which never came. Overall it was a good experience, with great music, great voice acting and a nice, although predictable, story.			"

												Blending elements of noir and science fiction, Gemini Rue delivers an interesting story wrapped in old-school graphics and great writing. Fans of old Sierra and Lucasarts games will feel right at home.The atmosphere can be summed up in one word: oppressive. Rarely have I felt so unwelcome - which is good! The music and sound design are top-notch. However, the voice acting sometimes seems to be a bit flat. The pixelated (but by no means ugly) graphics definitely are a throwback to the ""golden age"" of adventure games. Don't let them discourage you, the visuals aren't everything. The combat is clunky, but generally not a huge bother.It's the puzzles that make an adventure game. In Gemini Rue they're very intuitive and neither too easy nor too hard. Some of them can even be solved in multiple ways, which I felt was a nice touch and shows how much thought was put into making this game. A developer commentary is included, giving further insight into the authors' minds. There are some visual bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.Overall a very enjoyable game, even if you're not a fan of the genre. Definitely worth the price tag.			"

It's a true gem and a must-play for sci-fi thriller fans and anyone interested in a real good story, with great twists and awe-inspiring revelations concerning the human memories and conscience.I will admit that it has been a long while, that an adventure felt so unpredictable and so well narrated. It's a Film Noir, only you get to be the protagonist! Great story! Even replayable after a year or two. Recommended!			"

												Ever wanted to go back to the mid-90's and play an adventure game?  Well- with this game, you're there!A sci-fi romp following a split story between a prisoner who lost his memory, and a detective- you point and click your way through this beast.Seemingly taking ideas from point'n'click adventures before it (Beneath a Steel Sky, Blade Runner, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream), this one manages to meld the lot and create its own beast.Story is solid, with some twists in the tale, ""trust noone"".  Puzzles are plentiful, but sometimes a pain as items appear when a puzzle is solved on a completely different screen- or a dialogue box that you happened to have missed.  There are no ""real"" muliple endings, what you get is a linear story, but if you do something at the end you can get an extra line of dialogue.Graphics are very welcome.  Instead of looking ""old"", the lo-resolution pixel art gives the game character, screamingly familiar to a mid-90's adventure.  Effects, such as rain manage to give the world a sense of life, even though the setting is so dark.The zoomed in pictures in dialogue were OK at best.  Compared to the games smaller pixel art, it felt to me that these had far less character- most of the time not fitting to the ingame graphic and voice.  Without these, I felt the game would have created more of a link to the player with their character if it were just the pixel guys opening mouths and bobbing their heads.  I hope they include an option to turn off the dialogue graphics in their next game.Gameplay was mostly point and click, with a gun fight mini-game.  Point and click was standard,  right click and you can (eye), (hand), (foot) etc.  The game is fairly short at roughly 9 hours, and a few more if you want to find the achievements.There is a problem that you can't pull up your inventory to look at items (there is no inventory button).  In order to look at an item you need to right click on an ingame object, then right click on your item (makes little sense).Bugs:  There were some graphic bugs, but nothing game breaking.  I found that sometimes the right have of the screen was garbled after a load.  Also, if you have an instance of Chrome in the background, dialogues could not be shown / heard.  It was all skipped.  One screen also had a graphics ""layering"" problem, where the background was infront of the forground (groundfloor of the apt building).Overall;  Gemini Rue is a great point'n'click adventure that should've been released in the 90's... But it's out now!  There are a couple of bugs, but they don't break the game.  The amount of character and soul put into this project is worthy of a lookup, this is a game I'm proud to say I've completed.			"

 Rate 7/10	 Gemini Rue is definitely a good game. Catching story (with many turns of events), nice settings and good grapics (of course if you like ""old-fashion"" style games). Puzzles and screens are not so difficult but neither too easy, with gunfights and timed tasks to give gameplay some rhythm. Despite it's phylosophical approach it's in the end a short game (it took 8 hours to finish it) so some of the interesting topics of the plot (of wich i won't talk to let the gamers discover it by themselves) could have been inquired better, some characters more developed, otherwise i could give it a better rating. Bought on sale, definitely worth it.			"

												I just finished it, and it was good. Very Beneath a Steel Sky-esque, with a hint of Full Throttle (I'm not even sure why, but some parts of GR reminded me of some parts of FT). I really liked Gemini Rue.It is not exempt from a few shortcomings: the controls and interface kinda suck, combat is God awful (not even sure why they felt the need to include combat at all: it really feels out of place), everyone relevant lives in the same one condo, there are not that many locations in the game.But the good stuff vastly surpasses those. The atmosphere is just great, the visual design is excellent (hand-drawn, visible sketch lines, watercolour-y backdrops, big pixels for character sprints), the story flows well and the dialogue is quite well-written. The plot ""twist"" is introduced/hinted decently, and the ""converging stories"" device is also used fairly well. The music and voice acting also are top notch.Overall, Gemini Rue feels old school as ♥♥♥♥, in every respect: it is a greatly atmospheric and utterly enjoyable game that would have worked perfectly in 1994 as it does now.

												Where to start with this fantastic game? Let’s just put it like this, i had the Android version and i never finished it. I liked it that much i bought it here too! It’s like one of the great Lucasarts point and click games reborn.  The graphics are not your AAA company like Maxis..........(oh wait......that company died xD), Ubisoft...yeah maybe not as this is 1 game in a year not 14 games...ok let’s just say it’s not from a failed mega company. This is a hand-drawn pixel graphicated game. It’s a point and click adventure with a unique gameplay and style. Its Story has this cyberpunk adventure feel to it with its dark sci-fi feel and the most depressing atmosphere. The story is really its core purpose and holy what a story, i was just gobsmacked for such an amazing game; the gripping characters, the helpless feeling and high tech sci-fi cyberpunk future (23rd century) it’s like adding chocolate custard to a scrummy chocolate cake. It’s got images of the characters that speak, great voice acting, amazing soundtrack, interesting puzzles, secrets & collectibles and is a rather challenging game. 10/10 for one of the best experiences in gaming history, and for the amount of love the game dev put into this! Thank you for such a wonderful game.			"

												Absolutely the best contemporary point-and-click adventure game I've played in years - and I play a lot of adventure games. The characters, the story, the dystopian retro-cyberpunk setting and the clever, yet logical, puzzles all contribute to making this a beautiful adventure that deserves to be praised and regarded as a classic in the years to come. The game also contains several easter eggs and secrets which, along with the branching dialogue paths in the story, the behind-the-scenes commentary, and the alternative solutions to puzzles, should contribute to its re-playability factor.The only aspects that I find mar this otherwise flawless gem include the combat scenes (which feature quite heavily towards the end - yes, you can die), the inability to change the resolution from the in-game options menu (which led to some heavy pixellation on my 1920x1080 screen) and the lingering sense that your in-game decisions don't have a large effect on the conclusion of the story.

												I really liked this game. It felt like a sort of modern old school point and click adventure. The story is great, the athmosphere is amazing and I really liked the graphics (despite being really sick of pixel art in general). There is something hypnotic about the background animations, like water dripping from a drain pipe etc. Great detail.There where a few down sides though. There is a bit of pixel hunting, which comes with the territory I guess. Also, the entire game spans only a few locations. It works well, but it does feel a bit reused at some point. I like the contained setting all in all though.			"

												This is a great sci-fi noir point-and-click adventure game, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in that sort of thing.  The highest praise I can give it is that while not all of the puzzles are easily resolved, after finishing the more difficult ones I found myself saying, ""Oh, of course,"" rather than ""What the hell?""  It has good logic and excellent design.  The only downside is that there are a few repetitive puzzles that go on for longer than they need to, but even these make sense within the story.  It's a good play; pick it up!			"

I was expecting your standard point and click adventrure game, but this one has really set the bar high on impressive storytelling and unexpected twists.This is a gem for anyone who loves adventure game and deep stories. In this you start play as a detective who looks for a man who can find him where his brother is, but he never turns up for your meeting and so you go looking for him. This friend also knows the location of your character's brother, who he's trying to find.You also get to play as one of the prisoners in a rehabilitation centre omnimously named, Centre 7. You play as a man named Delta-Six who has his memory erased for the second time because he had attempted to escape. As him you attempt to break out yet again.Again, I highly recommend it to everyone.			"

At one point the saves didn't load anymore, so I just watched the rest of the story on youtube.			"

												Gemini Rue is a very good point n click game.  Both sound and graphics hit my taste right on the spot. It is a short game so don’t expect 40 hours of gameplay.The noir touch and story go awesome together. I enjoyed the game so much I replayed it only for the developer commentaries and it felt worth the while. Recommend buying for a rainy weekend.Regards McNoobsen			"

												I wanted to like this game soo badly since I love all the Wadjet Eye games I've played so far - but I just couldn't bear to finish it. The user interface in this game is absolutely terrible and everything feels clunky/buggy. The story and graphics are great, but that's about it. The story, which I finished by watching a walkthrough video, was absolutely amazing and almost made me wish that I stuck with it despite the annoyances.. Annoyances:- Terrible / non-existant game menus- Restoring a saved game from a rainy area has a bug where the graphics get all messed up for half the screen- Cover positions for shooting feel like they have weird keystroke/timing delays- Constant issues with path finding - always getting stuck on things on way to a door/exit for a scene- Some doors/exits have unusually small click areas toward very edges of the screen which is annoying to target- Every action is in a small pop-up menu that only comes up when right-clicking an object or person. There's no default actions for the most basic things such as having a left-click on a person start to talk or left-click on a door try to open it. You have to constantly right-click for everything which gets tedious. - Some of the hidden objects seem like they're two pixels in width so you can only find by mouse scanning versus being attentive to each scene- Puzzles are more difficult to solve due to user interface confusion. I aquired two objects, one which is needed to fix the other, and couldn't figure out how to use them on each other. Due to having to right-click an object to get that pop-up menu (also the only area to see your inventory), how do I combine two items that are both in my inventory? Well I have to right-click on a completely unrelated object to get the pop-up menu, at which point (according to a walkthrough video I saw) I should only need to click the object in my inventory that does the repairing. In the video I saw it worked, but it wasn't working at all for me so this is where I rage quit. It's impossible to differentiate between glitches, bad UI, and missing part of the puzzle along the way.			"

												A great game from WadjetEyeGames. Unlike Primordia or Shardlight the puzzles aren't that hard to solve and therefor is great for a bigger playerbase.(Sometimes it's about finding the correct pixels and most of the time it's quite obvious what to do.)While playing it turns out you are able to switch between Characters and at the end of the game you finally get to know how those people are connected->You will never expect that.Great Story. From my perspective one of the best Point and Clicks.I hope WadjetEyeGames will produce more such games as they have proven to make really good dystopian games.			"

												I really wanted to like Gemini Rue. The story and atmosphere are both great, and they're the reason I played through to the end.Unfortunately, they're the only things that work.Everything else, from the awful voice acting, to the puzzles which are either childishly simple or difficult only because of the poor interface, to the consistently awkward dialogue, drags this game way, way down.Worst of all is the combat. Genuinely some of the worst game design I've ever seen, the shootouts in this game control atrociously and are basically all play out exactly the same. You simply wait for the opponent to stop shooting, poke your head out, wait 2 seconds, press CTRL to hold your breath, then fire when the enemy reappears. Or, that's what's supposed to happen, except the unresponsive controls are likely to ignore your commands and get you killed. Then it's back to the previous save, which is ALWAYS several screens and a long conversation ago. There's no challenge, strategy or fun to be had. Fortunately, there's only a handful of shootouts, but that'd plenty to ruin the experience even without the other issues.Actually, the entire game is very short. Although, that may not be a criticism.			"

												I'm not finding this one nearly as fun as Shardlight, Primordia, or Technobabylon so far.  Actually I'm quitting and may not come back to it.  I find the gun mechanic irritating and not fun, a few of the puzzles are unintuitive in the ""you didn't hover the mouse over the right spot to find the answer"" variety.  The story is really good, and I think if they had done it more in the style of the three games I mentioned above it would have been far better.  I find myself just wanting to advance the plot more in the style of other Wadjet Eye games, and not constantly fiddle with mini-games.  I would recommend it if there were not several other, better games from the same company.  If you want a Cyberpunk adventure game, Technobabylon is far better.			"

 Positive + A genuinely intriguing story in a futuristic noir setting; watching the mystery of Azriel Odin and Delta-Six unravel throughout the course of the 5 ½ hour campaign does not drag on in the slightest, with a satisfying conclusion to top it all off+ In the style of older point and click games (most notably Beneath a Steel Sky), Gemini Rue’s gameplay is a tried and tested formula that doesn’t fail to test the player at times with somewhat obscure puzzles, while still remaining fairly linear+ The game also manages to effectively capture the graphical style of said older games, with both pixelated environments and character models giving the game a distinctive look; the sound effects and music as well are very well-implemented+ The amateur voice acting that accompanies the story is surprisingly well-done--especially the main characters--making the games futuristic/noir setting all the more authentic. Negative - The few shooting sections, while a nice addition to the point and click gameplay, suffer from awkward controls and mechanics (luckily these sections are few and far between)- The amount of environments and backgrounds is scarce, leading to you treading familiar ground far too often; some more locations to explore wouldn’t go amiss. Verdict “Gemini Rue pays homage to point and click games from the past, while still managing to feel both old and new. With an unforgettable story and quirky puzzles, the few gameplay sections that may try to detract from the experience couldn’t manage to deter me from playing through this gem. I’d easily recommend this game to fans of old adventure games.” 8/10 TJBs  "

												Very nice game which is obviously trying very hard to draw parallels with both ""Beneath a Steel Sky"" and ""Blade Runner"". Storywise it's up there with the very best of sci-fi gaming, with plenty of mystery, intrigue and plot twists where you least expect them. It's very beautiful to look at, in a VGA sort of way....and the sound design is top notch too. I know some people didn't care for the voice acting but it seemed fine to me. Even if the ""grizzled hardboiled"" protagonist sounds like Harvey Fierstein imitating Marlon Brando :DUnfortunately the interface is needlessly cumbersome. Rather than, say, left-click to look and right-click to use like the aforementioned Sky which they so liberally borrow from, you have to right-click, choose which part of your body you want to use to interact with an item and then click on it. It gets even more complicated when you gain a sidekick and have to drag them around in the same way. If you come across a ladder, do you use your foot or your hand on it? Actually, either works, but why give us the choice? ""Use"" really should be context-appropriate nowadays as most of the choices the player is given are either stupid (You're not going to use your mouth on the ladder) or don't matter (hand or foot works)....Oh, points also deducted for introducing a needless real-time combat system. Adventure games don't need real-time combat. I thought we learned this with Harvester, Blade Runner, Maddog Williams....at least Full Throttle let you skip the arcade sections if you didn't want to do them....			"

												Gemini Rue is a mixed bag. Unfortunately, for me the good parts were outweighed by the game's many annoyances.On the positive side, Gemini Rue has pretty strong pixel art which holds up well in comparison to similar games from the Golden Age of adventure gaming. The palette choices work well in evoking a dystopian sci-fi atmosphere. The writing is pretty good too, with a couple of caveats--an overly predictable plot twist, and some eye-rolling philosophical monologue at the endgame. Voice acting is uneven, but serves its purpose. The music is quite good, but is sadly rather sparse.And now for a list of complaints:The artwork often obscures point-and-click hotspots. (It's not ""hunt the pixel"" bad, just needs some higher contrast and larger hotspots in a few places.)The option to skip some walking animations is taken away part-way through the game, and is never returned.There's no automation of obvious (and cumbersome) interactions. Card-access doorways, ladders, and elevators become annoying obstacles, with no gameplay benefit.A couple of puzzles are pretty bad. The ""lights out"" puzzle (which appears twice!) felt so out of place that it took me out of the game. Another puzzle left me with the impression that the player character is too stupid to figure out on his own how to plug in an extension cord.The control scheme for moving boxes is completely decoupled from the basic point-and-click mechanics. Why?Inventory management has a poor interface. If I want to read an inventory item, I have to first click an unrelated hotspot on the screen just to bring up the inventory.Most puzzle solutions are pleasingly rational, but we're not entirely free of the adventure game curse of ""dream logic"".There's a pretty good adventure game here, but it's sadly obscured by interface problems. If you are an adventure game fan who can look past some of these warts, you might be able to have a good time with Gemini Rue. "

												Great story, music, and overall world design bogged down by the inherent tedium of point and click gameplay (in a game that, at times, requires both timing and precision) made worse by a horrible, ""whack-a-mole"" style combat mechanic. Check it out if you're desparate for a well-written cyperpunk noir accompanied by a solid soundtrack (and only if it's on sale), but probably not worth the trouble for the casual gamer (just setting it up on Windows 10 requires trial and error with compatibility settings and, even then, there's the issue of save file locations) - even in the case of the former (which is where I was when I bought it), the rough edges of this gem made it pretty hard to enjoy.

												It's a point-and-click adventure game of the older variety (puzzling puzzles and all), which, for some reason, puts some people off from the very outset. Assuming you're not from that group, however, you will find a game with a pretty unique and intriguing story, accompanied by a very fitting noir atmosphere (I hesitate to call it cyberpunk, though similar themes are employed) and well executed retro graphics. On the other hand, the story and the atmosphere are the good parts of the game.Why do I say that? Well, even when it works the controls, particularly those for shooting, are a bit of an annoyance. The game would've been better without those action sequences, but alas, they're there and can be endured. The main complaint, however, is that the game is rather buggy in game-breaking ways. There are workarounds, but it still makes it a bad product. For example, on Windows 7 x64, the first thing one has to do is to turn the Steam overlay off, or else any alt-tabbing or shift-tabbing means that all dialogue will be in fast-forward mode, making it impossible to follow the plot. Resonance, another game from the same developer, has the same issue, so at least I kind of knew about it.Next, after a restart my saves just disappeared. Turns out this can be fixed by moving them from \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gemini Rue\reslists\Savesto \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gemini Rue\Saves but why should I have to? Oh, and the escape key needed to access the menu sometimes stops working, at which point one should apparently realize that hitting shift first helps. Oh well, at least I didn't have to patch the game with specific versions of DLL files, but that reportedly happens too.Now, if you are willing to subject yourself to all of that, there's a nice, really well-voiced sci-fi story in it for you.  If not, you're probably just being sensible. Either way, I can't really recommend paying full price for the game. Sales level prices, yes, but perhaps only to fans of the genre.			"

												In the end, I was a little disappointed with this game.The starting point is very good, the atmosphere is captivating, and the interaction of the characters with the world has been carefully done. However, as the game progresses, the magic breaks apart: The script goes through more conventional routes, the world feels small and at some point  you wonder if the story actually makes sense (I dont think it does). It is a shame, because it looked so great, but I cant recommend this game. Also, the interface is really bad, but that's a minor quibble.			"

												Looks like a promising game and in the time i played it, i did have fun. HOWEVER when i wanted to play it the other day, i realized that it didnt save my game, although I did save it via the save game option when last i played it. Also loading the autosave file was not possible either because of ""file not found"". What the hell? Stuff like this is majorly game breaking for me since I see no point in playing a game that doesnt let me save and where i am in danger of having to start all over again every time I start it. So thats why it's a thumbs down from me.			"

												After reading so many reviews which mostly recommended this game, I decided to buy one. The storyline and the atmosphere are both great, no doubt. However, the clicking part (which is the main part of Point&Click games) is unbearable. I tried to do the right click to make the characters run, but they don't. I had to click so many times all the way to the destination, then interact right in front of the object. Thinking when you're chased by enermies or sneak through them. You have to response quickly, yet you spend so much time on clicking and then you die. The combat is the worst of all. This is probably the game that has the worst control I have ever played.If you really want to play it. Wait for the cheapest deal. But I recommend not to waste your money on it at all.			"

												First off I'll say I've enjoyed every part of this game.  Its got great atmosphere, well built puzzles, and so far not a lot in the way of head scratching time.But it has a huge bug that's never been fixed.  In both my attempts to play through this game I've lost all my save games between play sessions.  Everything saves and loads fine in game but when you quit and come back later all the save files are gone and the auto save just brings up an error. "

												The story seems interesting but the ""fight"" scenes are super annoying. They are not too hard, but they interrupt the flow very often and have unintuitive controls. On top of that there are some sitations where you just get shot for not doing the correct thing immedaitely. You will not loose any progress, because the game is fair enough to autosave at the beginning of such scenes, but dying 5 times before figuring out the correct sequence of doing things is just annoying. This might have been a try to make the game more interesting, but ultimately it failed.			"

Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  If you absolutely love adventure games (I don't) AND sci-fi noir (I do), then you might still be tempted to try this.

That being said, this was an awkward attempt at recapturing that same magic.			"

												Gemini Rue is a pretty standard point-and-click adventure with a fantastic plot. It appears to be a straight and to-the-point point-and-click adventure game telling a story in a no-nonsense dystopian future involving a detective searching for his brother imprisoned within a testing facility. But when you learn that the facility is for rehabilitating criminals by wiping their memories and starting them with a fresh slate, it begins to make you question what makes us who we really are.Despite being fairly low-res, the game does look good. However, it does not cooperate well with multi-monitors, the Steam overlay, and alt-tabbing. Also, the save system stores saves in two separate locations depending on how you launch the game. The actual point-and-clicking is fairly standard, but there are a few points in the game involving some really sub-par combat that the game could have gone without. These broken systems all make the game's presentation feel a lot cheaper and incredibly fragile to run. I'd rate this game higher if it wasn't for these issues, but they were so prevalent that it bugged me every time I played. If you can overlook functional bugs, definitely see your way through this game for a fantastic finale. 3 out of 5 foxes.			"

												If you like a good story, set in a dark future where man has colonized space and is divided in several societies which all seem to be Orwellian in nature, you'll like this game. The game's atmosphere comes across really well and the oldskool graphics add to a the feeling of melancholia for old games. The gameplay mechanics are really well done and intuitive for anyone who played at least one adventure game in his/her life. I like how you can use your smart device to make notes, search for information, and call people you know. You play as at least two characters (haven't finished the game yet, so I'm not sure about this): an ex-assassin, which reminded me somehow of Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant, waiting in a city to pick up a friend with his spaceship; and a guy called delta-six who's stuck in a Big Brother rehabilitation facility with his memory wiped. The voices in the game go from above average to excellent and make you care for the characters because they become almost real people.I'm a sucker for atmosphere and story, so if you like movies such as Blade Runner and The Dark City you should pick this one up!

Most of the game is voiced, couldnt believe it was such a small download for this much content. I've been playing it non stop. Cant seem to play anything else. The story just grabs you, and the game has such good gameplay. I hate adventure games where i have to go google for a complex puzzle solution. This game, doesnt get me frustrated one bit. I enjoy earning Achievements and exploring every inch of the universe. The puzzles are logical and easy, but complex enough to make you feel like you are accomplishing something. Im sad that im going to finish this oneday ! I dont want it to end. There are really so few good Sci Fi games out there that just engross you in it's world. This is wirth $20 in my book.			"

												Gemini Rue is a short but impressive retro-style point and click adventure game. It presents itself in a very Blade Runner/Cowboy Bebop-ish style, which clicks well with the fresh storyline and atmospheric music. It is clear that the dev draws inspiration from these two titles since he even mentions it in the included developer's commentary mode, and includes cameo appearences of the main Cowboy Bebop characters.  I very much enjoyed the puzzles, which are not overly complicated, but gradually become more challenging by cleverly combining the basic actions that are available to your character. The only negative I can think of is that some interactive items may be difficult to immediately spot because of the pixel art style.			"

The most interesting part of the game is when a certain gameplay mechanic is used to tell the story. I won't give any spoilers away, but it worked very well. There were times where I got frustrated trying to progress because I didn't perform certain actions in the right order, but for the most part the puzzles were straightforward. The game includes developer commentary that gives insightful tidbits in the mind of the developer. I highly recommend this game. Pros:+ Good voice acting+ Excellent story combined with an interesting gameplay mechanic+ Good musicCons:- Some minor visual glitches- Certains puzzles were difficult due to items blending in with the background making it hard to find.

												Gemini Rue is a point and click adventure game with sparse and limited fighting mechanics in various stages of the game that takes place in a dystopian sci-fi future that could be inspired easily from movies like Blade Runner. As it is expected, you explore the environment and interact with people and objects in order to solve puzzles and eventually proceed. There is also an item called the communicator which lets you communicate with various characters throughout the game but also provides you with all the necessary information and mission status.You play the role of a man named Azriel who was an ex assassin but now has left his past behind him and works as an officer against the organized crime which is run by a mafia-like group called the Boryokudan. Your formal mission is to aid a man who later helps you on your true mission which is to acquire information about your lost brother Daniel. After infiltrating the Boryokudans and reaviling that there is a secret facility where people are sent there to have their memory whipped out and re-trained to become criminals and that your brother was sent there, you gather your crew and set a new mission, rescuing your brother. The storyline despite being short is quite compelling and there are nice twists at the end as expected. The overall theme of the game is nicely expressed through the art style with retro like graphics and atmospheric music. However, I would really prefer it if instead the 16 bit overlay the visuals were a little more detailed. In comparison, the audio quality is really impressive for being an indie game. The audio logs are rich and clearly there was put a lot of effort into it. So, the audio and visuals are not side by side in my opinion. All in all, Gemini Rue is a solid adventure game following the steps of the classic ones, yet it feels fresh and modernized. All friends of the adventure genre should definitely try out this game.

												As soon as the game started, I took a silly guess on what will be the plot of the story. I was surprised and amused when my silly guess was right. The most important thing for me in games is the story, and unfortunately I didn't like the story in this game. The entertainment value in the gameplay is also very important and in this game I had to struggle through the bad gameplay. The pixel animation is minimal (I spilled my drink laughing when I saw that an unconscious character was put on the table, not on the sofa, because I guess the devs didn't feel like to draw a lying character in the proper position for the sofa) and the pixel art is often smeared and out of focus. I would not recommend this Point & Click adventure game, because it's very boring and predictable.

												Not sure how I ended up with this game, I don't typically like point & click adventure games. It always frustrates me when a good story is locked behind stupid puzzles that don't make sense. The matches doesn't go with the candle or cigarette. The matches are used on the envelope to gain the wax seal that's inside it.However, the fact it was in my Steam library and the Very Positive reviews convienced me to give this one a shot. But guess what? Same old Point & Click Adventure game: What seems like a decent story hidden behind dumbass puzzles that don't make sense. I had to use a guide to play the game as repeatedly got stuck with no idea how to move the story along.The voice acting starts to grate on your ears as you hear the same phrases repeated time and again while trying different inventory combos to see if you are able to move the story along. In the end, for me, it was just not worth the effort.			"

												Overall: Gemini Rue offers an okay story with awful controls. There are better games to play.StoryGemini Rue aims to deliver a galaxy-wide mystery with just 2 locations and a small cast of characters. It's not bad, but it feels empty. ControlsThe controls drag the whole game down.Getting through some doors is difficultFor most of the doors, you interact with them once to open them. Then you click again on the opening to walk through them.But for some of the doors, where you need to click to walk through them is very odd. For example, a few of the buildings have you walk through a stairwell. To go through those doors, you have to click outside of what's drawn on the screen.Mouse cursor gets stuck on the edge of the screenWhen I moved my mouse cursor to the edge of the screen, it would often get stuck. I'd have to swipe around on my touchpad a lot to get it unstuck. This happened dozens of times on my playthrough.Gunplay is tediousWhat you want gunfighting to be: exciting, heart-pumpingWhat gunfighting is like in Gemini Rue: ""One Mississippi, Two Mississippi...""Several times in the game you'll enter a gunfight. In this mode, there are the following controls:A, S, D -  move left out of cover, return to cover, move right out of coverW - switch which enemy you're targetingR - reload (only works while in cover)Spacebar - shootCtrl - hold breath (only while out of cover). This causes a bar to slide up into a green zone. It takes about 3 seconds. If you shoot an enemy while it's in this zone, it will instantly kill them.The battles just devolve into the following:1. Enemy cycles between shooting at you and taking cover. A given enemy will always take cover for the same amount of time.2. Count how long they take cover for. 3. Time holding your breath with how long the enemy takes cover to get an instant kill.A few times, I found myself doing the following:  I'd press A to move out of cover to the left. Then I'd press D to try to move back into cover. But that doesn't work. You have to hit S. I think this is unintuitive. If you've associated A/D with left/right then A/D should always move you one notch to the left/right. Needless complication when interacting with objectsThe game provides 4 main different actions for interacting with objects and people:- Eye (look)- Hand- Mouth (speak)- FootThe differentiation between Hand and Foot wasn't interesting enough to warrant the added complication.

												I really really tried to like and get into this game but I just couldn't. The general concept is neat, but the voice acting is meh and some of the voice lines are really cliche or cringy. The mechanics of the game felt a little stiff. Combat in particular was not great. There were a couple times in the ~4 hours I played where I just got really confused on what to do due to lack of direction. The music was probably my favorite thing about the game.			"

												I would really like to recommend this game, as the story seems intriguing, but I ran into several issues:- while the pixel-art style might work on lower resolutions, on my 1920x1080 monitor it turned really muddy and details became hardly visible- there seem to be several problems with the save system: when I saved in outside scenes, half of the screen turned black (developers are aware of this and wrote that this is really difficult to fix). Also my first savegame simply disappeared when I reloaded the game and the autosave couldn't be found by the game. I had to start from the beginning.- the gun fight mechanic is overly complicated and I got annoyed by it quicklyOverall less than mediocre for me.			"

												Gemini Rue is a retro-style point and click adventure set on an incredibly atmospheric and stylish backdrop with an engrossing story and deeply challenging puzzles. It has all the hallmarks of classic games within the genre and is of a quality that puts some big-budget modern games to shame today. You assume the role of two characters in this intertwining story;- Azriel Odin; a former assassin who is searching for his brother whilst looking for personal redemption for his past; and a mysterious hospital patient named 'Delta Six' who's memory has been wiped for reasons unknown. Your job is to collectively discover the secrets that exist in this bleak, corrupt and crime-riddled world and provide a resolution to your characters's plight. As the narrative develops and the story unfolds; you will be hooked. For such a simple 2D game; the story is truly absorbing along with the fully-voiced characters each with an intriguing personality.The user interface is also extremely well implemented which is pivotal as this game demands complete precision in the execution of tasks and puzzles. It is incredibly complex at times and you will be forgiven for having to look up the occasional solution but it is a testament to the developers on how to create a challenging, thought-provoking and engrossing game. If you're a veteran of the genre, a fan of adventure games or just looking for a story-driven title that offers a rewarding challenge; Gemini Rue is absolutely unmissable. It captures the essence of classic games perfectly and delivers a powerful and intriguing experience throughout. One of the best titles on Steam			"

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get running on any modern computer, and it is sorely outdated in terms of graphics and gameplay. The interface is cumbersome, the puzzles are unchallenging or the most basic timing puzzles that get very tedious quickly. The story is only mildly interesting, certainly not engaging enough to justify the price of nearly $10: paying a month of Netflix and watching The X-Files would be more satisfying for that price. There have been save file issues for me, as well, so any progress made is in danger of being lost for reasons I have no clue about. I usually don't mind old school style and feel, but this game simply turned out to be annoying. It was a huge disappointment for me.			"

												I appreciate this game, but some troubles with the puzzles and the UI leave more to be desired.The adventure game this one reminds me of is Beneath a Steel Sky.  The graphics are horribly pixilated, just as games from that era were with audio and voice acting to make up for the lack of graphical attractiveness.  And it does make up for it in those areas, the characters have parts that are well written and well performed with a very human story to go alongside it.The story is one I can appreciate.  The story follows two brothers, one trying to escape a station after having his memory wiped several times and the other trying to find the station and rescue his brother.  I liked it, the reveal happened a lot earlier than the real reveal and the major reveal becomes a lot more predictable the longer you go on through the game.  However, the writing is self-aware of its own predictability and manages use it as part of the build up -to the expected result- without insulting your intellect.  Instead of happening with an unexpected bang, it happens with a silent drone of acceptance, which I thought was what the author was trying to get and fits in with the environment they were building.Most adventure games tell stories of odd worlds and go out of the way to say how different this world is from the one we live in.  This game tries hard to explain the world with experience and view we can relate to, emphasizing the people without dwelling on the sci fi, dystopia, or technology.  From that standpoint, the game is a lot more serious than most of the games filling the adventure genre.The UI and puzzles hold the experience back somewhat.  The puzzles follow the standard point and click or dialogue variety with some machine operation and event type obstacles alongside it.  The gunplay they added to the game was clunky and annoying to do.  It's easy once you manage to figure it out but it feels like something to pad the length of the game.  Some of the puzzles also have this feel, as if they were made just to lengthen the game by making you repeat content and without adding to immersion.  The UI also soured me.  It is not terrible, but some of the user unfriendly conventions of early adventure games were adopted alongside the art style.  I did have some problems trying to figure out how to use items in my inventory together, something infrequent in this game and I wish I gave more thought to the tooltip telling me how to do it the one time I had to during the game.In all, I'd say it has the bones of a good adventure game and is at least as good as the games it emulates.  Unfortunately, the UI, gunplay, and some of the puzzles leave the experience feeling clunky.  A good find for adventure game fans, less so for everyone else.			"

												Having played many adventure games (closest comparison in setting to this probably Beneath A Steel Sky or Dreamweb), I unfortunately feel this is quite a bit below average.The story was... middle of the road. Slightly engaging in part, tedious and slow in part, not very long (my time spent is mostly idling). The main issue is that what your time is spent on is very tedious, niggling clicks to get from place to place. If you are using a touchpad, this is unbearable.Leftclick on a door to go through it. It's closed. Rightclick to open tiny action box. Leftclick on tiny hand icon to open door. Leftclick on doorway to enter. EVERY door requires rightclick-leftclick-leftclick. The screen area is quite small, so walking across a single area needs several clicks. You will often be lost and spend time backtracking, so it's basically an endless clickfest to do mundane actions whilst going through a very slow and not very engaging story.Dialogue is stilted and unnatural, voiceovers medium minus, classic immersion-damaging techniques (puzzle requires an item, the item does the task but breaks), very cliche plot devices, artificial constraints (you have lockpicks, and there's endless locked doors you cannot use them on). I feel there are much better ways to spend $10. Only for really hardcore adventure completionists desperate for the setting.			"

												Point and click adventure, movement feels sometimes wonkey, puzzles sometimes cryptic, but they add a certain charm to the game. There is a great amount of detail in the point-and-click interaction that gives a sense of realism to the world. I wish, however, that they had spent more time deveopping the setting and the characters. This is because the story is full of promise and philosophical intrigue, but falls very short due to the poor delivery that the somewhat shallow,predictable and underdevelopped cast dish out. Still, the story is surprisingly good. Overall 7/10, in between recommending and not, but slightly skewed to not.			"

												If you're a fan of Bladerunner, Cowboy Bebop, Firefly, even Mass Effect, then this game is for you.

He is on a mission to find his brother who he hasn't talked to in 10 years. Ugh, so much is going through my mind right now, even a bit depressed... All I have to say is that this game is a 10/10 Game of the Year of All Years.			"

												I’m a bit biased since I don’t like adventure games. The stories are often juvenile, puzzle solutions defy logic and the games themselves don’t have much adventure. The best I can do is say that Gemini Rue isn’t terrible but too many people here are going way overboard on their praise of this game.The main reason to play adventure games (I think) is for the story. GR’s is a cut above most of what you’ll find in the adventure genre but it’s still not what I’d call “good”. It’s simply okay. Nothing particularly memorable, though there are at least a few twists thrown in.Likewise, I loathe navigating through the UIs in these games because they often turn simple tasks into complex ones because of poor design. GR has several moments like this, too, where you’ll know what has to be done but have to figure out the exact way the game prefers you do it.I will give it some points for puzzles at least having rational solutions instead of falling into the trap of “adventure game logic”. When you have to reach a ledge, for example, you’ll pull over a crate to stand on instead of throwing a rubber chicken at a cat who will get a dog to chase it who will knock over a vase which will startle a mule into kicking you up to the ledge. Again, though, it’s so annoying to have to point and click around to figure out the exact right combination of menu instructions to get up on the crate & climb up to the ledge. I’d much rather have a jump or climb button and be playing a different game.The gunfight minigame is a nice diversion from all the pointing and clicking but is inferior to any action game. It was a fun challenge, at least, to get the Steam achievement for not getting hit once during them.The graphics are retro, which means they are not so great and are around mid-1990s standards. Considering this, they at least do a good job of conveying the “dirty future” atmosphere the game is going for and set an appropriate mood.So if you like adventure games, I’d say you will enjoy GR. If you aren’t crazy about the genre, though, you won’t find anything here to change your mind.			"

												Everything about this game stinks of plagiarism from Phillip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥ and films based on his work (Blade Runner and Total Recall in particular), but the narrative and dialogue lack any sense of subtlety. The writer apparently hasn't got an original thought in his head, but is very impressed with himself for having passed Philosophy 101. For a game that makes a big deal about free will, it's kind of ironic that there are literally no choices to be made, no story branches, nothing that you can do that will affect the plot in the slightest. At least most of the visuals are nice. The puzzles are mostly pretty straightforward once you acquire the necessary items and information, but there's a lot of plodding around just picking up random crap wondering where it will come in handy. There are maps of a city that you're in for much of the game, but you can't even explore most of what it shows- you're a cop chasing leads, and literally everyone lives in TWO apartment buildings.The game is also plagued by some serious bugs, which for some users could prevent them from running it at all, or cause crashes that prevent further progress. It took me quite a bit of research just to get it running, and then a lot of trial and error to get past one such bug, but I did manage to make it to the end. Not particularly glad I did. It's all very predictable, and incredibly preachy. Not recommended.			"

The game is fairly short and can finished in roughly 8 hours.  Gemini Rue is definitely worth the buy at $10 or less.			"

												Wouldn't expect this game to be so impressive. Great story telling which will leave you questioning your exsistence. The game itself is just like any other standard Point & click adventure game, which could really put off the younger audiences. but i myself enjoyed it even though the only adventure game i played was 'Hopkins FBI'. The puzzels arent all that difficult. but they do make you think. if you are really stuck you could easily open up a guide through your steam internet browser. once you check the guide you will realise how dumb you are for not figuring this part out (personal experience). The combat is unique and a little annyoing. it is a cover system which if you fail you will either load from an autosave at the beggining of the scene or 5 minutes away ( depends on the sequence) Luckily there isnt too much combat which adds a nicer atmosphere in my opinion. you should definatly try this game out no matter if you are a hardcore adventure fan which has played every adventure game ever since the 90s or a person who just plays call of duty. I think this game has changed my opinion of adventure games and i will definetly be playing some other adventure games. I really hope to see a the developer continue making games in this genre maybe a sequal or even a prequal. i wouldnt mind maybe seeing a game set in the same universe as the lore is really diverse. The game will provide you with maybe 5-8 of gameplay depending on your skill. which may seem quite short but remember that this is an indie game with a price tag of 6.99£.EDITI forgot to mention an annoying bug which at times the game will skip all the dialouge at times, if that happens reload an earlier save, if you dont mind not hearing what a character said you can save and load the game and they might reapeat themselves.

												Gemini Rue is one of my favorite games, and it gets better every time I play. It's set in a gritty blade runner-esq world, except with interstellar travel. It follows two characters as they try to acomplish their own goals- finding a lost brother, and escaping a prison that wipes your memory when you try to escape. The characters are well-developed, although there's some backstory that could certainly be explored further. The game is amazingly rendered with faux-16 bit graphics, hand drawn.

												Gemini Rue's a cyberpunk-noir point-and-click adventure game in the style of Lucasarts' classic catalogue.It's well-written, features a couple of standout voice performances--I particularly enjoy Azriel--and almost none of the cringeworthy, ""developer's brother's friend in a closet"" stuff you might expect from what was formerly a student project. You'll see some of the plot coming before it does, but the game raises some decent, Intro to Philosophy-level discussion material about what makes us all human.The pixel backgrounds are gorgeous, and the soundtrack's apes Vangelis' Blade Runner score in all the right ways. Moody saxaphones back up Azriel's rain-soaked journey into his past; clinical synths bounce and settle underneath Delta-Six's retraining in the mysterious Center 7. Everything comes together to form the atmosphere that is perhaps Gemini Rue's strongest asset.Gameplay-wise, the puzzles feel good and about as hard as they should. The combat mini-game isn't a high point--though it's neither frustrating. If you're an old hand with adventure games, you'll probably clear this in 4-6 hours. At worst, 10.Enjoy it as you would a good book over a couple of rainy afternoons.			"

												Gemini Rue is a point-and-click adventure game with a noire-ish science fiction theme (kind of like Blade Runner). This game was developed with Adventure Game Studio, so the graphics are extremely low resolution by any standard (320 x 200). In spite of this very low standard of graphics, the game plays very well. The point-and-click mechanics all work very well, you can interact with the environment, use inventory items, climb boxes and ladders, and engage in dialogs with characters. The main appeal of Gemini Rue is the sci-fi story. It is a very ambitious and dramatic story told without a hint of sarcasm. There are times when the story really pulls you in, which is the sign of a good story.There are also times were the story falls flat, where you can tell that the writer is a very ambitious college student (Josh Nuernburger). For instance, Boryokudan means ""violent gang"" in Japanese, and is the official, boring name that Japanese police have given the Yakuza so they sound less romantic. It seems Mr. Nuernberger decided Japanese was cool and typed ""mafia"" into an online translator. The way this word is pronounced by the voice actors is also bad. ""Boryokudan"" is very difficult for an English speaker to say correctly, and the voice actors have merely pronounced the word as it is spelled, with no attempt at approximating the Japanese pronunciation.The voice acting for the main characters is very good. Azriel (the main character) and the Director are excellent. For some of the lesser characters (the street vendor in particular) it seems that they just grabbed somebody off the street to read the lines.There is some challenge to this game in terms of figuring out what is going on and what is the logical next action to take, so it is engaging without being too difficult. There are a few puzzles in the game but none that I got stuck on. There were two instances where I got stuck and consulted a walkthrough, but this won't be necessary for most people (I tend to get impatient). There are a few action sequences involving shooting which are very easy.Overall I would say this is an excellent game for people who like point-and-click adventures and sci-fi stories. While very enjoyable, tt is not a perfect game and the graphics and production can seem a little amateurish at times.			"

												Gemini RueAn indie game reminiscent of old classic adventure games. Good story, but ugly. Not a must buy, but I think you should give it a try.Most importantly, do not bother watching the trailer. I think it does a poor job at selling the game.The story, well written dialogue, and voice acting are the greatest aspects of the game. The story is noir style in a dystopian future. Not a masterpiece, but it kept me interested enough to want to play to the end. The story is told from two points of view. In a dark sombre future you play as a detective, piecing together clues to find your brother. In parallel, you play as ""Delta-Six"", an inmate in a mysterious prison-like facility, slowly uncovering its secrets, unsure who to trust.The puzzles are not overly difficult: I never had to resort to a guide for help. One puzzle was particularly frustrating. It required the correct dialogue choices in a conversation. It felt more like trial and error than a logical puzzle.Graphics look old and blocky. The screenshots shown above are representative of the final product. Not a selling point of the game, but I did not mind.There are some gunfights. I did not care for them, but they were well suited to the noir setting.The UI is ... unique. Particularly, an odd design choice was to allow you to access your inventory only by right-clicking on an object in the game world. No biggie. Another annoyance is that when a second character follows you around, sometimes they might block an entrance/exit, e.g. a door.A greater annoyance is the save files of this game. When you start the game, you get a window with 2 options: either ""play"" the game, or ""configure"" the game's settings. If you choose ""configure"", you go to a new window where you find a button called ""save and run"". So those are the 2 ways to start up the game.  The problem is that, depending on which way you started the game, the location of the save files are different. For more information on this problem, look at the game's steam forums.I've played some indie games in the past that felt amateurish, as though it were a school project. For example, controls felt bad, or graphical eyesores when a character moves across the screen or when the camera pans across the scene. None of these problems manifested in the game.			"

												Great story and logical puzzles. There were a few puzzles that tripped me up, but nothing major. I appreciate this since I don't want to spend hours stuck on a single puzzle like I would in my youth. But I also don't think the puzzles were overly easy. They were just right. And the story and atmosphere of the game is absolutely fantastic. Some complain about the shooting sequences, but I honestly didn't think they were that big of a deal. I found it fairly easy to use, and if you die, it's not a big deal to try again. Overall, it's an excellent point-and-click adventure for fans of the genre. Highly recommended.			"

												First, get past the bad points: the graphic looks like it was done for some 16 bit platform in the early ninties (it looks absolutely horrifying on today's hardware and no attempt is done to alleviate its ugliness (fake scan lines, interpolating, anything)) and the controls are badly thought out and cumbersome.But, things is, you will get past these. The voice acting is mostly great, the dialogue well-written and the story, which, at first, is a somewhat cliched (but still well done) sci-fi noir, touches on some philosophical matters.  And really, it's the core of it all, the story. The puzzles (which are mostly well done, though ocassionaly it involves some pixel-hunting) and the minigames are only there to keep the story going and to let you submerge in it. The soundtrack is sparse but still, very atmospheric (and can't deny that it's been, er, inspired by the Blade Runner soundtrack) and yes, I have to return to the voice acting: it's really good. "

The voice acting is alright, and some of the puzzles could use a bit more clues but sifting through this Bladerunner-esque future world of gangs and brain washing brings about such yearning to play more that all those mistakes can be forgotten. If you want a great story and a little bit of change to the usual point and click, get this game. Otherwise, you are just living a rue.			"

												From a technical standpoint this game is a disaster. At first I had troubles to even start it because it tried to use some obscure resolution which my TV couldn't handle. It took me a while on forums to find out that I have to turn on a compatibility mode for the exe file and limit the number of colors to 65536. Let me remind you this is not some old game, this was released in 2011. How the hell is this still not patched?And that's not all. Sometimes the game loses your saves and you have to manually move them from ""\reslists\saves"" to ""\saves"" directory to get them back. Also there are a few graphical glitches and characters in a distance have different resolution than the background.Yet I'm giving it thumbs up. Because when you finally get it running, you get a pretty good old school adventure game in veins of classics from Lucas Arts and Sierra. It especially reminded me of Beneath the steel sky. Game actions make sense and the story overall is entertaining, only maybe the ending could have been a bit better.			"

												This is a fairly short (6hrs) point-n-click adventure game.  Not very difficult or obscure in its puzzles, runs without a hitch most of the time (one rare layering issue and sometimes the graphics for half the screen vanish on relaod, but fixed by zoning).  Really the only things that were flawed about this game was that most of Azriel's playtime is focused on a single city intersection (making the game feel quite contained) and that its too short.  I would have liked a little exploration or sense of breadth to flesh out the environment, kind of like in the old PbC Sierra games I used to play.  Slight spoilers, but dialogue options are also mostly single-directional; no matter what you pick the outcome is the same. There's enough lore here to make the setting believeable, and I quite liked that.   A few nods to the aforementioned Sierra games, as well as possibly one to Cowboy Bebop made me chuckle, and was appreciated.Not a bad game. If you like PnC, do pick it up if it's on sale!			"

												Entertaining old-school point-and-click adventure game, although if you didn't play any games when VGA was contemporary, the graphics may be too rough for you. The story and voice work are good, though, and the music is nice. There's also a developer commentary mode to give you more bang for your buck.It isn't without flaws -- it has an unfortunate real-time gunplay system that's just terrible (and commits the cardinal sin of sticking an autosave before a lengthy cutscene prior to a battle), and the script is kind of awkward if you inadvertently complete tasks out of the expected order, but if you like classic adventure games, you'll probably like this one.(Note that this game is in the Lucasarts no-fail-states style, not the Sierra die-constantly-and-make-the-game-permanently-unwinnable style.)

												If you like point-and-click investigations, this game *may* be up your alley, and I add that caveat for one reason. I absolutely loved this game. Not only do you get to take on the (primary) role of a cop named Azriel Odin but you also get the opportunity to play as many other characters in a story that finds its way together from many seemingly unconnected strands. The only reason I warn you about playing this is because it's not a simple puzzle-solving investigatory game; it requires--it some cases--a LOT of thought, if you aren't following a guide that spells it all out for you. Not all of the puzzles are obvious, and most of them are much more difficult than you'd expect, ranging in difficulty from ""no-brainer"" to ""it's been thirty-five minutes, what am I supposed to do with this thing?"" Aside from one instance of faulty direction (you'll know what I mean when you get stuck on the lock-pick puzzle), the game is not to blame for your inability to solve the puzzle. It's to blame for forcing you to think outside the box, to examine every possible option, to go over all the things you might normally take for granted in the gaming world: in this instance, it requires you to pay close attention to details you've gained along the way. Everything is important to one degree or another and it bears mulling these details over time and again. Second, in the same vein as the aforementioned difficulty, this game makes you think--not just about puzzles but about the story, as well. I absolutely do not want to spoil this game for anyone who has an interest in playing it, so I'll refrain from citing any specifics. I think it is a very well-made game; I think it is a very important game for people to play, if they are willing to pay attention, think, and take something away from it, that is; and I think it's the kind of game that will make you almost forget you're playing it--it sort of sucks you in like a sci-fi space drama, but without all the added bull involving large scale galactic battles and strange species invading this planet or taking over that mining ship, etc. It focuses on the people and their stories, but above all, it speaks to the human condition in a profound way I've rarely seen in video games. I would whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is willing to take the time to listen to what it has to say.			"

												Gemini Rue is a mature point&click adventure game created by Joshua Nuernberger and published by Wadjet Eye Games. The game takes place in the 23rd century and takes much of its compelling story and design inspiration from classic science fiction such as Blade Runner. Some have complained at the reuse of many of the game’s sets but I view this as a positive rather than a negative. I find the graphics hard on the eye, especially when viewing on a large monitor. Another big grumble for me is the proliferation of bugs littered throughout the game without which I would have marked much higher.I give this game a shaky 7/10 "

For a point-and-click Gemini Rue is relatively short (roughly 7 hours) and doesn't feature a lot of locations, but that's to be expected from an indie title. It does, however, feature a well-paced story, immersive world, and interesting well-voiced characters - everything a good point-and-click needs.			"

												Partly clunky controlling of characters and unnecessary rudimentary shooting ""combat"" which needed to be improved much more (or removed).Another annoyance is that prior to a combat, there should be a auto-save which skip the dialogues, in case one dies, so that you don't have to walk back and click through the dialogue again, which get reaaaaally old pretty quick.Other issues are the typical point&click issues like cryptic riddles or random combination of item, or the random order of actions which have to take place, which is luckily not thaaaat bad in GR, but still annoying.Beside all that, the game is really good and I would recommend it. Fortunately the writing is much better than most other philosophically touched games and the visuals are beautiful for fans of old school p&c adventures.			"

												A good adventure game, but I don't quite feel it matched the standard I've come to expect from Wadjet Eye games. The interface is archaic and there are a lot of trial and error puzzles, as well as some pixel-hunty moments and kind of obscure puzzle solutions. Overall though the game design is pretty solid, although there's a gimmick of being able to switch between the two main characters at one point that is never necessary and that I never actually used, dunno why it was even there. There's also a kind of basic combat system put into the game but it's used sparingly which is probably for the better since I'm not a huge fan of it. The story is pretty decent and raises some good questions, although some of the plot twists I saw coming a mile away (not all of them though). The music is good and the atmosphere is good and it's an overall enjoyable experience. Recommended if you're a fan of adventure games although I would recommend the Blackwell series and especially Primordia over this game from the same publisher.			"

												I never liked adventure games. Idea of having exactly one solution to a problem always put me off. This game suffers from this porblem too, you cannot shoot a lock if you are supposed to pick it, you cannot take plug out of the socket if you are supposed to stop machine some other way.Even though it has all flaws of classical adventure game it makes it up in other areas. Gemini Rue has has great sci-fi + film noir atmosphere which keeps you sucked into game from the beginning. It also has great, intelligent plot which makes you keep playing wanting all the time to discover what is going to happen next. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good story, also to people who usually don't play games but prefer reading books instead.			"

												I thought the days of the truly great point and click adventures were over. I was wrong. Gemini Rue lived up to and surpassed the expectations of a man who spent his childhood playing games like Full Throttle, Broken Sword, Beneath a Steel Sky, etc. The puzzles were a tad on the easy side, yet never required illogical leaps or random inventory gynastics to solve. A brilliant science fiction story, coupled with solid voice acting, locations, and soundtrack. This game was a real joy. Don't miss it.			"

												Gemini Rue is an excellent Point and Click adventure with a low res, grimy, cyber-punk aesthetic.  The look and animation of the game remind me of old games I used to play on the Amiga, in a good way.  The sound design is well done as is the voice acting, though it would have been nice to have some variety in the lines that get repeated often.  The puzzles in the game are generally relatively simple, but this is for the best as it keeps them from causing too much interruption in the story which is the highlight of the game.  In the game you play the part of several characters, and at one point can even change between them to complete portions of their story in whatever order you choose.  That is one of design strengths of the game, like pretty much any game in the genre, the progression is basically linear, however there are different paths which must be explored completely to allow you ultimately progress through the story, but you can complete these paths separately or work on one them move back to another then come back to complete the first.  This both allows the game to move more naturally as you don't feel like you are on rails most of the time; and allows you to do something else and come back to it if you get stumped in your progression.  I'm not the best point and click player and often have to refer to walkthroughs to complete them.  I did have to do this two times, and in both cases it was very small objects in the environment which I didn't realize were interactive that stumped me. I liked the low res look of the game, but the pixilation probably aggravated these objects not standing out.  If there were a system to highlight the objects that were interactive, that would help to eliminate that issue.  Yes, that would be easy mode, but if I could only turn easy mode on when I really needed, it would interrupt much less than having to leave and do a Google search.  The only other minor gripe I have is that you cannot view your item inventory without first finding an interactive object.  If you like point and clicks it's a must play, if you don't then you'll find it less aggravating than most.			"

												Gemini Rue is a gritty and dystopian thriller set in the landscape of science fiction noir.  It has that fururistic urban feel of Bladerunner while following Azriel and the jarring and lost feel of Memento while exploring the tiny and controlled world of Delta-Six.  For all you point and click adventure game lovers, this game brings with it that nostalgia of enjoying games when we were all younger, when HD didn't mean anything and games with good stories were where it was at.

Gemini Rue is an old-school point and click adventure game with some action elements. The game has an involving story and unusually good use of pixelated retro graphics but is somewhat on the easy side.The game is set in a dystopian future and features a story that starts our mysterious and gradually reveals more about what is going on. The story has philosophical aspects touching on the relationship between memories and personal identity although it doesn't really explore the subjects in any great detail. The story is the best aspect of the game and is helped by the fact that there are two branches of the story unravelling at the same, the two of which later converge. I found the story very appealing and it kept me wanting to keep playing to find out what would happen.The pixelated graphics suit the atmosphere of the game very well and the visuals are nicely done. I think pixelated graphics have been overused in recent times, but here they are used to good effect.Sound effects are adequate but nothing special, voice acting on the other hand is considerably above average and matches the personalities of the characters well.The actual gameplay is the weakest aspect of the game. Puzzles are somewhat bland, not all that creative and mostly a bit too easy. The action sequences are nothing special and don't add much to the game. You could perhaps argue that in a strongly story driven game like this, having easy puzzles may be a good thing, as harder puzzles would only be frustrating when you want to make progress to find out how the story continues. Whether or not you accept that arugment I think that the somewhat lackluster gameplay pulls the game down a bit and keeps it from being the really great game that it could have been.All in all this is a highly recommended game for all point and click adventure enthusiasts, ar least if you think a good well-told story is at least as important as good gameplay.

												This game has the visuals of an old school adventure, think of the old Indiana Jones or Monkey Island titles. What I liked was the serious approach, no jokes and stuff (well nearly), the good soundtrack and the unusual control mechanisms (fighting e.g., haven't seen that in a point-and-click adventure). You have to get used to them though.But where the game really shines is the great story, it really took me and I didn't see much of it coming. In my opinion it has a better story than comparably big adventure titles!			"

												Quite an interesting game with a cool story to tell. For fans of simple point-and-click adventure games, as well as space operas mixed with a 1940's murder mystery. The game opens with two parallel storylines, one of a man named Azriel searching for his captured brother he believe's has been taken to a prison called Center 7, and another storyline as a prisoner on Center 7 named Delta-Six. Both stories play-off each other very well and craft a unique flavour in the watered down world of space fantasy.Much of the game consists of walking back and forth only a handful of different environments, with the  odd cover-based gun fight that works relatively well though it could be much better. The entire game is voiced quite well which is nice and fits the space noir theme.It's biggest faults come in the way of hidden objectives that blend into the haze of the background and are easily missed multiple times. While these can be very annoying the story does come alive towards the end and is an absolute joy to play. Even with it's issues, it's worth a playthrough. 8 / 10			"

												Enjoyable and smartly crafted noir adventure. Puzzles are logical, and I only encountered one or two situations where I didn't know what to do next for a frustrating amount of time. Graphics and dialog work as well now as they would if this were released during the heyday of adventure gaming. Definitely feels like there is more to see in this dystopian backstory, so I'd definitely buy a sequel. Controls are a bit clunky, but never gamebreaking.Basically this is everything the Double Fine kickstarter promised and failed to deliver. Wadjet Games deserve multi-million dollar backing to make more games like these!			"

												An engaging story with a fantastically atmospheric setting. This hard-boiled pixel noir game stuff is right up my alley.If you like puzzle-adventures with a solid story, perhaps grittier style, then this is for you as well. Like detectives and pulp-novel type action? This does a great job of immersing you in such a story and adding a sci-fi twist. Think of a playable pixel bladerunner. The action is pretty basic, but provides a necessary aspect of danger to the game.If you appreciate artsy, atmospheric games. If you appreciate noir and adventure. And If you can bear a few puzzles in between I'd strongly recommend this title. The puzzles themselves aren't usually major headscratchers either, but enough to contribute to making you feeling like a badass noir detective. Strong story, style, and added gunplay goodies from the devs make this a game I personally am very happy to have played. Good buy!			"

												Most of the time I feel like I hate cyberpunk. It's a genre that lends itself too well to existential angst and superficial anti-corporatism. The themes of human identity in the face of transhumanism and the threat of all subsuming, monolithic corporation feel overplayed to me. They've lost their appeal to me through sheer overuse.Nonetheless, I can't help but appreciate the aesthetic and style of the genre. There is an inescapable appeal in hard boiled sour old badasses walking the worn wet streets of slums and ghettos orders of magnitude more technologically complex than contemporary society, feebly clinging to their humanity in the face of dilemma after dilemma. For me, Blade Runner captured this atmosphere and mood, and for that it is one of my favorite films. Gemini Rue has also nailed this feeling and ambience, and because of that I keep coming back to it years after my first playthrough. It's not a groundbreaking game, but it's a fantastic experience which is probably well worth your time.			"

												With a few subjective changes (I'm not entirely a fan of the combat system), Gemini Rue would be almost exactly the adventure game I want to make. Well-written in all senses--great story, great dialogue, great puzzles. The game DOES glitch a little on occasion when loading a save from the same screen as the save, but it clears up by leaving the room. About the only thing I didn't like was having to open a door AND going through the door being two separate actions.			"

												If you are an oldskool gamer or just old, this game will bring some ""good old days"" feelings to you. Being a point-and-click games fan is a must, but I found the adventure provided by Gemini Rue very satisfying. This is a story about identity forging and what makes us who we are. All served in a noir sauce. Score: 7/10Pluses:- engaging story- great music- good voice acting- noir atmospher- pretty pixelated graphics (in some parts)- some twists (story in a story type of thing)Minuses:- simplified ugly pixelated graphics (in other parts)- simplifications in game mechanics (all relevant people live 2 streets away from each-other etc.)- boring gunfights- (spoiler) plainly stupid phone conversation with Kenneth (the smuggler)			"

												Gemini Rue is an smart, interesting, and worthwhile little point and click adventure game. I hadn't played the genre for quite some time before this, but there was something about a cyberpunk noir dectective title that I couldn't avoid. And it delivered. The ambiance was exactly what I was looking for, providing a deep sci-fi mystery thrown over a gritty urban locale. Mix in a decent soundtrack reminiscent of a mellow jazzy detective story combined with Mass Effect or BladeRunner and it hits all the right beats.The story was woven brilliantly; you playing the part of Azrial Oden, ex-assassin on the hunt for his missing brother. I found myself following the pace very well, putting the parts of the mystery together on my own just as the story was delivering the outcomes. This meant, at least to me, that the story was smart, but not too smart. The gameplay is similar enough to other point and click games however the use of Azrials commlink to call associates or the terminals being used to look up vital information kind of gave the sci fi narrative a much more immersive feel.I guess a for and against this game would be it's length. If there was one complaint I would have it's that the story was a bit on the short side and that I didn't get to see enough of this universe. One or two other locations to further flesh out this world would have been great to see. I finished the game in around 8 hours at a pretty relaxed pace, not completing all (maybe a third) of the achievements. This to me was a bit too brief but the tight story and atmosphere more than make up for it.I thoroughly enjoyed Gemini Rue. So much so that I'm looking to try some of the other point and click titles from Wadjet Eye Games; the next being the Blackwell saga. If your looking for a good point and click game with elements of noir detective mystery combined with a great sci fi angle, then I'd suggest giving this game a try.			"

												Has 5 hours gameplay, a clever storyline and some basic combat mechanics that don't dominate the gameplay. There were no puzzles in it that were unsolvabley strange or difficult as you sometimes find in sci fi adventure... I'd almost say it went the other direction in not quite being challenging enough though. Had a slightly unique interface which gives you a variety of ways to interact with objects and this was used well in some instances but for the most part seemed superfluous.On the whole I'd say it has its faults but this is definitely a point and click adventure that is worth playing.

												Entertaining old-school point-and-click adventure game, although if you didn't play any games when VGA was contemporary, the graphics may be too rough for you. The story and voice work are good, though, and the music is nice. There's also a developer commentary mode to give you more bang for your buck.It isn't without flaws -- it has an unfortunate real-time gunplay system that's just terrible (and commits the cardinal sin of sticking an autosave before a lengthy cutscene prior to a battle), and the script is kind of awkward if you inadvertently complete tasks out of the expected order, but if you like classic adventure games, you'll probably like this one.(Note that this game is in the Lucasarts no-fail-states style, not the Sierra die-constantly-and-make-the-game-permanently-unwinnable style.)

												Gemini Rue's a cyberpunk-noir point-and-click adventure game in the style of Lucasarts' classic catalogue.It's well-written, features a couple of standout voice performances--I particularly enjoy Azriel--and almost none of the cringeworthy, ""developer's brother's friend in a closet"" stuff you might expect from what was formerly a student project. You'll see some of the plot coming before it does, but the game raises some decent, Intro to Philosophy-level discussion material about what makes us all human.The pixel backgrounds are gorgeous, and the soundtrack's apes Vangelis' Blade Runner score in all the right ways. Moody saxaphones back up Azriel's rain-soaked journey into his past; clinical synths bounce and settle underneath Delta-Six's retraining in the mysterious Center 7. Everything comes together to form the atmosphere that is perhaps Gemini Rue's strongest asset.Gameplay-wise, the puzzles feel good and about as hard as they should. The combat mini-game isn't a high point--though it's neither frustrating. If you're an old hand with adventure games, you'll probably clear this in 4-6 hours.

And the story and atmosphere of the game is absolutely fantastic. Some complain about the shooting sequences, but I honestly didn't think they were that big of a deal. I found it fairly easy to use, and if you die, it's not a big deal to try again. Overall, it's an excellent point-and-click adventure for fans of the genre. Highly recommended.			"

												Most of the time I feel like I hate cyberpunk. It's a genre that lends itself too well to existential angst and superficial anti-corporatism. The themes of human identity in the face of transhumanism and the threat of all subsuming, monolithic corporation feel overplayed to me. They've lost their appeal to me through sheer overuse.Nonetheless, I can't help but appreciate the aesthetic and style of the genre. There is an inescapable appeal in hard boiled sour old badasses walking the worn wet streets of slums and ghettos orders of magnitude more technologically complex than contemporary society, feebly clinging to their humanity in the face of dilemma after dilemma. For me, Blade Runner captured this atmosphere and mood, and for that it is one of my favorite films. Gemini Rue has also nailed this feeling and ambience, and because of that I keep coming back to it years after my first playthrough. It's not a groundbreaking game, but it's a fantastic experience which is probably well worth your time.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: I love Gemini Rue. The narrative was gripping, friendly characters were likable, and supporting characters all seemed like they belonged in the world and evoked the correct emotional response. The dark, rain drenched neo-noir setting is perfect for the story being told. Scenes were beautiful, the music fit superbly, the voice-acting was believable, and the sound effects were realistic. Is a person simply the sum of all experiences and outside input or is there more to a person? Gemini Rue explores identity, ethics, and even free will. Like all great pieces of fiction, which Gemini Rue definitely is, it'll leave you contemplating the questions it poses even if it doesn't offer a concrete answer. If you're an adventure game fan or simply like the themes, setting, and story presented, you owe it to yourself to look into Gemini Rue!			"

												People say there are two sides to every story, Gemini Rue takes that to the next level. Its a sci-fi point-and-click story game with a film noir feel to it.There are some elements to the game in which you have to solve puzzles and/or small problems but they can be solved in a matter of minutes if you just think about where to go next.You can choose what you can say and ask other characters, you can even lie to other characters if need be to get what you need in the end. There is an inventory system that can hold a variety of items like keycards, that can be used to access certain areas and/or resources in-game.It also has a very unique combat system where the playable character can take cover, peak out and shoot at enemies, and even take deep breathes for a good old-fashioned headshot.If anyone is looking for a game with a story, try Gemini Rue out.

												Gemini Rue is an excellent Point and Click adventure with a low res, grimy, cyber-punk aesthetic.  The look and animation of the game remind me of old games I used to play on the Amiga, in a good way.  The sound design is well done as is the voice acting, though it would have been nice to have some variety in the lines that get repeated often.  The puzzles in the game are generally relatively simple, but this is for the best as it keeps them from causing too much interruption in the story which is the highlight of the game.  In the game you play the part of several characters, and at one point can even change between them to complete portions of their story in whatever order you choose.  That is one of design strengths of the game, like pretty much any game in the genre, the progression is basically linear, however there are different paths which must be explored completely to allow you ultimately progress through the story, but you can complete these paths separately or work on one them move back to another then come back to complete the first.  This both allows the game to move more naturally as you don't feel like you are on rails most of the time; and allows you to do something else and come back to it if you get stumped in your progression.  I'm not the best point and click player and often have to refer to walkthroughs to complete them.  I did have to do this two times, and in both cases it was very small objects in the environment which I didn't realize were interactive that stumped me. I liked the low res look of the game, but the pixilation probably aggravated these objects not standing out.  If there were a system to highlight the objects that were interactive, that would help to eliminate that issue.  Yes, that would be easy mode, but if I could only turn easy mode on when I really needed, it would interrupt much less than having to leave and do a Google search.  The only other minor gripe I have is that you cannot view your item inventory without first finding an interactive object.  If you like point and clicks it's a must play, if you don't then you'll find it less aggravating than most.			"

												I thought the days of the truly great point and click adventures were over. I was wrong. Gemini Rue lived up to and surpassed the expectations of a man who spent his childhood playing games like Full Throttle, Broken Sword, Beneath a Steel Sky, etc. The puzzles were a tad on the easy side, yet never required illogical leaps or random inventory gynastics to solve. A brilliant science fiction story, coupled with solid voice acting, locations, and soundtrack. This game was a real joy. Don't miss it.			"

												This is truly a wonderful walk down nostalgia lane, very reminiscent of other point and click adventure games like King's quest, space quest, but actually improved in artistic quality and perhaps a bit lacking in the humor department. It does have humor, but it's a suspenseful and serious story, which is much better really than when a game developer tries to force humor, as a way to make up for an uninteresting plot.Not at all difficult to play but very challenging as has been said to find things out. I had to use a walkthrough, though, which took away from how much I enjoyed it. But that is not the game's fault. A good puzzle adventure is nothing without some trial and error. That would instead be a graphic novel. This game delivers and is voice acted as well. Really great. 9.4/10.			"

												Pretty awesome Point and Click game, excellent story telling, it's not cheesy or overdone or ""Feel this way because everyone in the game is.Has combat, isn't that good, but what do you expect? It's mainly for parts of the story that get more violent I guessPlot Twists arent too plot twisty, although there a couple of ""Aha!"" moments.Story is cool, message/moral is cool, ending is cool, it's cool. Kept me intrigued from the start, and I don't necessarily like point and click games, there are also multiple ways to do things I think, cause there are different options that I didn't choose, and if it messed up one option there was usually a way around it anyways.

												I stumbled upon this when I was looking for an adventure game with an intriguing story, which is what I found and I'm glad I did.Gemini Rue is a noir science fiction retro point and click adventure with a twist.The first part of the game lets you switch between two characters: A cop with a dark past trying to find his brother, and a brainwashed prisoner trying to escape a rehabilitation facility.The second part is the well executed conclusion of both of those stories.The setting and ambience fit the overall theme very nicely, and the game does well in making you care for what happens to the characters.The rare combat sequences are fun and don't feel, as one might fear in a point & click adventure, out of place at all. The soundtrack and voice acting is great too. Everyone looking for a serious, thought-provoking story in the form of an adventure game should not ignore this gem, which is my new favorite non-comedic point and click.			"

Some characters can come off as very stilted and cheesey and can take away from an otherwise immersive experience. Unless you absolutely cannot stand reading in games, the voices are best left to the imagination.			"

												Gemini Rue took me by the left earlobe kicking and screaming into its traditional early 90s style adventure and told me i couldn't leave until i'd FINISHED it. 9 hours later i emerged. The game is utterly compelling, at its heart Gemini Rue is a piece of detective Fiction. Its a narative driven scifi noir piece that's punctuated by a series of logical puzzles using the enviroment, conversation, your inventory and an ingame wolrd database. The World is heavly inspired by noir scifi such as blade runner, akira or Renaissance, and each screen is oozing with atmostphere. Gemini Rue is a rare game that gets everything just right, every element complements each other perfectly; the graphics, charaterisation, setting, narative, interface, aethetic, sound, puzzles and pacing, all boils down to a game that knows exactly what tone of voice its projecting. If you ever get a day of uninterupted game time, i'd highly recommend this very well executed piece.			"

												Good game. Neo-noir style detective story that's definitely influenced heavily by Blade Runner. It's not a very hard game. I only got stuck for any length of time once. It took about 7 hours to finish. Graphics are very retro from around the early-mid 90's. The music was really well done and fit in well with the type of story and there is full voice acting. The main character sounds a lot like McGruff the Crime Dog and he even wears a trench coat  like him too. lolz. There are some lame action sequences involving ducking behind cover and shooting enemies as they pop out behind their cover. Thankfully, there weren't too many of those and they were easy enough. Opening and walking through doors was a bit clunky, but it's not a huge problem. Genre fans will like this game and newcomers might like too if they don't mind the old-school graphics It's on the easier side of p&c adventures and the solutions are logical enough.			"

Deep atmosphere, classical gameplay with a few tricks, nice soundtrack, easter eggs, sinking storyline and a good price.

It follows two characters as they try to acomplish their own goals- finding a lost brother, and escaping a prison that wipes your memory when you try to escape. The characters are well-developed, although there's some backstory that could certainly be explored further. The game is amazingly rendered with faux-16 bit graphics, hand drawn.

												A noire sci-fi thriller point-n-click which asks the question; what makes us who we are? Our memories? Our environment? Our friends? Assassin turned cop, Azriel Odin, seeks to find out what happened to his brother in New Pittsburgh after the Gemini War. Delta-Six wakes up in a mysterious facility alongside other patients. Having no recollection of his past or his identity, he must find out why he is in this facility and how he can escape. The player can take control of both characters at anytime (except for the beginning) until he is finished that ""chapter,"" if you will, only to switch back to the other character to complete their ""chapter.""The puzzles can be difficult, but never tedious. A few may be frustrating or rely on small items within the environment, but still very doable if you pay attention to detail.This roughly 8-9 hour game starts slow, but when it picks up, it picks up hard and fast. A definite must play for anyone seeking a great story and/or a noire/sci fi game. 9/10			"

												Let's get this out of the way: I love Gemini Rue. The narrative was gripping, friendly characters were likable, and supporting characters all seemed like they belonged in the world and evoked the correct emotional response. The dark, rain drenched neo-noir setting is perfect for the story being told. Scenes were beautiful, the music fit superbly, the voice-acting was believable, and the sound effects were realistic. Is a person simply the sum of all experiences and outside input or is there more to a person? Gemini Rue explores identity, ethics, and even free will. Like all great pieces of fiction, which Gemini Rue definitely is, it'll leave you contemplating the questions it poses even if it doesn't offer a concrete answer. If you're an adventure game fan or simply like the themes, setting, and story presented, you owe it to yourself to look into Gemini Rue!			"

Its a sci-fi point-and-click story game with a film noir feel to it.There are some elements to the game in which you have to solve puzzles and/or small problems but they can be solved in a matter of minutes if you just think about where to go next.You can choose what you can say and ask other characters, you can even lie to other characters if need be to get what you need in the end. There is an inventory system that can hold a variety of items like keycards, that can be used to access certain areas and/or resources in-game.It also has a very unique combat system where the playable character can take cover, peak out and shoot at enemies, and even take deep breathes for a good old-fashioned headshot.If anyone is looking for a game with a story, try Gemini Rue out.

												A solid point-and-click with good atmosphere and a few interesting mechanics. Voice acting is hit or miss, mostly miss but it eventually becomes part of the fun.

												Excellent adventure game, in my opinion surpassing many of the greats released in the 90s. The puzzles are challenging without being artificially obtuse or irrational, but where the game really, really shines is in atmosphere and plot. It inhabits that nebulous grey area between classic science fiction and cyberpunk and really makes it work. The two principal characters are both sympathetic and relatable albeit in different ways and the voice acting, while not amazing is by no means bad. Play this shiz.			"

												I thought the days of the truly great point and click adventures were over. I was wrong. Gemini Rue lived up to and surpassed the expectations of a man who spent his childhood playing games like Full Throttle, Broken Sword, Beneath a Steel Sky, etc. The puzzles were a tad on the easy side, yet never required illogical leaps or random inventory gynastics to solve. A brilliant science fiction story, coupled with solid voice acting, locations, and soundtrack. This game was a real joy. Don't miss it.			"

												Gemini Rue is an smart, interesting, and worthwhile little point and click adventure game. I hadn't played the genre for quite some time before this, but there was something about a cyberpunk noir dectective title that I couldn't avoid. And it delivered. The ambiance was exactly what I was looking for, providing a deep sci-fi mystery thrown over a gritty urban locale. Mix in a decent soundtrack reminiscent of a mellow jazzy detective story combined with Mass Effect or BladeRunner and it hits all the right beats.The story was woven brilliantly; you playing the part of Azrial Oden, ex-assassin on the hunt for his missing brother. I found myself following the pace very well, putting the parts of the mystery together on my own just as the story was delivering the outcomes. This meant, at least to me, that the story was smart, but not too smart. The gameplay is similar enough to other point and click games however the use of Azrials commlink to call associates or the terminals being used to look up vital information kind of gave the sci fi narrative a much more immersive feel.I guess a for and against this game would be it's length. If there was one complaint I would have it's that the story was a bit on the short side and that I didn't get to see enough of this universe. One or two other locations to further flesh out this world would have been great to see. I finished the game in around 8 hours at a pretty relaxed pace, not completing all (maybe a third) of the achievements. This to me was a bit too brief but the tight story and atmosphere more than make up for it.I thoroughly enjoyed Gemini Rue. So much so that I'm looking to try some of the other point and click titles from Wadjet Eye Games; the next being the Blackwell saga. If your looking for a good point and click game with elements of noir detective mystery combined with a great sci fi angle, then I'd suggest giving this game a try.			"

												Gemini Rue is a point and click adventure set in a gritty sci-fi universe. I went into Gemini Rue knowing almost nothing and was very impressed with this game by the end.  The story is an extremely compelling mystery with many rewarding revelations at its conclusion.The Blade Runner esque music and atmosphere hooked me from the very beginning and although some puzzles were a little obtuse, the clever story and interactions pushed me forward.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to put 2 and 2 together and enjoys a good sci-fi mystery story.			"

												I never liked adventure games. Idea of having exactly one solution to a problem always put me off. This game suffers from this porblem too, you cannot shoot a lock if you are supposed to pick it, you cannot take plug out of the socket if you are supposed to stop machine some other way.Even though it has all flaws of classical adventure game it makes it up in other areas. Gemini Rue has has great sci-fi + film noir atmosphere which keeps you sucked into game from the beginning. It also has great, intelligent plot which makes you keep playing wanting all the time to discover what is going to happen next. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good story, also to people who usually don't play games but prefer reading books instead.			"

There were a few graphical glitches here and there at the beginning, but that did nothing to the whole experience. All in all, best purchase I've made this year.

												Are we defined by our memories?I've just finished this noir-esque, philosophical journey with a twist and boy was I entertained. I'll wrap up my pro's and con's - NO SPOILERS BELOW - + setting. max payne meets space opera, what more should I say+ music & sound. Soundtrack is awesome - game is fully voiced and the environmental sounds are realistic (voices sound different when heard through closed doors, for example)+ characters. The main protagonist feels like a comic version of Bruce Willis in the 80s (Last Boy Scout!), except he's living in 2229. + introduction of characters. Meaning you might not immediately notice who will be very important in the future.+ dialogues. A bit of fun, a bit of violence, a bit of philosophy. An intriguing cocktail of feelings that makes you wanna keep playing. + plot twists. nuff said here. + easter egg characters. I didn't find them all - there's an achievement for that (the only cool one, see below)+ open world feel. Of course the game is very linear, but at certain points you get the feeling you could go everywhere - you just don't want to.-  graphics. They're just a tiny bit too pixely for a game of this millennium. At certain points there are overlapping errors.- playability. Had to google how to combine objects in the inventory. Also frantically scrolling around trying to see the cursor change and show anything you can interact with feels good once acomplished, but can be tedious when you're stuck. - achievements. Only for the hardcore because most of em are a joke: STAIR MASTER - use stairs instead of the elevator, srsly? It does not affect anything. Also, not getting hit in fights (see below) or finding ammo in an adventure game is just... meh...- gunfights and boxes (I mean crates, not boxing). They're like repetitive, useless mini-games no-one needs; not difficult, either. Feels good to kill a meanie with a headshot though (yes, the game does give that option). Overall, the pro's are outweighing the con's since they're very big and important pro's and tiny, non-essential con's. I highly recommend to any fan of point & click, to any fan of darker stories. Although not being replayable really I'll might give it another run (with dev commentary).  "

												A beautiful story. Although not as noir as I'd hoped, it has some decent grit and characters you learn to love. There's a few things the game touches on that I would've liked to see in more detail, but I think the length of the game prohibits that. Gameplay is what you'd expect from the point-and-click genre although you'll be pleased by how little use-randomX-on-randomY you have to do (puzzles are all fairly sensible). Graphics are pretty old-school but it works, music I can't remember, and that's usually a pretty good sign. Yea, a good ride, and I recommend it, especially since there's not much else available that isn't made by telltale.[7.6]			"

												This is the first game I bought in Steam and had completed (1 of 6 purchased). It's not so long as good-old point'n'click adventures from 90th, but it is definitely excitement me with the plot and gameplay. It's going very smoothly and logically (There was only one place where I've got stacked for a some time).Good plot, not so hard puzzles and action shooting from time to time are doing their job to glue you to the game. A big advantage is all the dialogs are very simply to understand for the not english speakers, there're subtitles and audio also! So it's just as great as easy!  The only one thing could be better: a cinematics! I loved them in the 90th, but here's nothing compatible with the old ones, sadlyI totally recommend it!p.s. I was a problem with a fullscreen (default) in Ubuntu 14.10. There were graphical glitches on the black parts of the screen. So i've solved it by change to window mode by:~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Gemini Rue/acsetup.cfgwindowed=0 -> windowed=1gfxfilter=StdScale2 -> gfxfilter=StdScale3 (change a size of the window, from 2 to 5 as far as i know)			"

Basically you wonder around and solve puzzles that are people or enviroment based.  There is some minor cover combat shooting.I enjoyed the game, but did need to look up a walkthrough twice... both times I found out that i missed some tiny little area to click an object.  Once was a shard on the ground I never seen and another was a keycard on a desk I didn't see.It is a good game if you love old school point click, conversation style games with few areas to fail.

												This game is about as old school as you can get barring text-only, though it proves that there is no such thing as going out of style when it comes to fun.Story-wise Gemini Rue is a sci-fi noir tale - in the vein of Blade Runner - about a cop searching for his missing brother in a post-war, gangster run corner of the galaxy. It is also the story of a nameless detainee in a mysterious facility where mind erasure and “re-education” are the rule. These two stories run side by side with players alternating between roles, filling in the narrative blanks until they finally come head to head during the game’s climax.As for the writing, while some of Gemini Rue’s twists, motivations, and dialogue seem hackneyed at times, they can easily be written off as contribution to the game’s pulp roots. The gameplay is mostly solid, with a decent shooting mechanic for the “action” sequences and plenty of point-and-click puzzles to solve. My only gripe is that some clickable objects are very small, requiring one to play “hunt the pixel” in order to interact. More than once this caused me to overlook an otherwise obvious solution.In the end, Gemini Rue turned out to be a pleasant experience and worth the investment. If you’re a fan of sci-fi noir, classic point-and-click adventure games, or both, you should consider checking it out.			"

The graphics are reminiscent of my favorite old-school point and click adventures games while the sci-fi and noir settings are a perfect representation of how I’ve personally matured as a gamer. While the dialogue is simple, it’s enough to grasp the story and make you think. Upon completion, I achieved the bitter-sweet feeling of being satisfied with the story, but wanting to know more about the history of the world I was playing in.

I've just finished playing 'Gemini Rue' and can only say that it was a fascinating game with an enthralling sci-fi story.Thank you Joshua Nuernberger for developing such an amazing game! Keep it up and don't waste your talent!10/10			"

												Are we defined by our memories?I've just finished this noir-esque, philosophical journey with a twist and boy was I entertained. I'll wrap up my pro's and con's - NO SPOILERS BELOW - + setting. max payne meets space opera, what more should I say+ music & sound. Soundtrack is awesome - game is fully voiced and the environmental sounds are realistic (voices sound different when heard through closed doors, for example)+ characters. The main protagonist feels like a comic version of Bruce Willis in the 80s (Last Boy Scout!), except he's living in 2229. + introduction of characters. Meaning you might not immediately notice who will be very important in the future.+ dialogues. A bit of fun, a bit of violence, a bit of philosophy. An intriguing cocktail of feelings that makes you wanna keep playing. + plot twists. nuff said here. + easter egg characters. I didn't find them all - there's an achievement for that (the only cool one, see below)+ open world feel. Of course the game is very linear, but at certain points you get the feeling you could go everywhere - you just don't want to.-  graphics. They're just a tiny bit too pixely for a game of this millennium. At certain points there are overlapping errors.- playability. Had to google how to combine objects in the inventory. Also frantically scrolling around trying to see the cursor change and show anything you can interact with feels good once acomplished, but can be tedious when you're stuck. - achievements. Only for the hardcore because most of em are a joke: STAIR MASTER - use stairs instead of the elevator, srsly? It does not affect anything. Also, not getting hit in fights (see below) or finding ammo in an adventure game is just... meh...- gunfights and boxes (I mean crates, not boxing). They're like repetitive, useless mini-games no-one needs; not difficult, either. Feels good to kill a meanie with a headshot though (yes, the game does give that option). Overall, the pro's are outweighing the con's since they're very big and important pro's and tiny, non-essential con's. I highly recommend to any fan of point & click, to any fan of darker stories. Although not being replayable really I'll might give it another run (with dev commentary).  "

												A fantastic throwback to the classic Sierra days--including some pretty frustrating puzzles reminiscent of the era, but lacking the completely unwinnable scenarios from those games.  Also a rare example of good voice acting in a video game.  If this sounds like your cup of tea, take a few hours and enjoy this game.			"

												The atmosphere in this game is dark and somber, in a good way. The plot is engrossing and mostly well-written. The main problem is that the ""message"" the game tries to deliver at the end is nonsense, which leads to a rather unsatisfying ending. Still worth checking out if you're into noir with a sci-fi flavor.			"

												An excellent old-school-style adventure game - in fact, it's almost perfect.  The story is great, the puzzles are challenging but intuitive, and the ability to switch between characters is done well.  The only drawback of this game is its infuriating combat mechanic, which is poorly designed and unnatural.  Thankfully, combat sequences are few and far between, and the story more than makes up for it.  It's one of the few indie games I would recommend at full price.			"

												Scifi point and click adventure game; good story, characters, voice-acting, graphics, pacing, gameplay.  Puzzles reasonable and I never truly felt stuck anywhere.  Has a combat system that works reasonably smoothly and reminds me a little bit of Blackthorne or ""Another World"".  Twist at the end.  Solid and worth playing.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: I love Gemini Rue. The narrative was gripping, friendly characters were likable, and supporting characters all seemed like they belonged in the world and evoked the correct emotional response. The dark, rain drenched neo-noir setting is perfect for the story being told. Scenes were beautiful, the music fit superbly, the voice-acting was believable, and the sound effects were realistic. Is a person simply the sum of all experiences and outside input or is there more to a person? Gemini Rue explores identity, ethics, and even free will. Like all great pieces of fiction, which Gemini Rue definitely is, it'll leave you contemplating the questions it poses even if it doesn't offer a concrete answer. If you're an adventure game fan or simply like the themes, setting, and story presented, you owe it to yourself to look into Gemini Rue!			"

												Partly clunky controlling of characters and unnecessary rudimentary shooting ""combat"" which needed to be improved much more (or removed).Another annoyance is that prior to a combat, there should be a auto-save which skip the dialogues, in case one dies, so that you don't have to walk back and click through the dialogue again, which get reaaaaally old pretty quick.Other issues are the typical point&click issues like cryptic riddles or random combination of item, or the random order of actions which have to take place, which is luckily not thaaaat bad in GR, but still annoying.Beside all that, the game is really good and I would recommend it. Fortunately the writing is much better than most other philosophically touched games and the visuals are beautiful for fans of old school p&c adventures.			"
