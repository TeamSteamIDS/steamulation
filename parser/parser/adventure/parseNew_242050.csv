												Great game. Most fun I have had pretending to pirate since Sid Meier took a shot at it in the 90s. Largely addictive, great voice acting for the series, and dialogue that isn't painful to listen to on its own as well. This game could have a real shot as THE redefining moment for a series that has otherwise been largely stagnant. Unfortunately alot of those stagnations still exist here, repeated follow/eavesdrop missions for instance. All in all though this is easily what I would consider the BEST of the entire AC series since the first 2 games. Hope this is the start of a trend in making these more engaging and different/unique with each setting and iteration that follows.Check it out if you're ready to hit the open seas with your own brig, exploring the beautiful environments of the West Indies.

												The best Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2.This is coming from someone who hates pirates.This game comes in three parts being a Assassin, being a ship captain, and being a ubi.... I mean Abstergo employee.The Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved.- Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batman-like (Arkham games) and less Counter-kill spam. - Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered.- They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! (You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around)- Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games.- Side missions are amazing too, they range from under-sea diving to whaling to taking over forts.Being a ship captain is the best part of the game.- I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline.- Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive.- Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.Being a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it.- Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.Multiplayer- haven't touched itOther Stuff- Optimization could be better, but it is a beatiful game.- Best play with a controller IMO, until you have to aim with a pistol.- UPLAY :(Rating: 10/10 -1 for UPLAY => 9/10			"

												Black Flag is competing to be the best Assassin's Creed title since Assassin's Creed II.Not only the story is well written to a point that not only the gamer relates to the main character, a pirate named Edward Kenway, it also creates an emotional tide with the adventure and exploration of sailing the high seas and hunting treasure and other bounties while discovering more about the Assassins, the Templars, and the secrets of both.Sailing.Before Black Flag was released there was a game no one heard of called Pirates of The Burning Sea, a F2P MMO that currently had the title for best Sailing experience, Black Flag took that away and better.With a immerse and easy to understand camera and control mechanics sailing in Black Flag is an amazing time, so much so that the game gives you the option to Fast Travel if needed, and I played for over 50 hours completing the game, without Fast Traveling Once.With the additions of random AI Ships with Different Random Cargo roaming the seas, special challanges, secrets, and different weather and time conditions, the sailing it self sells the game.Running.The main aspect of running and jumping on rooftops and trees to explore ways to complete your objectives still a big thing and very well crafted, the only Con to it is that often you find yourself jumping in Hay Stacks or Trees just by running Aside some, which is a very hard thing to balance, but even tho very frustrating at the time, it goes away as soon as you get done with it.Storyline.The main storyline is very interesting to watch read and play, with various famous characters as usual of an Assassin's Creed game, introduced very well in the story.The ending feels solid, and with enough questions for more story, but not enough to upset anyone.Multiplayer.The multiplayer feels more balanced than previous AC titles, with more maps and a more fluid and Skill Based mechanic.The only bad thing is that as always and sadly gamers would always for some reason find ways to exploit game mechanics for an easy win.The game introduced GameLabs a feature that allows players to customize Game Modes, everything from what skills can be used, to how much a kill would be worth, and what kind.The issue currently with GameLabs is that you can only play your custom made Game Modes with your friends, and only find a Random ""Approved"" Type on the public lobby.With enough luck, that would be fixed, and a new feature would allow gamers to publicly host GameLab creations for any player to pick and play.Overall this is the level of detail the so called Next Gen titles should be all about. Great environments graphics, level design, interaction, and details to very small things.This might be the best AC Title so far, and might also be GOTY.			"

												Arrr, ye pirates ;)Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag feels slightly different, than the other AC titles. Why's that?Well, first of all, the main components are still the same. You're playing as Edward Kenway, a pirate which ends up being involved in the Assassins vs. Templar war.The gameplay didn't really changed, as you're still running and parcouring around in third-person. Climbing up on lookouts, to reveal the map, collecting stuff like chests and animus fragments, doing assassination missions and following the main quest about a mysterious observatorium.So far, everything as usual. The one big thing which changed, or was rather heavily extended, is the ship you are sailing with.Already introduced in AC3, you're also getting your own ship this time (of course, what would a pirate be without a ship ^^), the ""Jackdaw"". With said ship, you're spending a lot of time travelling through the caribbean sea, hunting down whales and sharks, exploring sunken ships and underwater caverns, battling other ships and boarding them to get gold and ressources in order to upgrade the Jackdaw (eg. more cannons, reinforced hull, different looking steering wheels or sails).In my opinion, the part where you are sailing around and enjoying the dynamic day and night cycle, checking for profitable ships to hunt down or just enjoying the waves on the sea is the best part of the game.The Sea Shanties (your crew will sing along on the open sea) are also great for the atmosphere and pretty entertaining (i found myself singing along with them :D ).The story itself feels a bit bland and is starting off pretty boring in my opinion.But it gets better throughout the missions and there are quite some interesting and likable characters which improves the story after the beginning.The graphic is pretty good, nothing groundbreaking, but very atmospheric and it can create some beautiful moments, especially with the day and night cycles.The world itself is also quite big, with enough places to visit and roam around to fill hours and hours of gametime. If you don't like collecting stuff or repetitive missions/ship battles, then you might be bored after a while. Even though the ship battles feel quite dynamic, at some point, it's still quite the same (especially if you upgraded your ship and you're more powerful).Overall, i found it to be a ""different"" Assassin's Creed title, as i had the feeling that component wasn't overly present. I had much more fun sailing around and exploring, than following the main mission. But i think that's also pretty subjective. It's still a very good game and i would recommend it to anyone liking the AC titles and/or good action-adventures, especially with a very good pirate-flair.Now, drink up me hearties and get back aboard, treasures are waiting, arrrr :)			"

												Sadly as with all games in the Assassinating Creed franchise, this game was not about murdering the members of the post-grunge rock-band Creed. And although I am still disappointed with these circumstances, this game has good pirate stuff. Despite the disclaimer during game startup warning me that the game ""was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs"", it's pretty obvious from the cobbled together abstract sci-fi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it was made by French Canadians.

												Before I start, I just want to address one thing:This is the best AC game I have played so far. And I'm a diehard fan of this series.Now let's start by a simple pros/cons:Pros:+The game doesn't take itself too seriously.+You really feel like you are a pirate, so careless and free to do what ever you want.+Almost no map limitations; after the few first missions, you are basically granted the opportunity to explore the world as much as you wish, which hasn't been possible in previous titles. And exploring is as interesting as it can get! Massive amount of islands, fisherman villages, caves, mayan ruins, plantations etc. And the game also rewards you alot for exploring.+Character design. Edward is an interesting main character and to be honest; there has never been a side character so cool as Edward Thatch, or well, as most of us know him as, Blackbeard.+Map. It's just... big. And full of places. After 50+ hours on the game, I'm still finding new islands to explore.+The amount of side activities. Ranging from the usual assassination contracts to defeating legendary ships, you will not run out of things to do.+Free roaming. Well, this isn't anything new to Assassin's Creed series, but the addition of freely sailing the seas and countering plenty of other ships to board and rob out of their cargo, this game takes freedom of play to a whole new level.Cons:-Optimizing is quite bad (which really isn't a surprise though), as the game will be somewhat laggy even on better gaming rigs. Don't expect too many FPS with high graphichs if your PC isn't top notch. It's not unplayable on computers that aren't as good, absolutely not, but you should be prepared for certain FPS drops and lowering your graphic quality etc. -The story is quite short (NO SPOILERS) and sometimes feels like it's a bit too much ""go there and kill him so we can be rich arrr!"". Story isn't bad, I really enjoyed it, but I still hope it would've been a bit more deep in some aspects.Summary:This has got to be one of my favorite games of all times, as it never fails to excite me. Are you a diehard fan of the series or just looking to be the ""deadliest scourge of these seas""? Either one, this game is for you! Enjoy!			"

												9/10 Game Play - The battle scenes are very shocking visual, compared to assassin's 3 it has a more perfect naval warfare system. Good stealth feeling. Great story.8/10 Graphics - With Anvil engine, not do perfect but the details of the game is also good. What's more we can run it smoothly.10/10 Sound - Game in each city have a sense of wonderful background music. And music with the exciting battle scenes is also energetic, give us the power to fight.8/10 Difficulty - People can easy to suit the controls, but if you want to do it well, you need to practice.9/10 Lasting Appeal - The story and the way of collection are long that you can spend tens hours play for it. What's short, the multiplayer mode doesn't change much compared to before, I think naval fighting could be better.Total Score - 44/50 Extrem Gut			"

												Before I bought the game, I saw those negative comments and I didn't understand why because this game is good.When I bought the game, I still didn't understand why those negative comments because this  game is great!After some days of playing the game (I played only 5-7 hours) well, I realized why.I'm not going to talk about how much the game bad and he has bugs, no, the game is great and has no bugs. I'm going to talk about Ubisoft.Ubisoft, The worst company I have ever seen. After  1 month I wanted to play this game, but when I connected to Ubisoft it showed me that I don't have this game. I tried to activate the key but it just said that I can't because this key already used. (I used it then)I tried to contact Ubisoft many times, (Their website, Facebook, and more), but as you can understand, they didn't even respond! I tried to contact steam with a very long message that tells everything that happened, but I don't think they even tried to read the message, they just sent me an email that says that I can't get a refund because I played the game more than 2 hours.Shame. The game is good. Ubisoft sucks.Thank you for reading this.			"

												After 700h+ spent in this game, I decided to write a little review. Singleplayer:Its one of the best parts in all ac series. I' m in love with ac2 but ac4 is almost as good as my fav part. It has beautiful, big world which you can easly explore. A lot of quests, stuff to collect. Nice combat. Maybe some easy... but its not a big minus of whole game. Storyline is really intresting (dunno what to write here to not spoiler... Its just awesome!). Music and graphics are on high level, great atmosphere of pirate world, ship battles, pirate songs, treasures, just everything what you can connect with pirates. I think only one minus is this ship/pirate stuff... for me personally its too much. It makes from it more pirate than assassin game. But still you can find a lot of sneaky mission and assassin atmosphere. Multiplayer:Here I' ve spent much more time. And I stil play it. I promise you, you will not find 2nd multi like this. Its still great fun with friends. A lot of nice modes, playing tactical or just jumping around. Abilities are balanced, perks also. I think I can say its the best multi of ac series. Really enjoy it. Just one minus are people who often play unfair... But its not game fault, just people carying for winning far too much. I think only game fault is that it has not so good matchmaking and sometimes you wait for session ages. In my opinion, no matter if you buy it to play singleplayer, for multiplayer or for both i can promise you, you will enjoy it! One of the best ubi games ever!			"

												Well it's not as good as the trailers would tell you, but it's certainly not bad at all. As usual the game looks great. I guess there's not much to add if you're familiar with the rest of the series.Well, the combat. It's hasn't improved, infact, it changed a little bit for the worse; it's not as spectacular as it used to be and feels kind of clumsy to control. The good part is you can have up to 4 preloaded pistols, so at least thát helps. Either way, you really should use all your tools in this game, they're totally OP compared to the lack of fighting skills. I guess it's because you play some stinking peasant turned pirate, rather than a trained assassin. Which is actually a nice change; being no part of either templar or assassin but getting in too deep to avoid the crossfire. The story does unfold quite nicely.The new things in this game are obviously the ship battles, gimmick from the last game. Well, not too surprising since they went with a pirate theme. Most of the game is either at sea, or in ports. A lovely addition to the sea travel are the shanties; a few drunks singing a song makes the trip more enjoyable, so it pays off to search for a few.The fun and yet frustrating part is boarding a ship to capture it. Somehow the controls suddenly go more wonky than usual when climbing the sails. Especially when there's a few waves moving the ship. And the decks always feel way too small with the amount of people getting in your way.But most of the boardings look really cool and are fun to do for a while.Then there's a whole new creature to hunt for; the Great White, and his nautical buddies.Although whaling is basically just chucking spears at the beast untill it stops flopping, it's pretty cool.  And the sharks do put up quite a fight.Oh, and another wonderful thing they added is; underwater levels. Because we all know how much people love underwater levels. They actually looks quite magical. Outside of the Animus there's a few computers to hack, and obviously a less action-packed part of the story going on. Strangely enough you seem to be an Abstergo employeé this time around...Although they really should've included all the DLC's if they wanted to ask such a high price for it, oh well, I bought it anyway when it was on a sale, I blame the pirate theme, ARRR. I guess I can't complain, all'n all, it's an entertaining game, pretty much worth what I paid for it. This damn franchise tricks me into buying it anyway.			"

												TLDR; This is, as far as my experiences go, the best Assassin's Creed game I have ever played. or maybe it's because I have a thing for pirates-themed games, I don't know. Story is there but certainly not the best part of the game. it's just there because every game needs one. it's the mechanics that works so well and contents that can make you spend 100 hours to complete all things in the game, that's not including the multiplayer (which I haven't tried).the old and tested formula of the AC series is still there, but this time there are only 3 huge cities which still looks similar to other cities in the previous AC games and also looks similar to each other. The fun part is on the sea. It is a seamless experience that is so well implemented that it feels hassle-free and very fun at the same time. For an example, you can do an assassination side mission, then right after you kill the target you can just jump into your ship, drives away, and wreak havoc shooting every passing ship that passes by. Naval Combat is the highlight of this game for me. there are a lot of different types of weapons. Your typical round shots, chain shots, mortars, heavy shots, fire barrels, and swivel gun. you can choose what to do with an enemy ship. destroy it till it sink and get 50% of its cargo, or damage it enough to be able to board a ship (kinda like in pokemon, lol). the boarding is fun, too. you'll get different objectives which I think is randomized. usually you'll be told to kill a certain amount of enemies depending on how big that ship is. then sometimes you are also given other minor objectives. I'm sure all people who have play any AC games know the part where you have to climb up to a vantage point and synchronize to unlock the locations of all secrets in a location? it's still there, but now you also have to do that on the sea, but through destroying a fort in an area. the global map is divided into about 15 parts (never counted the exact amount), and each part's surface is blurred until you destroy the fort's defenses and then get to the fortress and kill the commander (somewhat like fighting a ship, just harder).Beside the main story and synchronizing at seas, there are tons of activities you can do when you get bored. you can find treasure maps and then look for the location, solve mayan puzzles, dive underwater to collect treasures, sneaking to a warehouse and steal materials to sell, hunting legendary ships, collect music sheets which unlocks new chants your crew sings when you are exploring the sea, hunt animals on land to unlock upgrades and craft outfits, and also harpooning sharks and whales.upgrading your ship is also essential to be able to progress through the game. you will have no chance fighting a huge ship with only a handful of cannons and low hull armor. this is part of the fun, making your ship stronger and then pawning those cocky spanish / british fleet (try using your upgraded ship to destroy 3 frigates in a row, it's fun !).there is also a kind of mini games where you have a fleet of ships which you can send to do shipping missions that require a certain amount of time to complete, like most social games out there. If you have friends who also play this game, they can help your ship complete the mission faster. you can add captured ships to the fleet to make them able to complete bigger missions with bigger rewards. there's also a simple turn based combat system to make a trading route safer. it's pretty fun at first but in the end you just click everything and then forget about it (like social games).now for the negatives. I feel that the secrets and chests you can find on the global is too scattered (maybe it's meant to be that way). I've been meaning to collect everything but there's just too many things to collect (I'm sure it's a good thing for some people).the stealth aspect felt improved but still needs some tweaking. it's pretty difficult to move quickly from cover to cover when Edward wants to climb and jump on everything (it's annoying). not a significant problem though.

												Okay, first off, I want to say I love this game down to its core. Sure maybe it has bugs and frame rate problems, but this is still one of my #1 Most Favorite Game!Story: Amazing rich and emotional story though you are not tied to it and can go off and do whatever in the JackdawGameplay: This is where this game falls a bit. You constantly jump and climb on things you didnt want to. Though overall it's okayGraphics: When you are looking at moutains, ect. in the distance they somtimes flash back and fourth and also textures take awhile to load in, though other then that, the lighting, weather,water and textures are up at the top for this generation.Open World: Perfect, if you want to go to a bar and recruit some crew, to then go and invade a hideout and look the treausre to then upgrade your ship. Overall, I give open world 10/10Overall, I would give this game a 9/10 for its perfect story and amazing open world. I would recommend this to anyone who has a mildy good pc or any consel who wants hours and hours of good open world fun!-BlockbyBlock "

I'm sorry, but when you openly state something as being included in the Season Pass and then refuse to add it to the Season Pass DLC, you are commiting a crime of false advertisement.			"

												I decided to delete my earlier review and write this one as I can no longer recommend this game due to Ubisoft and Uplay.First, after 56 hours of game play, my save game was lost. I did some research and found out a LOT of people have this issue. I decided to open a support ticket with Ubisoft so I logged in to their support site. I went through the 'Submit a question' option to explain the issue. When I click submit it take me to a list of possible solutions, none of which are even close, and says if these dont fix your issue click submit. Only the submit button does nothing. I click on 'My Questions' only to have no new questions there. I tried this three times and could not submit a question.I then went to the Ubisoft technical support forum to post about the Black Flag issue and the Submit a Question issue. I typed out my new post and tried to 'submit' it. It tells me I have to choose a 'thread prefix' so I choose one from their drop down box and click submit. It blanks out my thread prefix and tells me I have to choose a thread prefix. I think maybe this is a bug because I didn't have a thread prefix selected when I first submitted. I retype the entire post, choose a prefix and click 'submit' only for the forum to blank out my thread prefix and tell me I need to choose a thread prefix.I finally had to reply to someone else complaing  thread because I could not create my own. Uplay and Ubisoft have forced me to change my review as I do not want my friends to have to go through this crap.			"

												08 November 2015 UPDATE - Again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Ubisoft STILL has utterly failed to correct their major game save issues. Regardless of whether or not you use or disable their horrible ""cloud save feature"", your games will STILL randomly disappear with no hope of recovery. I am at my wit's end with these thieves. They absolutely refuse to respond to anybody (a huge number of people) who have had this problem with anything other than a canned reply about ""we're sorry but your saves can't be recovered"" even if the damned inquiries have nothing to do with recovering game saves, but are asking if and when they are ever going to fix this game-breaking issue.What's more, they seem to have changed how the game is saved, so while previously, there was a possibility of recovering your game saves if you were lucky, that now seems to not be the case.Over two years in, it's clear what their answer is - NO, they are NOT going to fix it. I've tried playing this game on three different operating systems and two different computers (Windows 7, 8 and now, 10) and I have the same problem over and over and over.Take your money elsewhere. Ubisoft does NOT deserve your money and YOU don't deserve to have to deal with thier absolute indifference to their customers and their horrificly broken ""games"".I say all this with a very heavy heart, because in the time I have been able to spend playing Black Flag, I absolutely LOVED it, but I simply cannot support a game and its developer when they are uncaring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s whose only concern is to pocket as much of your money as they can before moving onto their next monthly installment of Assassin's Creed.Warning - this game WILL eat your game saves, it is inevitable and is happening on a mass scale and Ubisoft doesn't appear to care, based on their very few comments on the problem.I really enjoy the naval aspect of the game, although I wish that there were more ship types. There is not a very large variety at all. Also, too many bonuses and unlocks for the multiplayer side of the game, which I don't really care about (ESPECIALLY because there is NO naval aspect to MP at all, only running around on land.) I don't play a single-player story for hours and hours only to earn useless costumes and other crap for multiplayer, thanks...Also, almost all the DLC and the crap you get with the preorders is almost all MP content only. I was under the impression that it was for the single-player campaign as it was marketed that way.Also, after putting in over 200 hours on this game (even though I'm just over 50%, which goes to show I really enjoy playing this game) Uplay and/or the game decided it today, for no apparent reason, to completely wipe my game save. I booted it up to play today and it's simply gone without a trace. WTF.UPDATE - after further research, it's stunning how many people are also having their game saves wiped. I don't recommend this game solely because of this MAJOR problem. Trust me, you don't want to be like me (and all the other countless people having this problem) and spend 200+ hours of your life doing something that some crappy software that is forced on you (Uplay) is going to nulify on a whim. Their ""cloud storage"" system is a gimmicky piece of crap that will ruin your week.I'm sorry I spent as much money as I did on this game and all their BS DLC, the majority of which is not useful for ANYTHING in the game. This is probably the last Ubisoft game I'll be buying unless they get their act together, as their past games have also had issues like this.FINAL UPDATE - for others who've been screwed out of their game saves, one possible way o recover your saves that worked for me is as follows:Just for future reference for anybody that is searching for answers on how to recover a lost game save:1) Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft2) right click the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder and choose properties3) Click Previous Version4) Hopefully there is a pervious version backed up. if so you can double click it in the list.(There will be a folder in there with a long chain of numbers as its name. Inside there will be one or more folders with a couple numbers for their name. These are the gamesaves for whatever Ubisoft games you have. BLACK FLAG'S gamesave folder is '437'. Copy that one and replace your current damaged one.)			"

												Look, this is a great game.  But if you're getting it on PC understand you're playing a game of russian roulette with it.  This game has multiple tech issues.  I've experienced constant crashing when turning on AA, god rays, anything other than low shadows, etc etc.  This is odd, because I've got a powerful rig that has the game on maxed textures and plays numerous others maxed out with those options enabled but, sure, whatever, we'll say something is wrong with my computer and not BF.  There's also the issue that if you use UPlay's cloud saving the game will eat your save, causing you to lose hours of progress.  I personally LOST FIVE HOURS OF PROGRESS.  This even happend to a previewer on RockPaperShotgun.  Checking the forums, others have lost completed games, with the average loss being 8 hours.  Some users insist this continues after turning off cloud saves, so back up your saves too!  There's also the issue I may have had that this game may not play nice if you don't install it on the same drive with your windows install, although this seems to be true for other Ubi titles (like BlackList) (I can't pinpoint this one for me because I reinstalled and also changed graphic options at the same time which stopped crashing but which one fixed it(?), but other forumers have the drive issue).  And some users (thankfully not me) have the game crash on the splash screen.   Also, if you have a laptop apparently this game doesn't play nice with those and the integrated graphics cards involved, so do your research?  Don't know much about that one, currently using a desktop.This is a great game.  The gameplay is rock solid.  But I can't recommend it in good consciouscience because I don't want anyone to buy it, or worse, gift it, and not have it work.  That's an awful, frustrating feeling and I don't want anyone to feel like I did.  So no, the other reviewers are not wrong for recommending it.  Their time HAS been positive!  Mine hasn't.  It just is what it is, it's part of the baggage of PC gaming and it rears its ugly head now-and-then.However, make sure you turn off cloud saving no matter who you are and back up your saves.  This is a nasty bug for UPlay that doesn't care how great your machine is.  Imagine doing all the sync points or collecting all the collectibles on mutliple islands only to lose them.  It sure stinks.			"

												This was one of my top GOTY of 2013 due to the fact that it was the best out of the entire series up to date, and yes ENEMY DROWNS IN THIS ONE WOOO!Anyways to top it off some of the most memorable characters and music exist in this game, too bad they make very short cameo. As a player you'll be working in Abstergo and entering the animus to relive the life of Edward Kenway and you'll be sailing a large area of the Caribbean sea during the age of piracy. more than 40% of the game takes place in the sea which you'll be sailing and pirating.This is quite possibly the BEST pirate game up to date without the stereotypical aspects of piracy. Just traveling your boat around in the ocean is quite fun and the weather system is great+Graphic is great on this especially if you have the card to go farther and the monitor. Don't hate+Music is fantastic, so are the sound effects.+Water effects is WOW and the weather with the storm and winds is fantastic+The pirates sing shanty on your queue and it'll get stuck in your head+Voice acting is superb in this+Sailing for hours in the sea and just pirating people+ Sailing, Storms, Taking over Forts, Attacking epic pirate ships, WHALING AND HUNTING ANIMALS cough farcry 3 glad they brought that in, Undersea exploration and more.+- The costumes can either be ugly or great to some this is all depending on your preference+- Theres tons of collectables, sometimes can be quite a nuiscance to collect+-Some of the costumes are meh+- Same♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer, I played it in all creeds, all they did really was upgrade a new mode and added some new moves, it gets dry really fast after playing maybe a couple of days then you'll eventually forget it even exists. Wolfpack is interesting but gets dry.+-story was decent. Ending was super expected if you follow the series.-Some of the really awsome characters in this game make REALLY short cameos, Kid the pirate and blackbeard etc. They are fantastic and memorable but you didn't get much time with them to feel the connection- This game was bugged when it came out, I couldn't 100% it and drove me nuts-Not enough end game content You can only fight 4 Overall a much better game than all previous games, will make it hard to replay the old ones if you touch this one, even going back to HD remakes will make you go bleh.

												For the most part, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a fantastic game. For ease of interpretation, I have decided to break my thoughts on the game down into a simple pros and cons list. Pros:The open world sailing/plundering/exploring while aboard the Jackdaw is by far the best aspect of the game.The main storyline is decent (aside from the classic Assassin's Creed ""outside the animus"" sections that everyone hates)Combat is fluid and easy to learn although it was very clearly designed for consoleAll of the enviornments are beautiful and well designedVoice acting was well done and there weren't too many NPCs with the same voices. The upgrade system seems pretty reasonable outside of the fact that, once you have enough money, you can basically buy every upgrade without putting in any work to collect materials etc.Cons:The game was very much designed for console which produces quite a few problems for PC users.The Ubisoft launcher is absolutely terrible and I have had several problems getting it to boot up properly. Also, you will be unable to play the game if your Ubisoft launcher has problems so there is no way to bypass this terrible system.Even with a fairly well built gaming PC, higher level graphics options are etremely taxing and framerate drops are common.Gameplay becomes repetitive after a certain point and the quests outside of the main storyline aren't anything to write home about.After you have maxed out all of the upgrades for the Jackdaw/Edward, nothing really presents a challenge.Very little replay abilityThe cutscenes for sucessfully boarding a ship are all identical except for the fact that they are re-skinned depending on if the ship is Spanish, English, or pirate hunters. This is quite annoying if you pillage more that 10 ships (you definitely will)I already mentioned this above, but the ""real life"" sections of the game where you exit the animus are TERRIBLE! Every time one came up, I found myself saying ""please end this stupidity so I can go back to the story that I care about."" Perhaps some people feel differently about these scenes, but most seem to agree that the game would have been better if they had been left out all together.Multiplayer is clunky and feels like an afterthought. There is no real opportunity to play with friends in the way that would actually be fun (a fleet of customized ships sailing around engaging in massive battles and accomplishing various goals)Conclusion:I really did (and still do) enjoy this game. There are very few high quality pirate themed games on the market and Black Flag definitely fills that need. The game is by no means a masterpiece of storytelling, nor is it a real divergence from the classic Assassin's Creed model. However, it is a ton of fun to play (especially if you love pirates) and the add-ons for the delux edition are worth playing as well. I would give this game a rating of 7/10 simply because of the clunky conversion from console to PC and the constant issues with the Ubisoft launcher. If Black Flag was as good on PC as it is on console, I would give it a 9/10.			"

												Assassins creed 4 black flag is an awesome game. It has great combat, both naval and when dueling. I found the story started off strong but got progressively worse. However, I enjoyed the game far past the end of the main story [which took me 25 hours, your results may vary] and I ended up getting 75 hours out of it. The multiplayer is miserable but the end game content and side quests are great. For some reason I was capped at 30fps, DAMN YOUN UBISOFT! While I hated teh ending off this game it had a ton of solid content and the main questline had some outstanding moments gameplay wise. The side missions and exploration are even better offering stories of their own and allowing you to make your own story.Assassins Creed 4, Not revolutionary, but awesome! A solid 8.5/10			"

												Hands down my favorite game in the AC series, even if AC2 is arguably better as a whole. Being a pirate is just far more fun than being an assassin. Who knew?Game looks great, plays well, and fighting ships and upgrading your ship to fight bigger ships never gets old.One caveat: The game has some crap performance. Even after upgrading to a GTX 980 Ti, I was still only getting ~40 FPS.  UNTIL! I found a crazy fix that works. First, let NVIDIA control panel handle the VSync. The game's VSync is crap. Second, and it's really weird: After loading into the game, lock your computer. Then re-open the game window. This takes my perf from ~40 to ~60 every time. Don't know why. Doesn't make sense. It's some kinda weird bug, but by god it works.			"

												The internet has a big thing for pirates so it’s quite amusing that we have never had a fantastic pirate video game. Sure, we have had games that use a theme around piracy, say Skies of Arcadia’s sky pirates or the pirate theme of The Secret of Monkey Island, but there’s never been one game that has managed to blend in the concept of being a pirate, exploring the ocean and visiting islands quite like how it is done in Ubisoft’s increasingly popular Assassin’s Creed series.Ubisoft has learnt from the blunders of the incredibly slow introduction that Assassin’s Creed III featured. This is great news for fans or newcomers, as it means people jumping into Black Flag don’t have to sit through hours of slow paced story plots and tutorials to understand the game’s mechanics. Within the time frame that it took the player to start playing Connor in Assassin’s Creed III, you’ve already learnt pretty much everything that you can do in the world of Black Flag. Even better is that the main character, Edward Kenway, the grandfather of Connor, is a much more likeable person. He’s got an aura around him that was missing from the forever-straight behaviour of Connor. The overall tone of Black Flag is much more light-hearted in nature, thanks to the comical and carefree personality of the Welsh pirate, which is on display throughout the game’s many cutscenes.Story wise, Black Flag takes place a few decades before the main events of Assassin’s Creed III, and is set in a vast ocean filled with the tropical islands of the Caribbean. It begins with Edward in the midst of a storm fighting with another ship, which just happens to house an Assassin. Things go horribly wrong and Edward is washed onto a beach, along with the Assassin that killed some of his crew members. Like any good Welsh man, he gets revenge and plunders his gear, becoming a pirate masquerading as an Assassin.The plot is filled with Assassins and Templars – it’s in the franchise’s DNA to do so – as they all hunt down a thing called the Observatory. What makes this story different is the piracy theme. Edward doesn’t care much about the Assassins or Templars and their thousand year war; he just wants to have the Observatory for himself, so that he can become the wealthiest pirate that ever lived. With no loyalty to either gang, you see Edward acquiring help from both sides as he tries to gain clues and figure out where this special place is hidden.Edward’s personality and the game’s theme makes the story an interest one, and it’s backed up with fascinating supporting characters that include famous pirates like Blackbeard (Edward Teach) and James Kidd. The sci-fi elements still remain – Abstergo are featured in the present time, as the player is put into the role of an employee working at Abstergo Entertainment. Near enough from the get go the entire game’s world is available to explore. There are some areas that are pumped with harder difficulty to make it less welcoming for the player to sail there, but once the boat is obtained, the ocean really is the only limit. The world is huge, and what is even more impressive is that it’s filled with lots of unique locations that contain plenty of secrets to discover.While it’s easy to get lost in discovering new land and finding collectibles, there are three major cities, Kingston, Havana and Nassau, that Edward will revisit on multiple occasions. Each city feels alive and distinct from one another, and all are packed with plenty of hidden collectibles to find.Black Flag builds a lot on top of the ship components of the previous title. You’ll take part in plenty of ship combat, but thankfully that has been fleshed out with better controls of the ships weaponry.You no longer need to remember what button launches what attack, as depending where the camera is focused will determine what weapon will launch. But Black Flag is more than just blowing up boats, as when conquered ships are on their last legs, the player has the chance to pull in and board the vessel. Once aboard, a required amount of crew must be killed before the ship’s goods become your own. There are plenty of side quests to do when out on the seas, such as hunting down whales or other creatures and using the materials gained from carving animals to improve existing gear, similar to 2012’s Far Cry 3.Combat is still easy, continuing with the comparable counter-heavy fighting system that we have seen in games like the Batman Arkham series, but with less fluidity in animation. A change to the interface means equipping gear is snappy, and using dual pistols is as easy as pulling the shoulder button to aim or pressing Y to shoot at an auto target. If there’s one thing the combat can pull off, it’s that it looks flashy when you have mastered the skills and are taking down a group of guys.When you’re done with the story and all its crazy additional side-questing, there’s the multiplayer that can be jumped into. If you’ve played the previous games, then you have an idea how it works. It follows the same principles of finding the target and killing them, while not getting stabbed by the people that are hunting you.What I did spend a lot of time doing is looking in awe at how beautiful the game can be. Black Flag looks fantastic on the PC, with some thirst inducing ocean and wave effects that are some of the best generated in a video game. The world also looks great, with a lot of detail going into making a believable incarnation of the West Indies, with quality texture work and decent models.Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is an amazing pirate game, and also my favourite Assassin’s Creed title, which goes hand in hand with the more open nature of the pirate theme.

												Let me first say that this is a terrible port.  If you meet the minimum or even recommended specs chances are you will not be able to play this game in an enjoyable state.  You will need something almost double the recommended to actually play this game at a stable framerate even on normal settings.  I've owned this game for a couple years & am only now getting around to playing it because it's just such a bad port.That being said, this game is actually really good & I wish I could have played it sooner.  It isn't without it's faults, however.PROS-Large Open World to Explore-Lots of Collectables & Unlockables-Fun Gameplay-Good Story-Ship BattlesCONS-Gameplay can be frustrating at times-Collectables are mostly used as a ""Gameplay Time Extender""-Some Story Missions are just kind of dumb or trial & error-Earning Money relies on ""Kenway's Fleet""STORYYou play as an employee at Abstergo Industries, a private company built on Animus Technology that records & edits genetic memory data to make movies.  You are part of a team going through the Genetic DNA Memories of Subject 17 who's biological history makes him one of the most valuable subjects for Animus Technology.  As you ""play"" through his genetic memories you soon find that things are not what they seem.  An ancient conspiracy emerges about an age old war against Assassin's & Templars bordering on the deranged shows itself & you are soon tasked by your superiors with finding out about something called the ""Observatory"" as soon as possible.  Playing through the memories, you are in the role of Edward Kenway, a Privateer/Pirate of the early 1700s who's friends with Blackbeard himself.  You must use all yours & Edwards resources in order to find out about the Observatory & what power it holds.GAMEPLAY & FEATURESThe game starts off witha thud that turns into a bang.  Eventually, after 4 or so hours, you are in the actual meat of the game with your own ship, crew, & island hideout.  Everything is upgradeable, but not everything is useful.  Your house, for example, has about 3 upgrades, all of which do absolutely nothing.  You get multiplayer rewards for upgrading it completely.  Yea, that's what we want from our Single Player games, Multiplayer rewards.  Anyways, not everything is all bad.  You can upgrade your ship, your weapons & armor via crafting & add other new additions to your island hideaway like hookers, a bonfire & a tavern.  Most of which are still pretty disappointing.  I bought the bonfire thinking it would be this big epic burning man celebration on the beach, but it turns out it was just a camp fire with people around it.  Whoopie.  Upgrading your ship is the most important thing you can possibly do in this game.  You get materials for it by taking down other ships or raiding plantations stockpiles.  Each ship you take down you can either add to your fleet, lower your wanted, repair your ship, or just sink the bloody thing.  Sinking is easier but cuts your booty by about half.The Fleet is a sort of mini game where, each ship you capture can go on trade routes to earn money & random loot for your mansion to display or to equip on yourself or your ship.  I don't really like the idea of RNG loot systems, but this one's alright.  It's set up kind of like a Mobile game, where you take out enemy ships on routes, then send ships that are capable on the voyages which can range from 5 minutes to actual days to complete.  It's a waiting game, but it's also the best way to earn Money in the game.  I don't like that, if you don't use this minigame you are basically gimped for coin.  Money in the actual game itself isn't easy to come by & chests are filled with paultry sums that don't add up quick enough for what you need to buy.  In my travels in the game after about 40+ hours of gameplay I've maybe run across 40k total, while just sending ships out to do missions netted me over 100k by just turning the game off & waiting for missions to complete.Combat & platforming is also a mixed bag.  Sometimes it works perfectly, other times it's janky as all hell.  At times, Edward will run wild clinging to walls & jumping off of every little thing you don't want him to, while others he does exactly what you were trying to do.  During combat, sometimes counters just don't work & you'll be stuck in a quick succession chain attack by one enemy.  Others, they will always work & you'll never get hit.  The biggest issue I have though is how poorly designed the combat system is in general.  Simply attacking an enemy takes about 4x longer to kill than a counter kill, so there's really no point in attacking first as it just leaves you open.  You're better off just countering or throwing a smoke bomb & instantly killing everyone around you.  There are those cool bad♥♥♥♥♥moments when you are on a freeflow combo killing spree that make attacking worthwhile but it's just a less effective way of dealing with enemies.Then there are ship battles, which I must say are this games bread & butter.  Far more time was spent perfecting ship combat than the melee combat.  Starting out, you can't take on squat but as you upgrade your ship you will be able to take on the dreaded Man O'war vessels & even add them to your fleet.  Then there are the big Legendary Ships which are meant to be taken on only when you've fully upgraded your ship & those fights are doozies.  You get mortars, cannons, heavy shots, fire barrels, chain shots, & quick shots that target vulnerabilities you've made from other attacks.  Oh, and you can ram the crap out of other ships.  Once you get a big ram, you can pretty much monster truck your way over smaller ships with ease.  As you keep attacking ships, your wanted level goes up which summons Hunters, which get stronger & more frequent the higher level your wanted gets.  You can use your wanted level as bait to lure out better ships to add to your fleet or get more materials to sell or upgrade with.The crafting in this game is basically copy/pasted from AC3.  You'll need to hunt animals & use their hides to add/upgrade your arsenal & defenses.  The difference is now, you can hunt whales & sharks.  The best way for me to describe these fights are comparing them to the big aligator boss fight in RE4.  You harpoon them, latch on & they pull you around & dive down to hide.  Then, they attack your ship if you don't hit them in time.  It's almost the exact same formula from that RE4 boss fight, just replace the big crocodile with sharks & whales.There are also random events in the game like the White Whales or Trade Routes that give good coin or loot.  These appear as blue R-Boat symbols on your minimap & are available for limited times only.  Once found, they automatically share with anyone on your U-Play friends list so your friends can do them, too.  Not your Steam list, though.  So, if you have a lot of Steam Friends but not U-play the share feature is basically worthless here.Finally, the collectables.  These range from simple chests, to missions, to Animus fragments & there are a ton of them.  Doing them all will take a considerable amount of time & probably extend gameplay by at least 3x.  I say this as I remember the one mission that put 3 animus fragments in jump off points that forced you to treck back through the entire Island again after getting each one.  Literally, extending gameplay of that one mission by at least 3x.  Some collectables do this, others are simply put on the path so you can get them as you progress.  I don't know if there's a reward for collecting everything, since I haven't done it yet.OVERALLIf you are looking for a great open world adventure game with a Pirate theme & have capable hardware, then this is worth the buy.  It's frustrating at times but the pros do outweigh the cons in the long run. Just be aware that this game isn't perfect.  I'd go on, but I'm out of characters to type.			"

												>>>>>> While it's an amazing game by itself - the PC port is horrible. Read at the end for that, if your PC meets the RECOMMENDED or close to (not minimum at all) by all means get an enjoy the game. If you do not carry anything above 2.7Ghz / or an HDX8XX + or one of the newer GTX models you WILL NOT run this game at good speeds.Hands down the best Assassin's Creed game since AC2, and an amazing pirate game by it's own right.As soon as you start the game up, it starts up in high action and puts you in a storm, taking control of a vessel as soon as you're able to move and fight off the invading Navy after that ship's captain was killed. You play as Edward Kenway, a brash, young pirate in hopes of landing it big and living it easy, and right away the game tells you a bit of his backstory and you're given control of Edward yet again and gain access to the Assassin robes and his weapons of preference, two long swords.The game is visually a treat, with vegetation and fauna being more alive than ever in an AC game, just on the first island alone, you can see tiny crabs walking alongside the sand , you can see turtles moving about, seagulls flying above, etc the game feels alive thanks to these touches of detail - that's not even mentioning the amazing texture work the game has overall, the grass moves as you swivel through it, the water reacts to every little force and as you sail you get to see the waves far off move back and forth as they crash alongside your ship as you sail through the vast open world, arguably the biggest in any AC game to date, and explore every island to your heart's content.In regards to the already standarized systems found in previous AC games - the combat feels more like AC1 in it's execution, with counters not being as obvious and enemies being more aggresive, it makes you actually worry a bit and forces you to slow down and pick your fights as you can't take many hits in combat unlike in certain previous AC games. The regenerating is back for this game, and you will actually need it, as playing reckless will see you low on health more often than not as well as some enemies being almost impervious to kill counters mix in among those that are. Stealth has also been improved from the previous games, but it still isn't the best trait the game has, enemies still have the unrealistic bobble icons that flash from yellow to red and can be alleviated easily by just hiding in tall grass or sides o buildings, etc, but enemies DO react faster upon seeing you, making the experience slightly more intense and stealth a more viable option than in previous AC games.As far as new mechanics and things to do go: the naval combat has been GREATLY improved from AC3's. It involves 3 points of attack - Front (releases a bolo like cannon that slows down enemy ships), Side (Standard Damage dealing cannons) and Back (Drops fire barrels to stop ships from sneaking up on you and ramming your vessel) as well as a new attack mode that fires a concentraded cannon fire on enemy ship weakpoints to deal massive damage (you'll be using this a lot too) and every single Navy encounter feels more like a duel when out at sea, it is amazing. On top of that, lowering an enemy ship's value to red, and then parking alongside them will allow you to board their ship, you can choose to either down their ship entirely, or board them and take the full cargo to your ship as well as potentially add new crew members.* * In addition, there's also hunting (in both land and sea) land is like AC3, you find and kill critters on different islands and skin then for items that can be used to upgrade your holsters, etc for a bigger inventory space and extras for your character and in the sea you get to experience the joys of feeling like Captain Ahab and hunting that great white. :P The Seafarer's Adventures ~ This game as a whole is an AMAZING pirate game by itself. Traveling feels a lot like Legend of Zelda Windwaker, and I am amazed at how much of an improvement this game is compared to the mediocre AC3. Combat and the standardized AC mechanics have been greatly improved, the character itself is charming and lovable as far as rogue adventure types go and the game itself is a treat visually and sounds amazing too thanks to the amazing composition by Brian Tyler. A+++ One of my faves this year no doubt.EDIT: For now I have to unrecommend this game due to the large amount of bugs and issues the game currently has on PC. While I did love this game, I cannot for the life of me understand just what the hell Ubisoft is doing with this game. Performance before that PhysX patch was shoddy at best before, but now it's almost borderline unplayable, and even unplayable for a lot of people. I have a friend with an amazing Rig that can't even get past the damn Uplay Launcher and I have to run the game at 1280x resolution to maintain at LEAST a 28 - 30 FPS on both PCs. Until Ubisoft fixes some of these issues OR a new driver that makes this mess playable it's literally a ""Your Mileage may Vary"" kind of thing. Buy at your own risk.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag sailed in on a wave of hype before it was released. It was the perfect storm of combining the ninja-like abilities of the Assassins with the Pirate life of the Caribbean in the early 18th century. The game became more open-world with a large open ocean to explore and sail, islands, ruins, and cities to explore, whaling to be done, shipwrecks to search, and the adventure seemed endless. After the newness of this game wears off, however, the game quickly turns into a grindfest and a lot of the excitement is gone, replaced by monotonous tedium.The person no longer takes on the role of Desmond (  who was killed at the end of Assassin's Creed III  ) but instead becomes a faceless, voiceless worker at Abstergo Entertainment, a company working to turn the Animus Adventures into adventures for the average consumer. Your job is to explore the life of Edward Kenway (Hatham and Connor's ancestor) to turn into footage for a game about life in the Caribbean. Of course, the whole thing turns out to be another search for an old-world artifact: The Observatory, which has the power to change the world. Edward, who is neither Assassin, nor Templar, is just a puckish rogue who wants to make a fortune on the high seas. After having your previous ship destroyed, you chance upon an Assassin, Duncan Walpole, who was on one of the ships in the other side of the engagement. After chasing down, killing, and assuming Duncan's identity as an Assassin, Edward goes on his journey to find The Observatory.As stated before, the game goes from exciting, exploring the Caribbean and being introduced to the world, to having to grind a bunch of resources to upgrade your ship and your gear. The game also doesn't even give you one of the tools in your arsenal until VERY late in the game (and by the time you're given the tool, you use it for 2 missions and it's really not useful beyond that). Ubisoft still hasn't fixed the horrendous control issues that plague the AC franchise in its 6th game of the series. I don't know how many times I would be looking at something to jump to and the game would pick some arbitrary point in a completely different direction to send me. The game also loved to have me air assassinate a target on the ground rather than knock out a tranquilized enemy right next to me for whatever bizarre reason. When that air assassination forces you to have to replay a large chunk of the mission over again, it gets frustrating. The ending of the game felt really rushed rather than coming to a satisfying conclusion. The whole end sequence was more an exercise in patience rather than a real, honest-to-goodness boss battle as the level shifts and changes and you just sit and wait for it to get into the next position so you can proceed. By the end of the game, I was angry, frustrated, and beyond ready for the game to end.Although with all of its faults, AssCreed 4 was still fun. You just need a TON of patience and be ready to forgive the game for all the dumb decisions it's going to have you make. For instance, the game thinks that if you're in a place to jump up to the top area of a mast but also in a position to jump down 100 feet and almost kill yourself, the obvious choice that a normal person would make would be to jump down 100 feet and almost kill yourself. *facepalm*Final Verdict: 7/10[Final Edit: The game is also locked at 30 FPS on PC for whatever reason... No real excuse for that. My computer can handle the game at 60 FPS easily.]			"

Assassin's Creed: Black FlagTo give you a rough idea of how much I enjoyed this game: 63 hours in, I lost my save to Uplay sync issues (forgot to disable cloud sync after reinstalling Uplay), and didn't actually mind having to start over from scratch. I can safely say that this game has single-handedly restored my faith in the AC series. It really taps into your inner adventurer and every new element seems cleverly designed to make you want to keep going, craving for more.Pros:Refreshing story that distances itself from the usual Assassin vs Templar plot;Matt Ryan does a brilliant job as Edward Kenway—and so does the rest of the cast;Kenway is a believable, flawed protagonist;Seafaring, upgrading the ship and exploring is fun and addictive;Hunting and crafting is straightforward and cleverly integrated to gameplay;Fast-travel to viewpoints makes things a lot less cumbersome and exploring that much more attractive;Interesting, less intrusive approach to present day storyline;Beautiful Caribbean setting, and very good-looking graphics in general;Rating memories feels productive (if true) and is well implemented in context.Neutral:Split between overly familiar side quests, and new and exciting ones;Kenway's Fleet doesn't reset if you start a new game;Some unnecessary capitalisation in the subtitles in a misplaced attempt to mirror Old English;Decent soundtrack.Cons:Kenway's Fleet isn't as fun a trading system as it could have been (especially ship battles);Cross-shaped weapon selection is less accessible than the wheel, in my opinion;Database is less handy to follow the story/catch up on lore than previous iterations (no ""Recent entries"", etc.).

												The Game itself is great. Easily the best AC game since AC 2. But since you have to use Uplay, it ruins the whole experiance. If you can get Uplay to even run, you'll see yourself playing many hours of black flag only for Uplay to erase all of your progress. Because of Uplay I cannot recomend this game at all or any Ubisoft game.			"

												With AC IV Ubsisoft masters the art of mass appeal gaming in a spectacular open world.  Unfortunately,  its game play is as shallow as its world is vast, and its mechanics are pathetically anemic for an annualized franchise.  I'm writing this review after having completd only about half of the main story, because I'm debating whether or not to continue.  After 20 or so hours the aspects of the game that were initally fun have beocme boring and repetive, and its shortcoming are a constant source of frustration.  Quite simply, the game is no longer fun to play.Graphics quality is good.  The story is decent, although it unfolds most through cut-scenes and linear missions.  Combat is the same brain-dead block and parry nonsense that got old in the original Assassins Creed.  Free run as glitchy as ever, and quite often freely decides to move in a direction that defies all logic, often resulting in a spectacular plummet from heights that took several minutes of diligent manuerving to achieve.  Stealth is even more poorly implemented.  Auto-stealth zones are a poor man's stealth mechanic, and AC IV continues to use them liberally. The combination of simplsitic stealth and imprecise movement is a recipe for frustration.  Many times I have been hangling from a ledge with a guard patrolling above, waiting for the pricise moment to pounce... When suddenly I jump up right in front of him no apparent reason, triggering an alarm and failing the segment.  Such fundamental flaws are unforgivable after a half dozen or so AC release iterations.In all fairness, resource gathering and crafting is greatly improved.  Sea battles are the source of raw materials for upgrading your ship, and upgrades are a neccesity to defeat stronger vessels.  But even then, sailing around the world plays out like a single-player MMO.  Enemy ships are everywhere, so you must contantly engage in battle to get anywhere.  Ship battles are fun for the most part, but do get reptitive after sinking a couple hundred foes.  But grinding is required if you to obtain enough upgrades to take on legendary ships.There are quite a few other activities as well, like hunting and finding misc. collecetibles and treasure.  But the appeal of those diversions eventually wears thin as well.  There are also a few out-of-animus experiences thrown for good measure.  They are so linear, slow, and dull then when given the chance of hacking a computer or jumping off a building, I was dismayed to learn suicide was not actually an option.  Which was unfortunate becuase the hacking mini-game made me want to kill myslef in real life.So, I'm debating whether or not to continue my pirate adventure.  I've actually put it away a couple times already, then decided it deserved more of a chance.  I really want to like this game.  It presents a world full of potential.  Unfortunatetly, my voyages in AC IV seem to ultimately ground themelves on the rocks of shallow, glitchy game play and missed opportunity.  So, to save others the same frustrations it gets a thumbs down from me.			"

												Black Flags is a AC game and has bugs because Ubisoft. If you are have V sync issues or stuttering with constant drops to 30fps there is a fix and it gives you alittle more performance as well. You can either use the windows key+L to lock windows then unlock go back into game or run the game as admin with Vsync and triple buffering conrtolled by the gpu. Another issue you may get is freezing for a few seconds while sailing. This is a glitch caused by FXAA so don't use it. Now to my review.  Black Flag is not a normal Creed game. Mostly because its amazing, and no game with an ""animus"" in the story should be called amazing. The other AC games are good don't get me wrong I like them alot; but, not GTA, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Witcher good. Black Flag is nearly just that. The mechanics in the game are polished and open exluding a few bugs. The graphics are top notch for 2013 as well. The naval combat is a blast :p, and the melee combat is great. My only gripe is it is restricted to typicall AC themes. I.E. don't be killing civilians, no taking someone elses ship and building that one up, limited to what weapons you can hold on to. I am a pirate so I should be swashbuckling stabby cut throat ♥♥♥♥♥ mongering drunkard fun. The story is ok, but sometimes unbearably in accurate how they portray real pirates(simular to ACIII with its horrible geography and historic figures), and they are just there to move the plot. Black Beard is NOTHING like he was in real life. This is a 6,5""+ 280 pound+ man who left his crew to die by grounding the Queen Annes Revenge to keep the money for himself. Ubisoft portrays him as average size, fairly nice, inept at piracy and loyal person. Don't even get me started on Black Bart.The whole animus thing is bearley a discussion and is still needless. They could have just made it you are a pirate, go and pirate things. No need for the same old story of made up blah blah in historical localations, but the open world lets you forget about that. Though you can never get a new ship or are able to capture one which is a real shame. Though you can upgrade the ship.  With the world being so big and grand, and your crew singing while you sail its easy to get sucked in. (songs like Leave Her Johnny, Drunken Sailor and Fathom the Bowel I find myself singing at times to some odd looks from people) The mini games are a lot of fun and at times. I just like to play a game of checkers while listening to the ""live band"" who will play period music.(and each region gets their own songs based on the inhabitants. Like an English settlement will play old English and Irish songs like All for My Grog) Another gripe I do have for this game is its a bear to run. Most are lucky to see 30FPS@high res Ultra. I modded it and it tends to run around 45-50fps at 1080p with high on everything but shadows with an i7, 2gb nVidia, and 16gigs ram. So make sure you can run it if you are on a lower end machine or laptop. A 980ti will muscle it at 1440p at 60fps with sweet fx, but the gameworks features will need to be off because its gameworks. To maintain 60 100% of the time I need to drop a few setting down to very high even on a 980ti. For a 1080ti 4k is easily attainable but you will need to ajust your settings.  No joke this is one of the most stressful games to run with all of it's PC features. Black Flag is the one of two games of the series that was developed on PC then ported.(ACIII bring the other) Which is odd it still has bugs given it was made for PC. Since it was developed for PC it has a wide array of graphic options with many different setting to them.   This is a game I would highly recommend to people who even hate the series, because this pirate game shouldn't of bothered with the name Assassins Creed #. No it is to good! This is just Black Flag to me, and Black Flag is great!!!!!!!!! Oh and for some reason I always seem to play this when I've had a few. It just makes the debauchery better I think.			"

Posted: May 7, 2016
												Literally the best game I've ever played. At least, certainly my favorite game. I have never felt so immersed in and compelled by a game in my life. The music, the scenery, the world, the ships; all these combined perfectly to pull me deep into the world of the game. SHIP COMBAT: 10/10You have not felt immersion until you have stood at the wheel of a pirate ship dodging and blasting your way through a five-way naval battle in an intense gale. The ship controls are perfect, and allow you a huge amount of control over the Jackdaw. As soon as I got my ship, I spent days of real time just sailing around fighting, plundering, and upgrading; I can't get enough of it. I have played over 300 hours of this game and the naval combat has never once felt boring or stale; every fight is an adventure (provided you fight the ships in your ""weight"" class). I have beaten all the legendary ships. I have upgraded all aspects of my ship to 100% (including the legendary upgrades). I even went on a treasure chest hunt so I could get that special ship's wheel customization I wanted.All in all, this is the best sailing/naval combat game in existence (that I've played, at least). NON-SHIP COMBAT: 8/10You are rambo. Edward can literally take on the entire crew of a British Man-O'-War singlehandedly and win. The combat is fun and fast, but it's pretty much just a button-masher. If you're looking for an innovative hand-to-hand combat engine, you won't find it here (I'd recommend Shadow of Mordor). Also the game occasionally glitches, meaning you throw someone in the wrong direction, stab the air, etc (this is a rare issue, though). Still, the combat, and especially the boarding sequences (the game transitions seamlessly from naval combat to ship boarding; stereotypical pirate rope swinging included) is exciting and fast-paced, and makes you feel like you're in a less-silly Pirates of the Caribbean film. STORY: (7/10)For a non choice-driven story, this game really delivers. I felt very invested in Edward's character, and I felt that he underwent significant and realistic character development. Many people say they dislike the story because Edward is motivated by greed, but in my opinion those people have missed the point. This story is about a man achieving his dream of wealth, only to realize (SPOILER) too late that love and family are the greatest treasures of them all. I almost cried at the ending (SPOILER ENDS HERE).Frankly, I would have given the story a higher rating if not for the Assassin and Abstergo portions, which I found to be boring, uncompelling, and repetitive. WORLD: 10/10I've been to the Caribbean, and I have to say that this game's portrayal of the sea and islands is spot-on. The world is totally open, and the seas positively teem with trade and warships from different colonial powers (which occasionally fight each other) for you to plunder. Also, there are so many beautiful islands to explore that you can spend days of real-time getting through them all. Although the map is, of course, limited, it very rarely feels that way; you feel like the sea is yours to roam. SOUNDTRACK: 9/10As a music major, I hear a lot of great music by great composers. This game's music is right up there with those in some places. The music changes a bit too fast for my taste in some places (such as when you're going from naval to shipboard combat), but that's just a matter of personal preference. It's like Pirates of the Caribbean, but different.My only true complaint is that, sometimes, some of my crew sing a tad off-key in the sea-shanties. I like the shanties; they are catchy and add to the experience. But to be honest, off-key singing drives me insane. Luckily this isn't the case with all the shanties. OVERALL: 42/50 (84%)If you like pirates, buy this game. I would have gladly paid double the price if I had known how good this game was. My rating is not 100% because I feel there are some aspects of the game that could be improved. That being said, I repeat that this is the most fun I have ever had playing a video game.			"

												The 4th iteration of the main Assassins Creed games, Black Flag is arguably one of the better titles in this exceptional series.  Having put over 200 hours into this game over both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions of this game, I felt I should experience this game as it was truly meant to be played, on PC. While the port isn't the best ever produced, it was better than previous ports in the series.Pro's:+ Beautiful Graphics+ Smooth and Satisfying combat system that makes you truly feel that you are controlling a master swordsman+ Fantastic and detailed enviroment, one of the best in the Entire Assassins Creed franchise+ The Naval Combat is refined and gratifying. Immobilising a Man O' War, boarding it and slaughtering the crew is an adrenaline rush, that thus far, has never gotten old+ An atmospheric and masterfully composed soundtrack+ Long and detailed narrative that focuses on Edward Kenways search for the First Civilisation temple known as The Observatory. While a little too light on the whole 'Assassins Vs Templars' war that has been the focus of the series, I found it interesting and thought provoking none the less.Con's:- The port is a typical Ubisoft port, with frequent framerate drops being prominent throughout. Even with my midrange rig, 60fps at 1080p wasn't always that achieveable. - The main Antagonist is somewhat dull, with other villans in the franchise such as Cesare Borgia and Haytham Kenway being much more memorable and charasmatic.- The main missions require arbitrary optional objective's to be completed in order to get 100% sync on them. Unnecessary and unwelcome.- Combat System lacks almost any challenge. The majority of player will be able to defeat entire groups of guards without even getting hit. This is somewhat negated with the naval combat (taking on a legendary ship with only light upgrades is a sure fire way to load up Dark Souls for a relaxing and laid back experience).Overall, Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is something quite remarkable. An exceptional game that came at a time where the Assassins Creed series, according to the vocal minority, was beginning to tread water. Fantastic mechanics and aesthetic design make this game a cut above the rest. Sailing around the high sea's, my HUD faded in the background, the sound of sea spray splashing against the hull and my crew erupting into Way me Susiana is a truly remarkable experience that I, among many others, will never forget. A must play.			"

												A refreshing take on the Assassin's Creed series with a memorable protagonist during the pirate era, good gameplay, memorable characters, beautiful environments, a soundtrack suiting to my ears and last but not least great sailing mechanics and naval combat. This is the Ubisoft i admire (just like in the early 2000's) unlike nowadays.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV is very different to the other games in the Assassin's Creed franchise, which is why some people might critisize the game for straying too far from it's original purpose. However, I absolutely loved the game. Although Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag sets much more focus on being a pirate and sailing a ship, it definetely feels awesome to be an assassin pirate.There are lots of incentives to upgrade your ship and yourself, and to complete side missions and general activities. The story of Black Flag is definetely one of the best stories I've ever connected to (since the dialogue is almost always matched with the gameplay), and especially near the end you gain a deep understanding of the story. But of course, what's a good story without good gameplay? AC4 never dissapoints a pirate's wildest fantasies. I still remember the first time I rammed into a ship and swung onto the ship, wiping everyone out in a fury of pressing two buttons. The combat is rather bland and requires little skill, but feels really cool nevertheless. In the end, whether you've played every game in the franchise, have no clue about the games or just wanting to be a badass pirate, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is sure not to dissapoint.  8.8/10 P.S pistol-swords			"

												I am a fan of Assassin's Creed universe (I love all AC titles), but this one just ROCKED my world. What a brilliant mind, to put a plot from Assassin's Creed in a pirate era. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay brilliant and the action ... oh the action! I can sail all day wondering what's next, what will I find on a deserted island, what's next to plunder, which ship should I attack .. and so on. The BEST game with pirates, the BEST of Assassin's Creed series, and the BEST game of the year (yeah you heard me wright - and I own/ played GTA5 on my PS3). Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ it's a game that it's a MUST for every gamer that calls itself a gamer, and above all a PIRATE. You just have to try it ... I don't care how .. just do it! OH! And the naval warfare ... oh my ... you just have to experience this. I'll take my bottle of rum and I'll go find somethin go plunder. YARRR!!! 10/10			"

												Black Flag is a certain success. Certain, but not complete. The best word I have to describe that game is ""Inconsistent"".After the questionable third volume of the Assassin's Creed franchise, which was supposedly the last in the story... AC IV should have been very bright, sparkling with the story, the main character, the combination of all already invented game mechanics and a good addition of newer ones. It was really supposed to add something fascinating to the Assassin's Creed Universe.Ubisoft crafted one of the greatest and interesting games with ""Pirates"" topic - and some even say ""the best pirate game of all"". With that they failed to recollect the loose ends of that precious, yet quite dubious Creed of assassins. Speaking ahead, in the next game of the serial, the Rogue, Ubisoft went even forward with messing the cornerstones and adding as much blur to the main AC story as possible. What was intriguing and inspiring at the first and second volumes of franchise, the inheritance of the former race, the main quest to save the world from global apocalypse... all that becomes quite gaudy and messy, t the point when none care about the main quest at all. Oh well, let's cut the story, in the end it just dropped hard and shattered to bits and pieces - spoiling the overall impression even worse than the end of the Mass Effect III.As of the Black Flag in general, though... it is normal and even delightful open-world Ubisoft game, with the robbers from the main road posed as valiant knights in their crusade. Only with such goals to fulfill as the thirst for gold and blood and fear, and without the shadow of vengeance for their misdeeds... You may assume now what I'm not so high with pirates as ""good guys"". Well, I'm not high about the killing in the first place, but that can't stop me from admiring the Assassin's Creed serial for the impact on the gaming world that Ubisoft originally made.So - yeah, with all said, Black Flag is a damn-good gaming experience, with intense action both on the land and on the sea. Great naval battles, the chests with gold and other prizes spread along the big territory of West India... Black Flag is a one fine adventure.It has some flaws, sure: the main story and some of the game features quite illogical and even spoiled. Like hunting with the hidden blade - before you acquire one. Like the quests from assassins which you can take right after arriving in the first city - a friggin year before the story actually tells you to do so - and with that, the diving sequences (which would be so natural to free-riding adventurer before he messed with Assassins) comes closer to the end of the gameplot. In my game, I've conquered all the forts, sinked one of the legendary ships, and done about 80% of other free-riding before I was permitted to finally bought the diving bell. It is so messed in my book, that only non-explicit word I have about it is ""inconsistent"". Yeah, I said that already, I know, I know...Some major glitches known from AC III and even previous titles - disappearing ships, leaving big holes into the water, for example. Or people stacking into supposedly solid structures, like walls and roofs. Sometimes during the missions you can try to perform something supposedly legal by game's rules, but not lined into the given quest scripts, like jumping into other bush than you were aimed to... the game crushes. Sweet, right?Well, with all said, I'm still highly recommend the Black Flag. Even if you're not down with all that Assassin's Creed fuss, that game stands aside. It's a fairytale 'bout pirates, rum, treasures and exceptional bravery of the seamen, with glorious naval battles and very complex (even if a bit unstable) open-world experience.My mark is 8.7/10 - I enjoyed almost everything but the occasional (not frequent) bugs and bits of logical flaws here and there during my gameplay.PS: As of DLC Freedom Cry - take it, if you have a thing in saving black people from chains (even if gets repetative quite fast). Or if you enjoy the melee combat by AC rules, as there will be new and fine moves with big mean machete. If only there were decapitations in the fighting engine, Adewale would be a perfect resemblance to the ""Machete' movie... Blunderbuss is cool thing to wield as well, yarr! Just don't expect from Freedom Cry the deepness even on the level with Revelations. It's just a short DLC campaign for a black assassin, saving his people from slavery. Worth 6.9/10 mark, I guess.

												The short of it is:Performance wise, I've heard there are some glitches, but never saw anything that stood out. I never had any real problems aside from the usually odd jump mechanics, which are better in this title than the title that came before black flag, and easy to adjust to anyhow. It plays smoothly, has decent enough graphics and unlimited baddies to wack if your feeling blood thirsty.It can be a little grindy for some folks, but with so much to do, I didn't really notice. Also, no serious gamer is a fan of U-Play imo, but otherwise I really have no complaints. Even then, U-Play at least allows you to share rare finds with friends, which is an interesting feature. Black flag is an atmospheric AC game that won't feel very linear, as there is tons to do and it makes use of it's rather open world quite well. I've had loads of fun with it and I highly reccomend it.Long Verision:Ever played an Assassin's creed game and got frustrated with with the limits of the asassin code? I did. Thank god for black flag!AC games can be a hit or a miss, but even in the good ones sometimes you are left going ""for crying out loud! I'm an assassin! What care I about the common folk?!"" In older titles, it seems like for every enemy its okay to kill, there seems to be 20 civillans in the way and well, mistakes happen. Mistakes that would cost you because the commoners tend to get in the way.Well, you might not get to stab a bunch of innocents in this verision of AC ethier.. but for once, you won't notice. Black flag is definitely a title for those who want to cut loose. The civillans rarely get in the way here. They are spaced out nicely while still feeling kind of like a dense population and there are baddies a' plenty.The hero character of the hour, Edward, is also not your typical assassin from the order. He cares a whole lot less about all that honor talk, perferring the sound money makes. He has no qualms about killing for some coin and he gets away with it. Why? In AC:BF you play as a pirate who is pretending to be one of the assassins and therefore is not fully bound by the code.And when I say your not bound, I mean by the assassin's code or anything else. Black flag isn't just about hunting that templar scum. Sure, it's in there, but as a sailor, you soon will find you have wide swaths of ocean to travel with plenty of side actitvies to do.. some of which are locked behind story missions, yes, but the game gets rolling quickly and everything is open fairly early on without ruining progression.Want to upgrade your weapons? Go for it.. but you'll want to hunt that animal down to do it.. after all, you need it's skin.. and different animals means areas of travel and tactic. Want to hunt a whale? Well, are your harpoons up to snuff? What about your rowboat? For that matter, what about your main ship? Is it strong enough to face the might of the sea?You do want to loot miltary ships of all that heavy gold, sugar, cannon shot and metal don't you? Or were you just after boarding the scuttled enemy ship so you could fight them hand to hand, walking amongst them like the god of death your feared to be? Well, then you better buy a decent sword and cloak to look the part!And did I mention the songs your crew will sing as you sail the ocean, which you have to chase down to unlock? What about the forts you can wage battle against, or the ability to dock into a town and go hunting for soliders or raiding stock houses? What about a trading mini-game that allows you to capture ships and make them work for you in real time? It's a good way to make some coin while your working that 9 to 5 job that paid for the game in the first place. But then, maybe your just a landlubber who likes to gamble on british checkers. Yeah, it has that too. All the while, the usual AC goodies are there in the missions with a decent story and some fun sneakiness if you want it. Yes, if you want it.. most of the missions don't require you to be sneaky. It's a bonus, nothing more.. but might make things easier on you if your smart about it.  Black flag typically lets you play your way.Plus.. did I mention treasure hunts? Because what is a pirate without some buried tresure maps? On the modern day side of the story, your a promising intern at Astergo Entertainment. So when you want to step out of the animus (your simulator) and go back to  modern day, that's fine too. It has it's own little story to tell, which leads to several easter eggs from the older AC titles.. making black flag a great game to start on if your a little behind or even new to the assassin's creed games.

												I would love to recommend the game. But I never will and so long as Uplay exists I will never buy another Ubisoft game. I have spend more time trying to get Uplay to work than I have playing the game (and I'm 12% finished with the single-player campaign). The world is beautiful and the gameplay is fun. But the game requires Uplay which is a broken pile of steaming... excrement. According to Ubimal, Uplay needs me to set static a static IP for my computer then set up port forwarding for *TWENTY-FOUR* different ports. And if my wife or I want to switch computers (we have two desktops and a laptop that can run AC4 on max settings), then I have to go into the router configuration and change *ALL TWENTY-FOUR* ports to forward to the *other* static IP. And that's *if* Ubisoft connects. I haven't been able to connect yet. I have 70 games in my Steam Library, and I (semi-)regularly play five or more MMOs. I have a 200mbps connection (up and down) that usually sees maximum latency with North American Servers in the range of 100-200ms. The only time I *ever* have trouble connecting to a game is when it requires U(don't)play. We almost bought two copies so we could play the multiplayer together (we normally just play MMOs together). I am so glad that I didn't because buying the deluxe version of this game plus all of the DLC only to find that I can't access anything but the basic single-player game is frustrating enough. I would be highly irritated to have blown twice as much only to be locked out. As it is, I am strongly considering demanding a refund for everything except the basic game. Something I have *NEVER* done in twenty years of PC gaming.			"

												Its been a while since I completed this, looking at it today I realised I hadn't wrote a review, so here goes! Black Flag is definitely my favourite Assassins Creed title to date (I haven't played Rogue or Unity so I can't comment on them) the different combinations of side quests and missions kept me interested through most of the story. It is strange to think how long it has taken for there to finally be a great pirate game! And I really do emphasise on the word great. Sea exploration, battles and challenges are a wonderful addition to what I considered a pretty flat series. Assassins Creed looked destined to drag out the series with pretty much the same-as-normal routines that you would expect in most of Ubisofts titles, but Black Flag truly surprised me. I was immediately drawn to it when I first heard the inclusion of ships & battle. In fact this reminded me of when Total War finally brought naval battles into the game, I would spend hours enjoying it - just like Black Flag, it brought all those great memories back. Very refreshing and nice to be able to come back to (first had this on PS4) I'm looking forward to getting round to playing Rogue and Unity to see if Ubisoft has been able to keep up with this excellent title.PS: As a side note, Uplay is horrendous (as we all know) many times the game did crash, or Uplay decided to Notplay. It definitely became frustrating but overall didn't dampen my Black Flag experience too much.			"

												As a long time Assassin's Creed fan I must say I had my doubts for this particular title. With Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood alike being my all time fave AC titles, I was rather spektical about this at first. The whole idea of how Naval Combat in AC3 was horrible and made me rather avoid this title. But thankfully I took my chances and played this. It is absolutely incredible. Simply amazing.The gameplay like previous AC titles is well worked and serves a great time while it follows the same idea of counter killing just about anyone via combat remains classic and at it's finest. Naval combat has been refined in an amazing way that made me simply love it compared to AC3's naval combat. Edward is a real fun character, altogh he seems like the worst Assassin at first, he appears to have a much better liking than Connor, the story is fun, intresting and all around enjoyable. Map is huge, no need to explain on that detail. It's big, no other word needed. Like any other AC games it can have some humerous but only sometimes game breaking glitches, Ubisoft get your head straigth please, Unity just shows how much people can stand your slackering. People tend to hate Uplay, and I actually did at first. But hey it's not THAT horrible, as long as I don't have to use it to actually get in my games so for all I care I just ignore it when the game finally installs. Great PC port. Just love it. Solid 60 frames nonstop. Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is an amazing title, it serves the idea of a good game for both AC fans and non AC fans. While this may not be your typical 'Loyal to the Creed against the Templar's type of game, it well enough deserves a top spot in the franchise and sits very well with the legacy AC2 holds. All in all, I'd give Assassin's Creed Black Flag a 9.7/10 A must have if you enjoy these types of open world games.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. It is the next installment in Assassin's Creed series and a prequel to Assassin's Creed III in terms of storyline.Desmond Miles is dead, but his legacy continues. An unknown Abstergo Entertainment employee is doing research on Desmond ancestors in the familiar machine called Animus based on Desmond samples where he dives into the history of the one of many fearless and notorious pirates, Edward Kenway.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag like Assassin's Creed III, get some gameplay change and improvements again. Most improvements are very good and makes the game more fun and entertaining. The story takes place before the event of Assassin's Creed III, you play as Edward Kenway, grandfather of Connor Kenway, and a father to Haytham Kenway. In some location in this game, like in the city of Havana, we can go back to the building climbing style of gameplay, while in most location where it's not a city, the tree climbing still present a lot. But the best thing this Assassin's Creed has to offer is sea battles, piracy. While not on mission or on the way to mission location, you can engage and loot Spanish or Her Majesty ships, fleets or convoy and loot them for money and resources. Ship-to-ship battles has been improved a lot in this game that most of the time you will forget the mission and do some piracy instead. Sometimes I wonder how a small Brig can take down 2 big Spanish Galleon without a scratch and live to tell the tale. But those moment are awesome. But that just only one of many new features in this game that you can try. There are other things you can do like hunting sharks, wales or any of those extinct fish, explore undersea shipwreck and gets eaten by sharks, attack and conquer Spanish and/or British coastal forts, or maybe you just want to play checkers here. Sadly the Assassin's Brotherhood feature has been taken out in this game and replaced with Kenway's Fleet new mini-game. But many of these features are great, and there is still more to see.Graphics of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, for me, I don't know, I don't see much difference with Assassin's Creed III, except the effect on the sea. Sea can be very unpredictable here, sometimes the waves are calm, sometimes you have to face a small tsunami or hurricane which will damage you beloved ship. Performance of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is good, I haven't encounter any bugs or glitch and the game runs smoothly.In multiplayer, mictotransactions are back, I don't know why Ubisoft do that, but it's not like you have to buy them, so no harm done here.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, in my opinion, is the second best Assassin's Creed after Assassin's Creed II, ever. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Before I get into this review I'd like to adress a situation with AC3.AC3 followed the story of Revelations where it ended off, Desmond woke up from his coma and was off to another new adventure.In AC3 you overall got also introduced to a new Assassin Connor which most people call him uninteresting or lacking in terms of what Ezio had in store for you, but you shouldn't really put much blame on AC3 because of the Assassin design and what his atitude was in general.Connor in my honest opinion was a brutal as hell Assassin, a loving and caring person when it came to his natural enviormeant the Village and the Homestead, but a literall devil on the battlefield, characther design and atitude in general were pretty good and didn't lack in anything if you understood the point of his characther overall.AC3 overall was a pretty great game can't be top tier like AC2 or BF but it was a pretty great game in general.Now for BF.BF is either Great, Terific, Amazing, Glorious or God tier. It's pretty much an undescribable game for me really I enjoyed the hell out of it as a fan of the franchise for a long time, the overall core gameplay of it was smooth and fast paced and it was just an adrenaline rush in its own ways.The game offered us a better and more extende Naval Combat system which we have been asking for from AC3 and its probably the most fun you could also have in the game, the game in general is mainly covered 60% sea and 40% land making the Naval Combat one of the more important aspects of the game.The Naval Combat in BF is far superiour than what other Pirate/Ship battle games have and its quite alot of fun to just destroy the hell out of some giant fleets.Now overall the story and characther of the game.In BF the story picks off some time latter from AC3.Overall your characther is unknown as he is some kind of employe working for Abstergo as a double agent of some sorts since you technicaly share intel with the Assassins troughout the game in the modern day missions of the game ( Shaun and Rebeca ) overall the modern day segments are covered in a first person perspective and are just a bit odd, fun but odd, the fun thing you could really have in the modern day segments is just randomly collecting some QR codes and hacking PC's, yes hacking is a thing in this game, the hacking is pretty fun altough it repeats the same short minigame of either switching frequencies, turning a line from point A to point B in order to unlock the file or just a simple cracking the firewall type of game, pretty short but they are also pretty fun in general.The story of BF takes before the actions of AC3 so that means your way behind playing as the grandfather of Connor Kenway.Captain Edward James Kenway or as people called him that started off as a privateer at the begining of the game, overtaken for the lust of having a better life, greed is his main priority he takes as he pleases and doesn't give a rotten damn about anything, but hey thats the usual which you expect from a pirate, but troughout the game thinking that he may be some bad characther he overall isn't, he did get a bad reputation with both secret organizations but overtime learnt the morals of which had taken him quite some time to understand, over that course he sought to fight along side the Creed and follow its morals. He also was technicaly the founder and Grand Master of the English Assassin's Brotherhood. He grew to be quite a likeable characther in my opinion atleast.The core gameplay of it is as same as it was in AC3 with a few difrent changes to fit the playstyle of a pirate, duel wielding cutlasses and owning 4 flintlock pistols is the deal with AC4, the naval combat also has been improved from AC3 and also making it the main thing in the game.The game adds another important characther to it the Jackdaw which is your ship that you sail trough the Caribeans plundering and taking as you want, it's important that you take of your ship as it becomes quite the game changer if you upgrade it to max and all.Overall the game is good it'll take you aroudn 20-23h to complete that is if you spend next to no time on the naval contratcs, templar hunts, assassin contracts and such oh yeah and upgrading your ship which will take you quite a while to find the parts as there also a new mechanic added to game called Treasure hunting, you can find treasure maps from dead or unconcious corpses stranded on the shores of the locations you discover, each treasure map will containt either gold or an upgraded plan for the jackdaw and some aditional gold, sure gota love that pirate feel afterwards.Anyways got a bit offtrack there.The game at its base is great and all has a very small amount of glitches ( exclude the sinken rising ship thing which ocasionaly happens with the Jackdaw ) and so fort.The gameplay is great and is just amazing in some sense as you feel like a genuine pirate with the tools at your disposal.A much recommended game and also a favourite in my category as it just captures everything you could need in an AC game.

-Quick Review-Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a HUGE open-world, pirate-themed adventure game where you sale the ocean with a crew and your very own ship to find treasure, maybe complete the story or ignore it and just pirate.


I've got a feeling this is when the game starts to get REALLY fun!

-Detailed breakdown review-Confession Have you ever gotten yourself into something that was way over your head? You realized ""woah, this is going to be way more work then I was expecting""... That is how I feel about writing this review.After playing AC Black Flag for just a couple hours I knew writing a review was going to be a nightmare because there's just SO MUCH STUFF!So I must come clean and admit: I'm not really sure this review will be adequate. I plan to make a youtube review where I can hopefully outline my thoughts in more detail and with better control... But until then, you've got this mess!Story: Your story begins in 1715, you are Edward Kenway, thrill seeker, sailor, scoundrel... Pirate. Edward left his would-be-Fiancée and everything that he knew to set sail for the Caribbean.Along his journey he ends up making contact with the assassins, you know... the assassins with a creed? Yeah, those guys. For reason I will not spoil, he eventually is won over to their cause and helps them... But not before he has a jolly good time pirating!Oh wait, you just got pulled out of a simulation... What's going on here, you thought this game was about Pirates in the 1715's! Here's the thing, you're actually ""playing"" the memories of Edward Kenway for a company called ""Abstergo Entertainment"".They claim to be gathering footage for an up and coming Pirate movie they're doing on the characters in the 1715's and they need your help because you're naturally gifted with this ""memory-brain-meld"" technology. (It's basically VR, but VR in Sword Art Online style... but that's my guess anyhoo.)I could write a few more paragraphs on the story, but lets just say things are definitely not as black and white as they seem, between Abstergo and their goals, or the people *YOU* work with, for that mater.


And he was like ""Please give me a hand"" so I stabbed him in the back.

Gameplay: I could break the gameplay into a ton of sub categories, but for simplicity I'm going to focus on the two main combat features: Kenway's fighting/stealth/etc, and naval combat.KenwayKenway himself has quite the assortment of secondary weapons, even several different primary weapons, and don't get me started on the pickup weapons! Weapons for days!Kenway at first just goes to his dual swords for combat, but eventually he gets the sneaky-sleeve-daggers. There's probably a formal official name for them, but I'm calling them sneaky-sleeve-daggers.Depending on the weapons being used the animations are different, so a counter with swords looks and FEELS different then a counter with daggers, or even a counter when unarmed or holding a pickup-weapon.The Hand-to-hand combat is tailored for ambush striking, and then running away and finding a place to hide. Or you can be a man like me and duel your way through the English lines. Optional: you can also die a lot like me, because you're playing the game incorrectly. (My point is that the game isn't over if you get caught, normally there are numerous ways to get to objectives, you can sneak in, fight in, or a hybrid strategy. I personally like picking up sharp shooter's Rifles after they die, and sniping my target and running away making ""woop woop woop"" noises.)JackdawWhen Kenway obtains himself a ship, he names it the Jackdaw, a Jackdaw is a small bird part of the Crow Family (All the European readers are probably like ""DUH"", but hey! I've never seen one, okay? I'm sorry!). The Jackdaw starts out quite fragile, but as you loot and pirate around you get enough money and resources to upgrade her.And Upgrade her you do... with guns, armor, cargo, aesthetics, sails, ammo, crew quarters. Trust me when I say that you're definitely investing in this ship.Now comes the part I was skeptical about going into the game... Sailing a ship.Hands down, this was one of the most awesome and freeing sensations in the game! When you're sailing well, and can direct your ship where you want to go, the game is golden, couldn't be better. But when you're pinned between an enemy ship, and getting mortared by the local fortress... That magic dries up faster then rain in the Sahara.So the Naval combat is touch and go, as a whole it adds to the experience, and definitely doesn't bog down the gameplay in my opinion. However, I will note that some of the most difficult challenges in the game involve the Jackdaw, so when the game says ""Hey, you should upgrade your ship before you do this Mission"", You darn well toot'n should upgrade that crap. If you don't you have no one to blame but yourself for how much death you'll have!Here's where we come to my final note about the gameplay... specifically when dealing with the Jackdaw. You will hit literal walls that you cannot pass unless you go pirate-farm for a bit so you can upgrade your ship. Some people might be able to get by without it, but I had to go explore around, you can't really shoot straight through the story.Even though the story is quite linear and you can go from story chapter to story chapter, there is a type of ""gear check"" that is in place to slow you down. AC Black flag was designed to take loads of time to play, to some people believe it or not, that's a turn off for a game! To others it's like ""YES, inject that into my arm with an IV please, ahhhh yeah"".


This was a very creepy part, beautiful... but creepy (I hate sharks)

Conclusion: I knew this review would become huge... I haven't even been able to get into the finer details of the different weapons you unlock for Kenway or the Jackdaw, the mini-games, the multiplayer (ugh... don't buy it for the multiplayer please, it took forever to get it to work), special events, getting world completion, uplay, uplay achievements... OH CRAP UPLAY!Hey, Hi! did you make it to the bottom of this review? This game requires you to play the game through Uplay, Uplay MUST run in the background even if you boot the game through the steam client. That's one of the biggest gripes people will probably have about the game, other then getting stuck on ambient objects while trying to parkour... ACK! I couldn't even talk about the parkour!			"

												Possibly the best pirate game of the current gen and one weird Assassin's Creed setting ever. But hey, it works. What's great about this game is almost purely from its pirate element. Be a pirate captain, upgrading your ship, shooting ships and looting stuffs. As Ubisoft knows one weird good thing they made in AC III was the ship battle system. In term of gameplay, it's a very good action-adventure pirate game. Graphics may not be as good looking as their newer titles but the sea looks just fantastic. Also, it should run pretty decent on any modern PCs now. Only downside of the game is its medicore storyline that hardly related to previous games. Although good news is you don't have to play any of the those to play this. It's just another war between assassins and templars at Caribbean sea.			"

												Featuring an array of leisure really titanica, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag has characteristics which should always be at the heart of every game at free exploration, which is a cohesive and credible, and many secondary activities to justify the roam around the map. If to this we add a compelling plot, well placed in the historical context of reference and fun to follow, the result is a chapter of the saga able, finally, to stand up to the second episode for innovations, the centrality of sea life, and content density. Sorry didn't see the same courage in facing some of the ancestral deficiencies, such as the combat system, weapon anchored again always limits, but the renewed emphasis placed on stealth reminds us that the soul of the Assassin's Creed race much more again on a concealed blade, compared to a sabre in combat. Just twelve months away from the third chapter, the qualitative leap also brings a pleasant surprise, with Ubisoft who, unexpectedly, one of the best signature entertainment products that the saga of the killers has ever offered to fans.

												Pros:Good story.Good Graphics.Fairly large open world to explore.Treasure maps,Wreck Diving,Hunting,Crafting.Engaging sea battles from schooners to man o war's.Piratey songs.Day/Night cycle.Cons:Uplay.Minor graphical glitches/framerate issues occasionally in large and fast swordplay battles on land or @ sea.You cannot swap ships only upgrade the one you have (a brig).Minor climbing bugs in certain locations (Very rare).Combat can be sometimes simply a clickfest/parry - kill. AI can be predictable.If you just want to follow the assasins creed story across all the games then bag this one on a sale.Otherwise Rogue is prolly the best one out there so far and at the time of editing this,from what ive seen and played on a friends PC.

												This one is one of my 3 fav series in franchise with Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: BrotherhoodPros:-fighting system (started from AC3)-no more complicated crafting windows-Grand Theft Boat (except you only stay on your own ship)-charismatic main hero-Kenway's fleet (you send your fleet on missions and they bring you stuff)-interesting main story, sequences quite differ from each other by mood, locations and by things you do, unlike in AC1/AC3 (where you basically hunt each templar per sequence)-THANK GOD no more ""wanted"" system (on lands), that means no more killing witnesses, bribing heralds and removing poster every 3 minutes-awesome ""wanted"" system on the sea: kill boats -> kill bigger boats (bigger rewards) -> kill even bigger boats (even bigger rewards), and when you've had enough, turn off pirate hunters by bribing dudes on the lands-a lot of upgrades for Edward and Jackdaw, but sometimes they require you to find special recipes-soundtracks (personally I love all assassin's creed games soundtracks)Cons for all AC game:-overstretched gameplay by missions where:     -you have to quietely follow dudes    -you have to take a f***ing walk with NPCs-viewpoints (srsly I hate them, I usually try to visit ALL viewpoints in the beginning of the game)Cons specifically for ACBF:-bad optimisation (srsly, system req says: Nvidia GeForce GTX 470, mine's is a twice of efficient and still 40 fps in big places (cities, jungles etc)), but even worse has AC: Unity-no more Desmond's Adventures :/, starting from Black Flag the present day scenes go worse and worse :(Multiplayer (I really suck at it, so I don't want to judge it):-that's a VERY different expirience: no more waiting around, you mostly have like 1 minute to live-custom game modes, where you can fully customize session rules, and by fully I mean really fully (e.g make a game where only rifles are allowed)I suggest you buy console version, or this one if you have latest gen graphic card for 60+ fps performance			"

												[to be read in a calm voice]This is my first review of the game, that I didn't play (till now).  So why am I writing this? Because UPlay.Don't get me wrong: AC4 is probably great. That's why I bought it. But it needs UPlay and here problem begins. I neither need it nor want it, no matter what it offers and whats more important - I simply don't believe it works. And now I have one more reason for it> after you download about 30GB, it needs to connect, you can't immediately play in offline mode. When UPlay doesn't work, you are screwed. If there is a server maintenance, overload, DDOS or just anything wrong, you are screwed. Today UPlay doesn't work for me (trust me, I tried all the usual stuff as reinstall and so on..) and I know it's not Steams fault and all that is because a thing I don't like, I don't want and I don't use. It's my fault. I broke my own rule. For a long time I don't buy games, that requires 3rd party stuff. I never had use for them, didn't create even more accounts, avatars or profiles. And I never will. Also I'm an old fart so I remember those days, when if you bought a game, it wasn't ""right to use it for period of time on specific service"", it was actually _YOURS_.  Thats why I love GOG and Indie developers so much.  Steam is a different story, but it's a sevice that I CHOSE to use. Also I honestly think it tries to improve itself and I get the feeling Valve loves gamers, do not treat them like enemies that must be punished in advance, because ""pirates"".  Do I recommend this game? Of course I won't hate it just for what happened to me. But in order to help you with your decision, all I can say is:  ""Please, take a few seconds and think about WHAT and WHO do you support"". Next time I will. Breaking of own rules is stupid, anyway.			"

												Black Flag is going to be the last Assassin's Creed I buy and I've liked the series since the original (Yeah, I actually like that game). Why you ask? I mean after all I've played more than 50 hours of this game, I clearly didn't hate it. There's a lot to like here, the pirating is fun, especially because there's been barely any good pirate games ever since the remake of Sid Meier's Pirates and that was ten years ago. Edward Kenway is a likable protagonist that doesn't give a crap about ancient aliens brought to you by the History Channel, he just wants the British and Spanish to donate to his retirement fund by giving him all their sugar and rum. It's also a atmospheric game with some nice exploration, finding everything will definitely keep you busy.The thing is though is that the game is still plagued with frustrations, that while they don't straight up ruin the game, prevent it from becoming truly great. This mainly comes through the old Assassin's Creed gameplay of platforming and combat. Black Flag is jank as hell when it comes to platforming. Assassin's Creed always had a bit of clunky platforming at times but this is noticeably worse. Coming off of Shadow of Mordor proves this to me even more, Mordor was utterly smooth while in Black Flag it wasn't uncommon for the controls to sh*t themselves causing me to plunge to my death. The combat is also worse than the Ezio trilogy due to the sh*tty camera which was way too zoomed in which allows enemies to cheap shot you off screen. Enemies also have too good priority, being able to see you and hit you before you react sometimes. The future plot is at an absolute nadir here with an obnoxious metaplot that’s far more annoying than Desmond’s stuff ever was and I always thought he was the worst part of the series. (Though I never played 3)  All this goes to show that Assassin's Creed really isn’t improving and I assume 3 has ruined the series from here on out. But ultimately do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. Despite all the problems it’s a solid sendoff for the series seeing is that Unity and Rogue clearly aren’t helping to prevent the series' downward spiral. It’s definitely worth your time if you’ve liked the series up till this point and/or want a new pirate game.			"

												Great game, so many nautical miles better than Connor Kenway's story, piloting a ship was the most fun part for me I actually think I spent more time at the helm of the Jackdaw than chasing down the storyline.A warning though, make sure you disable ubisofts cloud server sync AND always run uplay as adminstrator (a bug still wuth the latest AC games), I found out the hard way after a 44 hour save file up and disappeared, now 87 hours in I have completed the story and roughly 90% complete on the whole game.Much recommend, Game itself: 9.5/10, it would be a 10 for me if the bloatware that is uplay wasn't present, alas the frenchies try to match big boy steam and can't even code their cloud servers correctly.Anyways, back to the high seas for me YARRRRRRRRRRRR.

												I couldn’t get into the Assassin Creed games. The illusion of choice masking linear gameplay and limited options. Too much running around, hiding, waiting out pursuit timers, easily obtainable goals, climbing towers, and shifting storylines that killed my suspension of disbelief. But I kept buying them cause:•	The attention to detail was astonishing.•	The user-interfaces were so well thought out.•	The tutorials were thoughtful.•	The fighting was pretty fun.•	The characters interactions with the world reminded me of the Prince of Persia games,•	The historical touches were engaging and the voice acting was excellent. But I didn’t play them more than a few hours cause I got bored. So “Black Flag” went on sale, I scooped it up cause my brother said it was decent but I let it sit for months cause I thought it would be more of the same. I have to give Ubisoft some props. This game is more expansive. There’s more freedom. More sense of accomplishment and I’m just having a good time. It’s polished like all the other games but some of the island scenes are just knock-out beautiful … it’s transportive. I’m loving the sense of exploration, the pirate songs, the layers. This game is an incredible accomplishment and I’m glad a gave the franchise another chance. Well worth a look for any action, adventure, or even RPG fan like me. "

												Full price not recommended, on sale maybe, see below.The only reason I got the game was for the naval combat, and it's honestly the only thing about the game I like. The BAD:I witness a ""big"" bug almost every time I go do a story mission. Minor bugs are endless and everywhere. Combat is awful and occasionally will completely stop working and you'll just flick your swords until you either die or resort to your pistols. Shoutout to the GENIUS developer who decided you can only attack when an enemy is highlighted. And then making the highlighting mechanic camera reliant. Btw, the camera is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥too. And don't get me started how it locks when you're being rushed through an underwater current while trying to dodge stone pillars and spikes. Really nice how you can't move the camera to see in front of you. The free-running is equally as horrifying, where you'll run up a wall next to you while facing the camera away from it forever if you don't force him to stop and walk away. Meanwhile running up a fallen tree requires 5 years of training and planning and a runway strip fit for a WW2 bomber. And sometimes he still decides to jump off the ledge next to it or just stop at the base completely. Basically, almost every mechanic seems broken or untested when you play enough. The story is AWFUL and completely unimpressionable. Half the time you have only a vague understanding of what's going on and why you need to be somewhere or doing something.Now here's my gripe specifically for newcomers to the Assassin's Creed series. Ubisoft's decision to make this an AC game was probably the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ up in the entire game. If you enjoy immersion may want to try somewhere else, cause you play as a guy playing the memory of his pirate ancestor. If you get this I don't need to explain any more, if you don't get it no amount of explaining will help. Moving on.The GOOD:Naval combat. It's satisfying, it's exciting, and it drives you to upgrade your ship as much as possible, which supplies gameplay. Only downside is how boarding can result in the bugs you get everywhere else (♥♥♥♥ing parkour glitches). Also, the Legendary ships are a teensy bit cheap. One has undamageable sides so you have to hit it from the front, back, or from above with mortar. Another consists of 2 level 75 Man o' Wars that fight you by working together and getting you inbetween them and ripping you apart from both sides (good) but as soon as you kill one the other proceeds to do its best to sit on you, with speeds impossible to match. So basically you have to kill them at the same time, or damn near close to it. But anyways, on sale for $20 the naval combat is planty to make it worth it. Had I bought on full price I'd be taking advantage of Steam's new refund feature.The OCD:Do you Hate people who Type like this?or people who don't capitalize anything that should be like british or captain blackbeard?Well whoever wrote up all the text in the game: subtitles, tips, everything, was BOTH of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S in ONE box!!!!! :D			"

Black Flag is basicly the same game but with updated graphic and a new story. The best thing about this game is that most of the stories are based on true events that actually happened back then. This is like ""playing a history book"" :) I recommend this game to all pirate lovers who like hours and hours of fun :)10/10 points			"

												An interesting Assassin's creed where you play a pirate.Probably one of the best arcade naval game available.If you don't like this part, forget about the game, it's an important one.If you like this part, the rest of the game is really great too. A lot of unlockables to track and things to do.			"

												Okay, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is an awesome game. I would recommend this to whose never play Assassin's Creed before, especially for anyone who like the pirate stories.Open world sailing with ship, naval battle, and aboard to another ship is the best adventures that the game offers to us. Gameplay is ease but still challenging, suit with any gamers playstyle.The storyline and characters are great, has some touching moments that sometimes maybe will make you cry. But still, I hate when the story going outside the animus -.-""Environments are so beautiful, tropical forest and ocean are wonderful (of course with a great graphic card :P). Voice acting is well done as well, they're good at singing.Combat is great, just same like other third person games. The upgrade system is pretty good, you want easy battles, then go hard at finding upgrade material or you don't want find material, then go hard at battles.Cons :- Maybe not fully perfect port to PC, some fps drop to 30 may be found.- Outside animus gameplay ( every times it on going, I always say ""the hell is this, just back to Kenway story !"" )Overall, this is the best AC story & ending (aside from Ezio story). I really do enjoy this game and always trying rush on main story because it just make me curious. Characteristic & enviroment are just so fabulous, and for combat / naval mechanic are awesome.Maybe this game is underrated (I know some people may feel disgusted with AC series), but just give it a try for this one, may you will fall into the storyline :)9/10 for it.

												Yeargh!I had high expectations for this game after all the positive things I had heard about it. Though I know all too well that sometimes those things that alot of people think is great, to me, are far less so. Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is... not one of those cases. This game is awesome. Period.It helps considerably that Black Flag shakes up the AC series which was in desperate need of something new and fresh. AC2 and ACB were awesome, but ACR added little new and AC3 seemed to have forgotten it was a game series that does killing better than managing a homestead. About the only interesting thing AC3 did was add some naval missions, which was a first for the series and ended up being the highlight of that game for me.And it only got better in Black Flag, as it had better considering this game centers around the ""Golden Age of Piracy"" in the early 1700's. A time when the Spanish Empire was still strong in the Americas, but the British were fast becoming dominant as well. As usual, you meet a fair number of historical figures here, and this time it's a more colorful cast for obvious reasons. Your main character, Edward Kenway, is a Welsh pirate who, in his desire for wealth and to support a family back home, decides to venture to the Caribbean to seek his fortune. As far as AC protagonists go for me, Edward is a close second to Ezio as being characters that I really like, being much more interesting than his grandson Connor from AC3 ever was.Story and characters are good here, but it's gameplay that makes this great. Black Flag is, in essence, everything you could ever want in a pirate game. Lots of rum, buried treasure, fights, and, most of all, sailing around in a huge open map able to attack and plunder as you please. As far as sandbox games go, there are two types: the kind that have giant interesting open worlds that I can explore for hours without getting bored (Fallout 3, Skyrim, most of the Saints Row games), and others that end up leading me to just play the main missions because I see little reason to go exploring (Oblivion, Sleeping Dogs, some previous AC games). Black Flag is the former. I spent so much time just wandering about that I had to force myself to do story missions because I would otherwise never finish the game.Oh, and one highlight worth mentioning: money is actually useful in this game. Unlike past AC games where you used cash to do some management thing or improve your house, you need mountains of cash to improve your ship, which only encourages you further to roam the open world causing mayhem. I hope future AC games take this approach because renovating shops or doing trade is at odds with the action gameplay, and using the cash to further the gameplay you actually do is good.This game isn't perfect though. The story missions are decent, but too often involve tailing missions where you have to follow some tosser without being spotted. A few are ok, but they seem more common in this game than in past AC games. And compared to the glory that is open world pirate action, following some tosser through the streets of Havana or Kingston is completely uninteresting. I also had a few bugs and one crash, but this is hardly the most unstable game i've ever played. My new monster PC ran this game great on max settings, but for others it may be a different story. Lastly I can do without the hunting and whaling stuff, if only because I don't like killing huggly animals. :(Except sharks. ♥♥♥♥ sharks. Also ♥♥♥♥ Uplay for simply existing. And having achievements separate from Steam ones.Anyways, this game is awesome. It might even be the best AC game i've played. It's certainly comparable to AC2 and ACB. For those who saw the series stagnate after those games, Black Flag is a sign that there is still life in this franchise, and that maybe there are more great games to come from it. We shall see. :oYeargh...			"

												Where do I start with a game like Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag?This game is utter bliss in true gaming form, I've much to say and go on about this specific title in the franchise.Since Assassin's Creed II, many fans go about claiming AC III is horrible and a franchise killer; claiming that none will ever match the greatness of AC II and that the Assassin's Creed franchise is a dying breed. Let me put it to you like this, Black Flag is the best thing to happen to this franchise since II.Why do I like AC IV Black Flag? Well I'll tell ya!First let's start with the story; Not the game's strong point at all but it is interesting and very thoughtful some times.The story seems to be primarily in the Animus not the real world so I will begin with Edward's story (the animus) then head into the real world protagonist.Edward's story has been the most interesting story♥♥♥♥♥Creed has seen since the Ezio days (Even though I'll admit to not being a fond fan of Ezio, I felt Connor was better than him and Altair in general is my favorite assassin). The story handles all sorts of cool things. It touches up on pirates like Black Beard, Benjamin Hornigold, Calico Jack, and plenty of other cool pirates. One of the best things about the story are the interactions Edward has with other pirates and enemies alike. The story does a good job at displaying the growth Edward has through out the journey and just how much you've done to affect the world he's in, positively and negatively. As for the Templar propaganda and all the cool illusive things about the old♥♥♥♥♥Creed story lines, they take place outside the Animus; you won't really be finding any cool intrigue in Edward's story though it is a good one.Animus Story; very interesting actually. This one takes place after the death of Desmond and touches up on the many secrets of Abstergo and their new Animus projects. Most of the story here is within secrets, like sticky notes and hacked computers that display little secret conversations and things alike. If you're just following the story and doing none of the side stuff in the real world, it's a shame to say but you're just not playing the full real story. There's juicy stuff here!Story Summary: 7.5-10 Pretty good, just not memorable or something new to the franchise.Next up, Gameplay. Assassin's Creed Black Flag refined gameplay for AC in general. The game controls and plays the same way as AC III which to some may be a good thing, I for sure liked the controls and free running of III and very much enjoyed the combat system from III which is also returned and refined in Black Flag. The game has a much stronger emphasis on ship combat this time, everything from getting money, to progressing across the world is done on that ♥♥♥♥ing ship. To be honest, the ship battles were fun and interesting in AC III and the earlier parts of this game, it did not have to become a main point seller of the damn game. You can't whipe your♥♥♥♥♥with out paying 2,000 and having abundant amounts of wood and metal in the ♥♥♥♥ing bathroom so you can whipe your ship's♥♥♥♥♥too. It is a lot of fun to use the Jackdaw later on when you've pimped it out to near incredible stats. Ship boarding is also a new system in Black Flag, and damn they are fun. Sure they get boring and repetitive, some times tedious, but honestly the rewards you get out of boarding is amazing. Ship combat can become very overwhelming, even when you're OP as ♥♥♥♥. Large ships in a large group can and will ♥♥♥♥ you over, especially in the earlier parts of the game. Most of the Jackdaw's and Edward's upgrades can be unlocked by getting secret blueprints across the caribbean and trust me they are the most annoying things to go out of you way to collect. I also hated hunting in this game, I felt it just restricted me from simply paying for an upgrade. Freaking metal and wood farming for the Jackdaw just ♥♥♥♥ing blows. But there's lots to do in Black Flag too! Assassination contractions have returned from the older AC games and they're rewarding! There's ♥♥♥♥ loads of collectibles and exploration to just be done here. Tonsa fun to be had!Gameplay: 6-10, it would be higher but the problems I've had were far more daunting than most of the fun I've had. It's sill damn good fun though.Graphics are next. Assassin's Creed games have never been ugly games, Black Flag is a wonderful example of the best of last gen graphics. Playing this game on high graphics is just mesmerizing. From the beautiful sky boxes, to the wonderful storm effects, the most wonderful water graphics, environments, and most character models; Black Flag just has plain beautiful graphics. It may lag your computer like monster though!Graphics: 9-10, definitely beautiful game.Sound and Music in Black Flag I feel is just plain forgettable. While the sounds of stuff and ship battles are just jaw droppingly awesome, the thing is most of them are recurring noises from Assassin's Creed III and previous titles. There's not much new to the sound system. As for music? What music? There's music?! AC IV has some great battle tunes and indeed does have wonderful ambient tunes playing around the cities like Kingston and Nassau, but besides those and the wonderful ship shanties; this game has a lack luster soundtrack. Tavern music's also pretty good but just not game saving.Sound and Music: 4-10, a definite dissappointment from a franchise that has been known for having good music in their games.In conclussion, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a must buy for those whom are Asssassin's Creed fans in the like. It's also a perfect game to get into the franchise with because it cuts off most of the old storyline from the previous games and gives gamers a fresh new canvas to enjoy. It is a memorable game in almost every form with most of the gripes I've had with it being forgotten by the time I've finished it. It's just masterful at heart and you can tell Ubisoft was making a game for its fans to enjoy, not for anything else. That's just what they've achieved and it's what makes this game the second best in its franchise.Overall Score: 8.5-10, must play and a definite pick up! "

												I feel like I should say something about this game since I was very sceptical at the beginning and was ignoring the whole Assassin's Creed series for years. Honestly, I can now easily assort this as one of my biggest errors I have ever done.(I have't played any previous AC games)Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag game, first of all I should point out that it is very intelligent game with complex and thrilling story and interesting characters, smart dialogues and amazing scenes. The whole game is based on the historical facts, so it's educative as hell too.The open world in this game is realistic and fun. Graphics and the game's design is perfect. I like the balance between the main story and side missions. The game gives you as much space as you want in the way how you want to proceed. The game's soundtrack is brilliant and feelingful aswell as the voice over which makes an irreplaceable atmosphere in this game. The main characters, pirates, are unique and definitely not boring. You will find nothing like wooden leg, parrots or eyepatch here. They are really well written characters. I would recommend Black Flag to anyone who likes action adventure games and ignored AC series, even to those who hate pirates, because this game illustrates them just the way they should be, I know it's still very romantic kind of way to look on them, but what the hell.10/10			"

												*VAGUE STORY SPOILERS*Continually, in reviewing every successive Assassin's Creed title, I write that they are full of content, atmosphere and potential, but ultimately mediocre in writing and mechanics.I usually note that there is one remarkable game out of the many games in the series. One that, like the others, is visually beautiful, possessing broad cityscapes and colorful vistas. Like the others, the game I refer to can boast of having plentiful content in a large world. It's also got a great atmosphere and a very complementary soundtrack, just like the other games.Unlike the others though, it has writing, story pacing and character development that is at least DECENT, more open-ended stealth mechanics and considerably more complex upgrade systems giving players more reason to keep playing and stay invested.That's this game.I suppose, of course, that I must respond to the weak and feeble objection raised against this game that it's 'Pirate's Creed' and not Assassin's Creed, which is among the more inane and irrelevant criticisms leveled at a game in my recent memory. As if it were at all pertinent to the game's overall quality -- to its mechanics, to its storytelling, to the content offered -- that it seemingly deviates from the other titles' primary conflict, theme, and gameplay focus.In fairness, I grant that it WOULD be pertinent if you thought that the previous titles in the series, in their focus on the Assassins, on the templars, and the thrust of the gameplay being about these concepts, were anything particularly good, special, or even decent.If you thought that, (and if you do, God help you) then it would make sense that this game would seem like a departure from those things and not a building on or continuation of them. Unfortunately for this line of criticism though and like I mentioned at the outset, nearly all the titles in this franchise have terribly poor writing, characters, and storytelling. Additionally, the Assassin/Templar conflict was a totally vacuous and surprisingly weak central narrative. Further, the stealth gameplay was fairly constrained and linear up to this point.I really have no reason to go back through ACI -- because it's a non-functioning horrible mess of a game, or AC2/AC:B/AC:R as there aren't many OTHER ways to go through the games or approach the situations given to the player.They all present the same atmosphere in the Assassins v Templar garbage and its NEVER, EVER been compelling or interesting except to the edgiest of teenagers and anonymous-hopefuls.This game DARED to occasionally tell other stories, hear other characters, show and immerse us in different worlds, and surprisingly enough, it was leagues more interesting and compelling than any of the other titles. Admittedly, I find it hard NOT to get caught up in the whole pirate atmosphere and the image of being a fearsome scourge of the seas.However, apparently to some fans, this is a GRAVE, UNFORGIVABLE SIN. I hear this complaint often enough that I devoted this much to it, anyway, moving on.(If you're going to leave an 'b-but muhh Ezio/Altair' comment, just stop now -- I don't care, bad characters, bad stories, at-best mediocre games)More often than not, this game is about a conflicted protagonist who, in seeking out riches, fame, fortune and comfort, ultimately loses people he cares about. In realizing the value of those he lost, his love for them, he comes to a greater sense of respect, care and regard for others and responsibility for the consequences of his own actions.THAT is a meaningful story with real potential to make me care, not the edgy, vapid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that constituted the 'narrative' in the other titles.OH, and I don't have to listen to Desmond's stupid voice or look at his dumb face, so there's points already. Silent protagonist in an Abstergo office who goes around hacking his colleagues computers and forced by the janitor to do increasingly risky tasks, uncovering the conspiracy or whatever.You're working there and going through Edward's memories under the pretense of developing an entertainment game based off his pirate stories. It's nothing fantastic, but is it better than Desmond and his band of losers? Does it makes relative sense? Yes!The story of assassins and templars is still there, but it is more of a sideshow, thank God, than in previous games, to the character's arc and development. At best, it's a helpful vehicle, but only that, in telling Edward's story, instead of the other way around, like in previous titles.For the arc I just described to make sense, the game had to have characters that were sufficiently developed and fleshed out themselves, so that we could care about them, and surprisingly enough, the writers delivered.Moving on, the gameplay is split between the traditional content featured in previous titles -- exploring the cities and countryside, jumping from rooftop to rooftop and assassinating targets on foot. The other half, though, is spent on your ship, which has a robust upgrade tree, sailing the high seas.Before we move on to the sailing, a note about the on-foot gameplay: the player is given more options in managing crowds and guards, whether you're putting them to sleep, turning them against eachother or disabling their security, than in previous titles.Revelations had a 'bomb-crafting' system that allowed for these things to an extent, but it wasn't even remotely necessary to engage with, as the game was mind-numbingly easy and the bomb making was cumbersome.Here, the game is at least challenging enough until you've got a lot of upgrades that it pays to be a little more careful and think about your approach AND the game gives you easy-to-use tools for your situation. You know, like in an ACTUAL STEALTH GAME.Your ship controls really well, and the game's system of ship levels, combat and different resources and items to collect, sell and use for upgrades makes for a whole world of deep gameplay that you can sink a lot of hours into. Your crew sing shanties, which are great and of which you can collect more floating around the cities to add to your collection and the atmosphere while you're sailing.There's plenty of sunken treasure, upgrade plans, collectibles and large goals to work towards, all to be uncovered by exploring the large map, visiting islands and cities. There's a LOT of content.This expansive world is a gorgeous, color-saturated depiction of the Caribbean. What's more to say about it? It's prettier than any of the previous titles in the series.If you're going to play an Assassin's Creed game, this is it. This is the remarkable title in the series that stands out for being above average to excellent in all departments.I couldn't recommend it more.			"

												well, after spending over 40 hours on the game, I have to say, this is the best assassin's creed since brotherhood. You get right into the story and your character has a very strong charisma. The ability to explore and do just about whatever you want is a nice change. I trully enjoyed the naval battle and the concept of taking ships to add them to your fleet to complete missions is very nice. I have not finished the game because I spent more time exploring the ship wrecks, the islands, stealing ships, completing the templar hunt, etc... as I said many, many things to do and so far, I have not been bored of it. Lets not forget the other notorious pirates such Black Beard, Captain Kidd, Rackam, etc. Highly recommend this one :)			"

												Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag doesn't really want to be an Assassin's Creed game, and I don't blame it. It seems keen to shrug off the oblique, convoluted lore surrounding the eon-long Assassins vs Templar power struggle, which managed to reach new peaks of ludicrousness even after that bit in the second game when you punch the Pope into unconsciousness in order to access an alien hologram. Black Flag stuffs all that into a box labelled 'whoops', throws it down a deep, dark hole and sends you on third-person free-running murder missions on the high seas instead. By Blackbeard's bushy eyebrows, that is a welcome move.You are Edward Kenway, a rogue who loves money enough to leave his girlfriend in port and sail to the West Indies in search of a vast fortune. In the opening scenes he steals an Assassin's hooded garb and wristblades and accidentally falls in with a crowd of Templars, a team of comedy evil caricatures led by a bearded grand master and backed up by a plate armoured man-ogre who throws axes at people. They're searching for the Observatory, an ancient device that enables its user to see the location of anyone in the world at any time. The Templars want it because it'll make coups easier, the Assassins want it to stop the Templars, and Kenway wants it because it's probably the most valuable thing on the planet.If that sounds a bit removed from piracy and plunder, don't worry. After the two-hour hand-holding tutorial section – mercifully shorter than in previous Assassin's Creed games – the Observatory is relegated to distant long-term objective status, and the story refocuses on the building of the pirate paradise of Nassau: a lawless little utopia maintained by a collection of criminals seeking respite from the attention of the law.That means Kenway isn't exactly an Assassin. He has all the free-running, jumping and killing skills of the sect – a genetic bonus, it's implied – but his relationship with the series' morally ambiguous order of murder monks is fractious. That keeps the plot's severest absurdities at arm's length and lets you just be a pirate and do pirate things. Hang out with famous brigands like James Kidd. Watch affable rogue Edward Teach become an unhinged, scenery-chewing Blackbeard. Sail across the ocean, rob ships, fight the British, take sea forts for yourself, harpoon whales, explore large coastal cities such as Havana and raid ancient Aztec ruins for treasure. All this in a beautiful tropical open world that's at its glowing, hyper-detailed best on PC.On land, much is familiar. Hubs such as Havana and Nassau are large, but there are no urban spaces to match the size and spectacle of Rome or Constantinople. A shame, certainly, but there's still a huge amount to explore in scattered settlements across Black Flag's massive archipelago. You'll sail between stilted pier towns tucked away in rocky alcoves, tropical islands sprinkled with treasure chests and larger townships like the manicured, orderly haven of Kingston. As always, you have to climb to high perches to scout sections of town, revealing chests, stores and sidequests in the area, the latter including a welcome increase in open-world assassination missions and warehouse raids. These place targets in open areas patrolled by British or Spanish forces and invite you to solve the problem creatively.Such missions feel closer to the original vision for Assassin's Creed than the scripted story segments which, while much improved over Assassin's Creed III's restrictive and buggy offerings, are still rather over-reliant on lengthy follow tasks. To raid a warehouse, you must first scan the area for the key holder, pickpocket it off him (or rob his corpse) and then make your way to the door without being shot dead by elevated musket snipers and roaming guards. Stealth has been tightened up to make this more interesting. Pervasive jungle foliage offers constant cover and targets can be marked using Kenway's magic 'Eagle Vision' mode, which lets you track guards through walls – a serious advantage, yes, but you no longer have access to the silent, ranged instant-kill throwing knives that made similar challenges trivial in previous games.

												“Absolutely breathtaking” is a very good way of describing Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, from my experience at least. I’m very happy that Ubisoft decided to go back in time to a very interesting period in history, the Golden Age of Piracy. Not only does this game visit a stunning Caribbean setting, but there are also numerous enhancements to the gameplay and graphics. I’ve put about 30 hours into it so far and I’m 60% towards total completion. In Black Flag, you can sail your own pirate ship, and explore a vast Caribbean sandbox consisting of uncharted islands, shipwrecks, and 3 major cities. There’s a vast open ocean to travel across, but the new convenient fast travel system has eliminated the annoyances of fast travel in the previous games (such as finding a fast travel point in order to fast travel). Now after discovering a location, you can quickly travel there at any time you wish. Each of the cities is different in its style and residents. Visiting each of them gave me the feeling that I was visiting a different part of the world. Havana has the Spanish theme, Kingston has the English theme, and Nassau has the Pirate theme. I was very impressed with the amount of detail put into each location. And this can be said for the more remote areas such as the jungles and beaches. A lot of work was put into making the environments feel genuine.The gameplay has been slightly improved since Assassin’s Creed III. There are many new tools to use (some are REALLY neat), and new animations for fighting sequences. The enemies feel more dangerous than they did in previous games, which are good because I always found the combat to be a little too easy :P Black Flag has made sure to keep the fights challenging.The graphics are another point worth mentioning. The Anvil-Next engine looks even better than it did in Assassin’s Creed III, which is to be expected, but it went above my expectations. The new weather system features full night and day cycles, complete with the most intense storms I’ve ever seen in games. Nvidia users get the full experience, with TXAA anti-aliasing and improved PhysX, though Radeon users still have a great looking game! A big reason I bought this game was because of the story, which is AAA quality as usual. The Templar twist in Assassin’s Creed III still beats anything that Black Flag has thrown at me, but that doesn't mean I’m disappointed. There are many famous pirates that some history buffs will go crazy over. Your character Edward has one hell of a journey turning from pirate to Assassin and even plays a Templar for a while. It’s very well thought out, with real events being tied into fictional events, part of the Assassin’s Creed universe.There’s so much more for me to talk about, but if anyone has made it this far, you’ll probably be sick of this fan boy rant. If you enjoy the series, you won’t need this review. If you’re unsure, I would take a risk and buy it. There’s so much to do, and a great story to boot.   "

												Best entry in the series since Ezio and Altaïr; though you might tire of the rather same ol AC formula the open world sea borne shenanigans are some of the best fun you'll have in an AC game, be it diving wrecks for treasure or capturing mechantmen and navy vessels for profit all to the sound of your crew bellowing out shanties..I met the finest Ram, Sir,that ever was fed on hay.

												This review along with other reviews from the steam community can also be found at the new group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/reviewboardAssassins Creed 4 : Black Flag restored a little fate in the Assassin's Creed line after the (spoiler for the Assassin's Creed 3)   The death of Desmond Miles but for me this was devastating  and the horrible character of Ratonhnhaké:ton a.k.a. Connor.  But our newest unknown main character a research assistant for abstergo entertainment seems to have some unknown potential.  But enough about him our true main character Edward Kenway a man who wanted to hold the world hostage and take what was owed to him or so he thought and became a pirate and lived by the pirate code and unwittingly lived by the iconic assassin's code: Nothing is true; everything is permitted.  Edward does start off a little lackluster and takes you awhile to get into his character and the many flaws he does have.  (spoiler)  Not being a true assassin or even joining order at the end of the game. I knew he had joined at the end but felt like it wasn't a strong revelation for him to join.   The story was strong in spots and weak in others and felt a little jumpy from certain missions to the next mission.  Towards the end of the game they mentioned its been six years and you are like wow really.  One of the downsides of the game is how Ubisofts loves adding those treasure chest and the run after an item like almanac sheets in the third and now music sheets and animus fragments.  I personally am bored with because all the games have had something along these lines but the plus side no feathers in this game. Same way with the fighting mechanics you basically just spam the same  button combinations over and over eventually I would like to see a combo fighting style installed in the games to keep it fresh.  The open world/sea was a amazing you will spend hours raiding ships.  Till the awe factor wears off and I mean hours because it was fantastic and the world was so huge.  If you didn't have the fast travel it would take you days (over exaggeration) to get from one location to another.  The naval part was one of the prizewinning features of this video game it was grand.  Legendary ship battles will have you shouting for joy once you defeat these monstrous ships.  Now the other downside to Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was the every so often how you would find the hole in the world and just free falling to your death.  The climb your ship from the sea and just fall through and be stuck or the gaming loading and you and your crew fall in a big empty ocean where your ship should be.  And the occasional graphic glitch where you need to exit the game completely and start again.  These were more annoying then anything on just how random they were.  All and all AC4: Black Flag was a excellent game and as a huge fan of the series I do recommend this game even though the gameplay and style hasn't changed much since brotherhood.  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/reviewboard "

												Every now and then I find a game that's simply an absolute pleasure to play, one that I can easily spend hours or even an entire day playing and not feel burned out. Rarely do those games come from AAA developers, but Assassin's Creed 4 most certainly delivered. Between responsive controls, fun game mechanics, a massive world to explore, and an exciting story, I enjoyed nearly every minute of this game. Though parts of the story do leave a bit to be desired, and I was left with some unanswered questions at the end. Maybe it's due to my lowered expectations after AC3, or maybe it's because I'm a sucker for pirate adventures and sea shanties, but the latest installment of the Assassin's Creed series just may be my new favorite.ControlsBasics – The basic game controls are more or less the same as they've always been: Run around, jump and climb buildings and stab lots of enemies. The familiar control scheme is satisfyingly responsive and though there were occurrences of Edward doing something I didn’t intend, they were seldom. Most impressive, however, is the input detection. I generally play Assassin’s Creed games with an Xbox controller, since they don’t require the precision of a mouse and allow for more fluid movement with the analog sticks. But if I wanted to switch to the mouse and keyboard (for instance, to more quickly navigate menus), all I had to do was press a key or move the mouse and input automatically switched over. When I want to switch back I pick up the controller again and can keep playing. I didn’t even have to enter the settings menu.Combat – Combat is incredibly satisfying, if extremely simple and easy, allowing you to either mash a single button until everyone's dead, or pull of some fun and impressive-looking combos with your swords and pistols.The Jackdaw – Similar to AC3, you have some control over the ship's speed, allowing you to make tighter turns if necessary. The ship does control rather sluggishly, but that's to be expected considering, well, it's a ship, and it's actually a good bit more responsive than what I imagine steering a real boat is like. Naval combat is fairly straightforward, allowing you to select from a myriad of weaponry for different scenarios. Use the broadside cannons to hit anything alongside you, the chain-ball shooting chase cannons to hit enemies in front, or launch fire barrels off the back of your ship to hit those behind you. You can also upgrade the ship with new weapons like mortars and heavy shot for even more range and damage.MechanicsThe World – The game world is absolutely massive, with tons of areas to explore and things to collect. And aside from a few story-critical areas, the entire map is open to you from the moment you get your ship, meaning if you want to ignore the story missions entirely and explore everything, nothing’s stopping you. Of course many areas of the map are far more dangerous than the starting areas, but a nice upgrade system lets you plunder enemy ships for materials which you can then use to make your own ship stronger.Forts – The map is divided up into sections, with each section being home to a large fort, or “base.” If you’re able to destroy the fort and kill the fort leader, the fort is then liberated, opening up that section of the map to you. This reveals locations and hunting areas for that section of the map, as well as opens up some naval missions that you can complete for some extra cash.Kenway’s Fleet – After you get a good ways into the story, you gain control of your very own fleet. From that point, any enemy ship you plunder gives you the option to send it to your fleet. Once there, you can send the ships on mini-missions similar to assassin missions from Brotherhood, trading goods for money. By completing these missions, you unlock new trade routes with new missions that can net you even more money. However, some routes are more dangerous than others, and you have to first send some of your fleet into a mini-battle to make it safer for travel. While overall a pretty small part of the game, the fleet missions can be interesting, and are certainly a good way to bring in some extra cash.Tailing and Tagging – Quite a few missions throughout the game involve following a target for a distance without letting them spot you. This usually involves walking at a distance behind them, and ducking into alleys or blending in with groups of people to avoid detecting. Black Flag also introduces a new mechanic that allows you to “tag” up to ten enemies by focusing on them in eagle vision. They are then highlighted when you return to your normal view, and you can follow them even as they walk behind buildings or you would otherwise normally be unable to see them. While a neat mechanic, it does seem to make many tailing missions almost too easy.GraphicsTo be blunt and to the point, the game looks gorgeous, both aesthetically and graphically. Some of the most enjoyable parts for me were just sailing over the deep blue waters, passing by other boats and islands. The texture resolutions are certainly impressive, and there were only a few times (generally during close-ups) when a noticeably low-res texture jumped out at me. With the recent addition of PhysX capabilities, smoke rising from fires and recently fired cannons also behaves much more realistically. And everything ran surprisingly smoothly, too. I’d heard some reports of poor optimization and consistently low framerates and was initially worried, but I was able to set the game settings at near maximum with next to no problems at all, only some slowdown during ship battles when there was a lot of smoke. And considering I’m running off a GTX480 I consider that to be pretty impressive.StoryEdward Kenway – To avoid the risk of spoilers I won’t detail too much here, but I did find the game’s story very enjoyable. The characters are solid and there’s certainly no lack of personality to be found. Edward is of course a pirate, so everything he does is with his own and his crew’s best interest in mind, but that doesn’t stop him from being able to care about others, and as the story progresses Edward really grows as a character, one of my favorite aspects of AC2. I did however have some issues with the finale, as the story ended with a relatively important task left incomplete and with a few overhanging questions that were never answered, which made for a slightly less than satisfying conclusion.The Employee – Meanwhile, outside the Animus, you play as a new employee to Abstergo Entertainment, a company aiming to bring the memories and experiences of people such as Edward to the general public in the form of interactive movies. Unlike the previous games’ arcs with Desmond, your character in Black Flag is faceless and voiceless, and you play from a first-person perspective, restricted to your office building throughout the game. It’s certainly an interesting spin on both the purpose of the Animus technology and the real-world portions of the game, and not entirely unwelcome in my opinion since Desmond’s story, while interesting, seemd to almost competed for dominance with Ezio’s story at times. Now your time spent outside of the Animus generally involves talking with your superiors, and later on learning to hack your co-workers computers for some very interesting backstory.The VerdictOverall this is certainly one of the most fun games I’ve played recently, and one of the few that I actually had a hard time putting down. It looks beautiful, plays well and is responsive, has an interesting story and overall some really fun mechanics. Despite a few flaws with the story that left questions hanging in my mind, I enjoyed the majority of the time I spent with it, and can say that this is a huge step up from the previous game.			"

												Easy the best of the Assassin's Creed franchise, and that is saying a lot, although some of the series is, to be kind, bad. You really get the sense of being a pirate, every man's dream, and it somewhat historically accurate. I loved seeing this old carribean towns when they were first starting, for example Jamacia with it's surronding jungles and flauna and animals. Walking amound the ruins of the earthquake. Small towns that of course are now huge. It's all great from a historic standpoint alone. I also had fun just running around pushing people in the water. The ship battles are great, and yes although you are a bit of a superman, the fights are still fun. One of the most fun games I played in years. I highly recommend.			"

												9/10+ fantastic presentation, some breathtaking sceneries, especially at sea, graphics in tropical places are always more impressive+ interesting story, different from the previous games in the series, likable main character (although a pirate, meaning greedy), open world game with tons of things to do (ubisoft seems to have mastered the open world gameplay mechanics, that's why i'm sure watch dogs is gonna be the best game of the year)+ i really liked the dispay of statistics by pressing the middle mouse button, it gives you a sense of completion, my worry in ac games always was that i didn't do everything i could, now you can track this much easier+ i also liked the chance to rate each mission after it ends+ multiplayer looks nice, although i don't really care in this kind of game for mp+ it seems this time ati cards are better optimised, since it runs identically in both my nvidia and ati pc- they have to improve fighting, it looks impressive but it doesn't feel like it when actually playing, they have to make it less automatic, counter is all you have to do to kill enemies easily or sometimes break their guard, but it needs more than thati don't have to play more to review the game, i know it's (after ac2) my favorite ac game, endless opportunities for this franchise, i hope ubisoft will make the best out of it.

												I am torn on whether to recommend this game. The reason for this is because I love the game itself, but it is just so poorly optimised. The game itself is incredably fun, and I love pretending to be a pirate. Plus, as a history buff seeing people like Edward Thatch (aka blackbeard) make me nerd out a bit. On the other hand, it is a uplay game. I could barely get my game to run at 30 FPS and had several bad glitches. So I am going to go ahead and recomend this game for its sake, but just be prepared to deal with uplay.			"

												I in turn love this game and Ill explain why.Parkour: The parkour of Assassins Creed 4 is similar to the outdoor free running of AC3 but with some great changes. First you don't just randomly start climbing a wall when running. It feels very smooth and clean but a notorious run up a wall and jump off that is terrible.Combat: The combat is relatively easy unless you come across an officer or heavy soldiers. These special soldiers can parry and counter attack. The two swords make the fighting very interesting with some bad♥♥♥♥♥animations. The pistols are slightly unrealistic because when you reload it does the normal reloading animation then does the same animation 2-4 times depending on how many pistols you carry. The pistols have great variety and are made for every players needs.  Combat Extended: One of the weapons you come across is the blow gun, it can shoot 2 profectiles, a sleep dart(Knocks them out for a period of time) and a Beserk Dart(It makes the victim start attacking others. You also have an array of odd weapons. Such as the throwing knife(Self Explanatory) and the Rope Dart. The Rope Dart can be used to hang or pull soldiers to you, I didnt use these much but when I did they were extremely useful. You also have two hidden blades.Gadgets: Some of the gadgets or items you get include the: Smoke Bomb and Money. The smoke bomb stun and blind soldiers whilst the gold draws civilians with means you can blend in.Ship Gameplay: The ship gameplay is acclaimed and overall extremely fun and diverse. The weapons you have include the: Mortar(A long range upward firing cannon that shoots a shell that explodes over the target spewing it with cannon balls.), The Chain Shots(Used to fire at sails and slow ships), Round shot(Normal Cannon shot) Heavy shot(A flaming cannonball of close ranged death) and the swivels(After you make a solid hit against the the solid part of the ship, it leaves weakpoints that the swivels fire at dealing massive damage). After you decapicate a ship you can board it and have to kill crew and/or cut a flag and/or kill a captain and scouts. After doing this you can repair your ship the Jackdaw or send it to your fleet, you can also lower your wanted level(If your wanted level is high enough pirate hunters come after you.).There is also assassin contracts which involve killing a target, bonus for remaining stealth, Naval contracts which you hunt down ships. You can also save pirates and unlock taverns.Story: The story is brilliant, there is character development is solid as titanium, and the story in general is SIMPLY BRILLIANT. Nope, no spoilers.In conclusion this game is the best in the franchise. "

There's a little more to the installation than usual, but if you download the current version of Uplay FIRST, then come back to Steam to buy the game, you can plug the CD key in and you're good to go. It's been fun! Just proceed with caution.			"

												As far as big budget games are concerned I'm way behind. I just recently started playing Black Flag and after the horrible, slow and boring ACIII this was just a breath of fresh air, even if it took many, many elements from the other AC games. But they also managed to improve on the more mediocre aspects this time, making it a solid game all around, and my favorite Assassin's Creed game since Brotherhood (which now comes second place).After some tweaking this game runs wonderful, at a solid 60fps. This game is just gorgeous. Man, rarely have I witnessed such a beautiful game. The water, the islands, the details. You have to see it in motion to truly appreciate it. Some of the faces, on the other hand, still need some work. Graphically speaking these are still the weakest, just like all the previous AC games.I think anyone has played an AC game before so they need no explanation as far as gameplay is concerned. There have been some changes this time, in a positive way. First, there's the sea, it's open for exploration right from the beginning (some (side) missions have to be unlocked first though, like diving). And second, the Abstergo/real life missions are short, which is a big improvement (I'd still like to see it entirely removed, however).Black Flag is a huge game. Completing the story will take roughly 20-25 hours I think and doing literally everything can take anywhere between 75-100 hours. It is that big. And it's all very fun to do as well, partially thanks to the sunny setting which absolutely brightened my mood on dark, cloudy days. I wish I had the time to 100% it but my priorities are a bit different in comparison to most of the other gamers out there (I like to finish as many games as possible).Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is back after the mediocre ACIII and it's bigger and better than ever. I thought I was done with the franchise after the last couple of games but if Unity can even match this one I'll gladly take back those words.[Rating: 94/100]			"

												Sail Ahoy Comrade!!ACIVBF is the 1st AC that I want to finish quickly. Aside because I want to finish because witcher 3 is incoming, the game itself is kind of stray from the line of the creed.To wrap the story , it's about a man that dreams big about adventure and get rich fast so he sail to the sea to become pirate while leaving his beautiful wife behind. All to find the plundering as a pirate that he was doing is wrong and he lost his way. At the end, the Assassin's Creed made him realise that he was wrong and help him back to his way, and don't forgot his daughter come to meet him so he really realise that he's wrong and try to become a good father. Happy End It's better to name this game a different title, the story is not about Assassin's Creed at all. It's about pirate and plundering, while adventuring meet the Assassin's Creed and Templar.While I complain about the story and the concept, the gameplay itself is fantastic. All the pirate game that I have played, this is the best so far. It got adventure, sailing ship, diving, parkour, and don't forget RUM! But there isn't any woman that I can have a way with (LoL).To wrap my review, this ACIVBF is a nonconsistent game. While the gameplay and the graphic is good, the story and the concept is stray from the line of the creed. So for you that following the AC series, this game somewhat explain a little what happen after ACIII, but the story itself is not really good.And for you that haven't play the AC series, this game should be remember as a Pirate Game, not an AC series.**Spent so much time in this game as a pirate than an Assassin (LoL)**			"

Here's some examples of the problems. 1: Huge FPS problem 2: I have this strange glitch where on the main menu it keeps scrolling up, I don't know if this is common or if this is just me 3: Ubisoft doesn't respond quickly, I have a deadline of when I want my games to be fixed. For example small bugs like texture I don't really mind maybe a few months Huge FPS glitches, I at least want them to respond within 2 weeks. (See what I mean now) They didn't respond for 2 god damn months.So that concludes why you should NOT get Assassin's Creed® IV Black Flag™.

												The possibilities in this game are absolutely wonderful.. if you have no problems at all. I had to turn off every spesial feature in the graphics and turn down the resolution to the absolute minimum, and it still lags as hell. (That is just my computer though).I cant connect to Ubisoft's server (I waited for 45 minutes and 32 seconds), which makes it impossible to progress further in the game after inspecting Kenway's fleet. Also, you can only save by checkpoints and you have to start at the very beginning of the mission if you have to quit. Any form of mod is also impossible. These parts would be, in my opinion, much more enjoyable if it was more like Skyrim or Fallout, where you save your games manually and the mods expand the gameinfinitely.The idea of this game is fantastic if you love the Caribbean Pirates, and its amazing that they try make a game based on that, but the technical♥♥♥♥♥♥is just horrible.

												I love the idea of open world sailing games.  I liked this game despite not really liking the console-style climbing/fighting/stealth genre of games.  I liked it right up until Ubisoft deleted 150 hours of game progress from their cloud service.  Since then I hate this game.			"

												Easily in my top 10 games of all time list, this game is worth buying to hear the soundtrack alone. I adore this game to pieces! The main, and one of the only things that bothers me, is that the cities feel quite lackluster and don't have much personality like they do in earlier Assassin's Creed games. Other than that, they took what they had created in Assassin's Creed III and developed it into a true masterpiece. I can heartily recommend this game.			"

												With the end of the world plot and Demond Miles' story being wrapped up in AC3, Assassin's Creed IV had the freedom to explore and chart new waters and it really does show in this grand adventure. Ubisoft have shown that the Assassin's series is far from running out of ideas as this installment, for me, is easily the most enjoyable and rewarding of them all.Edward Kenway, a man who is still uncertain of just what kind of man he is, takes up life on the sea in hope to one day be able to live a comfortable and easy life. His ambitions extend to as far as a coin can shimmer and no further. This story isn't one about conspiracy theories or attempts to save the world. It's a personal story of identity, purpose and self realisation that many, including myself, can very much relate to. What truly matters to a man and a woman.The characrers are easily what make this game so memorable. Each rough pirate and posh kingsman brings with them an equally vast and rich personality that you'll either love to love or love to hate. The voice acting is absolutely incredible and some scenes hold some truly gripping speeches.Managing to play this on ultra, the game is gorgeous. When you first take control of Edward and you sea the deep blue of the ocean, the lush green vegetation and the warm glow of the sands, it's hard to not take a minute and just observe everything around you. Even free running and chase segments in the jungle, I found myself just admiring the level desging so much.The music is yet another immersive feature to this game that a great deal of attention has been obviously applied to. The tavern music brings life to the towns you visit and the shanties sang as you explore the west indies makes you feel you're on an adventure for riches.I think the biggest attraction gameplay wise for most people has to be the naval combat. I personally love pirate games already and found the combat to be fast, intense and very enjoyable. The moment you incap a ship and call your crew to ready to board never gets old! There is enough freedom for you to play as you want. either defensively with fire barrels, up close with heavy shot, or snipe them with mortar fire. As with other Creed games, Black Flag has a A LOT of other activities to take part in, optional lands and towns to explore and mysteries to uncover! If you have an eye for adventure you'll feel right at home on the Jackdaw!My only problem is that the game is still restricted to the idea you're reliving memories and as such, the 'animus' prevents you from going to certain places at certain times becase ""It wasn't available in this sequence"" or it'd take you out of the experience of the 1700's to run around in a modern day office doing chores for people you don't know and don't bother questioning why. While Ubisoft DID do a good job in limiting both those things to a minimum, it was still something that didn't need to be there and restricted the experience, for me at least. Black Flag is a very rich game in character, content and reasons to play. If you want to get lost in the oceans and adventure or be a part of a grand story with grander characters then be sure to pick this gem up!			"

												I can't get my saved files. This game is good, but it honestly sucks when you can't play from where you left off. Even when I checked C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\Savegames.  I don't know what happened but I reinstalled this game twice and still don't have the ""savegames"" folder that I just mentioned. Uplay is terrible.			"

												After what is generally considered one of the lesser points of the Assassin's Creed franchise, Ubisoft put out yet another installment, taking the pirate theme and more or less perfecting it. Few other games have taken the pirate theme and done so well with it. Black Flag blends the concept of being a pirate, exploring the ocean and visiting islands quite well.In Black Flag, you take on the role of Edward Kenway, who is trying to make a life for himself and his family back home. He joins a privateering crew and one night at sea during a storm his ship comes across another that happens to have an Assassin on board. Things goes awry and Edward finds himself washed up on the shore of an island...next to the Assassin who killed some of his crew members. After getting revenge Edward plunders the Assassin's gear and begins masquerading as an Assassin. Deciding to meet up with the party who wished to meet the Assassin (found out via a note in his gear), Edward soon finds a ship to replace the one he lost. Ubisoft found an intersting way to turn our hero into an Assassin, although at some points it feels a bit off. A bit later in the game, Edward is asked to display the skills he's learned during his time with the Assassins, and Edward performs every action, every takedown with extreme ease, no explanation, and no backstory. Understandably though, this is used as a very light tutorial for your basic actions.The plot is your usual Assassins versus Templars fare, and this time both sides are after what is called the Observatory. The interesting thing is Edward doesn't care about either side, even though he is technically playing for the Assassins. Instead, he wants to find the Observatory for himself and become a wealthy man, and throughout the game he plays both sides to get whatever information he can to get him closer to his goal. Edward’s personality and the game’s theme makes the story an interesting one, and it’s backed up with fascinating supporting characters that include famous pirates like Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) and James Kidd. The sci-fi elements still remain. Abstergo are featured in the present time, as the player is put into the role of an employee working at Abstergo Entertainment, who is currently testing a pirate themed game for the company. These moments out of the animus feel lacklustre compared to the amazing world that Ubisoft has created in Black Flag.The game has an open-world feel to it, although it is not as large as most open-world games. You are pretty much free to explore as you wish, uncovering collectibles, finding hidden chests, pickpocketing citizens of one of the three major cities, as well as sailing around from island to island finding out what lies in store for you on each one. You can hunt wild game, which rewards you with materials to upgrade various things (much like Far Cry 3), such as weapon holsters to carry more weapons, or a bigger ammo pouch to carry more bullets for your gun. There are also many different outfits to customize your look.There is so much to do in Black Flag, that at times is can be a bit overwhelming. There are the standard vantage points from the previous games, where climbing to the top reveals large portions of the map, but there are a few new things. There are Forts that guard costal area, which can be taken over to reveal coastal sections of the map. There are also plantations which you can sneak into to steal goods, or Mayan puzzle pieces to collect that lead to treasure. The map is scattered about with some hidden and not-so-hidden treasure chests which house a variety of random loot, much of which just serves to line your wallet with currency. Currency is then used to buy upgraded swords, cutlasses, pistols, and so on.While participating in the game’s story missions, the game uses the same mechanics that we have seen  since the original Assassin's Creed. Following a target, and eavesdropping on their conversation to progress the campaign. There’s a voting system at the end of every mission, which is a brilliant way of Ubisoft implementing a feedback device for players, while blending it into the game’s plot through the Abstergo storyline. My only gripe is that it does not show what anyone else has voted, but instead thanks you for sharing your feedback. Combat is still easy, using a system akin to the Batman Arkham series, relying on careful timing, counterattacks, and chaining basic attacks together. As you master the system you will see just how flashy combat is, as you are then able to move between opponents in a whirlwind of steel and death, increasing the body count as you go. Even though you can kick everyone's butt if you so choose, there are times when it's simply not a good idea. Sometimes the numbers against you can be too great, especially as you are first learning the combat system. Portions of the game rely on stealth, and even when you are not forced to use stealth, it's always a great tool to weaken the forces pitted against you. You can hide in brush while whistling to draw your prey towards for a silent takedown, hiding their body in the brush afterwards as you continue onward towards your objective. And there are always plenty of places to hide and get the upper hand!Black Flag looks absolutely fantastic, with some thirst-inducing ocean and wave effects that are some of the best generated in a video game. The world looks equally amazing, with tons of detail going into making a believable incarnation of the West Indies. The animation can be a bit off, but apart from that it’s a very pretty game.Assassin's Creed is one of those games thats difficult to write a review for within a character limit. There's simply too much to tell about, from the 25+ hour campaign, to the multiplayer, to the insane amount of collectible and side activites, and the many exotic island locations which you may find yourself. Ubisoft has crafted possibly the best pirate game ever, and it is definitely a worthy addition to the Assassin's Creed franchise, and dare I say on par with the masterful Assassin's Creed II, possibly taking it's spot as the best game in the series. Ubisoft has fully addressed nearly all o fthe issues with the previous installments and added so much more on top of that. My hat's off to you Ubisoft....this time.

												Assassin's Creed Black Flag is one of the best games to date, a lot of scenery, action and adventure. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making it as the open world is very graphical and extremely detailed, as well as the actors as they have done a pretty good job with acting out all the characters throughout the game. Singeplayer is magnificent on so many levels, intriguing storyline, massive kill sprees, boarding and sinking ships, messing around, being able to do other things after you complete the game and just so much more to it. The whole AC series has had a massive evolution overtime where they even improved the gameplay and graphics and somehow manage to have a very good storyline for each of those games except maybe a few latest games where it's quite utterly terrible.So what about multiplayer? Surprisingly after 4 years since it's release, multiplayer is still active, while there are tons of new players they will soon become prestiges with a potential. What makes multiplayer fun, is that you'd find a lot of decent sessions when on the right time, you'd be invited to clans or get sent friend requests, earn abstergo credits each match to be able to customize all several characters of your own likings, craft abilities, ranged weapons or purchase perks and streaks, play your favorite gamemodes; Domination, Artifact Assault, Wolfpack, Manhunt, Assassinate, Wanted or Deathmatch. And the multiplayer is just overall impressive, it's much alike to Assassins Creed 3, Assassins Creed Brotherhood and Assassins Creed Revelations, so those who played multiplayer in those AC games will be much familiar with the gamestyle of AC4 and will be able to move straight into it and level up quite quickly. What tends to have people cocky is when they underestimate low level players not realizing most of them are smurfs, it's hilarious if you ask me. The one CON in all AC games ever, is Ubisoft, as they leave AC games unprotected so anyone could just simply hack in it, or even then, make profit off people buying the game and purchasing DLC's, erudito credits and abstergo credits, not to mention the countless bugs and glitches you'd find in both singleplayer and multiplayer in which they have not fixed and never will, as well as people complaining about crashing. One thing to make clear: Just don't mistake a good player for a hacker and try report them or slander them to Ubisoft to try get their account shut down.			"

At first, I'd like to mention that I only played the first game for a couple of hours, therefore, I don't have any knowledge or experience with any other Assassin's Creed game.The story was nothing special but not necessarily bad. It's just like any other pirate movie with a goal to find the treasure. It had many interesting characters, especially in the beginning. On the other hand, I strongly disliked every single one of those Abstergo office walking simulator parts. Who thought it was a good idea to bring that in?Gameplay is fantastic. It's full of naval battles, stealth, chasing, eavesdropping, exploring, collecting, etc.Combat system is almost identical to Shadow of Mordor, Mad Max and Batman games. There's a reasonable amount of weapons for various situations: hidden blades, swords, pistols, blowpipes, darts, ropes, smoke bombs and so on. It just leaves you with a choice to either sneak around and assassinate your target or just jump right into the brawl against the whole crew. Besides fighting, you're free to complete challenges and side missions, hunt, explore cities, ruins, jungles or deserted islands while freely moving around the obstacles.Sailing. That's where the game shines the most. Being an open world game, Black Flag let's you freely travel through the sea and engage in naval combat. Since you're the captain of your ship, you're able to fortify it. Some of those upgrades are cosmetic, others are mostly weapons, armor and space expanders. Your weapon arsenal while on the ship consists of mortars, fire barrels, swivel guns, chain shots, broadside and chase cannons, heavy shots and a ram. You can attack any ship that isn't an ally. Of course, you should evaluate its strength first as you won't be easily taking down Man o' Wars and Legendary ships early in the game. Once the ship is weakened you may board it or sink it and take its loot. Other activities involving ships are harpoon fishing, diving and developing your own fleet which carries and trades your goods with other countries.I can't say much about the multiplayer since I played it just for a few hours. It seemed fun in certain modes but kind of confusing for a newcomer like me. Plus, I really enjoyed the variety in skills, wide customization and character models.Pros:● Open world● A lot of stuff to do (side missions, collectables, etc.)● Excellent ground and naval combat● Freerunning● Decent upgrades● Perfect music● Beautiful graphics● Fun multiplayer● Your own fleet simulation● Storms/tornadoes/strong winds and waves● Sea shantiesCons:●""Meh"" story● Kinda repetitive● Can't change your ship● Uplay is necessary to play● Poor optimization● No Captain Jack SparrowBlack Flag attracted my attention due to ships, mostly because I am a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. I had high expectations and they were fulfilled. I'd recommend getting this on sale.8/10 "

												This game might be the best of the franchise. It combines the elements of Assassin's Creed 3's ship battles and the classic Assassin mechanics. The RPG elements of the ship are good since you have to go attack other ships in order to find your required materials. There is a lot of content in this game, missions, assassin contracts and a lot of collectibles scattered throughout cities and uncharted locations such as islands or jungles.The true pirate experience, and maybe this isn't too true to the assassin's creed series, but who gives a bottle of rum? It's awesome.If you wait for a sale to come up for this game get it immediately, if not, get it anyway.10/10			"

												Basically traditional Assassin's Creed game with ship battle. Very detailed world and interesting character. Ships are a very good addition to the game, but it can get repetitive and grindy. But it's interesting to  have both naval battle and land battle, which make the game more interesting. Some bugs are seldom present throughout the game, but it doesn't affect the game in general. The only major flaw in this game would be the story. Most, if not all, of the 'main' characters are very well developed. But they just disappear during the story or somehow managed to die. So I end up with some other characters that I meet in the middle of the game and they are not properly introduced and developed.			"

												The best of the series, in my opinion. Fantastic gameplay, good story, some relatively difficult puzzles to solve, and being a pirate, what more could you ask for? The only thing I didn't care as much for was the Fleet operations. The ""battles"" took too long to resovle considering it simply being turn-based combat simulation. i didn't think the time spent in what is essentially a mini-game was worthwhile. Luckily it's completely optional. Everything else I enjoyed and will likely have another play-through or two in the future.			"

												To me, this is the best Assassin's Creed. If I didn't have so many weird performance issues with Unity or Syndicate, I might like those more for the updated gameplay elements to it, but this one still beats them out with the exploration with your ship.I really enjoy playing this. Have played through all the way and collected everything in the past, and still find myself picking it up from time to time even now. It's AC, so I'm sure everyone knows what that entails. You're in an open-world, you have a main storyline you progress to push you towards opening up the whole game, and you have so many different sidequests to distract you whilst you do it.This game in the series takes a lot of the seriousness out of it for the sake of making a more fun experience. It's not built to be funny, but it's not burdened with the same heavy overtones of past ones with trying to save the world. You're a pirate. Yes, you eventually find a code and already started with some form of one, but it's secondary to you getting out there and getting all you need to be a true pirate king of the caribbean.When I play this, I actually tend to turn off the music and take in the sounds as is, or sometimes I put on some ambient music to really create a relaxing atmosphere while I run around the islands. I don't really care for the main soundtrack compared to past titles in the series, but that's a small qualm in an otherwise very solid game. It has it's flaws, it's own rules, but still I find that it is more freeing than limiting when playing, so ultimately I'm happy with playing this game and having the options to tackle any situation in a number of ways.I have no problems with performance. The game runs well and looks beautiful. Between this one and AC II, these are the ones to have if you are into the Assassin's Creed games.			"

												Black Flag was the first game I ever ""reviewed"" on my Steam account and as such, I didn't give it any real justice.Black Flag is herald as one, if not the best of the series and for good reason. It brings us an interesting protagonist with solid, naval gameplay. It has its drawbacks sure but it ultimately turns into a wonderful experience all around.I'm not usually keen on playing ""Yet Another White Male"" but Edward's depth really sold me on him. He has a perfectly understandable outlook of ""I want walls that hold back the wind and cold, I want food that doesn't taste like dust"". This is not an exact quote as I'm reinstalling after probably a year since I've played it last, but that is effectively his motive; To not be poor. This leads him to the pirate life (Or ""Privateers"" as he tries to convince his girlfriend that going away for a year is what's best for them) and further leads into his snarky devil-may-care attitude. He gets plenty of dialog that shows the full gamut of personality that involves greed, fear, worry, confusion, and bravery. This is how you write a character, people.The game does not waste time getting Edward in his own ship with mechanics you might recall were tapped into in AC3 but never utilized and was mostly stuck in an optional gimmick. It returns here in full blast with solid broadside mechanics that eventually turn into a melee as you render enemy ships inert. You follow through on a couple of objectives and call it a victory. It's one of my favorite aspects of the game and even includes a sort of ship-based stealth mission or two as you try to navigate your ship through swamps, avoid massive Man O War's, and risk exploring contested waters.If there's a drawback, it's that the game focuses so much on the naval combat (Which, again, is wonderful) that the on-foot missions suffer greatly. Most of them involve following a mark around and staying within an audio bubble to hear them properly. They are frequently irritating and not as interesting as the more straightforward assassinations that the series is known for.For those who felt the 'modern day' segments were a blight, they thankfully take more of a backseat here. You step into the role of a voiceless employee that navigate the headquarters on your off-time and suss out the secrets of the company. Ultimately you are whomever you wish to be and exploring is largely optional as most of the time you can just 'log back in' and go straight back into the game proper.Regardless of one's opinion on Ubisoft and recent business practices; I highly recommend you get this game. Even if you're not a fan of the franchise, Black Flag stands on its own two feet and you won't need to know a lot of lore to be invested in Edward's personal journey. Please get this game.			"

The best in the seriesThe twenty-four hours I spent playing seemed to melt away like sweet, tender meat. It's almost like I was having FUN. Unlike most games in this franchise, this game sports an evenly staggered mixture of unique gameplay elements. Half the time you'll be engaged to the classic stealth assassinations, but for the rest you're swashbuckling on the high seas. Every tedious moment I spent in an obnoxious tailing mission is well worth tolerating as a means of later getting to the real meat. The Piracy. I was bombarding a huge fortress when during the middle of the fight a MASSIVE rouge wave surged from the horizon, demanding my full attention lest I capsize. All the while shells rang out overhead, scattering upon my ship threatening to sink me as I took on damage and water. Enemy reinforcements were soon upon me as well and I was running out of ammo--so I rammed my ship into one of the enemy boats, scuttling it but not before swinging onto their deck and stabbing fifteen people in the♥♥♥♥♥♥like a boss. I cannibalized the ammo and ship parts to repair my own boat and continued my assault on the original base, which I soon saw explode spectacularly as a hail-fire of mortar and cannonballs converged upon it. My ravenous crew wasted no time invading the twisted burning wreckage of their base, climbing through the rubble to sword-fight the survivors as they furiously poured out against me. After planting my knife into the head of the commanding officers I broke into the war room and punched the ♥♥♥♥♥ commander in the throat.The seamless combination of boat combat and traditional melee fighting make this the best game in the franchise. If you play one game in the series make it this one.I like this game more than I hate UplayUplay is a tremendous dumpster fire filled with bodily fluids and dead dreams. If you release a game on steam, you're only doing yourself a disservice by forcibly ""integrating"" uplay into it.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV® Black Flag™ is a sequel to Assassin's Creed III (The reason it is a sequel has to do with modern-day storyline). This game goes one century back in 17th Century during the ""Golden Age of Piracy"" as you play as Edward Kenway, the father of Haytham Kenway, thus the Grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton/Connor (The Protagonist of Assassin's Creed III).[Visuals]The setting is beautifully made with realistic looking oceans and breathtaking landscapes. The color and beauty is quite well made, it feels like the beauty I once saw in Assassin's Creed II. Each major locations look unique to each other. For Example, Havana has blockly colorish clay houses with sandy streets, Nassau looks like a jungle mix with towns, and Kingston has colorful yet similar Buildings like the ones in Assassin's Creed III. Everything is made pretty darn well.[Gameplay]It has retain the same concepts in Assassin's Creed III, but much more improved. Hiding in bushes will not always protect you now as enemies will not only search bushes, but can spot you quickly if they are near enough to see you. Combat System has been improved and difficulty is balanced. The new Free-aim system works very well and bodyshooting enemies will not always kill them, so headshots are mostly necessary and reloading the gun(s) are quick and easy. There are changes for the enemies combat as well. They have the ability to tackle you down during a chase, enemies such as Scouts and Captains can attack you in free flow combat similar to what Connor does in Assassin's Creed III. Sharpshooters tend to shoot at you from above and stays there even if you are hiding. The stealth system seems to have Improved and for me it was enjoyable. Naval Combat is the key in this game. Edward's Ship, The Jackdaw, will be greatly relied on and if you enjoyed Naval Combat in Assassin's Creed III, then you will love this as well. Your ship can shoot cannons with correct aiming, Swivel guns aim perfectly, you can shoot fire barrels from behind and shoot chain shots from the front and with some more upgrades, you can use mortars and upgraded rams. These are useful when fighting tougher ships like Man O' Wars. You can now plunder ships when the ship is damaged enough. No cutscenes play during the plundering and moments like these are great. The Wanted System will not apply on land, however it will apply on the sea. As long as you keep plundering ships, your noteriety will increase, which will result pirate hunters to go after you. The higher the noteriety, the bigger the ship(s) will come, and more difficult it becomes. The Crafting System is encouraged so you may have more guns to carry, more health to gain, more ammo to hold, and so on. You can craft simply through the pause menu. You need materials which leads to Hunting, which encouraged to hunt animals such as Iguanas, Deers, Monkeys, and even Crocodiles. If you go further, you can even hunt sea creatures such as hammerhead sharks, great white sharks, humpback whales, Killer whales, and if you are lucky a white whale. Assassin's Creed IV has also introduced underwater exploring for the first time in the series, which you use a Diving Bell to explore and gain treasures in the deep ocean while avoiding dangerous animals such as Great White sharks, Jellyfishes, Sea Urchins, and Moray Eels. You can avoid them by gaining oxygen through barrels or diving bells or hiding in seaweed (Be careful as it may contain a Moray Eel).[Side Missions and Activities to Do]Side Missions are not bad and will have a good reward for you if you finish or collect all things in the game. Assassin Contracts are mostly unique and Naval Contracts are similar to Assassin Contracts, except it involves fighting on the Ocean. There are maps in areas to get so you can find a buried treasure by simply looking at the coordinates and checking the picture of the map which rewards you with either money or more plans to improve the Jackdaw. There are Missions that involves you getting a key to open a room for a new costume to wear. There are Mayan Keystones for you to search around the Map which rewards you a super cool looking costume. Forts are around the area that will shoot you on sight and it can be challenging if it has assistance from other ships, which is another reason to destroy them so they can reveal treasures and locations on certain sections of the map. Finally, if you are brave and powerful enough, you can fight Legendary Ships that will put up a challenge in the seas which is a great addition to the game.[Story (Modern Day - Abstergo Researcher)]You are an Abstergo Researcher, living the memories of Desmond Miles by using his DNA. The purpose of this is for marketing research as Abstergo was Successful with their product called ""Liberation"" (Abstergo's version of Assassin's Creed III - Liberation). They now hope to get more marketing possiblities by researching on Edward Kenway. As you go deeper into Edward's life, the more deeper you are in between the war of Assassins and Templars in this timeline. As you progress you will be given the ability to hack into Abstergo Computers, Cameras, and Servers to see information that is not meant for you to see. The story for me was not bad and had me excited for the next game.[Story (17th Century - Edward Kenway)]Edward Kenway is a privateer turned pirate who seeks wealth and fortune. The story revolves mostly about him and his desire for riches and wealth so he may retire a good life through piracy (Common among all pirates). You will see a brash and arrogant protagonist, but as he progresses, he will see clearer of what he does as he unintentionally enters the war between Assassins and Templars. You might hate him and you might love him (I believe that is the purpose in his character development), but either way, he makes a good story for a man who simply wants to be rich.[Ending (No Spoilers)]Edward's story ended surprisingly well. However, Modern-day ended with a cliffhanger. Is it a good or bad cliffhanger you say? I let you decide. Those who have played the entire Assassin's Creed series should no longer be surprised by coming Cliffhanger endings by now.[Bugs]There are some bugs that I encounter but was never interfering with my gameplay. I must say though, this sort of bug is the most oddest and most epic bug I have ever seen in a game. Sometimes you will have a hole in the water...and...well...lets just say...your sailors might...go to heaven and the jackdaw rises from the sea. or your ship is at the air and will go down quickly like crazy as if peter-pan was trolling Edward. It was the most hilarious bug I have ever seen in my lifetime. Don't let this discourage you, the game is still good to play. Regarding if it is PC optimized, I cannot say. I ran the game well with my 780M card at the highest settings possible, but I cannot say the same for others.This game improved greatly from its predecessor and I recommend it. Attempt to pay attention closely to the plot of both modern day and 17th Century as it plays one heck of a major role for the next game.Additional Notes: I have finished the game with 100% Synchronization. This is a review for Single-Player Only. Please be aware that I am reviewing the game itself, not the Ubisoft Launcher or anything that has nothing to do with the game, unless it is necessary to be said.This game is played on my Laptop:- Intel Core i7 4700MQ- 8 GB RAM- 1 TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive- Nvidia Geforce GTX 780M 4 GB- Bigfoot Killer Wireless-N 1103			"

												For me, this game was what really brought me into the Assassin's Creed Universe. I started with this game. I tried to go back and play the others, but I was too used to Black Flag's controls and features. Still, the lore and history of these games greatly appeal to me, it's one of my favorite series.			"

												This game is almost brilliant in all the ways it could possibly be! New revamped open-world, new colourful characters, good old gameplay mechanics as well as new ones - everything works out and everything suits the Assassin's Creed saga. I am a bit disappointed that there's too much taken from ACII (just again), rather than AC or ACIII. However, I enjoy the game and I sense it's great potential for the rest of the season with all the DLC and side-activites like AC Initiates.			"

 Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag  is an epic tale of pirates, pirates, pirates... oh and pirates!Edward Kenway is a young man who leaves his pregnant wife behind in his personal quest for loot and fame. The only way to achieve his goal is by becoming a bloody pirate. STORY:  The story revolves around Edward Kenway and his quest to become a mighty pirate in the Caribbean. He meets the mysterious order of the Assassins which he then decides to abandon. The story has some emotional bits but overall, it was rather disappointing. The Assassins plot seems forced and a bit out of place. If this game was called ""Pirates"" or something it would've been better since the AC plot is so forced. GAMEPLAY:  Standard Assassin's Creed fare, you jump, hide, kill, run around rooftops, and most annoyingly: eavesdrop. Once you board your ship, the Jackdaw, all of that changes. The naval combat and the huge open sea and world make up for monotonous on foot missions. While the naval combat draws so much from the PlayStation 2 game: Sly 3 Honor Among Thieves, it is still fun and innovative in its own way. To sail around the Caribbean and sink other ships while your shipmates are singing is a sight to behold.Oh, and the game has a sh*t ton of collectibles. GRAPHICS:  Beautiful. From the detailed environments to the characters and NPCs to the huge open sea to the animations, it clearly is one of the best looking games of 2013. AUDIO:  Solid cast of voice actors and one amazing soundtrack. You'll know you're in for a treat from the main menu’s theme. MULTIPLAYER:  The usual AC multiplayer, if you love it, you’ll love this one even more. If you hate it, it won't change your mind.Overall, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a great game if you forget that it is an AC game. With 50 hours of (mostly great) single player content and a good multiplayer, the game is not one to be missed. 8.8/10  "

												After 41 hours of playing this game, I reached the end.I must say, after playing through this game I did not only feel empty (what do I do with my life now? lol) but also sad. I played all previous assassin's creeds and this one is different. Not just the graphics, the story and protagonist have changed but also the way you play this game in and the kind of character the protagonist has. First of all you will play primarily on the sea. There also is land, but the sea is so much more open and in my opinion a lot better than in assassins creed 3. The things that make sailing so amazing are seafights, songs (personal favorite: Drunken Sailor), that special feeling of sinking your first Man o' War and much more. You'll see thing English Royal Navy fighting against Spanish ships, huge seabattles will unfold and you will be enemy and plunderer of all. You'll capture seafortresses which will after capture not only stop attacking you but also start to attack british and spanish ships. The story was, once again, amazing. You start as Edward Kenway (yes you heard it right, KENWAY), a pirate that cares for nothing and no one and left his wife in Britain to make some money as a privateer. Instead he stays as a pirate. You will meet the likes of blackbeard and Kidd. Along the story Kenway turns into a man with honour and a moral code, a true assassin.  I have nothing bad too say about this game. In this 41 hours of gameplay no notable errors occured, except for that one time that a ship spawned on me and I could not escape under it, which was fixed easily by leaving the animus and re-entering. My system definetely is not the newest (4 GB RAM, a not so new graphics card etc.), but for most of the timne the game ran between 50 and 60 fps (I've had some drops to 30 fps though, even some to 12, but that was so short that it didn't really matter or F up the gameplay)I bought this game for under €10 during the steamsale with the freedom cry dlc. This game was definetly worth it for that price. I'd advise anyone who reads this to wait for a sale before buying this. Assassin's creed games are on sale quite often every year.~my first review on steam			"

												Nice graphics, nice world, beautiful nvidia physics, nice main character, but Ezio more charismatic and better! But this game have old problems with gameplay and the same type boring missions.Conclusion: much much better than Assassin's Creed 3, but I love Assassin's creed 2 more, Ezio Auditore da Firenze forever!My score: 86/100 (must have)В игре хорошая графика, качественные текстуры, отменный динамичный дым благодаря физиксу, прикольный главный герой, но по харизме не дотягивает до Эцио. Вместе с тем в игре присутствуют и недостатки, так и не доработали геймплей с 1 части асасина, не дотягивают французы в этом плане до Бэтмана. Скучные однотипные миссии, типа выследи врага, подслушай разговор, защити от врагов, которые появляются на крышах из воздуха (ассасины в одной из первых миссий) и т.д. Морские баталии и хорошая графика тащат игру, однозначно лучше провальной третей части. Но на мой взгляд AC2 по-прежнему лучшая часть в серии.			"

												I really wanted to love this game, I really did, but unfortunately I played it and felt incredibly let down.Having been a fan since the first game, and adoring the second, I was one of the fans who felt let down by the third game, but still enjoyed it for what it was, although I cannot forgive the ending, which is where I feel my dislike for this game comes from.The game mechanics themselves are the best they've ever been, it's the most fluid and easy to control Assassin's Creed so far, BUT the overall story arc no longer interests me anymore, I found Edwards story to jump and skip all over the place, I really didn't feel like I was experiencing his character grow in significant ways like with previous games. And the 'real world' story while an interesting idea really didn't feel fleshed out enough for me, the only bits I really enjoyed were the memo's Desmond had recorded for his father.Overall I'll keep playing it, as from what I've read I'm only a few hours from the ending, but I shall be more patient when thinking about buying the next installment, and it will probably be the first Assassin's Creed I don't preorder.

												This one was a bit upsetting in that it does everything the previous games do right, and has all the same failings.The sailing portions are really the best parts, but they don't justify a $60 or $40 price tag. In the other areas, you've got the same situation: combat is enjoyable and smooth, you feel like the grandmaster at work when slaughtering through villages, and there is absolutely no challenge. If you have a mind to you can massacre everyone in game with hardly a thought, and there really isn't much reason to anyway. Outside of the structured missions there's very little to do on the ground, and some of those missions can be fairly dull as well, such as the ever-present tailing missions, an unfortune standby for the series. It's got some good spectacle to it, but I'm not really happy at having such an expensive paperweight just sitting in my library.			"

												To me, The Golden Age of Piracy is perhaps one of the most intriguing times in history, and this is exactly where the latest Assassin’s Creed takes us. Many feared what yearly entries would do to the franchise, but with the setting in the early 18th century Caribbean, the improvements to gameplay, and the leap to the next-gen consoles, this is probably the best version of the best Assassin’s Creed yet.In Black Flag, the Caribbean is yours for the taking, and it doesn’t take long before the game sets you loose on the world with your own ship, your own crew, and an enormous amount of things to find and do. Gone are the days of the naval portions being cordoned off from the rest of the game. In fact, you’ll spend the majority of your time on ship this time around, but if you want to scour that small island off to the starboard side for loot, you just need to drop anchor and make the short swim to shore.This easy and abundant gameplay makes getting distracted in Assassin’s Creed IV a very common occurrence. I found myself stopping and plundering every small island, boarding every ship, and exploring every undersea wreck. Many things are not available right up front, or you are just too weak to take them on, but the game’s progression feels very natural, and I never felt like I was locked out of doing too much at any given time. In fact, if I was able to do even more earlier on, I would have never gotten this review done.The story in Black Flag is one of the most interesting me, simply because of Edward’s rogue dynamic. Edward is not an Assassin. He stumbles into the conflict between the Assassins and Templars purely by chance while seeking riches to provide a better life for his estranged bride. He is a pirate. The growth and evolution of Edward and his external view of the conflict was a much more interesting story to me than the fairly static “creed locked” nature of the previous games’ heroes. The modern day aspect is also quite interesting and I did not dread being put outside of the Animus as much as I did in previous games. There are also a couple of interesting Easter Eggs connecting the world of Assassin’s Creed to Ubisoft’s upcoming Watch Dogs as well as possible hints at future entries in the Assassin’s Creed series.The free running through the world feels improved over Assassin’s Creed III, and while I did run into a few areas of frustration and difficulty climbing, these were much fewer and farther between than I was used to. Anyone who has played the past games knows the issues of running up a wall only to grab onto nothing or jumping out into open air instead grabbing onto a ledge. This being my biggest downside of any Assassin’s Creed game, I was very happy to find that the free running and climbing in Black Flag feels a lot more intelligent to what you are actually trying to accomplish.Being that it is such a primary focus, the naval portion of the game has been much improved over your time at the helm in Assassin’s Creed III. Dynamic weather can affect your ocean voyages as sudden storms attempt to topple you, fog limits visibility, and waterspouts damage your ship.The Caribbean seems extremely alive with a vibrant and varied world that feels much more organic and real than any Assassin’s Creed before. Being a free roaming pirate in this world is incredibly freeing and the only time I got any feelings of redundancy was actually during the Assassin focused missions. While being a pirate is extremely fun and open, playing the Assassin is the exact opposite. I felt limited while slinking around in foliage and tailing enemies without being seen. These may be staples of the Assassin’s Creed series but they have not evolved in the same way as the rest of the gameplay. Fortunately these sections play a much smaller part in Black Flag so they do not overshadow the awesome feeling of being a pirate.Collectibles are not a grind in Assassin’s Creed IV as they seemed to be in prior games. Money and supplies to upgrade your gear and ship are found by hunting the wildlife of the Caribbean and plundering the various ships found out on the open sea. Setting out in a creaky rowboat to take on a killer whale or a great white shark is just another daily occurrence for the times, and boarding a ship twice the size of yours to steal its contents is a necessary means for survival and fortune, but all of it remains fun throughout as there is so much to do that no one specific thing gets to feel too repeated.For those not familiar with the multiplayer, it consists of numerous game modes that involve hunting targets stealthily. The more stealth and discretion that you use, the more points you will be awarded. The execution is done wonderfully, but the online mode is largely the same as the multiplayer that we’ve seen before. While massive focus was put into overhauling the way the single player game was played, multiplayer was slapped with a few minor updates and a facelift for the environments and characters. The lack of change isn’t a bad thing as I feel that Assassin’s Creed has one of the most unique and fun multiplayer modes on the market, but don’t expect to be floored by the multiplayer in the same way that the campaign will get you.Even though it is cross generation, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is one of the must have launch games for the next generation of consoles (and PC!) and should hold you over with its vast world until the next slew of next-gen titles hits the market. Ubisoft have proven that they are not milking the Assassin’s Creed franchise for all it’s worth as much as they are cultivating the great things about the series to continue to bring us amazing and fun games. This impressive interpretation of a pirate’s life mixed with the Assassin and Templar influence was a thrill ride that will surely be hard to beat in the inevitable next entry in the franchise.Positive things.The Golden Age of Piracy.So many things to see and do around the world......and a massive vibrant world to contain all these things.Free running feels improved.Beautiful visuals.Being a pirate, in every way.Negative things.Tailing targets and remaining unseen gets repetitive.The freedom of the pirate makes the Assassin feel limited.Too many distractions can mean you take too long to finish a review.FINAL VERDICT 9.5/10			"

												After 100+ hours on this game...I decided to give a review!You can do so much besides the missions! You can explore,hunt,loot,destroy ships and more...Upgrading my ship was fun and awesome and it did not even get bored to upgrade my ship to prepare for what's next!However, this game is a new start and KINDA different from others Assassin's Creed game. But the game is awesome and there some glitches that DOES NOT RUIN the game. The glitches make this game funny but it does not ruin the game for you.There is 2 outfits in the game where you could unlock! You don't even have to buy a DLC or anything that has to do with buying in order to open it.There is a Templar Outfit-You have to collect ALL Templar keys to open the OutfitandThere is a Mayan Outfit-Collect ALL the Mayan stones to unlock it...it's worth it and if you get shot there will be no health taken away from you! It's damn sure recommend if you hate to use the human shield or getting shot every single time.There is new items that is soooooooooooo useful in this game to help you out threw the gameplay!Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Freedom Cry DLCThe DLC is really short and you can beat it like in couple hours. Depends on how you play but when the DLC goes on sale...it's worth for like $5.00 to spend couple hours and try beating the DLC!I am getting ready for Assassin's Creed Unity!Are you ready for Unity?

												I have been playing Assassins Creed 4 for 11 hours now and here is what I have to say about the single player campaign.The game is a 3rd person action adventure game just like the previous three before it. Developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.Assassins Creed 4 has surprised me with how the game starts off. It begins with a good build up to your character and then you find yourself beached on a shore with a fellow sailor and then chasing after him.When I first started playing the game I was very surprised on how it started off with pirating and adventuring. After a bit of playing the game started to feel like Assassins Creed with the climbing up a tall tower to sync you to your surroundings.Eventually I got to get my own ship and sail the seas. Finding small little islands and other larger islands to explore for treasure chests, messages in bottles and treasure maps. You also get to chase after sea chanty songs for your crew to sing as your sailing. Other artifacts like Aztec monuments you climb and get to orientate a marker with your surrounding to find where the buried artifact will be is a cool idea in the game. This all makes this game a joy to play and a break away form the old flag hunting that is meaningless.The game play is the same as previous Assassin Creed games with the climbing and combat style. I like that you can run up to a person and assassinate them, get into tavern fights to open the tavern up to you.There are places in town when you first begin where you need to save some pirates from the authorities who later join you and are your crew on ship. You also get to save people adrift on the seas and they become crew members.Once you upgrade your ship to include harpoons you will be able to go whaling and get that big white whale! Along with whaling you can go shark hunting as well.Eventually you will get to a point in the game where you will get control of your own island and call it home. Upgrading it to provide a tavern, shop, ship repair store and an estate home as well.This game was played with an Xbox360 controller and I can say that its really made to accommodate this type of game play. I appreciate it when developers make a game compatible with a controller.I am very impressed with Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and happy that I picked up the Deluxe Gold Edition for $30 during the 2014 Summer Sale.If your planning to buy this game or not sure if you want to play another Assassins Creed game I would recommend this game, check out the video below. Assassins Creed 4 is worth a play.I give this game:ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːPROS:[/b]Open WorldShip BattlesPirating!Great StoryLots of side questsTreasure hunting!CONS:[/b]The AnimusChasing down Sea Chanty tunes before it resetsCamera angle changes when picking up a body to hide it making it difficult to orientate yourself.

												After being mildly disappointed with AC 3, I am pleasantly surprised by this title. The story line might not be the best in the Assassins Creed series but that is made up for through a tight atmosphere, interesting characters and, of course, Pirates! Who doesn't like pirates? The graphics are well executed. Game play and controls are on par with similar titles. In game actions besides the main mission are varied, reaching from harpooning and hunting through stealth looting of plantations, to the ever popular collectibles, which by the way include shanties that will be sung by the crew while at sea after unlocking. Overall the game is extremely captivating. More so than it's direct predecessor AC 3.There is multi of course, which is a bit different from previous and it is well executed.Well done ubisoft.			"

												tl;dr : The game is great for it's pirate aspect and for the assassin's part.If you like Pirates of the Caribbean then you will love this one.         -Best pirate game out there         -Great environment         -Nice gameplay (naval combat is great,otherwise it's a typically assassin's creed minion kill simulator)         -Good graphics         -Mediocre to bad story         -BLACKBEARDIf the title was just ''Black Flag'' and not ''Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag'' then i wouldn't be able to find any flaws in this one.The only assassin's creed part is the characteristic gameplay of the franchise, yet naval combat is something new and done extremelly well.The world is big , big enough to spend hours and hours to explore,you get the feeling of a real pirate and its most amusing.Yes the storyline is quite dull and one-dimensional, the abstergo-animus thing has quite disappeard but the observatory and ''those who came before'' are present.The great thing about it is that it delivers the feeling of the pirate setting 100% and of course BLACKBEARD.I would rate it BLACKBEARD/10			"

												I might be a bit late to the party, but I recently picked this up on sale. I have not been this immersed in a single player video game for a while. Assassin's Creed Black Flag is tons of fun, whether it's the excellent story or wonderful side activities. If I was not bombing the heck out of British war ships, I'd be on my row boat spearing killer whales, or salvaging treasure from under-water shipwrecks. 30 hours of game play in 5 days, and it was all worth it.I did not have any issues with the Steam - U-Play link like other users. Everything worked flawlessly. I have 0 complaints about this game.I highly recommend you give Black Flag a shot.			"

												Fun and bountyful. Loved the vastness of the map, tons of activities and collectibles. Haven't 100% the game, yet spent 150 glorious hours pillaging and plundering the Caribbean! Seafaring is fun. Story is good, especially the pirate parts, action is great. Free-running controls are a bit clunky, so you may fail pursuit challenges at times. My only gripe with the game is the fact the amount of assassination contracts is finite.			"

												There is a lot to say about Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. You have a vast open world, in which you can travel by foot or by sea. You can either be stealth or brutal in your tactics. You can be the Devil of the Seven Seas or a vigilante of the nations and inspire freedom to your crew.The graphics are absolutely amazing. I've always admired water textures in video games and other than Skyrim; this has been the best I've seen by far. The sails of the ships and the gusts of wind that push them across the watery abyss. The environmental hazards of the sea; rouge waves and cyclones that rip apart everything in its path. The smallest island to the largest populated city. This game has a realistic and unique quality.The Gameplay is excellent. The Pirate story line is something that someone can only imagine. Sure, they have movies, other pirate games, etc. But I never have felt the true pirate experience. The Assassin, Edward Kenway, is an amazing addition to the Creed Line. The battles on Land are just as expected as an Assassin's Creed game, but with new tools, outfits and other additions. The Ship Battles are an amazing feature. There's a lot you can choose from to fix it up how you like. Some of the things you love, must be found or conquered to be added upon your ship.The Present Day story line was rather interesting. Some of it made sense and the rest of it did not. It's pretty expected to be confused about it, because you have no idea who you're character is. Sample 17 is the bloodline from Subject 17. So, as far as it is concerned. The character you are in control of, does not have any connection to the bloodline. You are just going back into Subject 17's ancestral line. Hopefully something will have mention in Unity's Present Day.The mulitplayer I couldn't really get into. I think it's fun to play with other people, but I don't think they have mastered this quality in their industry yet. They still have some things they need to work on for multiplayer that will appeal and increase their community and fanbase. With Unity on its way, I do believe Co-Op is their greatest option for the moment, until they can figure out what to fix in their multiplayer services.All in All. Best Assassin's Creed since Altair. 5/5 Singleplayer, 2/5 Online Experience.			"

												I went into this game expecting a completely different storyline, Assassin's Creed 3 was suppose to be the end of the Desmond story but in a fashion it continues in 4. I was not disappointed, the story has been very well written through out the entire series.I must also confess that being a rum drinker and already knowing the song Drunken Sailor I was pretty happy with the music through the game, usually I wind up turning it off as a distraction after hours of play but, for this, I listened and found a few more to like (""Worst Old Ship"" sometimes mistakenly called Waitin for the Day now ranks among my favorites)The game has plenty to play through on both land and sea, I've had a ball blasting and ramming ships (Down to tha drink!) as well as the usual fights and skulking about. There are a few of the annoying scripted fights but only for the story's sakeWith hints at more to come, I will of course look forward to seeing what may come of the future (or in this case the past)			"

												A great open world action pirate themed game with a ton of features. The story is alright although the biggest part of the game is up to you as a player to explore what the carribbean islands and seas has to offer. Go hunt down a royal convoy, dive for treasures in a long lost shipwreck or take on your classic role as assassin and do your thing. Go sneaky or all in guns blazing!Although it's a part of the Assassin's Creed franchise you are not in my opinion required to play any of the other games in order to enjoy this one. The games not especially connected and they all follow a similar plot. The game is in my opinion totaly worth the money but wouldn't hurt to wait for a sale either.			"

The only things I don't like are the ship battles which are sort of tough until you get a handle on it and the excessive combat that takes so long (especially with multiple enemies) The story, graphics, and overall fun is what makes this a great game. I look forward to buying another later on.   9.5/10-Me			"

In my opinion not the best out of the series but defenitly not the worst. I guess I'll have to replay all the mission and re-ugrade the jackdaw which will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ But willing to do it considering I am a HUGE fan of the series :) Just remember to back up your save file!!!

												Black Flag is as big of an improvement over ACIII as ACII was over the original Assassin's Creed; while ACIII took the series' trademark parkour gameplay mechanics and applied them to an open world, much of that world's freedom was limited or illusory. Black Flag makes the biggest leap forward the series has taken yet by giving you true freedom to go wherever you please whenever you please. Unlike ACIII's overlong prologue, Black Flag thrusts you right into the action and has you at the helm of a seafaring vessel very early - after a few introductory missions, the game centers itself squarely around sailing & naval combat which gels with the spirit & magic of Assassin's Creed's distinctive gameplay. There are a huge array of side quests and tangential, self-contained missions alongside the main story which you can go through at your own pace, and the light RPG elements return in the form of levelling up your weapons and ship as you progress through new waters. What makes this formula special isn't the plot or characters (some are likeable though not particularly memorable) but the world they inhabit - so alive it practically pulses with its own energy in a unique fictional slice of history - combined with freedom of exploration & activity. I've spent hours at a time sailing aimlessly through the sun-filled isles of the West Indies simply watching the weather change or engaging in naval battles and looting ships before taking to shore to stretch my legs and run through the jungles of deserted isles or the dense populace and buildings of bigger cities. There are buried treasures and letters in bottles to be found across a large map, a variety of animals to hunt in different regions to craft upgrades and new outfits, and even underwater swimming sections in which you evade sharks and other deep-sea dangers in pursuit of sunken wealth. Gone is the overarching present-day storyline featuring Desmond & Co. (which had grown very stale and convoluted); the Animus returns, but in an entirely new context that's creative & fun and features some ingenious meta-game narrative flourishes.Black Flag is, in my opinion, by far the best Assassin's Creed game to date (including the newer generation entries such as Unity and Syndicate), with the more dated and linear yet still brilliant ACII trailing behind. It injected a sense of wonder & adventure into a series that had grown stale, and it gives players the closest experience they'll have to being a seafaring pirate during the golden age of piracy. It may be the best naval action game ever made, and it combines the best elements of the series with a true open world sandbox I still marvel over and bound around in to this day. Whether you're already an initiated Assassin's Creed fan or new to the series, this comes with my highest recommendation as it's one of the best adventure games in recent memory. A solid A (9.5/10).			"

I do recommend the game, but I also advise Ubisoft to kill UplayMany people give the game a negative review because they lost their savegame. Well, same happened to me. Storyline finished, only some stuff to collect left in Singleplayer, Multiplayerlevel quite progressed. One day starting the game, finding no savegame... googling what could have happened -  Uplay happened! Looks like when there is any problem while the game is syncing or loading the savefile via Uplay, it's gone. After weeks of beeing just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at Ubisoft, I gave it one more try and made it a 100% (Like I did with all other AC titles).It is a great game worth the money. + Story+ Graphics+ Action+ many additional places to go besides the main story--------- UplayIt is an unnecessary piece of software, Noones likes it, noone needs it. Dear Ubisoft, finally listen to your customers and get rid of this piece of junk software. "

												Yar! So I heard you would like to become a pirate? Well look no further, because this game is a FANTASTIC pirate game! Coming from someone that has never played an AC game, I thought this game was incredible. I, however got frustrated at some of the stealth missions during the game, however I think that comes down to my lack of knowledge of the game mechanics for the AC stealth, so I wouldn't let that destroy my thoughts on the game! The ship fights are fantastic, and you could just go on a constant fight cycle for possibly hours on end, it never ends! So many places to explore, so much booty to loot, and the missions are fantastic, and would highly recommend doing it all if you want to enjoy yourself in this game! Also, the graphics in the game are STUNNING! I can't get over how good just little things looked, like rocks etc, to the vast forests and oceans! The soundtrack in the game is also fantastic. That plus the shanties that you get for your crew to sing is amazing. Overall this is a brilliantly thought out game, and a must have for all players that have either any love for the AC franchise or, like me, just want a good pirate simulator! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!			"

But then I saw some game play videos of the Black Flag, and thought of giving it a try, and wow. I was amazed what this delivers. Graphics, the game play, everything has been improved to a new level. The only con I see on this game is that it also requires uplay (as every other ubi game) which now we are kinda got over.So it's worth every penny a spended on.			"

												This is hands down the best Assassin's Creed to ever see the light of day. Not because it's an Assassin's Creed game but because it is an Assassin's Creed game wrapped inside Pirate Simulator 2013. I liked Sid Meier's Pirates and this game takes the concept to a whole new level. There is SO much to do.Pros- Sea battles- You can board ships- You can capture these ships and send them to your fleet- You have a fleet which incorporates its own mini game. You can send our fleet's ships to mission to gain resources and money but first you need to secure the trade routes by doing mini sea battles.- You can go whaling and kill sharks- You can explore islands from tiny to huge in size and kill the local fauna for resources.- You can find things like smuggler dens and dive to sunken ships to find treasures and treasure maps.- I'm not quite sure on this yet but it seems like you can assault whole cities and take them for your own. Correction: You can assault several forts and if you manage to destroy them with your cannons you gain control over a section of the map, i. e. no more ""red zone"" and collectibles appear.- Upgrade your ship- Upgrade your characterNeutrals- Tons of collectibles and unlockables. Love them or hate them...- You need to progress the story to be able to do everything listed above.ConsAt its core it's still an Assassin's Creed game. That of course doesn't automatically make it bad, but:- Uplay- Very sticky and at times sluggish ground movement. Your character constantly tries to grab on to or step on any possible thing he can find. Chasing something? Better jump on some random post and and squat for a few seconds instead of just running on the street like a normal person.- As soon as you step foot onto any roof, you will be hunted by ten or more guards who want to stab, shoot and generally murder you in cold blood for...being on a roof.- Silly bugs but nothing game breaking for me so far.

												Another fantastic entry into the Assassin's Creed Franchise, each year just seems to get better and better and Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is no exception, even though this game is mainly surrounded by a pirate theme, the Assassin's vs Templar's storyline is incorporated very well into the story and adds more emotional storytelling then ever before.This time around you play as Edward James Kenway, who is the Grandfather of Connor also known as Ratonhnhaké:ton who you play as in Assassin's Creed III. It is the first time an Assassin's Creed game has gone back before the previous game timeline and I am glad It did because Edward Kenway's story is absolutely fantastic and a very rememberable one. Edward Is a long time pirate after leaving Wales to persuade a life of plunder and adventure, which he soon finds. However Edward runs into a powerful group of Templar's, without realizing the consequences of his actions Edward is soon an enemy of the Templar's and not welcomed by the Assassin's, even though he does not care about the war between the two he will soon realize that his allies will question every move he makes as he experiences loss and heartbreak.The gameplay in this game is really good too from both ground to sea, this game being a pirate themed game has alot of focus on sailing around the caribbean sea. You will be the captain of a ship known as the Jackdaw, this ship is your transport throughout the game except for fast travel, the ship can be customized to your liking from its appearence to the upgrades for the ship such as better armour or more cannons to fire with. You can also customize Edward from Outfits and Weapons or crafting better Health Upgrades and more holsters to hold pistols in. The combat and parkour in the game is also very smooth and works well. There is alot of stuff to do in this game from Naval contracts, Assassination contracts, capturing forts, collecting items such as new shantys for your ship crew to sing, Mayan stones for a nice Mayan outfit, Templar hunt missions, multiplayer if you are into it and so much more. There is also DLC available for the game too that give you unique items to customize your ship with as well as other things.Now from a Graphical and Technical point of view, the game looks beautiful there is no doubt about it, It looks even better then Assassin's Creed III which was a huge leap in graphics for the series, however people have said that the game is unoptimized and some people have said it is really demanding. For me to get a most of the time constant 60FPS! at 1080P I had to turn off Physx which really only should be used if you are running Sli and turn down my Anti-Alising to SMAA, the game looked and ran beautifully for me on those settings with everything else maxed out, SMAA is better then FXAA and Physx is not the most optimized graphic setting in this game let alone in games in general, but other then that the game looked and ran great for me, I had to turn on VSYNC as I generally do in games because the screen did tear for me when It was off, just thought I would mention It because in some games I can get away with VSYNC being off.Overall I really did enjoy this game and I do recommend it to you because, It looks great no matter what settings you have it on, the story is memorable, characters are very interesting and the game is emotionally heart touching with a great soundtrack to back it up, I highly recommend this game regardless of whether it is on sale or not, It is worth the price.

""For years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a tinker's curse for those I hurt. Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home.""If I could, I'd give this game one thumb up, and one thumb down. But for this review, I thought to myself, what would I say if a friend asked me if he or she should buy this game? First off, I'm not gonna be like these other reviewers downvoting instead of not recommending because of a problem they had with Uplay. I've played the game and finished it, and put alot of time into this game, therefore I am actually gonna talk about the game, and discussing about what Ubisoft did right and wrong.The ReviewIt's definetly the most unique Assassin's Creed game out there. It shares a few elements from the other ones, but makes its own mark with its setting... 18th century Carribean. The gameplay is incredibly easy. All the enemy types are the same, and even though the animations are well done, they get boring to look at pretty quickly. Enemy AI is also pretty bad. Sometimes an enemy will see you, and then all of a sudden go back to patrolling. This is franchise has one of the easiest stealth systems ever, and Black Flag shares that curse. Enemies can't hear you running, enemies can't see you clearly sometimes, enemies walk across dead bodies sometimes, the list goes on. It's surprising that after five games, not even counting the PS Vita and PSP version, they can't add a simple little crouch button that games in 2004 had. Scaling also feels dumbed down and much easier. There's nothing special about it anymore, and there's a lack of interesting buildings. Now... being a captain of a ship. Something an Assassin's Creed game has never aimed at. It's got it's share of good and bad. The good? Steering feels immersive. The atmosphere of captaining your own ship, and having a loyal crew of members working for you that all want the same thing. It's done well. Everyone's happy, having fun, but always ready to follow orders. Ship battles are also fun, but there's no real strategy involved. Jumping on to the enemy ship never gets old too in my opinion. There's no better feeling than ""I've disabled you ship, now I'm gonna jump on, kill your crew members, and force you to lower my bounty level!"". Hunting whales, dolphins, and sharks is cool the first few times you do it, but it gets boring after a while and doesn't feel too useful. Same with diving missions, it's cool at first and actually has it's own little stealth system, but feels useless. The world is also HUGE! But... the islands are small, and there was never any feeling that I ever wanted to explore any of them unless they had a collectible that I wanted at the time. There's only four islands that have full cities, the rest are either for trading or they're empty. Edward is also probably the most unique character out of all the previous Assassins. The previous Assassins wanted Revenge, Freedom, Justice, Answers. Heroic type things like that. Edward? He wants to become rich and famous, which is fitting for the setting. His character model is also super badass. But despite all of this, he's not that interesting of a character. Bad thing's in his life happen, but somehow the player never really feels for him (except for maybe in the end). The story start's out right in the action, which is nice, but after that it sort of starts to lose its meaning. Of course, there's also the story that goes on in the modern day. I don't have many good things to say about it. It's unwanted and unnecessary. It's like immigration: an incredible boring and long process that you don't want to do, but it needs to be done for you to progress. Even though I'm not saying alot of good things about the story, don't get me wrong. It has it's moments that I wouldn't want to spoil for you, but it's taken over by too much bad. Graphics and sound aren't too special in this game. Facial animations aren't the best, and the lighting isn't too great either. The resolution for texture's aren't that low, but they aren't very high for you to be amazed either. Voice acting is good, but the quality of all the other sound's are average, some even subpar. There's also some bugs. I didn't deal with too many, but I dealt with enough where I have to inform it. Nothing gamebreaking though. And no, I had no problems with Uplay.Overall OpinionAssassin's Creed 4: Black Flag doesn't do much to impress. Here and there, it's got some good things, and it captures the pirate aesthetic, but it's overtaken by a boring storyline, easy gameplay, a few bugs, some ""meh"" sounds and graphics, and there's really not much to do in the world.Final RecommendationIf you are thinking of buying this game, only buy it when it's on sale, or find a good price and buy it for the cheapest price you can find.

												This is a game that has some extremely high points and extremely low points. Let's start with the good: Sailing. After the first hour or two of faffing about, the game gives you a pirate ship and sets you loose on the seas. Most of the fun times you'll have in the game will be sailing around and getting into incredibly dramatic ship battles on the high seas. If you've ever played Sid Meier's 'Pirates!' then you'll be pleased to know that sailing in Black Flag is basically a modernized version of that. You have to manuever your ship to bring cannons to bear while staying out of their firing zone by managing your ship's speed and manuevers. In one memorable moment, I assaulted a British fortress in the middle of a storm, riding waves and dodging artillery as a British Man O War and a pair of Frigates bore down on me. Using a wave to barrel out of the way of an artillery barrage before delivering a round of heavy guns onto a Man O War's backside is absolutely thrilling stuff. The sailing alone is enough to make me recommend the game. It's incredibly fun and incredibly fresh. The story (ignoring the modern day headache that the game insists on vomiting onto you now and again) is alright, if fairly predicatable. One problem I had is telling apart the male pirates. It seemed like I killed about 8 pirate guys that betrayed me somehow and I had some sort of beef with. But I didn't really care about the details of the templar/assassin nonsense anyhow, so I'll give the story a pass. I liked James Kidd quite a bit after all. The problems with the game are basically everything else. Let me discuss the major points:First:Whenever you go back to land to take an assassination mission, the first thing you'll be asked to do is tail and/or eavesdrop on someone. This involves jumping on a rooftop as they walk along town (and needless to say every town in the Caribbean has a good five or six guards inexplicably guarding rooftops) or hiding in a bush as they walk along. If you fall behind, mission failed, start again. Not fun.Second: The land combat is ridiculously easy. I did some early assassination missions, made some gold and then bought the Wheellock Pistols, which have massive range but do less damage. Unfortunately for every Spanish soldier in the Caribbean, pistol damage means♥♥♥♥♥♥when a headshot is an instant kill no matter what. For when I did do melee, I had a pair of swords that I bought in the first hour of the game that let me jump around going for a stabathon on all the bad guys without much trouble. But honestly, that wasn't even the problem. There are three points in the game where your weapons get arbitrarily taken away in an attempt to get you to use stealth, but even with just your wrist knives you can kill infinite guards with parry and break defense. Sure it's fun at a visceral level to walk up to a fortress of British soldiers and kill everyone inside, but Dark Souls this ain't. Third: The game wastes time with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There's this entire diving minigame with unique mechanics where you've got to dive underwater for some treasure while using air bubbles and dodging sharks. It's a terrible minigame that no one in the right mind would want to play and Ubisoft seemed to recognize this, because you only have to do it once. You can explore ship wrecks as an optional thing on your own, but it's such a tedious busywork section that no one in the right mind would want to do it. Which brings us to the central point, which is that Ubisoft has no idea how to tell a good idea from a bad one. Instead of underwater travel or tailing (and I'm not even going to talk in any detail about the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing modern day office/hacking crap), they could've given the sailing a bit more depth and made more things to do at sea.  As it stands, the game is great fun up until the point where you've got your ship upgraded to the point where you can take on two Man O Wars with ease. At that point, the game sort of peters out and you'll fast travel from story mission to mission to wrap the thing up. Just goes to show that while a team behind a game might have talent, you still need a director with a coherent vision to make a game great. Without that vision, you end up with a scatterbrain game like AC: Black Flag. Still, cool that a brother is heading a big video game project. Keep improving, Ashraf Ismail.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV is the game that Assassin's Creed III should have been. You know... like, actually good and stuff. In that way, it's somewhat similar to the drastic change in quality from AC1 to AC2. Assassin's Creed III had some good ideas, including changes to the controls and overall formula, but ultimately just wasn't as good as the previous games (not to mention it was also buggy as all hell). AC4 takes the improvements that AC3 tried to make and actually implements them - with nary a bug in sight. I suppose it also helps that the setting and main character are far more interesting as well. I mean, seriously... who doesn't dig pirates and adventure on the high seas? You play as privateer Edward Kenway - neither Assassin nor Templar - thrust into the middle of both of those worlds. Edward is one of the better protagonists in the series, and is generally quite likeable.The one huge difference that sets Black Flag apart from previous games in the series is its setting - well over half the game takes place on the ocean. And what an ocean it is... seriously, it is huge. And sailing on it is just so very cool. The closest comparison I can make is to exploring the ocean in the Wind Waker on Gamecube back in the day, only much bigger and more realistic. The exploration element alone is great. However, what really sets AC4 apart is the way it looks and feels. In terms of video game technology, it's just amazing what they were able to pull off. You can almost actually feel like you're out on the ocean, as waves and wind make your ship swerve, sway and dip (and just wait until you see all the gorgeous weather effects). I can't imagine any game ever nailing seafaring better than this... (well, at least not until virtual reality sailing comes along). It just feels great. Naval combat also plays a big part in the game. Unfortunately, as fun as it can be, it does have a few problems. You control your weapons by changing the perspective of the camera (look to the ship's side to fire cannons, or to the rear to drop fire barrels, for example). This is all well and good, in theory, but in the heat of battle with multiple enemies, it can get a bit dodgy. By the end of the game, you should have a good handle on it, but it isn't always the easiest thing to manage. By far, the coolest part of combat is boarding other ships. There are no loading screens on the ocean. Ever. This means that any ship you see (and all of the crew members on it) can be engaged in real time, at any time. If you want to jump off your ship and swim to a frigate and kill every dude on board all by yourself, you can do that. If you want to incapacitate a ship with your cannons, get alongside, board it by swinging on a rope and air-assassinating the captain from one of the masts, you can do that. It is very, very fun. But as with anything, repetition will eventually cool those initial highs and you may start to tire of the whole process by the time the latter parts of the game roll along. This is more an inevitability than a knock on the game itself, but should be mentioned. Rounding out the new additions to the series, Black Flag introduces a set of underwater diving locations. These are mostly optional and don't really make or break the game one way or the other. They are just ""meh"", mostly due to the horrible controls inherent with underwater segments in every game with underwater segments ever made. Ever. There are some cool bits underwater, but these segments could have easily been excluded and it still would have been a decent game.The other half of the game takes place in land-based locations, and follows the standard AC series formula. You take on various missions to gather information or assassinate people, which require either stealth, combat, or both. Free-running and climbing also return and are generally OK, though the usual issues (like climbing onto things you aren't trying to climb onto in the heat of the moment) are still ocasionally present. Combat is similar to previous games as well. Mostly all you need to do is button mash and use counters or break enemy defenses at the appropriate moments. As simple as it is, it is still ever so satisfying, due to the insane number of moves you can pull off in various situations - put simply, you are a serious badass. There is also a very limited number of different weapons available (contrary to previous games), which is a welcome change. There's no longer 3 inventory screens' worth of pointless weapons you'll never use. Early on, you'll be able to buy a good set of swords and pistols. Those, along with your hidden blades, are pretty much all you'll ever want or need for the majority of the game. The land-based segments take place in 3 major locations - Havana, Nassau and Kingston. Additionally, there are a number of smaller islands scattered around the ocean that contain fishing villages, ruins, and more. Overall, it's a nice balance between traditional AC and the newer naval bits. The last part of the package is a sub-plot that continues the goings-on in the modern-day time period. With Desmond out of the picture (mostly), you play as an unnamed employee in the game division of the Abstergo Corporation. I don't mind these sections too much, but for those of you who don't care about these present-day bits, just know that most of these sections are optional, and the parts that are required can be done pretty quickly. The optional activities available involve ""hacking"" a bunch of computers, which unlocks various bits of lore and info on what has happened since the events of the previous game. If you are into following that part of the series, some of it is pretty interesting. Otherwise, these optional bits can simply be ignored. Overall, I found this to be a worthy entry in a series I thought was on its last (peg?) legs. The amount of things to do is pretty insane, and I found almost everything to be pretty dang fun. That said, I am also somewhat easy to please, and kind of anal when it comes to games that have any kind of collecting aspect... so take that opinion for what it's worth. A lot of how much you enjoy this game will depend on how much you dig the new seafaring aspect, since it is such a large portion of the experience. I can see how it might be hit or miss for some people. If you liked the naval missions in AC3, then you will most definitely enjoy the improvements Black Flag makes in that area. If you hated those missions, I hesitate to recommend AC4 wholeheartedly (though you very well may still enjoy it). If you've never played an AC game before, or haven't played one in a long time, this is a great one to jump into the series with. It's definitely not perfect, but it's pretty solid overall. I'd rank it up there with the better games in the AC2 era. I'd give it a B+ or A-.			"

I mean the games fun but its not really an assassin game its more of a combat game. I think Ubisoft should make a different series for combat and people who like combat games and leave this series as an assassin game. If you like combat then this a game for you. If not don't get it.			"

												Love the game! It is the first AC game in the series that I play and I love everything about it. The graphics are amazing, the story is catchy, there is a lot to explore and the naval battles are just amazing!!Positive aspects:- I really started to like the present day missions - the computer hacking and stuff, however I foresee a grimm ending ? (please don't spoil it for me)- I like the fact that the resources (metal mostly) are kind of scarce and you either get them from naval battles, wreckages or warehouses- the world is huge :)Some negative aspects:- tail and evesdrop missions are kind of repetitive and while you get the hang of it I would much prefer to do different stuff- some unrealistic fort takeovers - > super tornadoes while attacking it and after you capture it, it's sunny all of a sudden (like... come on!)Update: Good God, I played like 55 hours without ever using mortar??? Just - accidentally - found out how to use it :)))Update 2: Just finished the game - didn't like the ending that much... Maybe I'll try to defeat all the 4 legendary ships (actually just 3 left) and collect all the animus fragments and to get 100% sync.And also I should play Freedom Cry.Overall a great game, IMO!			"

												This is probably the best AC game I've played so far. Previous titles made me uninstall them after a couple of hours but this one is absolutely solid and enjoyable experience. The story is interesting and has some unexpected plot twists. The whole ""pirate"" stuff is also nice and fun to do. Unfortunately the combat system is still about mashing two buttons until all your enemies are dead. Naval battles are better but with some upgrades your ship becomes way too powerful and even high ranked enemy ships can't stop you. Hunting is fun but when you got everything you need becomes useless. Graphics looks pretty and effects like smoke and fog are really well done.Overall AC IV is absolutely worth purchaising and speding your time among the carribean pirates.			"

The Good:* Highly-refined combat system* Well-balanced and non-gimmicky sailing system* Huge, meticulously-made open world with few duplicate textures* Potential for extremely good graphics if you have the hardware* Good sound and voice acting* Environment interaction is top-notch* Missions are designed well and have a large variety* Stealth is fun, challenging and diverse* Memorable soundtrack* Stunning visualsThe Bad:* No triple buffering* Uplay with its malevolent updates and other skullduggery* HUD is tacky, distracting and too intrusive* Combat is too easy and unchallenging (stealth makes up for this)* Some aspects are copied from previous games without improvement* Glitches of Titanic proportions (excuse the pun)* Kenway's Fleet minigame thing is horrible* Too many cutscenes; especially when doing sailing activitiesBottom Line:The most refined and diverse Assassin's Creed yet, however, if Ubisoft keeps improving each game in small increments and releasing every year or so, this series will turn stale very soon (this has already happened according to some). Until then, this game is well-polished and extensive and thus highly recommended.			"

												IMHO Black Flag is the best in the series. The ship combat, travel, and streamlined horde brawl combat with it's counters and gadgets is the best it's ever been. The setting is open and collectibles actually have a fun effect - new sails, wheels, figureheads, canons, and mortars for your ship, new outfits, inventory upgrades from hunting, sea shanties your crew sings while sailing (you will find yourself humming along to your favorites, if you have a heart), and different weapons from challenges like the pistol swords.There's nothing like riding the wind full sail bearing down on a British Man-o-War loaded with gold and treasure through a heavens-sundering storm like a vengeful spirit while your crew sing Leave Her, Johnny, surprising the slaver ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with a screaming volley of mortars before smashing them open with the Jackdaw's trusty ram, then swinging onto the deck from a rope and taking the prize bloody with cutlass and pistol.

												Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is my favourite Assassin’s Creed game, one of my favourite Ubisoft games next to Far Cry 3 and definitely one of my favourite games in general. The majority of the game is based on Assassin's Creeds naval combat system. Combined with an engaging ship upgrade system and some of the best mechanics from Far Cry 3 like the hunting/crafting system. This makes for some insanely fun gameplay.In terms of story the game doesn’t really become Assassin’s Creed until the last couple sequences and even then doesn’t actually further the AC storyline much in both past or present story arcs. ACIV: BF does however capture the pirate theme is an incredible and immersive way. It’s almost as if Ubisoft wanted to release a standalone pirate game but were unsure of how it would sell so they made it within the AC universe instead.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and addicting gameplay experience or pirate themed game. Note: This game does not have triple buffering. If you want to run this game at 60fps on a lower end machine without compensating graphics, I recomend downloading and runnning D3D overrider alongside the game and using the ""force triple buffering"" option.

												Highly recommended for those interested in open-world and stealth games. You will be thrilled with so much actions before you know it. The game itself introduces a strong focal point in naval exploration for the first time in the series, which is something quite unusual. Another relatively similar game to this is the newer Assassin's Creed Rogue. Like all games in the series, the game incorporate both present modern-day events and a fictional history of real life events based on the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, featuring three major cities of Havanna, Nassau and Kinston. The plot is long lasting and quite overwhelming as you progress further in the story.			"

												I'll start by saying I've never played an Assassin's Creed game before this one. That might have some bearing on my opinions of it, maybe not. This game is pretty damned good, though. Even without the (what I assume to be) over-arching AC story, it stands up. The modern-day stuff could have, in my opinion, been taken out entirely and it would have #1 been just fine and #2 made just as much sense story-wise. Being a pirate is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I haven't seen a game yet that really captures the feeling of sailing on the high seas as well as this one. It's not exactly like LoZ: Wind Waker, where you have to be mindful of the wind direction and such, but it feels really good anyway. The naval combat is superb as well, and while the boarding actions (and the resulting cinematics afterwards) don't necessarily seem realistic in the midst of a huge battle, but it works anyway. Upgrading the ship feels really good, too. You can customize your sail color and figurehead with unlockables, but there's really no better than the Crimson sails, which you get fairly early on and I never changed. Finding upgrade plans in underwater chests and with treasure maps is always neat as well, and really gives you a reason to explore. And honestly, you'll be exploring anyway. The game mostly open-world, so you can completely disregard the main story-to a degree-and just explore and conquer the seas. My advice, though, would be to at least progress throught he story until you get the diving bell. It's really not all that far in and you need it for certain ship upgrades. I made the mistake of conquering about 50% of the map before I did that, but it's not really a huge deal.The hand-to-hand combat is a bit trivial, you really only need to wait to block, then hit kill. Not a lot of challenge, but it's fun anyway usually. All the stealth bits are also there as you would expect from an AC game, and those are done well. So what's bad? Well, like I said before, I gave 0 ♥♥♥♥s about the modern day missions. They kinda sucked me out of the game, and while they don't last too long, they're kinda boring and have pointless mini games thrown in. One of them is literally just Frogger. They also pair you up with an IT guy with all the social skills of a broom in a dark closet. Just an annoying character. And to top it all off, towards the end of the game it gets stupid. Like, really stupid. This is one of those moments where maybe it would make more sense if I had played the earlier AC games, but they don't give much explanation for it here and it's just a big wtf moment. Like, I just want to go around doing awesome pirate♥♥♥♥♥♥ but they make me walk around (because that's all you can do in modern-day missions) and watch some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥they offer no real explanation for. There's hints about the ongoing Templar-Assassin war happening even today, but it still felt really unnecessary. That's honestly my only complaint. It's an aweome game, being a pirate is fun as hell, they tie in a lot of actual historical figures from the Age of Piracy, the sailing is great, harpooning is awesome, I just disliked the modern stuff. But hey, that's what the series is. Would definitely recommend, even for those who haven't played Assassin's Creed before.			"

												IMHO Black Flag is the best in the series. The ship combat, travel, and streamlined horde brawl combat with it's counters and gadgets is the best it's ever been. The setting is open and collectibles actually have a fun effect - new sails, wheels, figureheads, canons, and mortars for your ship, new outfits, inventory upgrades from hunting, sea shanties your crew sings while sailing (you will find yourself humming along to your favorites, if you have a heart), and different weapons from challenges like the pistol swords.There's nothing like riding the wind full sail bearing down on a British Man-o-War loaded with gold and treasure through a heavens-sundering storm like a vengeful spirit while your crew sing Leave Her, Johnny, surprising the slaver ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with a screaming volley of mortars before smashing them open with the Jackdaw's trusty ram, then swinging onto the deck from a rope and taking the prize bloody with cutlass and pistol.

												***Work-in-progress review***Merely 3% complete and I already know this is going to be the best AC game I've played to date (not counting Rogue, Unity and Syndicate).Black Flag takes everything awesome and fun about AC II and bring them to the next level.PROS:- Drop dead gorgeous graphics!- Typical awesome, epic pirate tracks!- Fluid and entertaining parkour system!- Satisfying and responsive combat system- Charismatic protagonist (AC III SUCKS)- Finally, some female! (AC III SUCKS)- Assasination missions are back! (AC III SUCKS)- Courtesans are back! (AC III SUCKS)- Colletibles hunting no longer feels like a chore (AC III SUCKS)CONS:- Understandbly more demanding on hardware.  With 3770K + 970 + 16GB, I couldn't run the game at 60 fps with everything maxed out at 2560 x 1440.- Even at maximum mouse sensitivity, camera moves rather slowly, forcing me to drag my palm across the mousepad instead of simply moving my wrist.GOLDEN AGE OF PIRACY.  If you are getting one AC game, Black Flag is it!			"

												One of Ubisoft's triple A titles, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (AC4: BF) further expands the Assassin's Creed universe not only in terms of the plot, but in gameplay as well. It's rare to find a game that builds off of so much material, but AC4: BF stands out against the traditional video game since it offers a variety of side-quests or mini-games. Within AC4: BF there is crafting, naval fleet management & trading, item collection, hunting, harpooning, piracy, exploring and of course the third-person assassination missions that we all know and love from the franchise. AC4: BF is absolute fun and has become the premier pirate game. Everything from the diverse gameplay to the graphics and sounds, AC4: BF is not to be passed up by any self-respecting gamer as it is what video games should be delivering in terms of experience.

												The graphics, soundtrack and gameplay are great and it runs well even on my measly intel 4000 integrated graphics. The story falls a bit short, unfortunately; not only because of the writing but also because it's easy to get distracted by side activities until you can't remember what was going on anyway and probably can't be bothered to care either. That said, it's not bad, if you don't mind a more fantasy-oriented AC game with a lot of focus on mythology and stuff, but it's not exactly the most captivating piece of AC storyline I've ever seen. The game runs smoothly even on my laptop (Yes, I'm playing this on a laptop. Sue me.) and I haven't encountered any bugs, either (apart from the occasional sword phasing through some of the outfits, but I have yet to see a game where that doesn't happen).The parcour pathfinding is no less aggravating than it could be in previous games, and there are some climb-able things it really hates, such as a few parts of mast and rigging, as well as the occasional tree. Fluidly running over rooftops and the like works good, though - if you can find enough rooftops to run over, that is.You don't need to constantly hold down three keys (forward, sprint and freerunning) anymore, only two; you only need the third one for jumps deemed 'unsafe' by the pathfinding, which is definitely an improvement. Hand-to-hand (or, well, sword-to-sword) combat is okay, but neither particularly hard nor terribly exciting. Very satisfying, though, and it looks awesome. Naval combat, however, is fluid, streamlined and just plain fun once you get the hang of it. The only thing that is probably even more fun than naval combat is sailing: The different weather conditions are beautiful to watch (look out for high waves during sunshine - the color of the sea when the sunlight shines through the waves is a very nice and very pretty touch), if occasionally slightly aggravating (hello there, super-dense fog and intense storms with unfortunate timing) but ah, the things you gladly suffer for a bit of realism.The ship handles very nicely too, and the level of texture you can see even while sailing is incredible.(Also, bonus point for sea shanties, dangit! Best thing ever. Although the soundtrack if you deactivate them is glorious, too. Win/win.)I don't know if I've mentioned it yet, but the game is stunningly beautiful. Very detailed, very nicely textured and well made, with a very clean, intricate and atmospheric look. If you're anything like me you'll probably end up climbing sync points more for the looks than for anything else, especially because the map is a good deal less integral to you finding your way around than it used to be.The only thing that I don't like about AC4 is the amount of wasted potential: AssCreed needs a more captivating story than AC4 has and as much as I love it as it is, it probably would've been the game of my dreams if they'd just made a pure pirate game out of it and expanded on the pirate-y parts of it. The Assasin parts of the game do feel a bit tacked on every now and then.Still, I don't regret spending money on this - it was totally worth every cent of it and I can full-heartedly recommend it - it may not be a perfect game, but it is a very, very good one.

												Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a mix of Assassin's Creed II and III on Steroids. I have played Assassin's Creed II and the story was amazing and so was the combat but here its amazingly expanded upon. Adding your own crew and ship to sail is what makes Aassassin's Creed IV huge! The Sandbox style to this is something special, as a AC fan I think it brings a new taste and adventure to the table. Edward has many new tricks up his sleeve, you are taken on an amazing quest of adventure in the Caribbean, the year is 1715. You will encounter many Spanish and English along the way as you explore the Caribbean. Secrets and ruins of the Mayans. The combat is fluid and a real enjoy to watch as you take part in it. This game is a must own. If you are new then it does not hurt to try or if you are a veteran then you will look forward to this!			"

												Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is my favourite Assassin’s Creed game, one of my favourite Ubisoft games next to Far Cry 3 and definitely one of my favourite games in general. The majority of the game is based on Assassin's Creeds naval combat system. Combined with an engaging ship upgrade system and some of the best mechanics from Far Cry 3 like the hunting/crafting system. This makes for some insanely fun gameplay.In terms of story the game doesn’t really become Assassin’s Creed until the last couple sequences and even then doesn’t actually further the AC storyline much in both past or present story arcs. ACIV: BF does however capture the pirate theme is an incredible and immersive way. It’s almost as if Ubisoft wanted to release a standalone pirate game but were unsure of how it would sell so they made it within the AC universe instead.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and addicting gameplay experience or pirate themed game. Note: This game does not have triple buffering. If you want to run this game at 60fps on a lower end machine without compensating graphics, I recomend downloading and runnning D3D overrider alongside the game and using the ""force triple buffering"" option.

												Highly recommended for those interested in open-world and stealth games. You will be thrilled with so much actions before you know it. The game itself introduces a strong focal point in naval exploration for the first time in the series, which is something quite unusual. Another relatively similar game to this is the newer Assassin's Creed Rogue. Like all games in the series, the game incorporate both present modern-day events and a fictional history of real life events based on the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, featuring three major cities of Havanna, Nassau and Kinston. The plot is long lasting and quite overwhelming as you progress further in the story.			"

What is the franchise about and what is the game like?Simply put: Like the Batman Arkham franchise in historical costumes. Third person parcour, forgiving stealthy or go loud game, which is not meant to completely run & gun. I played the first two tittles before Black Flag. Here is my impression on this one:What remained:- Beautiful, large open world.- Great atmosphere- Love to detail regarding historical costumes.- Senseless meta story- Repetitive elements- Nice puzzle minigames entering terminals. Though to a lesser extent than the previous episodes had.- As with the other parts: Too many collectibles, simply to inflate playtime.What improved:- Naval battles are fun and intuitive, capturing an enemy's vessel is great.- Key bindings for PC players make more sense and are easier compared to AC1 & 2.- The shanty catching quests are a worthy replacement for the race ontop of the roofs parcour challenges.What got worse:- Berserk darts are simply game-breaking due to their long range. The poison syringe in AC2 already made things a lot easier, but this is an overkill. Besides, the animations are far more boring and it makes no sense that someone on a berserk dart kills the own people but spares civis. Was much more fun in AC2.- Second point is the new climbing system, which might have been introduced together with AC3: It is beautiful, if you can leap seemlessly from branch to branch in the forests, but the same mechanics let you clinch on every corner or jump ontop of treasure chests, you simply wanted to open up. This was always a problem but since the parcour part used to be a little harder w/o this change, that glitch didn't happen that often before.- The corruption of statistical information, aka ""progress tracker"". Now even subquests are added to the main story's tracker and some values like collectibles are counted double (as ""location"" and as ""side activity"")! This slows the progress increase down for a looong time.- Ok, eavesdropping events are a staple of the franchise, but this has gone overboard to me with this one. Same goes for the tail-your-man missions. - Skins, impossible to use, because they were rewards of long-gone community challenges? Unbelievable!What I like about this franchise is that real contemporary characters (mere commoners, not just the famous ones) are picked according to their value to the story. So the backstory to these characters is always authentic, like a merchant  turned pirate or a nun opening up a brothel in Renaissance Italy.The story is the same since part 1 though and quite incoherent this time. These contemporary characters are rather thrown in than fitted in nicely: Ok, the barmaid turns pirate for the looks of it, but Adewale complaining about searching for a fairy tale castle, though he should be most appreciative of the whole crew, being an assassin?Outfits which contain stat boosts are meh, if I can't choose them and simply add the boost. Most of the time, the puffy native Indian outfit is the most useful, which is sad indeed.The rope darts are given for the last 20% of the main story and nobody knows why, since there is anyway enough to make this game far easier than the previous parts.But what an amazing game this could have been, if the marketing department had less of a say in it!The real meta story of the game, which was well fit in between all the character information is the battle between devs and marketing department which was added as some ironic side twist in a form of managerial comments: ""Should we mention slavery? People want to hear postive stuff..."" - This picking on stupid marketing department phrases makes this game really worthwhile - besides it is an enjoyable but repetitive game. If it wasn't for the nice Caribbean environment and the cool navy battles, this part would be worse than AC2. "

												Do you like pirates ?Do you like Assassin's Creed ?Well this is probably the game for you. Having said that, the game does not really feel like Assassin's Creed. It is essentially a full-on pirate game.Pros:- good pirate feel- nice visuals and soundtrack- good naval combat and boarding etc.Cons:- the usual FPS issues (fine in parts, but with random drops)- not much Assassin's Creed to itAll in all, I'd recommend it more as a pirate game, if you want Assassin's Creed, go back to AC2 etc.			"

												Hands down the best Assassins Creed in the series. If you played Assassins Creed III and didn't like it, no worries. That game was garbage in comparison.  Even AC2 doesn't have♥♥♥♥♥♥on this. My only issue with this game is that its not optimized that well for PC. Even high end computers seem to have significant frame rate drops. Enjoy the hell of it but don't expect a smooth 60 fps the entire way through. That being said, the graphics are incredible if you have the system to display them. Perfect game for the winter too. If you have seasonal depression, this game is like a portal to the Caribbean.Overall game - 9.5/10I've played and beaten this game three times, and I'm still going to play it again. The gameplay is incredible and the graphics are superb.If you factor in the poor optimization and performance - 9.0/10. You need a pretty solid rig to run this game on Ultra settings.PS. I never touched the multiplayer so don't factor that in to this review.			"

The effects and gameplay, cut scenes and story, graphics and detail, just about everything you look for in a good game is here and ten times over. It is vast and endless and will end up racking up some serious hours on this game. The things you can do on this game are unreal!

												The fourth numbered entry in the Assassin's Creed series that proudly carries all that a title like that entails.  I'll keep this short for people by assuming that those reading know the basics of these games and I'll specifically go over the biggest changes since Assassin's Creed 3.Ship combat has been improved and is a far larger part of the game than previously.  I'm sure that this is assumed since you're a pirate now but the developers outdid themselves and made it an absolute blast.  You can now upgrade pretty much every aspect of your ship several levels by acquiring resources to do so.  How, you ask?  Good old fashioned piracy.  Blast an enemy ship to the point of almost sinking and you can swing aboard for some good old swashbuckling which will net you resources, crew, materials to repair your ship, and even additional ships to do your bidding in the fleet mini-games.  In an abstract sense, I almost felt like I was playing a modern Sid Meier's Pirates when I was sailing about the Caribbean.As per usual in Assassin's Creed, the ancestor's story was great and very engaging but the blasts to the present frequently bored me to tears.   In this game, even moreso than the others, I often wished that AC was composed entirely of the memory sequences instead of any of the Abstergo Entertainment garbage.Edward Kenway, the protagonist and Connor from AC3's grandfather, is an interesting character who I enjoyed playing as.  A drunken pirate with a love of plunder who rides a character arc that ends with him growing as an individual, he fit the atmosphere perfectly and really fit the bill.  The supporting cast was also fantastic and I found that I grew attached to several of the characters over the course of the game.  Each was well written and had an interesting arc of their own in the game's story.I highly recommend this game to fans of the series as well as any who are looking for a good stealth game with fun combat mechanics and/or a great piracy simulator.  The Freedom Cry DLC is also very much worth it on a sale price and will provide several hours of entertainment playing a character that contrasts Edward to the extreme.  Aveline, on the other hand, is enjoyable but very much a demo offering only about half an hour of play.			"

												The Assassin's Creed series was never my type of games. I actually never really all enjoyed the series with the exception of the first.BUT THIS IS AN EFFING PIRATE SIMULATOR (or as close to one as you can get). While the game never takes away the copy paste element of ALL the other Assassin's Creed games, this one has a much more tollerable experience... if you like pirates and simulated games. Black flag has stunning realism in the ocean sailing. There are strangely fun events to partake in and loads of ships to sink, destroy, or board. While you do still do the traditional island hunting, stalking, hawk diving, assasinating of traditional Assasin's Creed games, it's a bit more free roam. Therefore, it will not force you to continue the story line if you just want to kill some whales and blow up ships. Upgrades for your ships, and crafting elements are apparent in this one.I'd say Black Flag is one of the best, top notch Assassin's Creed games released so far. On PC, expect some framerate dips if you aren't running a brand new $1000 rig, but it's not unplayable. Expect some frustrations with controlling your charecter without a controller as well. I'd strongly reccommend a PC controller for this game. It will make movement on land (with all the traditional Assassin's Creed's mechanics) and sailing your ship far easier.None the less, Assassin's fans will have a different viewpoint than myself. As not-so-much a cult follower of the series, to another Assassin's fan, get it. To a non-Assassin's fan like myself, it's worth at least finding a friend that has it to try it. You may be impressed. Perhaps you'll get it on sale, never beat the game, and roam the ocean like I do. I'm pretty pleased with the sailing myself. Then again, I always wanted to be a pirate. RRRGGG!!!4.0/5 for an Assassin's Creed game4.5/5 for a pirate simulatorI'd pay $30 for this game anyday. Not sure if I'd really pay all that much more for it though. Happy sailing!			"

												Black Flag is a bit of an oddity in the Assassin's Creed Franchise. It's difficult to say if it's a good Assassin's Creed game because it is quite a bit different, both thematically and mechanically, than it's predecessors. Fortunately this is actually very good thing in a franchise that has seen a bit of a decline in terms of quality over the years. At the very least, I will say that this is the best pirate themed game that I've ever played, as well as one of my favourite games flat out. First things first, this game just oozes atmosphere. The locations you get to visit are all interesting aesthetically as well as being quite varied from one another. There's a pirate cove full of debauchary and friends, there's English and Spanish colonies, independant islands and small stretches of land barely big enough to walk on. The great design choice is the fact that you don't spend the game in a couple of cities, you spend it exploring. The journey between all of the story specific islands and landmasses is genuinely entertaining because the world is a such a joy to explore. It's not just a case of the graphics being good (which they certainly are), it's the fact that the world is very nicely crafted and a lot of detail has been added in.The way in which you move through the world is twofold, you sail around the world in your ship, or you leave the ship and wander about doing the various story and side missions scattered around the world. You are somewhat stopped from simply going wherever you want by the game placing much more difficult to defeat ships in some of the locations you are meant to visit later on in the game. Theoretically you could just take these down, but it's more likely you would get absolutely trashed. I won't complain about this as an artificial way of stopping you from doing whatever you please, because it makes sense from a narritive point of view: the bigger ships protect the more lucrative trade routes and areas.The absolute best part of this game however is undoubtedly the ship itself. The Jackdaw. Your home for the game and where the real pirating is done. After a brief period of adjusting to the controls of the ship it becomes second nature to be behind it's wheel. The game is just oozing in theme, and the ship is no exception. Your trusty crew will sing sea shanties as you sail around and you'll soon find your favourite ones and have them memorised. Upgrading the Jackdaw over time is an entertaining distraction and once you reach the upper echelons of the upgrade tree you'll really notice the difference in power. You can customise aspects of it, such as the prow, the sails and the interior to your liking. The ship combat is very robust and I didn't find myself bored of raiding other ships even towards the end of my playthrough. You sometimes find yourself in combat with two or even three larger ships and the hectic nature of battles in the high seas really shines through. It's especially satisfying blasting a full broadside and watching another ship begin to sink. Of course, this is a pirate game, so after weakening an enemy ship you have the option to board it, during which you will engage the enemy in hand to hand combat. As as assassin you will always have the upper hand in the melee, but your crew will be helping you out as well. One of my few complaints about the game is that boarding can become quite tedious. You are expected to kill a certain amount of the enemy ship's crew before they surrender their cargo, but on the bigger ships this often ends up being 25 kills. When you're already fighting multiple ships and you have to do this two or three times, it can become somewhat irritating.Upon capturing enemy ships you have 3 options, patch up your own ship, reduce your wanted level or add them to your own fleet. Your wanted level increases the more ships you loot or sink in a short period of time, and progressively stronger bounty hunters will head your way, actively seeking you out wherever you happen to be with the intention of taking you out. It's pretty easy to reduce but it's a cool little mechanic.As for sending ships to your own fleet, this game introduces a little minigame where you can send your own fleet of ships on missions to earn you resources which can be used to upgrade your own ships. It takes a little while to get used to but it can be a fun distraction, though I wouldn't say it's really necessary to do, perhaps just a time saver if you really want rarer resources quicker. If I was being cynical, it feels like ubisoft wanted this to be a game you play all the time, because the bigger missions take 9 hours (real time, not playtime) to complete, which is a bit ridiculous if you're like me and marathon games. That being said, I did have fun with the fleet system, and capturing bigger ships to add to your fleet is a nice distraction.The story follows Edward Kenway's progression from pirate to assassin, with some interesting characters along the way, such as Blackbeard and Mary Read. At the same time it does continue the story from the previous games.  Of course, this is another story of the battle between assassins and templars, but I actually felt motivated to do a lot of the missions because I was doing them for other pirates. I feel like Edward's motivation to become an asssassin is credible and believable, as he learns various lessons throughout his journey in the game that convinces him he needs to follow a better path. The story overall is fun, if a little short. I feel like how much you care about the story would affect your enjoyment of the game somewhat. I didn't really care too much about the assassin/templar thing, but it drew me in towards the end of the game. You are using an animus throughout the game, with the motivation being that you are working for a company trying to make a pirate game using the memories of Kenway. This takes place in the offices of Abstergo, and you're able to wander about the offices to find some nice tidbids and story pieces from the previous games. There's a really cool twist at the end as well. If you blast through the main story, it probably won't take you very long, but if you're like me and you mix in the main story with exploring, you can greately extend the amount of time you play.There's some cool little things to do on the side. Hunting is one of the standout features, in particular hunting whales and other large sea creatures. Unfortunately, without properly upgrading your harpoon it's very hard to actually catch any of them. You can use the pelts/materials of the animals you hunt for gear and to upgrade Edward's abilities as well. You can use treasure maps to find hidden booty, find pieces of sheet music to add to your list of sea shanties and various other distractions. My favourite part is that you can go underwater in a diving bell and feel the fear of hiding from sharks while you look for treasure.The biggest problem is that you have to use Uplay, which is third party DRM within the DRM which is steam already. Thankfully I had no issues with this, but a lot of people have had very negative experiences with it. Finally, I feel I have to talk about the musical score. The music really is incredible at capturing the atmosphere of the game, and there are some truly memorable pieces which I still listen to from time to time. The sea shanties are excellently done and make you feel like you're really part of the crew. Overall, this game is amazing. It's almost a shame that's it's an assassin's creed game, because at times I felt like it could have been something much more if it wasn't shackled into the franchise, with certain expectations and necessities being in the game. The feeling of freedom and joy sailing around the map is an unforgettable experience for me and I can't recommend this game enough. Perhaps it's not the Assassin's Creed you're used to, but I feel like that's a really good thing.			"

												Black Flag is an excellent open-world adventure with a likeable protagonist. It is a comprehensive improvement over its lacklustre predecessor - Assassin’s Creed 3.  There are plenty of interesting side tasks to keep you busy for dozens of hours. The ship combat remains satisfying for just as long and ship upgrades feel worthwhile. While the campaign has a few poor eavesdropping missions, they are offset by quality, varied content. You can spend your time finding buried treasure, whale hunting, ship-wreck diving, plundering convoys or basic assassinations. The Caribbean setting is the perfect change for the franchise and the engine produces a sublime atmosphere. AC4 is a truly impressive Pirate experience without the unpleasantness of Scurvy or Dysentery.			"

												This is the first review that I have to start with the classic ""I wish there was a neutral rating button"" line.Let's start with the positive: The game looks really nice, the areas are beautiful, the music is nice, so are the Shanties. If you liked the naval battle in AC III, you will love it here, it is a lot of fun, especially once you upgrade your ship. Sailing on the ocean in the Jackdaw with your crew singing... just very immersive and looks awesome.Also, even though there are some pirate-clichés, the game is surprisingly accurate when it comes to the development of the whole pirate-scene in the carribean. I recently read two books about it (it almost seems as if the story-writer here read at least one of them), and they kinda show you how it all came to be, where those pirates came from. So not as many clichés with peglegs, parrots on the shoulder, eyepatch and yaarrr. However, I wish they had put this out as a standalone pirate-game, not a part of the AC-franchise. Either they tried to attract more people who are into pirates, and so many apparently are, or they really tried to really mix things up, really try to change the scenery big time in order to reinvigorate the franchise.***Slight story spoilers ahead*** IMO, it does not work. So here we have a greedy pirate, who often enough acts like a jerk, who gets marooned with an assassin. He kills that assassin with surprising ease, puts on a clothes, suddenly knows how to use eagle view, and tadaa, new protagonist for AC4. It doesn't work for me. I was like ""What, that's it? He steals this guys clothes and weapons and now suddenly has assassin abilities""?Edward's main motivation is greed. People complained about a rather stoic Connor or how Shay in Rogue betrays the assassins and becomes a templar. Here we have a guy who mainly cares for gold. How is that for a sympathetic hero? I know that eventually, he realizes there are other things, but how many hours into the game is that? EVen Shay, who betrays the Assassins, has more honorable intentions as he wants to stop the assassins from dealing with things much too powerful after thousands of people died.I get that people love the pirate side of things, and if this was just a pirate game, I'd give it a big thumbs up as one of the nicest pirate games. But do people really say ""Man, I love this franchise with this ancient order of highly trained assassins and their everlasting fight against templars. Now, the new assassin is a greedy pirate who stabs an assassin, and we'll drink rum, sink ships and be a pirate and assassin?""Sure, lots of people LOVE pirates, and I guess many waited for another good pirate game, so I am sure for many, an AC with pirates was perfect. However, I care mostly about the assassins, characters, storyline, historic settings, and in that regard, to me, BF is not a good entry. Innovation is good, especially since the series ran out of ideas lately, but to simply blend the franchise with a safe bet theme (pirates. What's next? Wild West?) doesn't work IMOIt just doesn't work for me personally, I am sorry, even though I am happy for those who actually consider this the best AC. Now, while the devs put in a lot of changes (like the diving, shanties, the new blowpipe which you shoot berserk- and sleep-darts with, new mechanics to naval battles, the fleet etc), they also apparently ran out of time or ideas regarding the main missions. The amount of tailing and eavesdropping here is frustatingly horrible. At some point, I quit playing because I couldn't STAND YET ANOTHER eavesdropping mission. You start a mission (or templar hunt), sneak up on someone and tail him, having to stay out of sight, not aggro guards, not getting to close, or eavesdrop for quite some time.If this would have happened like, 3-4 times in the game, it might have been fun even. But the amount of these quests here is silly. I just tried to get back into the game after  a long break, started the next mission, and guess what? Another tailing one. Afterwards, I started a templar hunt in town, and guess what? Eavesdrop. It wouldn't even be as bad if the hiding and parcouring would be more precise. The game still suffers from some control flaws... not as bad as they sometimes where in AC2, but it's less ""safe"" than in, say, Unity or Syndicate. I have played every AC so far, and yes, misjumps and mistakes happen. But they happen WAY less in those newer games. If you are supposed to totally stay out of sight and follow a pretty strict route set up by the devs (for some of the eavesdrops), it only works if the controls are really tight. They often are, but still, sometimes it doesn't work.Same for combat. I played Rogue in between, and blocking in that game was much more precise than it is in BF. Optional content? Of course, you have a metric ton of that in game, just like in most other Ubisoft games. However, it's not so optional. I disliked the diving with the overly aggressive sharks. However, at some point, you can't continue the storyline if you haven't upgraded your ship enough. Only way to do that is with blueprints eventually which you get from underwater shipwrecks. So if you dislike the diving, get ready to do some more. Even if Rogue has more of a polarizing setup (Assassin goes templar) and might look more bland (icebergs, snow, polar-like areas), and is VERY similar to BF, it did many things better. Taking over forts actually makes more sense (more profit), blueprints are hidden in wrecks on land, so jump-puzzles rather than diving. In Rogue, you also can skip the fleet-combat (minigame with your fleet), at the risk of losing a ship or two. The fleet-battles in BF cant be skipped, and even though they might be fun at first in a FB-game type way, it actually gets dull. So, here is my verdict:+ Great pirate game (- ...unfortunately, it's an AC game)+ Naval battles are fun+ Beautiful zones+ Lots of things to do+ Nice touch with the history of pirates- Jerky main character which to me is much less likeable than even Arno, Shay or Connor- Edward at first seemed like a sneaky attempt to copy Jack Sparrow. Boy, was i wrong. Wait until you meet the guy who temporarily maroons you on an island later on. It's ridiculous how much they ripped Sparrow here.- Diving IMO sucks- Diving is kinda mandatory for blueprints- Controls not as precise as they should be- While lots of things were innovated... the amount of tailing and eavesdropping is simply ridiculous, same with some of the chases.- Fleet is nice for income etc, but eventually, it takes too long, wish you could skip to the results like in Rogue.I get why people love this, but to me, it's not very AC-like. Assassins and pirates is a stretch, but the way Edward is introduced is ridiculous. Even if Rogue is considered ""BF V2"", because it's so similar, and even though its story might not be for everyone, it did MANY things better than BF. I personally rate this above Syndicate and Liberation, but below Unity, Rogue, ACII to AC III. If you want a great pirate game, check this out. If you always wanted assassins doing the pirate-thing, enjoy. If you're like me, mixing them doesn't work well, and Edward is pretty much my least favorite assassin. The game has quite a few things going for it, and would normally be a 7, as AC 4 I rate it a 5-6, especially because of the story and overuse of certain mechanics/types of missions. Was torn between thumbs up and down, but as an AC-game, it's not something I recommend after enjoying the other ACs so muchBefore you go ""Dude, 35 hrs in game...thats a good value""... I did restart the game eventually after I first lost interest, and even though I played it a bit, it never was remotely as enjoyable as the previous or later episodes, even though Syndicate was even worse IMO			"

												WOW! there is absolutely no word to describe this game it's just absolutely fantastic. Set during the early 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the story follows notorious pirate Edward Kenway, the grandfather of Assassin's Creed III's protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton, who stumbles upon the conflict that's waged by the Assassins and Templars. Unlike most of the previous games, gameplay elements focus more on ship-based exploration in the open world map, while still also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. Assassin's Creed IV has three new main cities; Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which is currently residing under the Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. Assassin's Creed IV has a much more open world feel, with missions that are very similar to those found in Assassin's Creed, as well as fewer restrictions for you. The world opens up much sooner in the game, as opposed to Assassin's Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give the player freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. You will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages. The world is built to allow you to have much more freedom. Assassin's Creed IV also features 50 other individual locations including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations and underwater shipwrecks to explore, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration.A new aspect in the game is the Jackdaw, the ship that the notorious pirate Edward Kenway captains. The Jackdaw is upgradeable throughout the game, and it is very easily accessible to you when needed. In addition, a new underwater component has also been added. You now have access to a spyglass, which allows for the examination of distant ships, along with all of their cargo and their current strength. Overall I give this game a solid 10/10 it is by far the best Assassin's Creed game I've played. I really recommend this game because I am 100% sure that Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.			"

												Embraced what AC3 did with the ship, Black Flag has good characters (despite a mellow protagonist), a fun open-world structure, and a side mission progression that feels less like checking things off a shopping list and more like slowly taking over the ocean. Modern day story line is shoehorned and feels irrelevant, but otherwise an extremely awesome experience to get lost in.			"

												Had an amazing time with this game. The best Assassin's Creed game after Assassin's Creed 2. The story, albeit slow, is amazing. The combat mechanics has improved. Totaly like the dual cutlass. The main focus is on the sea where you travelled between islands with your ship, the Jackdaw. You can upgrade and customize your ship. Now the secondary objectives only applies to the story mission. You can play on the sea all day long pirating, attacking ships, plundering, harpooning, diving etc. The music is great too, especially the Jackdaw's ""radio"". The Kenway's Fleet minigame is good for extra income and you can play it with your smart devices by installing their app. Multiplayer is awesome as always. It got Game Lab mode which allows you to customize a game. Wolfpack coop mode also got improved.The parts that I don't like is lack of weapons. In this game, you only have cutlass and hidden blade for combat. No small weapons anymore like previous game. But you got pistols, 4 of them which is good.  Assassination missions are same and boring, but the final reward is awesome (pistol sword FTW XD). No more silent ranged assassination since no bow or crossbow. Dunno pirates don't like bows. The main villain didn't get much spotlight and kinda forgettable. Collecting uncharted chests and Animus fragments is a hassle.This game deserve 9/10. Totally worth it.			"

												Total masterpiece! They actually went back to their roots and released an amazing sequel. The way Edward acts and associates with the different orders is total gold. Everything the old games brought they improved on with this one and created a HUGE world to explore. I actually want to explore and do every side quest; unlike in AC3 where it was bland and boring. Edward is a killing machine, dual wielding swords and wrecking guards like the good old days. New hero new game, spot on masterpiece. As someone who hated AC3's version of ship battles I was surprised how much i enjoyed Black Flag's. They expanded on the ship battles: boarding, more guns, and rain mortars to destroy more and more to make your ship stronger. Nothing dragged on or felt out of place. The missions were enjoyable, and I like how they implemented a rating system for feedback on if you hated the mission or if they were well done. Also the addition to salvage underwater wrecks and the environment down there was just beautiful.The only downside I could see is the story isn't as gripping as Ezio's story. It was good, but Ezio's story was just fantastic and untouchable on scales beyond all comparison. Edward is a pirate, he plunders and steals booty that is all he cares about. He mocks the creed and laughs doing it. Although it doesn't hit the level of legend Ezio could hit, Blackbeard and the other pirates are enjoyable to listen to and work with; unlike Connor's story/acquaintances. Overall I give this a solid 8.8/10. Also buy Freedom's Cry DLC, Adewale has a great story, and was a character I loved in the main story.  "

												Possibly the weakest entry in the series to date.  The entire story feels arbitrary and half-told, and the ""climax"" was far from satisfying, leading the end of the game to feel abrupt, as if it ended early to accomodate more DLC.  Issues that have dogged the series have only gotten worse, with ground combat being the worst I have seen yet.  I don't think I've ever played a game where I felt simultaneously more powerful and incredibly weak, but they have managed to somehow pull that off.  It also bears, in my opinion, several strong resemblances to Far Cry 3 while failing to capture any of the uniqueness of that game.  Hunting and scrounging for materials to craft upgrades, weird visions where you're forced to walk really slowly by people from your past as they rage at you, taking over enemy forts to give yourself fast travel locations - fans of the tedious parts of FC3 will be very happy with this title.Despite buying the game in Steam, it plays in Ubisoft's terrible Uplay, which requires a separate account and tracks achievements separately.  Buying a large pack of DLC here on Steam therefore requires manually copy/pasting each individual code over into Uplay, which is cumbersome and unnecessary.  My playthrough was also plagued with lost savegames, which a quick search shows has been an issue known to Ubisoft for several months and has received no attention, resulting in the loss of about two dozen hours of playtime.  Despite Uplay's ""always on"" cloud syncing of savegames, I was able to lose entire sessions with no real warning on multiple occasions.  Ubisoft forum denizens offer a workaround for this issue in the form of a batch file to back up your savegames (I did not try this), but the fact that Ubisoft has failed to resolve this issue several months after a botched launch reflects extremely poorly on their further involvement in the title.  Gone is the ability to recruit new assassins, replaced by the ability to create a trading fleet managed in a minigame instead (The less said about this new minigame the better).  I suppose this is due to the fact that Edward isn't actually an assassin until the end of the game, and while he occasionally works with them his ends seem mostly at odds with theirs throughout the game.  In the plus column - this game is gorgeous and there is no way to overstate that.  Every sightline falls on something just beatifully done.  This game also has some of the great jumping and climbing puzzles that has made the series great, and collectibles are very liberally sprinkled all over the place, which made for a lot of fun until I lost an entire day of collecting due to a savegame corruption as mentioned above.The overall impression I felt while playing was less like I was playing AC4, and more like I was playing a reskinned AC3.

												Bought it in the Lunar Sale.Found it impossible to play because of Uplay and the ""no internet connection"" bug. A word from someone waiting on a refund from Steam, I'm told Black Flag is the best Assassins Creed game to date but I can't recommend a game a third party program like Uplay governs.Uplay: 0/10Assassins Creed Black Flag: ?/10Edit due to comments:I had tried troobleshooting various recommended ways including clean installing Uplay from the Uplay website, still no luck. Luckily I was smart enough to close the Steam Uplay launcher, if I hadn't Steam would have taken the launcher being open as me playing Black Flag and I would never have gotten my refund.			"

												It's one of those strange things, I really enjoy sailing, ship battles and upgrading the ship but the missions are AWFUL. It's the same thing over and over, follow someone as they loop around the city, get spotted once and you restart. I come back to assassin's creed games hoping they have come up with something new, something unique in the missions but they haven't. If they only spent as much time on the core game as they did on the ships, physics etc... It's a horrible game with a decent candy coating... A candy coated turd.			"

Edward Kenways roll and personality tends to be more appealing than conners in AC3. Fun ship battles and a great story to follow with plenty of things to do on land and sea. The Diving missions are beautiful and and great addition to the game play. so go check it out.			"

Posted: January 12, 2014
												First of all, if you read my rantview of AC3, you know a lot of what I thought was wrong about it.This game basically fixed all of that. It's a much more logical progression of the series than AC3's ""here's a bunch of half-baked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that doesn't matter and will be used as a one-off that we don't ever ♥♥♥♥ing explain"". There's actually a reason to do things, and -- holy shitballs -- those things are actually ♥♥♥♥ing explained.I know that Ubi has different teams working on AC. This is the A team's game. The B team made AC3, and ♥♥♥♥ me does it show. This game is everything AC3 should have been, plus it has ♥♥♥♥ing shanties. SHANTIES. SHANTIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.Yes, you're a pirate. Yes, you get a ship. Yes, it's fun to board other ships, steal them, send them to your fleet, etc. Yes, you get to run around stabbing mens from the rooftop. Yes, there's still a modern-day storyline included for no particular reason other than to make you really, really appreciate the REAL game. But shanties are the most important thing in this ♥♥♥♥ing game. There are other things to collect, sure, but SHANTIES. Shanties are to 18th century sailing (AND PIRATES) what ♥♥♥♥ing shooting things is to video games. Inseparable. Natural. Right. SHANTIES.Seriously, though, the shanties are AWESOME and since you spend so much time sailing around the Caribbean you might as well listen to them. If you don't collect all the shanties you are a bad pirate and I don't like you, but you will also get REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING TIRED of hearing the same handful of shanties over and over again. Collect the shanties both to be the piratey-est pirate that ever pirated things, and to save yourself from hearing Sally Brown about 50,000 times. Shanties.Beyond SHANTIES, there's actually a good game here. There's hunting, but it's not the stupid, unexplained and utterly useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that it was in AC3. Bonus: it's optional. You can buy the skins needed if you don't want to sail to bumble♥♥♥♥ nowhere to get two monkey hides for whatever the ♥♥♥♥ upgrade you're looking at, when you're just sitting on a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing money. (See, AC3? This♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't hard, you ♥♥♥♥ing waste. Now go back in the ♥♥♥♥ing corner so I can continue pretending that you don't ♥♥♥♥ing exist.)The ship stuff is pretty awesome. The controls are a refined version of what was in AC3, except now there's actually a ♥♥♥♥ing reason to sail the ♥♥♥♥ing ship, unlike ""Assassin's Creed Seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ developed this? A room full of syphilitic monkeys? 3"". You get a crazy armament, as well. The Jackdaw (that's your baby) has to be the heaviest-armed brig in the ♥♥♥♥ing world. You get not just your broadsides (which can ultimately be upgraded to have 23 guns per side), but also mortars, fire barrels, and a ♥♥♥♥ing ram. That's right, you can ♥♥♥♥ing ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then rock out like it's the 3rd century BC. By game's end, your little ship is taking out ♥♥♥♥ing full-sized warships that quite literally dwarf you as if it's no big deal. Such is the power of the shanty. Did I mention you can make it pretty? You can make it pretty. Then you can ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s some more, while being pretty.The only real downside to the ship game is that eventually most of the challenge goes out of it. You can throw money at most of the ship upgrades, but the upper-tier ones are all locked behind a need to find plans scattered throughout the world. Some are found in buried treasure chests -- because what would a pirate game be without buried treasure -- while some come from exploring sunken wrecks. The wreck stuff is, honestly, kind of tedious and occasionally annoying. ♥♥♥♥ sharks, that's all I'm going to say. It's not impossible, and it's not outright bad (*coughAC3huntingcough*), but there's not a hell of a lot to it. The only real variation in the sunken stuff is that you occasionally find a smuggler's cove and then you have to Batman the ♥♥♥♥ out of the bad men in there, because you don't have your full armament. That stuff is pretty cool.Anyway, back to the ship. Once you gather enough cash, resources (cloth/wood/metal, gained primarily from capturing prizes on the open waves), and plans, your little ship becomes an unstoppable juggernaut that ♥♥♥♥♥ all over every ship on the sea regardless of size or apparent strength. The one exception to this is the ""legendary"" ships, which are firmly optional. They offer big rewards, but by the time you're strong enough to actually take them on the rewards are utterly meaningless. They exist primarily for bragging rights, and you have to approach each with a particular strategy, so at least there's more depth to them than the standard ""poop out doom at the ship until you can board it, then repeat"" nature of the naval game later on.As a quick aside, it's really ♥♥♥♥ing weird that when you stop to board a ship every other hostile ship just stops attacking you and sort of stands by to watch. Understandable from a gameplay standpoint, but still very odd; doubly so when you realize that you can cripple a ship, wait until you're severely damaged, run back to the crippled ship to board and capture her and then use her to repair your ship back to fighting shape WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE. It's strange and unrealistic, but I'll give it to them because, hey, at least it's not AC3 (no, I'm not going to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on AC3 -- ever).The story is what it is. I won't spoil anything, other than to say that the protagonist is actually enjoyable and not a huge ♥♥♥♥ing whiny, irrational and wooden ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that anyone with a ♥♥♥♥ing brain would've simply dragged out back and shot in the ♥♥♥♥ing face to save the human race from having to deal with him. Edward is awesome, although his character development, if you don't pay attention to the dates, can seem really oddly paced. Edward is a pirate's pirate. Even the way that he gets involved with the Assassins is awesome, and the completely unnecessary and stupid hours-long intro of AC3 is nowhere to be found. You get some short backstory, then it's PIRATE TIME with PIRATEY PIRATE THE PIRATE as your protagonist. He even ends up seeming human and rational, if self-centered. Dude's a pirate.All in all, definitely worth your time. Incidentally, the first real DLC, Freedom Cry, is also pretty damned good. Not exactly the longest thing, but you get to play as Kenway's quatermaster (read: first mate), Adewale, and he uses a ♥♥♥♥ing machete while running about stabbing men. A machete. There's a kill animation where he hacks it into a man's knee and then LEAVES IT THERE while he punches him in the face. So yeah, worth it if you like the main game, but not terribly long (which is probably a good thing, to be honest).			"

												I think its fair to say I recommend this game as not only has it entered my top 5 games ever, it has a good claim on being the best game I've ever played!  It’s a phenomenally rich and detailed pirate sandbox which takes the typical Assassin's Creed formula (of which I am a fan) but adds a twist.Edward is a different kind of protagonist for this series.  He's instantly likable as a rogue looking to further his own ends.  But there is depth to the man.  He has a conscience and watching him grow as a character makes for a compelling story.Technically I’m amazed by what the developers have managed to do.  The seamless transition between captaining a ship to the traditional Assassin's Creed free-running is incredible.  The simulation of the sea is a marvel as the rolling waves, the wind and storms look and feel amazing.  Make no mistake, if you have the rig to run it this game looks absolutely beautiful.There is so much to see and do in this game its almost impossible to get bored, there is such a vast area to explore.  As of right now I think I've clocked 30 hours and I’m just under a third the way through the game.			"

Doing the dives gives me pretty big anxiety though; the sea creatures really freaking me out!All in all, I love this game. I never usually buy games when they're new and $60 and I'm so glad I took the risk and got this game. TOTALLY worth the time I've put into it so far, and the money I spent!

												The 4th memory line of the Assassin's Creed storyline. I'll be writing this review without any or very little spoilers and for single player only. i am not much of a multiplayer personFirst off i just finished getting 100% in the main storyline and for the dlc with it and i must say, it was well thought and a very enjoyable experience. Story 9/10Replayability 7/10graphics 8/10Sounds 9/10What can i start with. You play edward kenway, A man looking for a way to be famous with a lot of coin to his name. You follow his adventure and how he helps change history as we know in the other franchise games. The story mission were maybe only a quarter of the time i spent playing the game and the rest was having fun sailing the seas with a boat you get very early in the game which you can upgrade with resources you find along the way, finding treasures and searching the entire world with the crew. It reminded me of the days of playing legend of zelda windwaker if you have played that youll understand completly what its like out on sea.Would i recommend this game. Absoutely. 100% Good story good sailing and good sights to see.If you like the franchise, it may not be these best of the series but it is one of the top ones hands down "

												This game is the surprise of the year for me. I started to lose interest in the AC series pretty quickly after AC2 which was my favorite in the series, until now. I knew nothing about this game other than the pirate theme, and I had no real interest in playing it, but damn am I glad I got the chance to try it out. This game is INCREDIBLY fun, more so than I ever would have thought. I honestly haven't been this engrossed in a video game in a quite a long time. Not to mention it's absolutely gorgeous looking. You would be doing a disservice to yourself to pass this one by...I almost did. Just play the damn game, you will enjoy the hell out of it. YARRRRRRRR!			"

I didn't even get the game expecting to like this, but I love it.-Variety of items and weapons-diving missions are funCons-Many abilities/finishers were removed that were in Assassin's Creed 3.  This game is better, so I'm not sure why it removed portions of combat.-The game seems blurry/foggy on all settings.  Hard to describe-YOU CAN'T SWIM UNDERWATER OUTSIDE OF DIVING MISSIONS.  WHAT KIND OF PIRATE GAME IS THIS?I love the game, but it has some unfortunate limitations.  Still one of the best AC games.			"

												When I played Assassin's Creed 3 I said to myself, ""I hope they make a whole game centered around this amazing naval combat "".  When Black Flag was announced my excitement and anticipation was highly optimistic.  After playing Black Flag I can honestly say it's by far my favorite Assassin's Creed title, and quite possibly the best game of the entire series.Ubisoft has hit every nail squarely with their design decisions for AC4, starting with a new badass main character that rivals the charm, toughness, and intriguing story of the Ezio era.  The Connor character from AC3 was likable in few ways compared to Kenway.The naval system and combat was improved and given a much larger focus in AC4, as to be expected in a game about pirates.  The vast scale of the map will blow you away the first time you zoom out to find your location, and realize how large this open world is.  Once I took to the seas I immediately found myself unable to stop playing.  The atmosphere is amazing.  Storm clouds rolling, whales jumping, ships sailing and battling each other, all while your crew sings the most catchy shanties that will have you singing along.  I seriously loved just casually sailing looking for collectables while listening to my crew sing.Speaking of collectables they introduced a perfect pirates tie in for collection quests in the form of actual treasure maps.  The maps would give you a general coordinate to search, but to find the treasure you'll have to study the map and your surroundings looking for landmarks to find the X that marks the spot.  Other collectables included animus fragments, sea shanties lyrics, messages in bottles, and money chests.  These aren't hidden collectables, but they are scattered all over the open world and add more story for those completion fans.Now, it wouldn't be an AC game without assassination missions.  While the games best moments occur on the seas, it's by no means saying the assassin parts are bad.  They are quite excellent.  Granted the games combat mechanics have not changed or evolved much since it's inception, but that's not a bad thing entirely.  They simply want to stick with what works, and are not trying to reinvent the wheel of the AC franchise.   The assassin segments do a great job of adding variety to the environments spanning huge Caribbean cities,  jungle villages, island fishing towns, and underwater caves.The one definitive thing about Black Flag is you'll never be without something cool to see or do.  I didn't even mention multiplayer yet, which is still the same solid game it's been since Revelations.  My only complaint about Black Flag was they couldn't give a us Pirate Ship multiplayer battle mode.   All I can say is, ""I hope they make a whole multiplayer game centered around this amazing naval combat ""			"

												When I finished with the disappointing Assassin's Creed III I vowed that the only thing that could get me to buy the next one is if they made it almost entirely naval battles. Looks like Ubisoft was listening. I'm very happy to say that Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag may be my favorite Assassin's Creed game of all time. It is certainly the one I have spent the most time playing, at almost 60 hours. It's competition is of course Assassin's Creed II, which had a great cast of characters and a story that spanned several decades. Black Flag's story is not as strong, but there are plenty of great characters and tons of open-world activities to entertain you in the meantime. It also doesn't hurt that pirates were one of my minor childhood obsessions.The key to including side activities in a game is to make them enjoyable. Black Flag succeeds so well in that area that I focused most of my time plundering ships, taking over forts, and doing assassin contracts rather than advancing the story missions. This lead to several amusing moments where I played story missions clearly intended to teach me how to do a side activity (take over a fort, for example), only I had already done that activity several times on my own. Some side activities are better than others; attacking and boarding ships never really gets old, but I only hunted when I absolutely needed a particular pelt to craft a piece of equipment.The downside to making an ambitious open-world game like this is that it may have been a little too much for the developers to handle. There were numerous times when my movement would be impeded by invisible obstacles, and there were occasional objects getting stuck inside walls. None of this was a game breaker, but it is something you notice. My favorite was in a scene where Blackbeard was being very menacing, very serious, and then a bug changed the tone of the whole scene.


YouTube™ Video: Kenway's Bandana Mishap 

			Views: 22		

			Blackbeard was having such a good, intense, intimidating scene when Kenway shows up and changes the whole tone with a wardrobe malfunction.		

If you play Black Flag simply for the story, you probably won't think it is an amazing game. It's biggest problem is that it lacks direction. It tried at the end to bring everything together with a fairly emotional scene in which Edward reflected on all the people he had lost on the way, but it didn't feel like enough. The real magic happens while you are just having fun sailing around, fighting royal convoys and pirate hunters, getting caught in storms, and listening to your crew sing sea shanties. Speaking of which, the soundtrack is once again wonderful, and it keeps getting stuck in my head while I am away from the game.I have read a lot of people complaining about the modern-day story that the game advances every once in a while. I didn't mind, but I think that may have to do with my unique perspective: I'm a computer science student, and Abstergo Entertainment is somewhere I could totally see myself working at in a couple of years. I enjoyed just walking around looking at all the nice equipment they have.Visually Black Flag is a beauty. My biggest complaint about Assassin's Creed III's graphics was the resolution of their textures, and that problem has definitely been fixed. I suspect that the new generation of consoles had to do with that.Assassin's Creed is the only annual franchise that I have been able to get behind, and I think the key is variation. The unifying element is freerunning, but there have been many twists and additions to it that help keep each game feeling fresh. Couple that with the fact that there are many different settings for them to choose from, and I predict that this series will continue on for quite a while.$60 is definitely a reasonable price for this game, and I also feel comfortable recommending it as a jumping-in point to the series for those of you who have missed out on it until now.

												An Assassin's Creed game with barely any references to the sempiternal Templars vs Assassins conflict, instead focusing on piracy and exploring the Caribbean.Pros* Naval battles are quite fun and refreshing!* Ubisoft is slowly learning how to polish the gameplay* The theme of the story is surprisingly-strong and focused compared to the other games of the series, and that's not even including the meta commentary on the video game industryCons* Too much reliance on old Assassin's Creed staples like tailing missions and poorly-scripted stealth* Very unoptimized PC portIt's a bit annoying when you already know from older games how everything will eventually end for poor Edward, but in the meantime, what a cool protagonist to follow.

												8.5/10Finally finished this game, after being behind in the series for years, and then restarting after getting half way through the game, due to needing to factory reset my computer.Pros:Great character developmentHuge (at least compared to the other AC games) world to exploreTons of side questsShip battles are pretty fun (and pretty intense, when you get 3-4 frigates and a couple man o wars on you)Crafting system was okay, and it made you have to go out and hunt to be able to craftHunting was alright, harpoon hunting was pretty fun (although the trajectory of the harpoon was a little weird at times)Cons:Characters that I really liked died... :cries:Ship trading route things, while good at making money, were insanely boring and annoyingAlthough I didn't do every side quest, the game seemed a bit shorter than the othersEvery once in a while, even though ive done an objective for a main mission, it wouldn't register, and I'd have to reload from my last checkpointSlightly repetitive, like all the other AC games (although not quite as repetive as the others)To get a full sync on your memories, you have to do certain things. to my knowledge, there's no way to see what those things are, unless you by chance do it without noticing, and then see the little progress box come up (about half of my memories are only 80% sync because of this)Funny bug I found:If you jump from the top of a windmill, onto one of the rotating fin things while its coming up, it shoots you about 100 feet in the air, and then kills you when you fall to the ground. I'm almost ashamed to say I did it for a solid 20 minutes, because it was funny. "

												New edits:This, for me, is ts the BEST Assasins Creed Game I've ever played, hands down.Combat, game play, game length and the story transition smoothly into the next, and the room for character development and upgrades in this massive open world experience is plenty.Notes:Graphics: Sleek and beautiful. Most issues you'll encounter have been solved in online forums, so do your homework. Of mention is PhysX. Disable that, even if you have an NVIDIA GPU. It has noticeable memory leaks and degrades game performance substantially, and the effects it enables are very minimal. Again, your mileage may vary.Story:The most epic part of the game, if I may confess. The characters are well developed, and it highlights key cultural notes of the height of piracy in the West indies and the figures of that time (Mary Read , Anne Bony, Black Beard, Calico Jack, etc) and the tumultous events of that period (such as the Maroon uprising, the execution of Calico Jack, the deaths of Mary Read and Black Beard and the role of piracy in shaping up the eventual collapse of  the Pirate republic). All in all, we see the main protagonist, Edward Kenway, grow up from  a rash seafarer to an experienced, self-centered pirate who found his purpose to his calling with the Assasins' and eventual maturity into a legend after Mary Read's death. This storyline and the many hours you'll spend pirating will keep you going back for more, and to be frank, this is probably the most nostalgic Assasins' Creed game in the franchise.Audio/ Sound work: Excellently done. The music in this game is expertly composed, and the shanties are a timely and welcome addition to the deep, well-crafted in-game environment. Also, quite memorable. The english speakers are quite fluent, and all in all, a high quality recreation of the characters they represent. Gameplay: Reminiscent of Assassins Creed III, the action is split about 60:40 land/sea in missions, and there's a ton of side activities, exploration, assassinations, and naval expeditions to execute in this exhilirating chapter of Assassins Creed. A slight drawback (in my opinion) is that combat , naval expeditions and assassinations feel a bit repetitive compared to the previous Assassins Creed games, and not much innovation has been done to the aging combat system in this franchise. Compared to other free-flow combat games such as Batman Arkham City, this game feels way more immature in that regard, and furtthermore, lowers the game difficulty considerably. A plus on the side is that parkour is flawless, and the emphasis on climbing tall access points for synchronization isn't emphasized much. The side content / DLC:Playing as Adewale in the Freedom Cry DLC adds extra gameplay and a slight variation in equipment (Machete vs dual-wielded cutlasses and a rudimentary shotgun in place of the dual-wielded pistols from the main game) and a new story line covering the previously un-explored Maroon uprising that is hinted at in the main game via the templar hunt missions. This DLC naturally fills in the gap and adds up to a grand climax at its' end. In a manner, it builds up Adewale's character in a light that we see since his departure from the Jackdaw as the quartermaster and models him into a capable liberator and assassin. The element of naval warfare also exists, though with a larger emphasis on liberation and lesser on wanton plunder.Online/ Multiplayer:Self-descriptive. Prepare to spend much of it on land, though. Take hints from the DLCs in that regard. Your mileage may vary, knowing how unreliable Uplay's network connectivity can be. I'm aware console gamers may have a better experience here compared to the PC version.Recommendations: Get the season pass. Playing as Adewale adds several hours of gameplay (for one) and has its' perks.I'lll be playing Assasins Creed for a long time to come.Overall rating: 10/10 , must - own.			"

												If you ever wanted to play a pirate game with a wonderful open world, colorful characters, combat that, while a little repetetive at times, is still somehow enjoyable, a ship that can modified (somewhat). Then this is the game for you.Dont let the Assassins Creed title fool you. Sure, it is in the same universe laid down by the past games (Templars versus Assassins). But at the risk of a slight spoiler, you are neither. You are the privateer turned pirate Edward Kenway. And all your actions in this game, even during interactions with the two main factions in this game are motivated by your typical piratical greed.I dont know how many other ways i can say this. Its a pirate game with some of the conspiracy theory type storyline of AC thrown in for good measure. But mostly the storyline is about piratical matters.Dont play this if you are expecting the next installment of Assassins Creed. Its not.In fact, i feel like the developers of AC at Ubisoft just wanted an excuse for a, well made, pirate game and couldnt quite fit the old storyline into it much, so just added a sprinkle of it. And made the game. You know, what they made is something that i genuinely think is great. If they had focused on semi-historical games that were not Assassins Creed they would still have been great games. This is. Sure it has a few little bugs. What game hasn't?This is a great Pirate game. And most of all, Not too cliched. The pirates in the game are not all: Argh!! and comical. They seem geuinely human, a little amoral at times but still human.			"

												First of all, if you read my rantview of AC3, you know a lot of what I thought was wrong about it.This game basically fixed all of that. It's a much more logical progression of the series than AC3's ""here's a bunch of half-baked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that doesn't matter and will be used as a one-off that we don't ever ♥♥♥♥ing explain"". There's actually a reason to do things, and -- holy shitballs -- those things are actually ♥♥♥♥ing explained.I know that Ubi has different teams working on AC. This is the A team's game. The B team made AC3, and ♥♥♥♥ me does it show. This game is everything AC3 should have been, plus it has ♥♥♥♥ing shanties. SHANTIES. SHANTIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.Yes, you're a pirate. Yes, you get a ship. Yes, it's fun to board other ships, steal them, send them to your fleet, etc. Yes, you get to run around stabbing mens from the rooftop. Yes, there's still a modern-day storyline included for no particular reason other than to make you really, really appreciate the REAL game. But shanties are the most important thing in this ♥♥♥♥ing game. There are other things to collect, sure, but SHANTIES. Shanties are to 18th century sailing (AND PIRATES) what ♥♥♥♥ing shooting things is to video games. Inseparable. Natural. Right. SHANTIES.Seriously, though, the shanties are AWESOME and since you spend so much time sailing around the Caribbean you might as well listen to them. If you don't collect all the shanties you are a bad pirate and I don't like you, but you will also get REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING TIRED of hearing the same handful of shanties over and over again. Collect the shanties both to be the piratey-est pirate that ever pirated things, and to save yourself from hearing Sally Brown about 50,000 times. Shanties.Beyond SHANTIES, there's actually a good game here. There's hunting, but it's not the stupid, unexplained and utterly useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that it was in AC3. Bonus: it's optional. You can buy the skins needed if you don't want to sail to bumble♥♥♥♥ nowhere to get two monkey hides for whatever the ♥♥♥♥ upgrade you're looking at, when you're just sitting on a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing money. (See, AC3? This♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't hard, you ♥♥♥♥ing waste. Now go back in the ♥♥♥♥ing corner so I can continue pretending that you don't ♥♥♥♥ing exist.)The ship stuff is pretty awesome. The controls are a refined version of what was in AC3, except now there's actually a ♥♥♥♥ing reason to sail the ♥♥♥♥ing ship, unlike ""Assassin's Creed Seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ developed this? A room full of syphilitic monkeys? 3"". You get a crazy armament, as well. The Jackdaw (that's your baby) has to be the heaviest-armed brig in the ♥♥♥♥ing world. You get not just your broadsides (which can ultimately be upgraded to have 23 guns per side), but also mortars, fire barrels, and a ♥♥♥♥ing ram. That's right, you can ♥♥♥♥ing ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then rock out like it's the 3rd century BC. By game's end, your little ship is taking out ♥♥♥♥ing full-sized warships that quite literally dwarf you as if it's no big deal. Such is the power of the shanty. Did I mention you can make it pretty? You can make it pretty. Then you can ram ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s some more, while being pretty.The only real downside to the ship game is that eventually most of the challenge goes out of it. You can throw money at most of the ship upgrades, but the upper-tier ones are all locked behind a need to find plans scattered throughout the world. Some are found in buried treasure chests -- because what would a pirate game be without buried treasure -- while some come from exploring sunken wrecks. The wreck stuff is, honestly, kind of tedious and occasionally annoying. ♥♥♥♥ sharks, that's all I'm going to say. It's not impossible, and it's not outright bad (*coughAC3huntingcough*), but there's not a hell of a lot to it. The only real variation in the sunken stuff is that you occasionally find a smuggler's cove and then you have to Batman the ♥♥♥♥ out of the bad men in there, because you don't have your full armament. That stuff is pretty cool.Anyway, back to the ship. Once you gather enough cash, resources (cloth/wood/metal, gained primarily from capturing prizes on the open waves), and plans, your little ship becomes an unstoppable juggernaut that ♥♥♥♥♥ all over every ship on the sea regardless of size or apparent strength. The one exception to this is the ""legendary"" ships, which are firmly optional. They offer big rewards, but by the time you're strong enough to actually take them on the rewards are utterly meaningless. They exist primarily for bragging rights, and you have to approach each with a particular strategy, so at least there's more depth to them than the standard ""poop out doom at the ship until you can board it, then repeat"" nature of the naval game later on.As a quick aside, it's really ♥♥♥♥ing weird that when you stop to board a ship every other hostile ship just stops attacking you and sort of stands by to watch. Understandable from a gameplay standpoint, but still very odd; doubly so when you realize that you can cripple a ship, wait until you're severely damaged, run back to the crippled ship to board and capture her and then use her to repair your ship back to fighting shape WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE. It's strange and unrealistic, but I'll give it to them because, hey, at least it's not AC3 (no, I'm not going to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on AC3 -- ever).The story is what it is. I won't spoil anything, other than to say that the protagonist is actually enjoyable and not a huge ♥♥♥♥ing whiny, irrational and wooden ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that anyone with a ♥♥♥♥ing brain would've simply dragged out back and shot in the ♥♥♥♥ing face to save the human race from having to deal with him. Edward is awesome, although his character development, if you don't pay attention to the dates, can seem really oddly paced. Edward is a pirate's pirate. Even the way that he gets involved with the Assassins is awesome, and the completely unnecessary and stupid hours-long intro of AC3 is nowhere to be found. You get some short backstory, then it's PIRATE TIME with PIRATEY PIRATE THE PIRATE as your protagonist. He even ends up seeming human and rational, if self-centered. Dude's a pirate.All in all, definitely worth your time. Incidentally, the first real DLC, Freedom Cry, is also pretty damned good. Not exactly the longest thing, but you get to play as Kenway's quatermaster (read: first mate), Adewale, and he uses a ♥♥♥♥ing machete while running about stabbing men. A machete. There's a kill animation where he hacks it into a man's knee and then LEAVES IT THERE while he punches him in the face. So yeah, worth it if you like the main game, but not terribly long (which is probably a good thing, to be honest).			"

Edward Kenways roll and personality tends to be more appealing than conners in AC3. Fun ship battles and a great story to follow with plenty of things to do on land and sea. The Diving missions are beautiful and and great addition to the game play. so go check it out.			"

												I think its fair to say I recommend this game as not only has it entered my top 5 games ever, it has a good claim on being the best game I've ever played!  It’s a phenomenally rich and detailed pirate sandbox which takes the typical Assassin's Creed formula (of which I am a fan) but adds a twist.Edward is a different kind of protagonist for this series.  He's instantly likable as a rogue looking to further his own ends.  But there is depth to the man.  He has a conscience and watching him grow as a character makes for a compelling story.Technically I’m amazed by what the developers have managed to do.  The seamless transition between captaining a ship to the traditional Assassin's Creed free-running is incredible.  The simulation of the sea is a marvel as the rolling waves, the wind and storms look and feel amazing.  Make no mistake, if you have the rig to run it this game looks absolutely beautiful.There is so much to see and do in this game its almost impossible to get bored, there is such a vast area to explore.  As of right now I think I've clocked 30 hours and I’m just under a third the way through the game.			"

												I am obsessed with this game! It is huge! There is SO MUCH you can do. It never gets boring or tedious, just due to the crazy amount of activities you can do. Doing the dives gives me pretty big anxiety though; the sea creatures really freaking me out!All in all, I love this game. I never usually buy games when they're new and $60 and I'm so glad I took the risk and got this game. TOTALLY worth the time I've put into it so far, and the money I spent!

												Everybody's already said it, but it bears repeating - the boat stuff in AC: Black Flag is immensely fun. The series gets a lot of flak for stagnation and yearly installments, but you can tell this one was made by people who really wanted to make something new and exciting. Sailing the seas, attacking forts and boarding other ships, finding buried treasure, and listening to your crew sing various shanties as the rising sun burns fog off the water's surface is something that's actually pretty unique in video games. Any complaints I could have about Black Flag are mostly related to some legacy AC stuff. There's about two dozen too many tailing or eavesdropping missions and the controls are slightly improved but still randomly has a bit of that trademark series stiffness. Thankfully, everything involving being a salty sea dog out for the next big score looks, plays, and controls wonderfully. Strongly recommended. Go plunder some booty (and then play this game).			"

												This game is incredible inovative and cre<ative compared to it's predecessors. I played them all and I have to say that Black Flag is a huge improvement in the AC series. It's awfully addicting and there is so much to explore and collect. It's a very clever mix of creativ breath taking content and solid repeating gameplay like seizing other ships, which can be fun for hours. The graphics are still amazing now in 2016 too.All in all I really have nothing to complain about, I had zero problems with U-play and only a few minor bugs (fell threw the  floor once and some quest people were missing sometimes, but nothing which coudln't be fixed easily with a reload or a quick travel)I totally recomend playing this game!

												One of my favourite Assassins Creed games since ACII. The story could be better but hey, anything is better than Unity, Crash Team Racing has a better storyline and Gameplay than AC:Unity. Once you have finished the game you have hours of collectables & forts that we have become used to in other AC titles. The controls for this game are great, combat is the same old counter-based style which i like. The Ship combat is easy to get used to for anyone who has not played ACIII. The free running is solid apart from a few glitches here and there but for me it was a rare occurence.In conclusion this game is worth the £20 I payed for it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to play or have played other AC Games. - 10/10 would play again			"

												Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag ReviewAhoy m8! Ready to sail the Caribbean? Assassins Creed IV lets you do just that. Assassins Creed IV is a large step-up from Assassins Creed III. The naval combat is much improved and sailing around is generally a good time. The graphics are beautiful if your GPU can handle it. They made huge strides to improve ambient life and vegetation, and it really paid off. Everything is an improvement, except one thing. I feel like I was cheated out of land battles and exploration on land. The 3 cities you get are not enough for my type of exploration. Another city would have made this game a 9.9/10 for me. Having said that, I give this game a good 9/10. Solid, compelling, innovative, fresh, and most importantly fun.			"

												As someone who found running over roofs in previous AC games repetitive and boring, I was actually pleasantly suprised with the Black Flag. It's still the same ""busywork"" game we are used to from Ubisoft but the range of activities is so wide that you won't get bored anytime soon. I liked change in the enviroment from just plain cities to wilderness and sea (I haven't played AC3, so I don't know about that), very refreshing. There is so much things to do, ship battles with eventually managing your own fleet, diving to shipwrecks using diving bell, hunting using harpoons and I could go on. Mentioned running across rooftops has been put behind a bit on behalf of these things, so there's just a couple of ""cities"" that are nowhere near the size of AC2 cities. But I didn't mind, didn't really missed them.Graphics is great and runs ok with occasional framerate drops in cities or wilderness (vegetation causes this, I presume). Ubisoft Montreal really managed to make a nice, tropical world in which you could imagine living, which is a sign for me of great work.Story is a bit weak but you'll have fun nontheless.Giving that the pirate theme is not being used much in games, this is one of the best pirate games you can get. I wouldn't hesitate to say even the best.			"

												This game is actually incredible. With the exception of a little bugginess this game is really well put together. It has all the elements of a great game. Fans of the series plus games like X. It takes the original winning formula and adds in this system where you go around in a pirate ship and blow other boats up for supplies to upgrade your boat and make it more awesome so you can blow up even bigger boats. And THEN it adds in this Kenway's Fleet minigame thing where basically after you blow up a boat (mostly) you can add it to your fleet. The missions take like 10 hours in real time (they go when the game isn't running) and you get money from them and they unlock new missions and stuff. It's just awesome. And THEN you get your own island which you can upgrade for better stores and perks around the world. And THEN it unlocks a series of side quests that tie into the main questline where you save assassins or something but it adds them to every city so you can go back and do these side quests that are each like 4 missions in length. It's just great. I don't want to go outside until I finish it basically and that's going to take forever because all I do is sail a boat and blow stuff up instead of doing quests.			"

												After that nasty 'Connor' fiasco... Ubisoft has redeemed themselves a bit with this one. Kenway is 'almost' as cool as Ezio. The gameplay is exceptional. The story continues to have many holes. The battles on and off shore are very violent and gratifying. I've seen better puzzles in games from Ubisoft but these ones still get the job done. The ending was very brief and completely unsatistying. Over all I'd say Ubisoft lost its way with the mystery and intrigue of the story that was present in the game right up til' then end of Ezio's saga. But this game is still entertaining and fun in spite of these ball droppings.			"

												Having played all AC games and having spent about 300 hours in doing so i can say without doubt that this one is the most fun, intriging and exciting above all.Removed from the morality issues of Ezio and all his baggage and the monotony and boredom of connor, black flag gives us Edward a small man with big aspirations. Not being bogged down with the weight of the assassins from day 1 is a refreshing change of pace. and the freedom to hit the seas and have a crack at who ever and whatever crosses your path is great.Hitting locations simply for the hell of it is great also, i spent the first 30 hours just sailing about picking stuff up, going to islands and boarding ships.Also the stealth thing is back, ACBF makes you think about attack plans whilst trying to assault a castle or takedown a target, no more running headlong into a target, hitting him hard, then diving into the sea......no no you need your thinking caps and paitience.All in all i have enjoyed this greatly, and the plot although not quite so grand is facinating, and you feel that you could leave it to explore without making it feel unimportant.Only downside is the whole animus thing, being kicked from your pirate adventures to walk about an office for the ""actual"" story is frustrating. and i feel that the AC games suffer from that.But all in all BRILLIANT "

												At first this game dissapoints being a poorly optimized port from PS3 (judging by those files steam\steamapps\common\Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag\multi\videos\ps3_name.bik) with framedrops in open spaces, which are primary part of the game, and out of sync engine cutscenes - I'd really prefer them prerendered in this case, I wouldn't mind extra GBs. Laptop's HD5400 can't handle them unfortunately (plus 13.4+ driver shuts off display's backlight for reasons unknown), but it handles enclosed sequences, Aveline DLC and multiplayer. It just needs better preferences section - I can't turn off bloom, multiplayer graphic settings don't save at all, MP and SP .exe are separate, but I can't have fancy French voiceover and English voices for SP. PunkBuster service may need some kind of repairing - but it works, I never noticed cheating. It feels like in development game was remade, so software experience was partially forgot so new problems appear.But gameplay is awfully addictive, I just got it for multiplayer but was dragged into pirating, I still played half of it (""one more location/mission and I'm done""). Shanties are amazing! Exploring is interesting even with reused  buildings - settlements look way to similiar. There are activities for any taste, and they feel like one whole thing. Aveline DLC was enjoyable (no learning curve bullcrap there, straight to action)What's best for me is multiplayer, it just keeps improving with every game. Now there's Game Lab for costumizing game modes, Assasinate mode, which encourages stealthiness and caution even more. Wolf Pack is like a missing piece - it's both practicing ground and co-op variant.			"

												This game is actually incredible. With the exception of a little bugginess this game is really well put together. It has all the elements of a great game. Fans of the series plus games like X. It takes the original winning formula and adds in this system where you go around in a pirate ship and blow other boats up for supplies to upgrade your boat and make it more awesome so you can blow up even bigger boats. And THEN it adds in this Kenway's Fleet minigame thing where basically after you blow up a boat (mostly) you can add it to your fleet. The missions take like 10 hours in real time (they go when the game isn't running) and you get money from them and they unlock new missions and stuff. It's just awesome. And THEN you get your own island which you can upgrade for better stores and perks around the world. And THEN it unlocks a series of side quests that tie into the main questline where you save assassins or something but it adds them to every city so you can go back and do these side quests that are each like 4 missions in length.

The gameplay is improved, yet the stealth gameplay is still not great imo. The game really shines in the pirating. They have taken the best elements of character progression from Far cry 3, excellent ship battles and places to conquer. In fact it is such an improvement over the last games, they could really have released this under a different franchise name.Runs well too, no crashes for me. 1600p with msaa, this game looks SWEET!Seriously, buy it.

												After almost 50 hours of gameplay I finally 100% memory synced and the reward wasn't worth it at all.The worst part of the entire thing was doing the mind numbing Uncharted chests/fragments, I can explain it in steps:---100% Uncharted---1.) Start sailing your ship.2.) Open the map and mark a chest/fragment.3.) Sail to the chest/fragment.4.) Jump off your ship.5.) Swim to the island.6.) Climb tree/rock and get your chest/fragment.7.) Swim back to your ship.8.) Climb your ship.Now repeat steps 1~8 76 times until you get all 46 uncharted chests and 30 uncharted fragments.But if you ignore that everything else you do is pretty fun, I enjoyed sailing the ship but the real fun for me was exploring the lush islands on low settings because the game is horribly optimized.Also the ""out of the Animus"" stuff is pretty fun to, I enjoyed the puzzles they gave you for the activities there and you found out some pretty cool stuff.All in all the game just sucked completely.8/10			"

												Heyyo, wow! So much to love and enjoy about this game. It's definitely refreshing how they mixed the ship combat & boarding with the solid Assassin's Creed foundation. It reminds me a bit about the amount of fun I had with Sid Meier's Pirates back in the day which is definitely a good thing. It's definitely my favorite Assassin's Creed game yet.Side missions / activities are pretty good and varied... Deep sea diving, Animal hunting on land and at sea, Assassin Missions, Trader Missions, searching for Mayan puzzle pieces, Templar key hunts... Lots to do.One of my favorite little side activities is collecting ""Shanties"" which is songs the Pirates sing... and each Shanty you collect? Your crew learns a new song! A game where collecting things adds more fun to the game indirectly and in a good way!? Awesome. :POn PC it was optimized incredibly well compared to even Skyrim even with packing more detail on screen. :)The only poor part is the controls when diving underwater and a current carries you... can't spin the camera and know what Edward's skull is about to bounce off of lol... only other control issue? Parcour. The classic controls of Right click enables parcour and Shift increases the running speed is sorely missed here. Sometimes it's hard to tell Edward which way you wish for him to move with just WASD, that and if you're trying to make a tight manuver (ie, Climbing the masts to cut down a Ship's flag) Edward will think you meant leaping somewhere else instead of 90 degree turn and climb the Mast some more. :(Overall? Even with a few control flaws? It's still my favorite Assassin's Creed game to date... Definitely worth the money, especially if it's on sale. :)			"

The graphics are superb, the story and gameplay have only improved over the years.Sadly, the game is poorly optimized, i would only recommend playing this with a powerful computer, unless you enjoy low resolution gaming.

												+ It's Assassin's Creed+ Story is half-decent and makes you think+ Historical sites and people+ Beautiful+ Each island is unique- Takes ages to get to anywhere - takes you like 10min of sailing into nothing to get to a place (of course you have to discover it/take it over before using fast travel). Hopefully you don't have to destroy/avoid ships in the meantime, because that can stretch out up to/over 30min.- A bunch of little things to pick up on little islands, which additionally stretches the game into oblivion. You park the ship right next to the island (hopefully not crashing it) and swim at least 2 min to the island, pick up the thing, and swim 2 min back. I guess it's a good excuse if you want to spend more time in that world - would it be a historical time more up my alley, I would probably enjoy it.- Tedious: tedious fighting, tedious sailing, tedious running around, tedious picking up stuff, tedious getting resources ... I forgot what the story is even about anymore before I get to the next section.- When you give up and log up again half a year later, you can pray that your fingers still know the right buttons, because the keyboard settings will confuse the hell out of you.- Cliches everywhere. James Kidd is in fact a woman called Mary Read - a famous female pirate. No problem with the fact. I have a problem that as soon as James takes his hat off, he transforms into glamorous woman, wearing lipstick and eye-makeup. Even you can do better than that, Ubisoft.- Uplay sometimes decides to erase your save-game as Uplay does (do yourself a favour and download Savegame manager for backups).Overall - the game is good for people who don't have a limited amount of time to spend on it. Me, having about 1day a week to spend on games, rarely decide that this is the game I'm going to spend it on. Simply for the fact, that I can spend 12 hours in the game, and not get anywhere with it.			"

												After playign this game for a while I was able to say that the combat is wonderful from Land to Sea. The way you can use your ship is incredible and the upgrade route is great. Money is actually useful! Yet If you were going to buy  this I would say you shouldn't the reason why is becuase the game is not optimized at all. I have a GTX 960 4GB and a i5 6500 with 8GB of Memory. And all I get is 45fps on the Sea and 20 on land usaully. Not just that but the frame times are so incostent it is sometimes hard just to fight people. So I say No to buying it, unless you don't mind a game stuttering if two seconds.			"

												As much as I wanted to return to this game, I can't.  I have a 980 Ti and play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt at max settings in 1440p 60fps, yet I cannot play this game with medium setting in 1080p without consistently dropping below 30fps and rarely maintaining 60 fps.  Even with everything at lowest I have constant frame issues and lag.  I've tried several solutions, explored all the graphics options, but I've come to the conclusion it's just a weak port that isn't running well with my rig.  I played the game on the Xbox One and never finished it, and I would totally recommend it from my experience, but I can't give a recommendation for a game that won't work for me.  It seems few other people are having issues based on the very positive steam user rating, just leaving this here so that people know that issues may arise.  I will be refunding this as I have had to with my past four Ubisoft purchases because while I don't have issues with other companies generally, Ubisoft I've run into issues with UPlay, stability, or countless other issues.

												Short review: This game is HORRIBLE!Longer review: I am really disappointed with this game as I was really looking forward to this, and when it was released early, I was over the moon! But now I believe that I maybe shouldn't have got so excited for it, as I was let down BIG TIME! Here's why I don't like it:1) The controls are fiddly: There has been a few times when I was in combat and I just didn't have control over Edward. Example, I would be fighting a group of 3-4 guys and when they got in close range, I couldn't move away and couldn't fight back either. Even when you're not in combat, running/climbing all over the environment can be tricky in places! 2) Graphics problems: The graphics are consistantly going weird on me. It becomes totally unplayable. If you want to see what I mean, please feel free to have a look at some screenshot's I've taken. You'll see what I mean! UPDATE: Here are links to the screenshots:


OK. I've had enough of this♥♥♥♥♥♥now! Listen to me when I say that AC4 is CRAP! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

3) Gameplay can be generally frustrating: I must admit, I can't remember if AC has a selectable difficulty as it was a while since I started the game, but I ALWAYS start on easy mode on the first playthrough of every game I buy, just to get the hang of it and then move up after. But I'm still on my first playthrough and can be waaaaay to hard. The number of times I've actually got super angry is unreal. Avoid this game if you have anger issues/prone to high blood pressure. You may just suffer a stroke! Finally, I think it's such a shame. I had really high hopes for this game and really did enjoy it for a little while, and the one good point is that the storyline is pretty good and sucks you in, but knowing what I now know, I really regret buying this now! I know Steam says I'm entitled to only 1 refund, this may just be the one time I exercise that right!Avoid like the plague!			"

												I was about 5 or so hours into the game and I was really enjoying myself. It was around this time I thought it would be a good idea to hunt for different animals so I could get better gear (more pistol capacity, better armor, etc.). There I was, wandering on some island near cuba when I saw a sea turtle. With my head filled thoughts of turtle armor and other possibilities, I shot it, not thinking much of it. Edward saunters toward the turtle and I press the button to take my reward from the carcass. Nothing. I try again and again, growing more desperate each time. I am experiencing flashbacks of myself several seconds ago, laughing maniacly as I unload round after round of lead into the unsuspecting sea creature.I am crying now. I just wanted to be a pirate.""What have I become?"" I ask myself, half sobbing, half screaming. I cannot tear my eyes away from the unmoving turtle corpse. My high hopes of sweet turtle armor have transitioned to thoughts of suicide. I am a murderer now. I push myself away from my computer desk and fall to the ground into a pool of my own excrement. My mother walks into the room to see her only son covered in his own filth and muttering the word ""turtle"" over and over. She sheds a single tear. She knows what I have done. She quickly calls the cops on me and has me arrested. I don't fight the officers as they lift me up from my fecal pool and into their cruiser. I get sentenced to death for voluntary turtle slaughter of the first degree. I don't order a last meal, because all food tastes like sea turtles and shame now.They take me to the electric chair and tie a blindofold around my eyes. I don't struggle anymore. I am numb. All I can think of is the turtle.			"

												Though I haven't even finished it yet (40 hours in) it's absolutely safe to say, that this is the best AC titleI like it way better then the second, they reduced the city size, and made three smaller ones, which reduces unwanted running around for kilometers. Though overall mapsize is bigger. The best part is out on sea imho. The battles you can have there are just amazing. It all depends on the upgrade system,if you're able to take on three Man'O'Wars or not :D In the beginning, even some smaller ships can sink you in seconds xDAnd cruising around the sea, while listening to your pirate singing shanties, is just awesome (Leave her Johnny leave her...)Fighting is still overpowered, but enemies can hit you easier, then in previous titles, which is a plus imho.Freerunning is as awesome as always, but can be clunky sometimes, but that's mostly yourself being to hectic with the controls :DAnd the pirate theme just fits so great into this setting, honestly go buy this if you like AC titles, and if you don't liked them before, start with this!

												Hands down one of the best games I have played in the past few years. Assassin's Creed 4 takes the whole franchise to a new level by adding an exciting naval combat system. You never get bored of playing as there is such a varity of things to do. Combat is a little glitchy at times especially while boarding. The story admittedly falls short and is lackluster compared to Assassin's Creed 2 or even Revalations. Graphics (provided you have a decent graphics card) are stunning. Community challenges allow you to compete with the community in certain objectives which adds a nice competative element to the single-player. The naval combat and the many side quests and explorable areas more than make up for the game's shortcomings. Overall amazing game that will keep you hooked for quite some time. 9.5/10			"

												Assassin's Creed IV is definitely one of my  GOTY's for this 2013. Mind you, I haven't played any AC games before, so I was a bit skeptical of spending a full $60 on it. However, one hour into the game was all it took for me to realize I was wrong. I love the Caribbean setting and everything the developers added to immerse the player. The characters were also very lovable, and they made the storyline amazing. All the sidequests and missions were incredibly fun, but some became a little tedious. If I'm on the topic of complaining, I might as well include that this was a very poor console port, being locked at 30 FPS. Don't get me wrong-the graphics are incredible and the attention to details such as foliage blew me away. However, I was dissapointed when I discovered that even my beastly rig couldn't run it at a higher framerate than a console. Overall, I recommend this to anybody as long as you don't mind the performance issue.			"

New items weapons and just more badass stuff goes on in the game. And did i mention the map? Take AC3's map and times it by 10. I have so much more to do in the game and I can't wait!!

The story walks in the same way as the last games of the series. Maybe just for the fun of vsiting some beatiful enviromets could be enough to play this game. I've played for as long as 40 hours, and yet, can't find any empathy or simpathy with the main character. By the way, i'm a fan of the series, and for this, I preferred to wait for a price drop.

												If you ask me, Asscreed was at its pinicle in the Assassins Creed 2/ Brotherhood era, and although Revelations wasn't that bad, 3 was a disjointed mess with some cool ideas in place, but overall a hack job.Black Flag  doesn't really work as an AssCreed game in my book.  I never immersed in the huge cities like those of Italy or Palestine, with their towering buildings and crowded streets.  Instead I bummed around the Carribean, mincing through sparsly populated streets whith the occasion tall building and a few trees to climb.  There's bushes and sugar cane everywhere, so stealth is as easy as pie. The NPC reactions to death/fights/assasinations and general shenanigans are as placid as stoned grandmas, and the combat is so godamned easy that there's no insentive to take a stealth approach as you can button mash your way out of EVERY single combat encounter.  The Arkham games and Shadow of More Doors did some really cool and interesting things with this combat system, but Black Flag makes it a cakewalk.  Not every game has to be Dark Souls, but come on lads!  most baddies are just walking cutlass fodder who can't even block!However, strangely enough, Black Flag works incrediably well as a jaunty swashbuckling simulator.  Forget about sneaking around and offing people with your hidden blades, and instead embrace beautiful nautical exploration, exhillirating naval combat, the manical choas that comes with boarding a Man'o'War, the sublime delights of deep-sea diving, and a predicatble but enjoyable plot with some fantastic dialogue and brilliant beards. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!  I just can't get enough of saling the open seas, my hairy crew of rascals singing their little shanties, looking for Spanish Man'o'Wars to attack, new islands to explore, and new booty to get my hands on!. If only i could skip those bloody eavesdropping sections and tun off the damn desynchronisation bs...   Like I said, Asscreed hasn't been great, in my view, since Brotherhood, and Black Flag doesn't do anything to bring it back in that direction.  But as a Swashbuckling simulator and fun action adventure games there's not more you could wish for.			"

Combat feels like a chore when you get far enough in the game.- The cut scenes - Not all of them, just the ones that play after you destroy a ship.- The AI - They might as well not even be there if they're going to be this stupid.Apart from that, though, the game is very fun.

												Where to start? For a bit of context, I have not yet played AC: Rogue or Unity.For those who don't know, you play as a pirate, and a lot of the assassin-themed gameplay prevalent in the previous titles has taken a backseat to the updated naval combat mechanics from AC3. And honestly, it's for the better. You'll still be doing the classic free-running and assassinating, but the focus generally seems to have moved to good ol' plundering and looting on the high seas with your very own ship: the Jackdaw.The sailing mechanics, while not completely realistic, are a lot of fun and have a surprising amount of player feedback for an Assassin's Creed game. After you severely damage enemy ships with the impressive range of weaponry equipped on the Jackdaw, you'll be given an opportunity to board it. This brings up a short sequence of mini-objectives that have an atmosphere oozing with piratey goodness: swinging from ropes, blasting soldiers with broadside cannons and an amazing soundtrack; which feel absolutely exhilarating at times.Successfully taking over ships gives you materials that can be used to help upgrade the Jackdaw. Cloth, wood and metal are each used in reasonably balanced upgrade trees that lead through a satisfying and addictive progression system. And yes, it is addictive. I spent many hours gathering the materials required to max out my mortar so I could demolish some of the game's many naval bases easily. For the first time ever in an Assassin's Creed game, I actually wanted to collect money to buy things.Now, onto the story. You play as Edward Kenway, a greedy pirate looking to make a quick buck after acquiring an Assassin's uniform (and also the grandfather of AC3's Connor). Ed is easily the best protagonist in the series to date, and I'd even go as far to say he's more fun than Ezio. He just doesn't give a damn about anything, especially early in the game. This is a refreshing perspective and one of the many great things with the story. The dialogue is also great; it's filled with plenty of pirate slang and less ""WHERE IS CHARLES LEE?!"" There's also a great host of supporting characters, which I would say is probably a first for the franchise.Unfortunately, the story still has problems. The modern-day Animus stuff is still here, and although it's been (thankfully) toned down a great deal, it still butchers the pacing and immersion. I used to enjoy the modern-day story, but after the horrendously bad ending of AC3, I just don't give a damn anymore and I'm sure many other people would be more than happy to see it just go away forever and focus on the historical time periods. Besides that, Black Flag seems to have some trouble spelling out specific details that are important to the plot, leaving some sequences a bit of a mess because things are poorly explained and/or illogical. It baffles me that they still haven't figured out a way to make a 2 year time-skip not feel like a 2-hour time-skip. A simple ""Two years later"" screen will fix this issue, Ubisoft!Otherwise, the story is quite good by Assassin's Creed standards. Memorable characters with solid voice acting are the real appeal here.As great as the naval combat is, it certainly feels held back be being an Assassin's Creed game. Namely due to the fact that the awkward free-running mechanics and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat are largely unchanged from AC3. It's always infuriating when the shoddy controls make Edward run up the side of a wall instead of around a corner thanks to a minute level of imprecision, and even worse when you try to jump down to a slightly lower ledge but instead leap off the building like a suicidal maniac. And the combat? Let's just say that they desperately need to update this. It's essentially a glorified quick-time event where enemies line up in a single file and dive into your sword like a bunch of lemmings. Even the naval combat, despite being generally very good, suffers from being too easy and a bit shallow.Regardless, these issues are tolerable. There's plenty of fun to be had in the Caribbean, which by the way, is absolutely gorgeous. The city of Havana in particular rivals Florence and Venice from AC2 as one of the most stunning locations yet. The map is also cluttered with a daunting amount of side missions. Most of these feel a bit samey, but they do offer some unique challenges, such as attempting to decipher a crudely drawn treasure map. Aside from the naval combat sequences (which make up at least 50% of the game), most of the missions are what you'd expect from an Assassin's Creed game; kill such-and-such, jump in that bale of hay, and follow the paranoid Templar for five minutes (unfortunately, it feels like Black Flag has a higher number of those tedious tailing missions than previous iterations). Which a few glaring exceptions, the optional objectives are much more reasonable and enjoyable this time around. No more ""swim across the river without getting wet"" crap.I had a few bugs and frame-rate issues, but thankfully it seems much more stable than AC3, which was ludicrously unpolished. This is definitely a step in the right direction for a series that's becoming stale. I really wish they'd improve the awkward controls at the very least, and make a fully-fledged pirate game unrelated to the Assassin's Creed brand.Something like a 7.5/10 for this one.			"

												PROs - My favorite in the series, any fan of AC titles or pirate themed games will love this one. Fast & fun action combat & stealth tactics with all the parkour trimmings, as in any of the AC games prior to Black Flag. Battle enemy crews on the high seas through boarding in naval combat while steering clear of violent, but awesome storms and rogue waves that will quickly send you into the deep watery abyss if your not careful. Hunt animals for hides and rescources for crafting your upgraded gear and even dive for sunken treasure or dig it up with aquired maps. Beautiful graphics, fun Multi-player action with friends and one helluva story that sets the stage for this grand adventure in the Carribean. Highly recommended!CONs - Requires Ufail, er I mean Uplay....          - Uplay          - Uplay          - Requires ""High-End"" pc to enjoy smooth gameplay without audio issues during cutscenes.          - Oh and requires Uplay			"

												At first I wasn't very fond of this game. I didn't ike the whole pirate concept because I just didn't think sailing around would be that fun...man i was wrong. This game is fillied with so much to do. From infiltrating forts, to destroying and boarding ships. Finding artrifacts to unlock new and unique armour. Stealthly taking out assassination targets, hunting, enjoying the improved and incredibl fluid freerunning, going underwater into hidden caves, building your own fleet and much more. The combat may be easy, but still very satifisying. Stealth in this game is challenging and fun when pulled off right. This game is probably the 2nd best assassins creed game out there after 2. Worth the buy.			"

												This is definitely the best Assassin's Creed game of the bunch. AC3 was a very ambitious game. While it wasn't terrible, it wasn't able to complete it's vision and felt uncomplete. This game, however, completes AC3's vision of exploration and naval combat. Edward Kenway is a MUCH BETTER protagonist than Connor. While the setting might not be as interesting and the historical figures not as apparent, the story is overall a lot better than AC3's. Definitely worth your money.			"

												After sinking over 50 hours into ACIV, it is safe to say for me that is the best Assassin's Creed game yet. It even is better than 2 and Brotherhood, which were neck and neck for the best one for a long time. The main story is very complex about Edward Kenway's journey to become an Assassin and you get to witness how he evolves as a character It is easily the best Pirate game of all time and I hope they do more games with Edward Kenway as the main character as Kenway is probably my 2nd favorite assassin behind Ezio.

												AC4 is a monumental pirate experience in the West Indies as your open world. The freedom to explore, plunder, and adventure to your hearts content is an unforgettable and thrilling experience. The main character, Edward Kenway is definitely welcome to a now ever extending line of Assassins in the AC franchise and I guarentee you'll love him. On the flip side, the story has several ups and downs and the modern day detracts the atmosphere of urgency the other games had. Regardless, it's a very solid game and redeems some of the mistakes of AC3. 9/10			"

												I was a massive fan of the original Assassin's creed games and quickly realized that the series was bound to lose quality over time (as it did).So when I picked up Assassin's Creed Black Flag I didn't expect a great Assassin's Creed game.And I didn't get one. Matter of fact, I think it would be a terrible game if it focused more on the Assassin aspect of the story, that didn't really seem to fit the main character or the situation he found himself in all that well.But while Ubisoft may have given us a mediocre AC game with Black Flag it seems they accidentally created an amazing and beautiful pirate game.The Pirate story is believable, the setting and maps are absolutely breathtaking, as is the experience out on sea, with the sound of waves crashing against your ship, cannons and seagulls in the distance and your crew singing shanties as you roam the map in search of adventure.If this game is on sale and you can run it I see little reason to not pick it up, it's easy to lose yourself in the beautiful world and story and I can't think of a single pirate oriented game that can even reach the overall feel of this title.TL;DR: Meh AC game, Amazing Pirate game. Do get.			"

												Here's a TL:DR if you don't want to read the whole thing:The game has a very large amount of stuff to do and, if you take your time to enjoy it, will keep you occupied for a very long time. The pirate story was good, but I didn't like the Animus story. It got in the way of me being a pirate and I hated that.My full review:I absolutely loved this game!It took me 91 hours to finish over 7 days (yeah, I know, that's a lot of time playing in 1 week). Of course I wasn't rushing to finish it, so it could easily be done faster.However, I didn't just rush through the story. I played the game to as close to 100% as I could get. This means I completed all the story missions, found all Animus fragments, chests, hidden treasures and mayan stones. I completed all templar missions and assassin contracts. I hunted and harpooned every type of animal. I bought all the swords, guns and outfits. I also crafted all the outfits I could. I got every Jackdaw upgrade and every upgrade for Edward. I took out all the legendary ships and filled an entire fleet with level 60 Man O' War ships.There are only a few things I don't have for Edward or the Jackdaw, but those things are earned from completing community challenges. Considering that I don't have friends that's a bit harder so I get away with that ;)Now, story wise:I found the Animus extremely annoying. I've been told that it's better in this game than previous games. It only pulls you out of the Animus into the modern day 5 times out of 13 (I think) total main missions. I know it's part of the AC series and all, but the Animus is just annoying to me. I'm perfectly fine with a game having good story, but if it interrupts gameplay then it's just annoying. The Animus thingy does just that.I don't play a game for story, I play it for gameplay. If I want story I watch a movie or, better yet, read a book. Games are for GAMEplay.As I said, a good story is fine. That's why I loved the story within the pirate world, because it didn't interrupt my gameplay. I was a pirate. I felt awesome while I was a pirate. As long as I'm an awesome pirate I'd enjoy the story, but as soon as it says, ""No, you're just a guy testing a game. Here, be boring"" I don't feel awesome and don't enjoy it.Enough being annoyed at the Animus!Pirate story! I enjoyed it. It even stirred up some of those feels closer to the end. If they managed to stay completely away from the Animus I would have possibly said it's the best single player game I've played...ever....and it's up against Just Cause 2 so that would be quite a feat. The Observatory and it's weird doohikkyness was a bit silly, but I was fine with that because I was still a pirate. It's just the animus. Literally, that's the one and only thing I can say I did not enjoy about this game.I know lots won't agree with me. I don't care. A game is about gameplay, the Animus got in the way of gameplay. It's a nuisance. Simple as that.			"

												If you ask me, Asscreed was at its pinicle in the Assassins Creed 2/ Brotherhood era, and although Revelations wasn't that bad, 3 was a disjointed mess with some cool ideas in place, but overall a hack job.Black Flag  doesn't really work as an AssCreed game in my book.  I never immersed in the huge cities like those of Italy or Palestine, with their towering buildings and crowded streets.  Instead I bummed around the Carribean, mincing through sparsly populated streets whith the occasion tall building and a few trees to climb.  There's bushes and sugar cane everywhere, so stealth is as easy as pie. The NPC reactions to death/fights/assasinations and general shenanigans are as placid as stoned grandmas, and the combat is so godamned easy that there's no insentive to take a stealth approach as you can button mash your way out of EVERY single combat encounter.  The Arkham games and Shadow of More Doors did some really cool and interesting things with this combat system, but Black Flag makes it a cakewalk.  Not every game has to be Dark Souls, but come on lads!  most baddies are just walking cutlass fodder who can't even block!However, strangely enough, Black Flag works incrediably well as a jaunty swashbuckling simulator.  Forget about sneaking around and offing people with your hidden blades, and instead embrace beautiful nautical exploration, exhillirating naval combat, the manical choas that comes with boarding a Man'o'War, the sublime delights of deep-sea diving, and a predicatble but enjoyable plot with some fantastic dialogue and brilliant beards. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!  I just can't get enough of saling the open seas, my hairy crew of rascals singing their little shanties, looking for Spanish Man'o'Wars to attack, new islands to explore, and new booty to get my hands on!. If only i could skip those bloody eavesdropping sections and tun off the damn desynchronisation bs...   Like I said, Asscreed hasn't been great, in my view, since Brotherhood, and Black Flag doesn't do anything to bring it back in that direction.  But as a Swashbuckling simulator and fun action adventure games there's not more you could wish for.			"

												Where to start? For a bit of context, I have not yet played AC: Rogue or Unity.For those who don't know, you play as a pirate, and a lot of the assassin-themed gameplay prevalent in the previous titles has taken a backseat to the updated naval combat mechanics from AC3. And honestly, it's for the better. You'll still be doing the classic free-running and assassinating, but the focus generally seems to have moved to good ol' plundering and looting on the high seas with your very own ship: the Jackdaw.The sailing mechanics, while not completely realistic, are a lot of fun and have a surprising amount of player feedback for an Assassin's Creed game. After you severely damage enemy ships with the impressive range of weaponry equipped on the Jackdaw, you'll be given an opportunity to board it. This brings up a short sequence of mini-objectives that have an atmosphere oozing with piratey goodness: swinging from ropes, blasting soldiers with broadside cannons and an amazing soundtrack; which feel absolutely exhilarating at times.Successfully taking over ships gives you materials that can be used to help upgrade the Jackdaw. Cloth, wood and metal are each used in reasonably balanced upgrade trees that lead through a satisfying and addictive progression system. And yes, it is addictive. I spent many hours gathering the materials required to max out my mortar so I could demolish some of the game's many naval bases easily. For the first time ever in an Assassin's Creed game, I actually wanted to collect money to buy things.Now, onto the story. You play as Edward Kenway, a greedy pirate looking to make a quick buck after acquiring an Assassin's uniform (and also the grandfather of AC3's Connor). Ed is easily the best protagonist in the series to date, and I'd even go as far to say he's more fun than Ezio. He just doesn't give a damn about anything, especially early in the game. This is a refreshing perspective and one of the many great things with the story. The dialogue is also great; it's filled with plenty of pirate slang and less ""WHERE IS CHARLES LEE?!"" There's also a great host of supporting characters, which I would say is probably a first for the franchise.Unfortunately, the story still has problems. The modern-day Animus stuff is still here, and although it's been (thankfully) toned down a great deal, it still butchers the pacing and immersion. I used to enjoy the modern-day story, but after the horrendously bad ending of AC3, I just don't give a damn anymore and I'm sure many other people would be more than happy to see it just go away forever and focus on the historical time periods. Besides that, Black Flag seems to have some trouble spelling out specific details that are important to the plot, leaving some sequences a bit of a mess because things are poorly explained and/or illogical. It baffles me that they still haven't figured out a way to make a 2 year time-skip not feel like a 2-hour time-skip. A simple ""Two years later"" screen will fix this issue, Ubisoft!Otherwise, the story is quite good by Assassin's Creed standards. Memorable characters with solid voice acting are the real appeal here.As great as the naval combat is, it certainly feels held back be being an Assassin's Creed game. Namely due to the fact that the awkward free-running mechanics and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat are largely unchanged from AC3. It's always infuriating when the shoddy controls make Edward run up the side of a wall instead of around a corner thanks to a minute level of imprecision, and even worse when you try to jump down to a slightly lower ledge but instead leap off the building like a suicidal maniac. And the combat? Let's just say that they desperately need to update this.

												Hands down one of the best games I have played in the past few years. Assassin's Creed 4 takes the whole franchise to a new level by adding an exciting naval combat system. You never get bored of playing as there is such a varity of things to do. Combat is a little glitchy at times especially while boarding. The story admittedly falls short and is lackluster compared to Assassin's Creed 2 or even Revalations. Graphics (provided you have a decent graphics card) are stunning. Community challenges allow you to compete with the community in certain objectives which adds a nice competative element to the single-player. The naval combat and the many side quests and explorable areas more than make up for the game's shortcomings. Overall amazing game that will keep you hooked for quite some time. 9.5/10			"

												Let me be pretty sincere here: this is the best Assassin's Creed so far. I'm a huge fan of the series and had always played all of the games right on the launch. It was not different with Black Flag.AC IV represents the final move into the pure sandbox experience. Although since AC Brotherhood the series invested in more and more quests and things to do out there in the open world, which has been improved in each instalment of the series, Black Flag has so many things to do, and so much different from each other, that it feels a completely fresh experience.I saw some criticism about the Creed part of the story being left aside, but for me it isn't too much of a big deal... AC is always about a historical representation, and it truly brings to us the end of the Caribbean Piracy Era. And the plot around Edward Kenway is a pure metaphore for it. Play it, pay attention to the details and you'll clearly see it. Plus, the life of captain Edward is the most emotional of all the series, the character is the most humanized of them all.As for the gameplay, it feels really great to navigate from island to island, famous port to famous port, engage in battle and in piracy actions. The core gameplay revolves around your ship, but the mechanics of climbing and acting stealth still makes presence.One good thing is that the stealth part has been greatly improved. The level design is thought to be stealth, differently from the AC III, which had a broken level design for the stealth gameplay, specially for doing 100% of the achievements. Sure, Edward's drive is the same as the other AC games and sometimes he'll end up doing things you don't want to. Ubisoft must look at this and make it better in AC Unity I believe, it's something that is frustrating sometimes.The music is great but not that memorable as the AC II or III were, but you can still enjoy and the game has great voice acting. As for the graphics, videos and screenshots speak for themselves: the game is gorgeous, specially on the PC, with many effects and a high resolution.Do not be affraid: Black Flag is the best Assassin's Creed to date, and one of the best historical games ever made.

												The senario isn't that good compared to Ezio Trilogy, but i wasn't expecting it to be that good neither. Those three games were fantastic.

You can customize your character a lot more in the multiplayer of this.			"

												Not much to say, just a genious game, so both thumbs high! Each level, a new surprise and all the staff you can do, outside of main missions, is very nice. Hunting bull shark is just wow and I cant do it to often with my age, without risking a heart attack :D This game ist just to recommend! Buy it in sale, or out of it, this game is worth every cent.

												My favorite Assassin's Creed game was the first one in the series, I liked all the other ones after it but I could never truly love them as much as I did with the first one until now that is. I can finally add another one to the favorites list because this is more than just an Assassin's Creed game it's also an amazing pirate game.There's so much going on in this game I mean what's not to love about a pirate caught between templars and assassins, the main story line will take about 24 hours to complete which was my main focus but there's tonnes of side quests and objectives to do which could possibly give you another 20 hours maybe even more. The best feature I think is the ship sailing and battles just oh my god amazingly fun, an addition to all the new crazy things comes ship customization to upgrade for battle or to look good and there's also all the other customization you'd except from past Assassin's Creed games for your character as well. A controller works perfectly out of the box and the keyboard and mouse work fine fully rebindable even though I'd still recommend a controller. There's plenty of user and graphics settings to mess with which is always a plus and there's more than one audio slider which is great. The game also comes with multiplayer your typical death match type game modes you've seen in the past, great fun with friends but might not be for everyone.I always hate having to list down bad things about games I love but it has to be done for one this game is super repetitive and I hate it, I hate having to constantly do tailing missions or stealth missions... I just want to get into the fun stuff but no that's never the case with this game. It also has that slow start syndrome you know the long story tutorials that tell you super basic things once every few sections. There's also really boring abstergo missions you know the ones that force you out of the animus to do really lame stuff, I mean sure it's cool but I'd rather just play the historic side of the game. Lastly the game still doesn't have any form of windowed mode this is what the sixth game down the line and this still isn't a thing?I absolutely love this game and at it's current price point of $25 USD it's a steal, I mean if your looking for a good Assassin's Creed game to reignite your love for the series or to just jump straight in with no strings attached, hell even for a good pirate game than this game is for you.

												If you ask me, Asscreed was at its pinicle in the Assassins Creed 2/ Brotherhood era, and although Revelations wasn't that bad, 3 was a disjointed mess with some cool ideas in place, but overall a hack job.Black Flag  doesn't really work as an AssCreed game in my book.  I never immersed in the huge cities like those of Italy or Palestine, with their towering buildings and crowded streets.  Instead I bummed around the Carribean, mincing through sparsly populated streets whith the occasion tall building and a few trees to climb.  There's bushes and sugar cane everywhere, so stealth is as easy as pie. The NPC reactions to death/fights/assasinations and general shenanigans are as placid as stoned grandmas, and the combat is so godamned easy that there's no insentive to take a stealth approach as you can button mash your way out of EVERY single combat encounter.  The Arkham games and Shadow of More Doors did some really cool and interesting things with this combat system, but Black Flag makes it a cakewalk.  Not every game has to be Dark Souls, but come on lads!  most baddies are just walking cutlass fodder who can't even block!However, strangely enough, Black Flag works incrediably well as a jaunty swashbuckling simulator.  Forget about sneaking around and offing people with your hidden blades, and instead embrace beautiful nautical exploration, exhillirating naval combat, the manical choas that comes with boarding a Man'o'War, the sublime delights of deep-sea diving, and a predicatble but enjoyable plot with some fantastic dialogue and brilliant beards. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!  I just can't get enough of saling the open seas, my hairy crew of rascals singing their little shanties, looking for Spanish Man'o'Wars to attack, new islands to explore, and new booty to get my hands on!. If only i could skip those bloody eavesdropping sections and tun off the damn desynchronisation bs...   Like I said, Asscreed hasn't been great, in my view, since Brotherhood, and Black Flag doesn't do anything to bring it back in that direction.  But as a Swashbuckling simulator and fun action adventure games there's not more you could wish for.			"

												Here's a TL:DR if you don't want to read the whole thing:The game has a very large amount of stuff to do and, if you take your time to enjoy it, will keep you occupied for a very long time. The pirate story was good, but I didn't like the Animus story. It got in the way of me being a pirate and I hated that.My full review:I absolutely loved this game!It took me 91 hours to finish over 7 days (yeah, I know, that's a lot of time playing in 1 week). Of course I wasn't rushing to finish it, so it could easily be done faster.However, I didn't just rush through the story. I played the game to as close to 100% as I could get. This means I completed all the story missions, found all Animus fragments, chests, hidden treasures and mayan stones. I completed all templar missions and assassin contracts. I hunted and harpooned every type of animal. I bought all the swords, guns and outfits. I also crafted all the outfits I could. I got every Jackdaw upgrade and every upgrade for Edward. I took out all the legendary ships and filled an entire fleet with level 60 Man O' War ships.There are only a few things I don't have for Edward or the Jackdaw, but those things are earned from completing community challenges. Considering that I don't have friends that's a bit harder so I get away with that ;)Now, story wise:I found the Animus extremely annoying. I've been told that it's better in this game than previous games. It only pulls you out of the Animus into the modern day 5 times out of 13 (I think) total main missions. I know it's part of the AC series and all, but the Animus is just annoying to me. I'm perfectly fine with a game having good story, but if it interrupts gameplay then it's just annoying. The Animus thingy does just that.I don't play a game for story, I play it for gameplay. If I want story I watch a movie or, better yet, read a book. Games are for GAMEplay.As I said, a good story is fine. That's why I loved the story within the pirate world, because it didn't interrupt my gameplay. I was a pirate. I felt awesome while I was a pirate. As long as I'm an awesome pirate I'd enjoy the story, but as soon as it says, ""No, you're just a guy testing a game. Here, be boring"" I don't feel awesome and don't enjoy it.Enough being annoyed at the Animus!Pirate story! I enjoyed it. It even stirred up some of those feels closer to the end. If they managed to stay completely away from the Animus I would have possibly said it's the best single player game I've played...ever....and it's up against Just Cause 2 so that would be quite a feat. The Observatory and it's weird doohikkyness was a bit silly, but I was fine with that because I was still a pirate. It's just the animus. Literally, that's the one and only thing I can say I did not enjoy about this game.I know lots won't agree with me. I don't care. A game is about gameplay, the Animus got in the way of gameplay. It's a nuisance. Simple as that.			"

												Where to start? For a bit of context, I have not yet played AC: Rogue or Unity.For those who don't know, you play as a pirate, and a lot of the assassin-themed gameplay prevalent in the previous titles has taken a backseat to the updated naval combat mechanics from AC3. And honestly, it's for the better. You'll still be doing the classic free-running and assassinating, but the focus generally seems to have moved to good ol' plundering and looting on the high seas with your very own ship: the Jackdaw.The sailing mechanics, while not completely realistic, are a lot of fun and have a surprising amount of player feedback for an Assassin's Creed game. After you severely damage enemy ships with the impressive range of weaponry equipped on the Jackdaw, you'll be given an opportunity to board it. This brings up a short sequence of mini-objectives that have an atmosphere oozing with piratey goodness: swinging from ropes, blasting soldiers with broadside cannons and an amazing soundtrack; which feel absolutely exhilarating at times.Successfully taking over ships gives you materials that can be used to help upgrade the Jackdaw. Cloth, wood and metal are each used in reasonably balanced upgrade trees that lead through a satisfying and addictive progression system. And yes, it is addictive. I spent many hours gathering the materials required to max out my mortar so I could demolish some of the game's many naval bases easily. For the first time ever in an Assassin's Creed game, I actually wanted to collect money to buy things.Now, onto the story. You play as Edward Kenway, a greedy pirate looking to make a quick buck after acquiring an Assassin's uniform (and also the grandfather of AC3's Connor). Ed is easily the best protagonist in the series to date, and I'd even go as far to say he's more fun than Ezio. He just doesn't give a damn about anything, especially early in the game. This is a refreshing perspective and one of the many great things with the story. The dialogue is also great; it's filled with plenty of pirate slang and less ""WHERE IS CHARLES LEE?!"" There's also a great host of supporting characters, which I would say is probably a first for the franchise.Unfortunately, the story still has problems. The modern-day Animus stuff is still here, and although it's been (thankfully) toned down a great deal, it still butchers the pacing and immersion. I used to enjoy the modern-day story, but after the horrendously bad ending of AC3, I just don't give a damn anymore and I'm sure many other people would be more than happy to see it just go away forever and focus on the historical time periods. Besides that, Black Flag seems to have some trouble spelling out specific details that are important to the plot, leaving some sequences a bit of a mess because things are poorly explained and/or illogical. It baffles me that they still haven't figured out a way to make a 2 year time-skip not feel like a 2-hour time-skip. A simple ""Two years later"" screen will fix this issue, Ubisoft!Otherwise, the story is quite good by Assassin's Creed standards. Memorable characters with solid voice acting are the real appeal here.As great as the naval combat is, it certainly feels held back be being an Assassin's Creed game. Namely due to the fact that the awkward free-running mechanics and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat are largely unchanged from AC3. It's always infuriating when the shoddy controls make Edward run up the side of a wall instead of around a corner thanks to a minute level of imprecision, and even worse when you try to jump down to a slightly lower ledge but instead leap off the building like a suicidal maniac. And the combat? Let's just say that they desperately need to update this. It's essentially a glorified quick-time event where enemies line up in a single file and dive into your sword like a bunch of lemmings. Even the naval combat, despite being generally very good, suffers from being too easy and a bit shallow.Regardless, these issues are tolerable. There's plenty of fun to be had in the Caribbean, which by the way, is absolutely gorgeous. The city of Havana in particular rivals Florence and Venice from AC2 as one of the most stunning locations yet. The map is also cluttered with a daunting amount of side missions. Most of these feel a bit samey, but they do offer some unique challenges, such as attempting to decipher a crudely drawn treasure map. Aside from the naval combat sequences (which make up at least 50% of the game), most of the missions are what you'd expect from an Assassin's Creed game; kill such-and-such, jump in that bale of hay, and follow the paranoid Templar for five minutes (unfortunately, it feels like Black Flag has a higher number of those tedious tailing missions than previous iterations). Which a few glaring exceptions, the optional objectives are much more reasonable and enjoyable this time around. No more ""swim across the river without getting wet"" crap.I had a few bugs and frame-rate issues, but thankfully it seems much more stable than AC3, which was ludicrously unpolished. This is definitely a step in the right direction for a series that's becoming stale. I really wish they'd improve the awkward controls at the very least, and make a fully-fledged pirate game unrelated to the Assassin's Creed brand.Something like a 7.5/10 for this one.			"

												The very best Assassin's Creed game out there so far. Easily 50+ hours of gameplay on singleplayer. If you're a completionist like myself, there is a lot to do, and you won't bore yourself out. Very expansive and seamless gameplay. There's so much to do and you'll get side tracked from the main storyline easily; which isn't a bad thing. Everything is fun, and has differences in difficulties, not everything is too easy or too hard.TL;DR - Vast content, seamless gameplay, many things to do, play in your own style. You control the game.10/10 (considering the genre, previous Assassin's Creed titles, gameplay)			"

												This is undoubtedly the best Assasin's Creed game yet, and I've played and beat them all. Assasin's Creed IV Black Flag feels like a revitalization of the franchise. It is truly a remarkable experience set in a caribbean atmosphere and centered around pirate lore. The game has numerous addictive qualities that keep pulling me back for more. Sailing the high seas in conquest and search for treasures never gets boring. Upgrading your ship and battling ever increasingly difficult numberrs of foes keeps you on the egde of your seat. The graphics and sound here are truly spectacular, and without taxing your computer hardware. I really can't recommend this game enough. If you enjoyed any of the previous Assasin's Creed games or haven't played them but have an interest in pirate lore, this game is an easy no brainer. Get it now and enjoy the adventure, because games this good only come along once every few years. I'd give it a 10 out of 10.			"

												I was a massive fan of the original Assassin's creed games and quickly realized that the series was bound to lose quality over time (as it did).So when I picked up Assassin's Creed Black Flag I didn't expect a great Assassin's Creed game.And I didn't get one. Matter of fact, I think it would be a terrible game if it focused more on the Assassin aspect of the story, that didn't really seem to fit the main character or the situation he found himself in all that well.But while Ubisoft may have given us a mediocre AC game with Black Flag it seems they accidentally created an amazing and beautiful pirate game.The Pirate story is believable, the setting and maps are absolutely breathtaking, as is the experience out on sea, with the sound of waves crashing against your ship, cannons and seagulls in the distance and your crew singing shanties as you roam the map in search of adventure.If this game is on sale and you can run it I see little reason to not pick it up, it's easy to lose yourself in the beautiful world and story and I can't think of a single pirate oriented game that can even reach the overall feel of this title.TL;DR: Meh AC game, Amazing Pirate game. Do get.			"

												This is definitely the best Assassin's Creed game of the bunch. AC3 was a very ambitious game. While it wasn't terrible, it wasn't able to complete it's vision and felt uncomplete. This game, however, completes AC3's vision of exploration and naval combat. Edward Kenway is a MUCH BETTER protagonist than Connor. While the setting might not be as interesting and the historical figures not as apparent, the story is overall a lot better than AC3's. Definitely worth your money.			"

												Assassin's Creed. Very... interesting series for me to talk out. They start releasing a game a year on main gen consoles and PC since 2009, hell, they released two back in 2014, Unity and Rogue, and I guess they do it this year again. Heck, they could be releasing even more a year. What I am saying, ladies and gentlemen, is that this game makes Call of Duty jealous from the ridiculous releases each year. So, to quell our possible uprisings, Ubisoft decided to say, ""We are sorry to hear that you are unsatisfied. Would you like an awesome pirate adventure?"" The unanimous answer to that was, ""...well now we do!"" Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, which is not the fourth game but I would go nuts for counting up what game it actually is probably, is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome without a doubt, and is probably the best of the franchise, though I've only played this game twice, half of 3 and part of 2. Not very much, yeah, but this game is awesome. Want to know why? Of course you do, or else you wouldn't be reading this. So let's get into it, shall we?STORY: Your name is Edward Kenway. Actually, you're some guy who works at a video game development place that uses Desmond Miles's DNA to both make games and  benefit the Templar order, but most of you only give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the pirate, so I'll tell you about the pirate. You go to the Carribean to try and make money to support you and your wife back in England. After you kill an assassin, you decide to impersonate him and go to a meeting in Havana, where it turns out that the Templars plan to find a place called the Observatory. Edward, seeing a way to make money, decides to try to go after it. He is then imprisoned, but breaks free and takes a ship and a crew that are willing to go after the observatory with him as long as they get paid. You are thrown unwillingly between the duel for power between the Assassins and the Templars as well, which is interesting to see how this plays out. The story is interesting, I was engrossed enough, there were a couple neat twists throughout the whole story. The ending was sweet, I'm glad I made it to the end. Oh yeah, and that DNA playing thing was good I guess. Overall great.GAMEPLAY: Same♥♥♥♥♥♥as the last couple♥♥♥♥♥Creed games. You run around, have a lot of gadgets, you can do parkour. Stealth gameplay is fine, but I feel like sometimes it is kind of unfair, though it might just be because I suck. Combat is great, feels fairly satisfying. The parkour stuff is fine. Ship combat is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as well, I love fighting on ships. Just remember, play with a gamepad. Keyboard controls are kind of bad.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Game looks damn good. Water looks very nice, environments are nice, kind of the same jungle-y areas for the most part, but still nice. This game takes a lot for it to run, however, so you might want to hold off on this unless you have a PC that can handle it. My rig could barely run it even. But if you have a good PC, it won't matter.CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Edward Kenway is a good character. It's kind of interesting seeing him evolve from a man who only does something for a paycheck to a loyal member of the Assassin's (spoiler? meh, probably not.) You come across some notable members of pirate history, including Blackbeard, Black Bart, and some more guys who I probably could recognize if I paid attention better in social studies the day we went over these names. If this was a review of AC3 I could tell you every single ♥♥♥♥ing name in that game, I bet. xD You don't really have any notable members of your crew with the exception of Adewale, a slave who helps you escape your prison and take over your ship and becomes your First Mate. He's awesome as well. Not really any bad voice acting I'd say, character design is decent, so I can't really complain.SIDE ACTIVITIES: Land activities are simple. You can go on assassin missions where you have to take a guy out, you can help other Assassin's out in order to find keys to a safe, you can raid storehouses, you can use your eagle vision to find Mayan keystones, you can syncronize points to reveal bits of the map, or you can just go around and look for collectibles. Seawise you can attack and conquer forts, which reveal parts of the map, you can go harpooning sea animals for crafting purposes, you can go on naval contracts that are essentially assassin missions but on a boat, and you can, of course, attack and plunder ships like a true pirate. You can also go underwater with assistance of a diving bell and explore underwater wrecks. Decent amount of variety with these, I think I might miss one or two but you get the idea. Nice amount of stuff to do.FINAL VERDICT: Nice place to start off in the♥♥♥♥♥Creed saga. Any game that doesn't have Desmond Miles in it only gets points to me. 9/10, definately worth picking up sometime soon. In a world without gold, we would be heroes Kenway!  "

												Not much to say, just a genious game, so both thumbs high! Each level, a new surprise and all the staff you can do, outside of main missions, is very nice. Hunting bull shark is just wow and I cant do it to often with my age, without risking a heart attack :D This game ist just to recommend! Buy it in sale, or out of it, this game is worth every cent.

												My favorite Assassin's Creed game was the first one in the series, I liked all the other ones after it but I could never truly love them as much as I did with the first one until now that is. I can finally add another one to the favorites list because this is more than just an Assassin's Creed game it's also an amazing pirate game.There's so much going on in this game I mean what's not to love about a pirate caught between templars and assassins, the main story line will take about 24 hours to complete which was my main focus but there's tonnes of side quests and objectives to do which could possibly give you another 20 hours maybe even more. The best feature I think is the ship sailing and battles just oh my god amazingly fun, an addition to all the new crazy things comes ship customization to upgrade for battle or to look good and there's also all the other customization you'd except from past Assassin's Creed games for your character as well. A controller works perfectly out of the box and the keyboard and mouse work fine fully rebindable even though I'd still recommend a controller. There's plenty of user and graphics settings to mess with which is always a plus and there's more than one audio slider which is great. The game also comes with multiplayer your typical death match type game modes you've seen in the past, great fun with friends but might not be for everyone.I always hate having to list down bad things about games I love but it has to be done for one this game is super repetitive and I hate it, I hate having to constantly do tailing missions or stealth missions... I just want to get into the fun stuff but no that's never the case with this game. It also has that slow start syndrome you know the long story tutorials that tell you super basic things once every few sections. There's also really boring abstergo missions you know the ones that force you out of the animus to do really lame stuff, I mean sure it's cool but I'd rather just play the historic side of the game. Lastly the game still doesn't have any form of windowed mode this is what the sixth game down the line and this still isn't a thing?I absolutely love this game and at it's current price point of $25 USD it's a steal, I mean if your looking for a good Assassin's Creed game to reignite your love for the series or to just jump straight in with no strings attached, hell even for a good pirate game than this game is for you.

												Black Flag is everything Assassin's Creed 2 was and improves on it. Sailing and listening to shanties is one of my most favorite things to do. There's also enemy ships to board, loot to steal, fortresses to destroy, and legendary ships to sink as well! There's a lot of pirates in this game that dont exactly quite fit, and the story is a bit muddled at times. But if you can ignore that and the simplistic combat system, Blag Flag is a game worth playing, and keeping.			"

												A good game with beatuiful graphics, fun gameplay and strong characters. That said though, the Assasin's Creed combat system needs a serious re-vamp, and the game needs a difficulty setting. I've been a fan of the Assasin's Creed series ever since the first one, and I've put thousands upon thousands of hours into the franchise, and It's true that I've never had more fun in any of the games, but I wasn't as immersed in the story as usual, the combat system is really clunky and bad, seeing how it mostly consist of mashing two buttons, and isn't anywhere close to being as fluent as the Batman-combat system. As I mentioned earlier, the game is way to easy for my liking, making at a ""masturbate to murder-machine fantasies"" game, where you dream of being this unstoppable monster who just slaughters everything. That said though, the naval combat is really developing into something amazing. The multiplayer, as It has been since Brotherhood isn't much to talk about, although there is rumours of a Naval-Warfare multiplayer mode, which sounds amazing. This would have been an AMAZING game for drop-in drop-out Coop sandbox, but alas.TL DR;Good,pretty casual game with some interesting ideas if you're looking for some fun, but not much of a challenge. Score:8.5/10 from a Assasin's Creed veteran.			"

												This game has a lot going for it.  You play as a pirate of the Caribbean who doesn't really fit in with the Assassins or Templars.  He basically just does what he wants and what he wants is money and gold.  You command a ship around in a big open world with hardly any loading.  One of the things that I was amazed by is how you can essentially stop sailing a ship, jump into the ocean, swim to islands, and continue playing on foot with the standard Assassin's Creed gameplay.  Fast travel has been improved greatly this game and is pretty much necessary as everything is so spread out.  One of the great things is each of the synchronization points become fast travel points and you can go to them immediately through the map menu.  You don't have to go to a fast travel point to fast travel.  Hunting and crafting makes its return and it's way more fun.  They got rid of setting traps and bait.  Instead, you just shoot the animal with your gun and it's over with.  Sword play is essentially the same as before.  Gun play has changed from the previous games I believe.  You can now control where you aim instead of auto locking.  If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed and Sid Meier's Pirates, you will enjoy this game.			"

												When it's hard to enjoy AC series without completing AC (Altair's story) and AC Legacy (Ezio's tale), almost everyone can enjoy AC4: Black Flag without playing previous installment. It almost looks like new entire installment, even I wondered why there's no separate installment ""Black Flag"" instead AC4: Black Flag. Either way, AC4: Black Flag is good in its own way different from previous installment.For some people who wants to enjoy Assassin's Creed story but too lazy or didn't want spend time completing previous installment, AC4 is a good start. But of course, it'll be more enjoyable if one has completing AC and AC Legacy.Final Verdict (w/o DLC):8.2/10			"

												One of the most satisfying games I have ever played. The story is great. The open world IMO is amazing there is nothing like the rush of capturing a fort or boarding a ship. There are some easy parts in this game and some hard parts. The open world is nice, there are a lot of places to visit. A lot of the missions are repetitive, but the beauty of the locations and the time setting really make up for it. This game is a gem highly recommend. Would plunder and kill again.			"

												The gameplay is fantastic. Really, it is! I haven't had any issues with uPlay or the like at all.The story so far seems interesting enough.But I do have one issue with it, and that's the graphics.See, my laptop is, admittedly, a bit old. It's not really 'primed' for these kinds of games.I can run AC3 at all-High settings at a resolution of 1360x768. Same, oddly, with MGSV.I was hoping to do the same with this, but unfortunately I can't.Instead of scaling the resolution to match your screen, it keeps it in a black border. This means that I have to squint.And this wouldn't be so bad were it not that, even when I change my desktop resolution to match, it stays bordered.I initially refunded this game, but I'm willing to give it a shot with some tinkering. I just wish the graphics customizationwas a bit better implemented.Overall, I'd give it a 7.5-8/10. "

												If you ask me, Asscreed was at its pinicle in the Assassins Creed 2/ Brotherhood era, and although Revelations wasn't that bad, 3 was a disjointed mess with some cool ideas in place, but overall a hack job.Black Flag  doesn't really work as an AssCreed game in my book.  I never immersed in the huge cities like those of Italy or Palestine, with their towering buildings and crowded streets.  Instead I bummed around the Carribean, mincing through sparsly populated streets whith the occasion tall building and a few trees to climb.  There's bushes and sugar cane everywhere, so stealth is as easy as pie. The NPC reactions to death/fights/assasinations and general shenanigans are as placid as stoned grandmas, and the combat is so godamned easy that there's no insentive to take a stealth approach as you can button mash your way out of EVERY single combat encounter.  The Arkham games and Shadow of More Doors did some really cool and interesting things with this combat system, but Black Flag makes it a cakewalk.  Not every game has to be Dark Souls, but come on lads!  most baddies are just walking cutlass fodder who can't even block!However, strangely enough, Black Flag works incrediably well as a jaunty swashbuckling simulator.  Forget about sneaking around and offing people with your hidden blades, and instead embrace beautiful nautical exploration, exhillirating naval combat, the manical choas that comes with boarding a Man'o'War, the sublime delights of deep-sea diving, and a predicatble but enjoyable plot with some fantastic dialogue and brilliant beards. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!  I just can't get enough of saling the open seas, my hairy crew of rascals singing their little shanties, looking for Spanish Man'o'Wars to attack, new islands to explore, and new booty to get my hands on!. If only i could skip those bloody eavesdropping sections and tun off the damn desynchronisation bs...   Like I said, Asscreed hasn't been great, in my view, since Brotherhood, and Black Flag doesn't do anything to bring it back in that direction.  But as a Swashbuckling simulator and fun action adventure games there's not more you could wish for.			"

												Here's a TL:DR if you don't want to read the whole thing:The game has a very large amount of stuff to do and, if you take your time to enjoy it, will keep you occupied for a very long time. The pirate story was good, but I didn't like the Animus story. It got in the way of me being a pirate and I hated that.My full review:I absolutely loved this game!It took me 91 hours to finish over 7 days (yeah, I know, that's a lot of time playing in 1 week). Of course I wasn't rushing to finish it, so it could easily be done faster.However, I didn't just rush through the story. I played the game to as close to 100% as I could get. This means I completed all the story missions, found all Animus fragments, chests, hidden treasures and mayan stones. I completed all templar missions and assassin contracts. I hunted and harpooned every type of animal. I bought all the swords, guns and outfits. I also crafted all the outfits I could. I got every Jackdaw upgrade and every upgrade for Edward. I took out all the legendary ships and filled an entire fleet with level 60 Man O' War ships.There are only a few things I don't have for Edward or the Jackdaw, but those things are earned from completing community challenges. Considering that I don't have friends that's a bit harder so I get away with that ;)Now, story wise:I found the Animus extremely annoying. I've been told that it's better in this game than previous games. It only pulls you out of the Animus into the modern day 5 times out of 13 (I think) total main missions. I know it's part of the AC series and all, but the Animus is just annoying to me. I'm perfectly fine with a game having good story, but if it interrupts gameplay then it's just annoying. The Animus thingy does just that.I don't play a game for story, I play it for gameplay. If I want story I watch a movie or, better yet, read a book. Games are for GAMEplay.As I said, a good story is fine. That's why I loved the story within the pirate world, because it didn't interrupt my gameplay. I was a pirate. I felt awesome while I was a pirate. As long as I'm an awesome pirate I'd enjoy the story, but as soon as it says, ""No, you're just a guy testing a game. Here, be boring"" I don't feel awesome and don't enjoy it.Enough being annoyed at the Animus!Pirate story! I enjoyed it. It even stirred up some of those feels closer to the end. If they managed to stay completely away from the Animus I would have possibly said it's the best single player game I've played...ever....and it's up against Just Cause 2 so that would be quite a feat. The Observatory and it's weird doohikkyness was a bit silly, but I was fine with that because I was still a pirate. It's just the animus. Literally, that's the one and only thing I can say I did not enjoy about this game.I know lots won't agree with me. I don't care. A game is about gameplay, the Animus got in the way of gameplay. It's a nuisance. Simple as that.			"

Combat feels like a chore when you get far enough in the game.- The cut scenes - Not all of them, just the ones that play after you destroy a ship.- The AI - They might as well not even be there if they're going to be this stupid.Apart from that, though, the game is very fun.

												Where to start? For a bit of context, I have not yet played AC: Rogue or Unity.For those who don't know, you play as a pirate, and a lot of the assassin-themed gameplay prevalent in the previous titles has taken a backseat to the updated naval combat mechanics from AC3. And honestly, it's for the better. You'll still be doing the classic free-running and assassinating, but the focus generally seems to have moved to good ol' plundering and looting on the high seas with your very own ship: the Jackdaw.The sailing mechanics, while not completely realistic, are a lot of fun and have a surprising amount of player feedback for an Assassin's Creed game. After you severely damage enemy ships with the impressive range of weaponry equipped on the Jackdaw, you'll be given an opportunity to board it. This brings up a short sequence of mini-objectives that have an atmosphere oozing with piratey goodness: swinging from ropes, blasting soldiers with broadside cannons and an amazing soundtrack; which feel absolutely exhilarating at times.Successfully taking over ships gives you materials that can be used to help upgrade the Jackdaw. Cloth, wood and metal are each used in reasonably balanced upgrade trees that lead through a satisfying and addictive progression system. And yes, it is addictive. I spent many hours gathering the materials required to max out my mortar so I could demolish some of the game's many naval bases easily. For the first time ever in an Assassin's Creed game, I actually wanted to collect money to buy things.Now, onto the story. You play as Edward Kenway, a greedy pirate looking to make a quick buck after acquiring an Assassin's uniform (and also the grandfather of AC3's Connor). Ed is easily the best protagonist in the series to date, and I'd even go as far to say he's more fun than Ezio. He just doesn't give a damn about anything, especially early in the game. This is a refreshing perspective and one of the many great things with the story. The dialogue is also great; it's filled with plenty of pirate slang and less ""WHERE IS CHARLES LEE?!"" There's also a great host of supporting characters, which I would say is probably a first for the franchise.Unfortunately, the story still has problems. The modern-day Animus stuff is still here, and although it's been (thankfully) toned down a great deal, it still butchers the pacing and immersion. I used to enjoy the modern-day story, but after the horrendously bad ending of AC3, I just don't give a damn anymore and I'm sure many other people would be more than happy to see it just go away forever and focus on the historical time periods. Besides that, Black Flag seems to have some trouble spelling out specific details that are important to the plot, leaving some sequences a bit of a mess because things are poorly explained and/or illogical. It baffles me that they still haven't figured out a way to make a 2 year time-skip not feel like a 2-hour time-skip. A simple ""Two years later"" screen will fix this issue, Ubisoft!Otherwise, the story is quite good by Assassin's Creed standards. Memorable characters with solid voice acting are the real appeal here.As great as the naval combat is, it certainly feels held back be being an Assassin's Creed game. Namely due to the fact that the awkward free-running mechanics and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat are largely unchanged from AC3. It's always infuriating when the shoddy controls make Edward run up the side of a wall instead of around a corner thanks to a minute level of imprecision, and even worse when you try to jump down to a slightly lower ledge but instead leap off the building like a suicidal maniac. And the combat? Let's just say that they desperately need to update this. It's essentially a glorified quick-time event where enemies line up in a single file and dive into your sword like a bunch of lemmings. Even the naval combat, despite being generally very good, suffers from being too easy and a bit shallow.Regardless, these issues are tolerable. There's plenty of fun to be had in the Caribbean, which by the way, is absolutely gorgeous. The city of Havana in particular rivals Florence and Venice from AC2 as one of the most stunning locations yet. The map is also cluttered with a daunting amount of side missions. Most of these feel a bit samey, but they do offer some unique challenges, such as attempting to decipher a crudely drawn treasure map. Aside from the naval combat sequences (which make up at least 50% of the game), most of the missions are what you'd expect from an Assassin's Creed game; kill such-and-such, jump in that bale of hay, and follow the paranoid Templar for five minutes (unfortunately, it feels like Black Flag has a higher number of those tedious tailing missions than previous iterations). Which a few glaring exceptions, the optional objectives are much more reasonable and enjoyable this time around. No more ""swim across the river without getting wet"" crap.I had a few bugs and frame-rate issues, but thankfully it seems much more stable than AC3, which was ludicrously unpolished. This is definitely a step in the right direction for a series that's becoming stale. I really wish they'd improve the awkward controls at the very least, and make a fully-fledged pirate game unrelated to the Assassin's Creed brand.Something like a 7.5/10 for this one.			"

												Assassins Creed Black Flag is a redemption in the seres since the Last game Assassins Creed liberation that was a big fail. Black Flag is a great game. There is lots to do and you will find yourself doing the extra activities that most games just add but never really motivate you to do them. The story is great and the main charcter Edward Kenway is awesome hes a mix between the ladys man smooth talker Ezio is and the rough thugish figure that is Conner. One thing that sets this game apart is the motives Edward isnt doing these things for honor or glory or because it the right thing to do, his only motive is money and you see that in him during the main story. I would give this game a 9/10 because the only thing keeping this from being a perfect game is well the Assassins Creed parts this would have been much better as just a pirate game. I liked the new touch that they added with the exsploration of Abstergo Entertainment insted of the whole Desmond Miles thing but It was very boring and I would really have liked it better if I could just skip it entirely and go back to being a pirate. Another thing is the old Assassins Creed missions. I loved beinging a pirate and raiding plantations that was new and something that I think people will like to do but the old stalk this guy or evesdrop on this person was very annoying a something that was old and boring a long time ago. Etheir way this game is worth your money and would be a shame if you didnt pick it up.			"

												Who doesn't love pirates? Who doesn't love assassin's?Who doesn't love brutally murdering your foes on the open sea's? If you said me to any of these questions, please leave the store page for AC IV Black Flag right now. Having played every single game in the Assassin's Creed series, I can say with all honesty that the gameplay feels almost the same as all the others, with small little additions that are hardly noticeable.. with the exception of Edward's ship, the Jackdaw, this game can be compared in combat and free roam with most of the other Assassin's Creed games. However we all know that most of us buy from the Assassin's Creed franchise to enrich our minds about the history and story of Desmond Miles, and now moving on from **spoiler alert** his death in AC3, this continues to Subject 17 in the eyes of Edward Kenway. You'll notice that Edward is not like most of the Assassin's, which proves for an incredibly refreshing plot and storyline, and I can't say I was bored at any one point in the game. Yes, some may call me an AC fanboy, and I probably am, but I know friends that have picked this up to be their first Assassin's Creed game and have enjoyed it thoroughlly. Great game, and can't wait for more to come.  "

												This is the best Pirate game I have ever played. When you're sailing over the ocean, the water splashing over your beloved vessel, the wind playing with the custom sails you picked for the Jackdaw (your ship, duh) and at the same time your whole crew sings a shanty ... This alone is worth playing. Of course there's a story that's SLIGHTLY about Assassins, but seriously, it's the story of a man that wanted to become rich and famous and loses so much along the way. Hey, it's a bit like Scarface. Pirate-Scarface. But without the dickishness of scarface. The protagonist, Edward, is just a human being with his mistakes and funny sides and moments that make you really feel awful for him.So yeah, if you are sick of the Assassin's Creed series, but are eager to play a game about pirates:Then get it already and play it, lass!

												The meta-story is totally underdeveloped and disappointing, but the inner plot is reasonable and mostly fun, even if the protagonist is a bit unlovable at times. Worth playing if you liked AC3, but hopefully they'll pick up the meta-story a bit in future DLC.			"

												READ ALL TOP NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME.http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=6805&game=Assassins%20Creed%204%20Black%20Flag test systems ability to play the gamePositive:Game play: This newest installment of the creed series is bring a refined combat system making fighting fluid and easy also fun to use. The new climbing or free running, that had been simplified in number 3 has showed itself once again proving to be fun and easy.Flowing sword play and explosive cannon battles are but icing of the cake for this game.Story: As always the writers at Ubisoft have written a masterpiece, the story seemed to have no strange or abrupt periods. Running smoothly and being the meat on the bones for the story lovers.Sea Battles: One thing I personally liked about number 3 was the fact we could sail, but I also found a distinct lack of instances where we could go sailing. Through out the whole game sailing is a major player and extremely fun to do, commanding naval ships from schooners to mana’ wars and taking forts for the black flag is both exciting and productive being one of the best ways to make money in the game.Graphics: An amazing game when it comes to graphics, texture detail is great and maps are vast with few loading screens NOTE: I am running the game on max settings with every effect enabled on a 1440 x 900 HD resolution screen, my view may be different than yours.Negative:Game play: there are instances where freerunning will fail or you are aiming and try running doing this will fire what ever weapon you are using.Story: I honestly can’t think of anything I would prefer to change.Sea battles: When you're not aiming you fire a usable heavy shot no matter what.Graphics: Tasking on your system, recommend having a high end gaming computer for advanced graphics NOTE: The next gen games such as this and cod ghosts run massively different on almost the exact same systems.Conclusion: MAKE SURE YOU CAN RUN THIS GAME BEFORE YOU BUY! The AC4SP.exe can have crash problems here are some links that helped me fix it http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1827759.htmlhttp://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/727484-AC3SP-exe-Has-stopped-Working-ForumsNOTE: multiple fixes may need to be applied.Personal Score: 8.5/10Having to instal the uplay is very annoying and the lack of a fix for the AC4SP.exe (may be fixed by the time this is out) is also concerning. As a long time fan of the franchise I see nothing wrong with the game itself just issues that are unresolved and annoying boot things like uplay.			"

												By far the best game in the series since AC2. Deeply immersive and featuring one of the most beautiful and complex game-worlds I've played in this year, AC4 let's you live out your pirate fantasies in full. And I think that's the reason it has that magical spark... The spark the series hasn't had since AC2. The urge to go out and explore.Pros: Beautiful graphics, Solid PC Port, Great Voicework, Stealth Refinements, Wonderful Ship Navigation and Combat, Thick Atmosphere, Hours Of Content, A Massive, Immersive Game-World, SEA SHANTIES!Cons: Uninteresting and Rather-Dull Story, Usual Bugs and Issues With Free-Running, A Large Amount Of Irritating 'Tail' Missions.Final Score: 9/10. A fresh and interesting new take on the franchise, and a real return to form.			"

												This is a pirate game, not an assassins game. Forget all that ""Assassin's vs Templars"" nonsense. It is a pirate game, and a fun one at that. Although this is not quite the Sid Meyer's Pirates 2 we never got, this is still an excellent pirate game in its own way, to make up for what could have been. I definitely recommend this for its pirate content.There are a few things that Ubisoft did that irked me wrong, mainly taking away player freedom on certain missions by forcing the player to take the cowards route and flee, instead of staying around and sinking all foes down to Davy Jones' Locker. It was quite revolting.Also a few things in the story don't really make logical sense, and it makes it hard to take the story seriously.Freeroaming and pirating is a delight, although it is a shame that the game area is only little above a 1/3 of the Caribbean, and not the whole Caribbean.Overall I would recommend this to others. 7.5/10			"

												Only other AC I've owned was the first but this was a nice refreshing reinvention of the series with a lot of things to do and a lot of new ways to go about playing. Some people are complaining about it not being a real AC experience because of the additional pirate attributes but I beg to differ, it still very well holds true to the AC mechanics and scheme of things. Enjoy! I know I do (and I normally don't pay for games but bought the Gold Edition of Black Flag, let that tell you how worthy this game is).			"

												So it's finally here on pc... Was it worth the delay you ask?Assassin's Creed 4 is a prequel (of sorts) to Assassin's Creed 3 in which you play as Connor's grandfather Edward Kenway a notorious pirate, Edward is an absolute delight to play as, he is quickly becoming a personal favourite of mine, all the old gameplay factors have transferred over from the previous installments, unfortunately this means evasdrop missions and tailing missions make a return, they still bring forth annoyances, optional objectives are back from those suffering from OCD and wish to 100% the game.The sailing and sea exploration is the main feature of this game. And by god is it amazing. From small boats to giant warships they all carry prescious recources that are required to upgrade your ship, and believe me they're needed if you wish to be in control of the Caribbean, ship controls and battles have been tweaked and tightened since Assassin's Creed 3, they now feel bigger and more intense, the controls feel more responsive so that you can react to these manic battles.The story is still top notch and full on. Voice acting is ace, and the new present day parts are intriguing if slightly dull compared to that of Desmond's final journey in the previous installment.Final Verdict: This game is worth every penny you pay for it, with countless hours of fun out of the story and a thrill ride of a story. 9/10			"

												PROs - My favorite in the series, any fan of AC titles or pirate themed games will love this one. Fast & fun action combat & stealth tactics with all the parkour trimmings, as in any of the AC games prior to Black Flag. Battle enemy crews on the high seas through boarding in naval combat while steering clear of violent, but awesome storms and rogue waves that will quickly send you into the deep watery abyss if your not careful. Hunt animals for hides and rescources for crafting your upgraded gear and even dive for sunken treasure or dig it up with aquired maps. Beautiful graphics, fun Multi-player action with friends and one helluva story that sets the stage for this grand adventure in the Carribean. Highly recommended!CONs - Requires Ufail, er I mean Uplay....          - Uplay          - Uplay          - Requires ""High-End"" pc to enjoy smooth gameplay without audio issues during cutscenes.          - Oh and requires Uplay			"

												If you ask me, Asscreed was at its pinicle in the Assassins Creed 2/ Brotherhood era, and although Revelations wasn't that bad, 3 was a disjointed mess with some cool ideas in place, but overall a hack job.Black Flag  doesn't really work as an AssCreed game in my book.  I never immersed in the huge cities like those of Italy or Palestine, with their towering buildings and crowded streets.  Instead I bummed around the Carribean, mincing through sparsly populated streets whith the occasion tall building and a few trees to climb.  There's bushes and sugar cane everywhere, so stealth is as easy as pie. The NPC reactions to death/fights/assasinations and general shenanigans are as placid as stoned grandmas, and the combat is so godamned easy that there's no insentive to take a stealth approach as you can button mash your way out of EVERY single combat encounter.  The Arkham games and Shadow of More Doors did some really cool and interesting things with this combat system, but Black Flag makes it a cakewalk.  Not every game has to be Dark Souls, but come on lads!  most baddies are just walking cutlass fodder who can't even block!However, strangely enough, Black Flag works incrediably well as a jaunty swashbuckling simulator.  Forget about sneaking around and offing people with your hidden blades, and instead embrace beautiful nautical exploration, exhillirating naval combat, the manical choas that comes with boarding a Man'o'War, the sublime delights of deep-sea diving, and a predicatble but enjoyable plot with some fantastic dialogue and brilliant beards. I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!  I just can't get enough of saling the open seas, my hairy crew of rascals singing their little shanties, looking for Spanish Man'o'Wars to attack, new islands to explore, and new booty to get my hands on!. If only i could skip those bloody eavesdropping sections and tun off the damn desynchronisation bs...   Like I said, Asscreed hasn't been great, in my view, since Brotherhood, and Black Flag doesn't do anything to bring it back in that direction.  But as a Swashbuckling simulator and fun action adventure games there's not more you could wish for.			"

												Where to start? For a bit of context, I have not yet played AC: Rogue or Unity.For those who don't know, you play as a pirate, and a lot of the assassin-themed gameplay prevalent in the previous titles has taken a backseat to the updated naval combat mechanics from AC3. And honestly, it's for the better. You'll still be doing the classic free-running and assassinating, but the focus generally seems to have moved to good ol' plundering and looting on the high seas with your very own ship: the Jackdaw.The sailing mechanics, while not completely realistic, are a lot of fun and have a surprising amount of player feedback for an Assassin's Creed game. After you severely damage enemy ships with the impressive range of weaponry equipped on the Jackdaw, you'll be given an opportunity to board it. This brings up a short sequence of mini-objectives that have an atmosphere oozing with piratey goodness: swinging from ropes, blasting soldiers with broadside cannons and an amazing soundtrack; which feel absolutely exhilarating at times.Successfully taking over ships gives you materials that can be used to help upgrade the Jackdaw. Cloth, wood and metal are each used in reasonably balanced upgrade trees that lead through a satisfying and addictive progression system. And yes, it is addictive. I spent many hours gathering the materials required to max out my mortar so I could demolish some of the game's many naval bases easily. For the first time ever in an Assassin's Creed game, I actually wanted to collect money to buy things.Now, onto the story. You play as Edward Kenway, a greedy pirate looking to make a quick buck after acquiring an Assassin's uniform (and also the grandfather of AC3's Connor). Ed is easily the best protagonist in the series to date, and I'd even go as far to say he's more fun than Ezio. He just doesn't give a damn about anything, especially early in the game. This is a refreshing perspective and one of the many great things with the story. The dialogue is also great; it's filled with plenty of pirate slang and less ""WHERE IS CHARLES LEE?!"" There's also a great host of supporting characters, which I would say is probably a first for the franchise.Unfortunately, the story still has problems. The modern-day Animus stuff is still here, and although it's been (thankfully) toned down a great deal, it still butchers the pacing and immersion. I used to enjoy the modern-day story, but after the horrendously bad ending of AC3, I just don't give a damn anymore and I'm sure many other people would be more than happy to see it just go away forever and focus on the historical time periods. Besides that, Black Flag seems to have some trouble spelling out specific details that are important to the plot, leaving some sequences a bit of a mess because things are poorly explained and/or illogical. It baffles me that they still haven't figured out a way to make a 2 year time-skip not feel like a 2-hour time-skip. A simple ""Two years later"" screen will fix this issue, Ubisoft!Otherwise, the story is quite good by Assassin's Creed standards. Memorable characters with solid voice acting are the real appeal here.As great as the naval combat is, it certainly feels held back be being an Assassin's Creed game. Namely due to the fact that the awkward free-running mechanics and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat are largely unchanged from AC3. It's always infuriating when the shoddy controls make Edward run up the side of a wall instead of around a corner thanks to a minute level of imprecision, and even worse when you try to jump down to a slightly lower ledge but instead leap off the building like a suicidal maniac. And the combat? Let's just say that they desperately need to update this. It's essentially a glorified quick-time event where enemies line up in a single file and dive into your sword like a bunch of lemmings. Even the naval combat, despite being generally very good, suffers from being too easy and a bit shallow.Regardless, these issues are tolerable. There's plenty of fun to be had in the Caribbean, which by the way, is absolutely gorgeous. The city of Havana in particular rivals Florence and Venice from AC2 as one of the most stunning locations yet. The map is also cluttered with a daunting amount of side missions. Most of these feel a bit samey, but they do offer some unique challenges, such as attempting to decipher a crudely drawn treasure map. Aside from the naval combat sequences (which make up at least 50% of the game), most of the missions are what you'd expect from an Assassin's Creed game; kill such-and-such, jump in that bale of hay, and follow the paranoid Templar for five minutes (unfortunately, it feels like Black Flag has a higher number of those tedious tailing missions than previous iterations). Which a few glaring exceptions, the optional objectives are much more reasonable and enjoyable this time around. No more ""swim across the river without getting wet"" crap.I had a few bugs and frame-rate issues, but thankfully it seems much more stable than AC3, which was ludicrously unpolished. This is definitely a step in the right direction for a series that's becoming stale. I really wish they'd improve the awkward controls at the very least, and make a fully-fledged pirate game unrelated to the Assassin's Creed brand.Something like a 7.5/10 for this one.			"

												Never really was a fan of the franchise, but this game is very, very fun. My main gripes with the game, though, are:- The combat system - A lot of people hate it becaue they feel it's insanely easy, and quite frankly I have to agree. Combat feels like a chore when you get far enough in the game.- The cut scenes - Not all of them, just the ones that play after you destroy a ship.- The AI - They might as well not even be there if they're going to be this stupid.Apart from that, though, the game is very fun.

												Here's a TL:DR if you don't want to read the whole thing:The game has a very large amount of stuff to do and, if you take your time to enjoy it, will keep you occupied for a very long time. The pirate story was good, but I didn't like the Animus story. It got in the way of me being a pirate and I hated that.My full review:I absolutely loved this game!It took me 91 hours to finish over 7 days (yeah, I know, that's a lot of time playing in 1 week). Of course I wasn't rushing to finish it, so it could easily be done faster.However, I didn't just rush through the story. I played the game to as close to 100% as I could get. This means I completed all the story missions, found all Animus fragments, chests, hidden treasures and mayan stones. I completed all templar missions and assassin contracts. I hunted and harpooned every type of animal. I bought all the swords, guns and outfits. I also crafted all the outfits I could. I got every Jackdaw upgrade and every upgrade for Edward. I took out all the legendary ships and filled an entire fleet with level 60 Man O' War ships.There are only a few things I don't have for Edward or the Jackdaw, but those things are earned from completing community challenges. Considering that I don't have friends that's a bit harder so I get away with that ;)Now, story wise:I found the Animus extremely annoying. I've been told that it's better in this game than previous games. It only pulls you out of the Animus into the modern day 5 times out of 13 (I think) total main missions. I know it's part of the AC series and all, but the Animus is just annoying to me. I'm perfectly fine with a game having good story, but if it interrupts gameplay then it's just annoying. The Animus thingy does just that.I don't play a game for story, I play it for gameplay. If I want story I watch a movie or, better yet, read a book. Games are for GAMEplay.As I said, a good story is fine. That's why I loved the story within the pirate world, because it didn't interrupt my gameplay. I was a pirate. I felt awesome while I was a pirate. As long as I'm an awesome pirate I'd enjoy the story, but as soon as it says, ""No, you're just a guy testing a game. Here, be boring"" I don't feel awesome and don't enjoy it.Enough being annoyed at the Animus!Pirate story! I enjoyed it. It even stirred up some of those feels closer to the end. If they managed to stay completely away from the Animus I would have possibly said it's the best single player game I've played...ever....and it's up against Just Cause 2 so that would be quite a feat. The Observatory and it's weird doohikkyness was a bit silly, but I was fine with that because I was still a pirate. It's just the animus. Literally, that's the one and only thing I can say I did not enjoy about this game.I know lots won't agree with me. I don't care. A game is about gameplay, the Animus got in the way of gameplay. It's a nuisance. Simple as that.			"

												I bought this game primarilly because I liked the sea battles so much in AC3, But the sea battles aren't as enjoyable in this gameThe game isn't terrible and if you are a AC fan like me you will probablly be able to look past these problems.            The game is very repetative, I suppose you could say that about evey assassins creed game because many of the side missions are to capture templar hideouts or save a citizen. But this latest game multiplied the those feelings, Every battle you fight is only slightly different than the last, forts are identical with only slight differences in armor and cannons.             If you're a hardcore AC fan than go for it, but I wasn't able to play halfway throught the game before I got bored with it.			"

												This is undoubtedly the best Assasin's Creed game yet, and I've played and beat them all. Assasin's Creed IV Black Flag feels like a revitalization of the franchise. It is truly a remarkable experience set in a caribbean atmosphere and centered around pirate lore. The game has numerous addictive qualities that keep pulling me back for more. Sailing the high seas in conquest and search for treasures never gets boring. Upgrading your ship and battling ever increasingly difficult numberrs of foes keeps you on the egde of your seat. The graphics and sound here are truly spectacular, and without taxing your computer hardware. I really can't recommend this game enough. If you enjoyed any of the previous Assasin's Creed games or haven't played them but have an interest in pirate lore, this game is an easy no brainer. Get it now and enjoy the adventure, because games this good only come along once every few years. I'd give it a 10 out of 10.			"

												One of the most moving and motivating games that Ubisoft has ever releasedBlack flag is unlike any  of the other Assassin's Creed games that they have released, Although while they do kinda have the same combat and movement mechanics this game's storyline is quite unique in it's own way as you make your way as being a bad♥♥♥♥♥pirate and assassin, and has a very good stimulator where you can control your own ship and go battle in the sea with amazing experience, the storyline is jaw dropping and if you buy the Gold Edition you get to play as Adewale, won't give any spoilers there but the storyline where he and Kenway had left is one no one should be left out of.TLDR; YOU GET TO BE A PIRATE			"

												Assassins Creed 4 black flag, do i reccomend it? yes, why? well read onAssassins creed black flag continues the series, personally im not too much of an assassins creed fan, the combat is cool but not that special imho and i don't like 3d person only, the climbing of ships and buildings is cool and the entire stealth aspect i like alot, it is a bit lacking in the terms of not being able to manually crouch.What makes me like the game though is the ship combat. it is the only game in recent times that takes age of sail ship combat and only one ever in that way as far as i am aware of, and it might sound weird but that is the entire reason why i bought this.if you allready like assassins creed series this is reccomended, if you dont but like ship combat, i reccomend this, if you like neither just dont bother, i dont know why you are reading this if the last thing is the case.

												After the fairly decent AssCreed3, and considering the many positive reviews for this game, I made the mistake of having slightly higher expectations than usual. This unsurprisingly led to some disappointment (yes, sadly going against the trend in most other reviews). But once I recalibrated my expectations to “standard AssCreed fare”, it was not too bad.The story is messy and silly. It has some good parts but most of it is mediocre - overall not as good as AssCreed3 in my opinion. I have the suspicion casual or younger gamers may like it more. It sorely lacks atmosphere when compared to games like Dishonored or The Witcher or films like 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. The script is full of plot holes (even more than usual). Half of the game is fairly serious and makes some sense, but the other half is silly and does not make any sense. This inconsistency harms immersion. The main character is decent, but does not quite have the charisma of Ezio or Haytham from previous games.The missions and gameplay built on the story are very bland and repetitive. Almost any potentially interesting story scenario is reduced to a handful of copy-paste follow/sneak/kill/eavesdrop gameplay designs. It seems like the devs were slightly lazier than usual - AssCreed3 missions were far from perfect, but still seemed slightly more varied and hand-crafted.The difficulty balance of the gameplay is poor. AI detection feels arcade and inconsistent. Stealth areas are severely overpopulated with guards, meaning you are forced to look at the minimap all the time to have any chance of avoiding detection. If you don't reload checkpoints often, open combat is nearly inevitable, which in turn is far too easy. This makes trying to play stealth frustrating, because the odds feel unfairly stacked against you, and it is always so much easier to just fight and kill everyone. But fighting gets boring quickly - you just spam attacks, then counter when prompted, and repeat that indefinitely.The sandbox gameplay has been brought to the fore, but like the main missions, it is very arcade, bland, and repetitive. The open world is large, but most places all look the same. Compared to AC3, there seems to be slightly less content overall, though still more than enough. The problem is a lack of quality, not quantity. Still things like naval battles and boarding enemy ships are novel for a while and work fairly reliably, which is more than can be said of naval battles in a Total War game (Shogun II etc). The sea shanties (songs) are a nice touch, and possibly the single best feature in this game.Graphics are the best yet for an AssCreed game, and the first in my opinion to just about match those of Crysis 1 (released 6 years earlier). The water out at sea looks particularly good. The visual quality does not hold up everywhere though - quite a few ugly meshes and textures here and there. The default settings are poorly optimised - you need to manually tweak the settings to get the best visuals while keeping the FPS high. Ship physics are decent and must feel amazing to the average console peasant, but if you have an eye for realism and have been on a real ship, it still leaves much to be desired. Your 150-ton brig behaves like it has the mass and manoeuvrability of a modern olympic racing yacht combined with the stability of a modern river ferry (complete with bow thrusters). You can sail straight into the wind with no speed loss. Enemy ships also handle like powerboats. In some ways the sailing physics were more realistic in AC3 - you could not sail into the wind, and it felt slightly more natural, though admittedly less reliable (momentarily flying ships etc).PC controls are as bad as usual. They are not game-breaking, but they do work against you - I messed up a lot of missions because my character would do the wrong thing like randomly climbing a wall. A few times just before successfully capturing a huge enemy ship, I would fall from a mast to my death due to glitched controls. The checkpoint system has its usual annoyances and reloads sometimes caused technical problems like missing quest items (requiring quiting to desktop and reloading). I encountered more bugs and glitches and generally rushed content here than in any previous AssCreed game.Overall, for me, AC4 is a mediocre AssCreed game that wasted a lot of potential. It is not a “bad” game, but it does not deserve any of the hyped reviews. I can only recommend it at the steam sale price.			"

												Here are just some of the things you can do in Assassin's Creed 4: climb a tower, hunt a whale, hide in a haystack, steer a ship in a storm, stick a sword through a man's eye socket, shoot an iguana, stab a shark, stand atop a church balcony and sprinkle coins onto the people below, regardless of their beliefs.But you can't just crouch when you want to, which seems a bit odd for a game that spins around sneaking, subterfuge and poking holes in the heads of a secret war between assassins and templars. The struggle for supremacy intersects with old-fashioned analogue piracy in Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, which lets you sail across the massive caribbean, swim in its perfectly turquoise waters and make any treasure your own. Not having a squat button in the middle of a meticulous recreation of Havana is the ultimate first-world, 18th century problem.You do, however, bend your knees and lower your stance automatically as soon as you enter a bush, and the good news is these stealth shrubs are everywhere. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is a more honestly designed game than the last, appearing cognizant of where it needs to lay down some rug-shrubs to cover up the seams between – how many systems is it now? There's sword-fighting, pickpocketing, free-running, air assassinating, diving, sailing, eavesdropping, harpooning; all slave to another massive, richly rendered slice of history. And it's all the better for designers understanding the monster they've created.			"

												Wasn't much of a fan of Assassins Creed in the past and had only played Brotherhood and Revelations (which I didn't finish) but I decided to pick this game up when it was on sale for cheap. Ran at 60fps constantly at 1080p and every setting on the highest possible with an I7-6700k at 4.7GHz and a GTX 690 (SLI seems to work pretty well).I've really enjoyed playing the singleplayer and while the trailing missions were annoying (they always are) other parts such as the ship gameplay and the edgy banter had between Edward and the other characters was great, especially Stede Bonnet. The characters were memorable and really helped make the game realistic. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the diving aspect of the game due to getting attack by every damn creature that lives down there but it's not an important part of the game so it can be avoided.I found very few bugs and glitches during gameplay and nothing that impacted the game negatively causing me to have to restart a mission. The game looks beautiful and plays beautifully as well (I was using an Xbox 360 controller for my playthrough).Would recommend if you want to blow up some ships and stab some spaniards.			"

												Really great game, great gameplay, graphics and soundtrack. Storywise, I wished this game would focus more on the Assassin's VS Templars war as the storyline is quite heavily based on piracy and naval missions (not neccesarily a bad thing though). Edward Kenway is a liked character even though I wasn't a huge fan of the fact he doesn't show much knowledge regarding the Creed and what it takes to be part of the Assassin's Order. Most of the game, playing as the self-centered and arrogant Edward Kenway that's driven by money doesn't really feel like an Assassin to me. His character development thoughout the end of the game is good but it's not smooth, it feels somewhat forced. As a major fan of the Assassin's Creed series and storyline, I personally think this game would be better off as a pure pirate game rather than part of the AC series.			"

												I've played all the Assassin's Creed installments previous to this one, and I have enjoyed this one the most (Ezio is second best). I loved the size of the world and the large number of quests and missions. I was afraid the boat fighting would be clunky like in Assassin's Creed 3, but it was actually very fun. It was satisfying taking down larger ships with speed and better tech. I also really enjoyed the setting in the caribbean, with great artistry on the landscapes and on the water. Even the animals were fun to kill or just watch. I highly recommend this game.			"

												A thing of absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beauty!Tried a few of the older Assassins Creed games and never quite got on with the controls but as this one seemed to be a good jumping on for the later stuff I gave it a go and am VERY glad I did.Great action, fun combat both hand to hand and ship based and absolutely STUNNING to look at.Have just finished the main story. It's a game I'll now keep installed so when the mood takes me I can jump back into the world for an hour and go looking for new stuff to do as, like most open world games, you can finish it but only have completed 50% of what the maps promise. There are contract to take, sharks and whales to hunt and loads more. Oh, and being Cardiff born it rocked hearing so many Welsh accents in a game...even if one NPC I bumped into called me a sheep shagger  :)Only downside being I'm now addicted to rum (captain morgans of course) and the wife has said she'll punch me if I tell her I want to plunder her booty one more time.

I haven't had any issues with uPlay or the like at all.The story so far seems interesting enough.But I do have one issue with it, and that's the graphics.See, my laptop is, admittedly, a bit old. It's not really 'primed' for these kinds of games.I can run AC3 at all-High settings at a resolution of 1360x768. Same, oddly, with MGSV.I was hoping to do the same with this, but unfortunately I can't.Instead of scaling the resolution to match your screen, it keeps it in a black border. This means that I have to squint.And this wouldn't be so bad were it not that, even when I change my desktop resolution to match, it stays bordered.I initially refunded this game, but I'm willing to give it a shot with some tinkering. I just wish the graphics customizationwas a bit better implemented.Overall, I'd give it a 7.5-8/10. "

												Possibly the best entry in the series so far, and a huge improvement over 3. The main storyline quests are still a fairly linear experience without much freedom to deviate from the scripted manner you're supposed to complete missions in, but in terms of sidequests the game opens up incredibly early, and apart from a handful of storyline-specific locations that don't unlock until later in the game you're free to explore more or less wherever you want. Ship-to-ship combat is a big part of the open world experience, and it's very well designed and satisfying with a huge number of upgrades available to improve your ship's capabilities, and the option to capture enemy ships for bonus loot and put them to work in your fleet.Unfortunately the melee combat is kind of a mess - especially in large encounters where it can be almost impossible to attack a specific enemy reliably, which is doubly infuriating when faced with a combination of enemies that are immune to different types of attacks. And the free running still has a mind of its own sometimes, resulting in Edward being really, really interested in running up and down a wall continually instead of going around corners. But apart from a few minor control issues, the overall game experience is a huge improvement on the previous instalment, and the number and variety of side activities provides plenty to keep you playing beyond completing the main storyline.

												I don't know if I recommend this, honestly. Just read my criticisms and decide for yourself.I only played the first and second AC. The first was a clumsy mess of a game but very innovative. I remember thinking to myself ""Can't wait to see what they do next, with all issues solved. This is going to be the go-to formula for AAA games in the next few years"". I guess I was right, AC 2 did solve all its issues and expanded on the original. And this did became the go-to formula for AAA games even to this day.Then, after many years without playing an AC game, but playing plenty of sprouts of AC, like Batman, Just cause and many others, I gave AC another try with Black Flag. Heard great things about it, so why not. I don't remember exactly how AC 2 felt when playing, so my main parameter for comparison comes from Batman games, and I don't know if Batman really improved on the formula or if this AC took a few steps backwards.About free running/climbing. The level/missions' design certainly doesn't respect the limitations of the system. The game makes you chase enemies through narrow streets, so you will find yourself climbing a wall that was exactly perpendicular to the direction you were running because you brushed against it. Then the game makes you stalk people, but you can't rely on this movement scheme will do what you think it should. When you are two levels above the guards and want to drop to the second level you might end up doing a somersault with a rolling finale on the guards' feet instead. The parkour system is actually impressive, with glitches here and there, like getting stuck at small steps and not finding the occasional edge, but it's the level design that simply doesn't know what it can do well. On the sea there is a similar issue. It's all very fun, sailing through storms, attacking other ships, upgrading etc. Until the game decides to throw an escort mission. Oh god. An escort mission. On a ship. What else? underwater level? slippery ice level? (retro references :P) And this is yet another example of mission design that doesn't seem to respect the mechanics a whole lot. Sure, you can finish this level, but not with skill. You will play again and again until you know where the ships are coming, just like you did for the chase and stalk missions. It's not the kind of level design that makes me happy. It feels like a chore.Does all of this break the game? not at all. It does make it frustrating about half the time. In fact, it feels like AC1 all over again! I remember feeling exactly like this, admiring the potential and wanting to see what comes next in the series. Only now I'm not that curious anymore, specially after I heard this is the best of the series since AC2.			"

												Fantastic game. I love it. I will write a longer review when I have time. Added quite a bit. This is not an assassin game but a pirate game. You're not going to be playing Assassin's Creed but Pirate's Creed instead.PROS1. Sailing the Seven SeasI love this part. The sailing engine is amazing. From the rogue waves to the ship upgrades to the slow creaking turning of the ship to the naval combat to the ship boarding to exploring the ship, they are all amazing.The sailing seems to be the most interesting thing about Black Flag. You can see the waves splash onto the deck, steer away from water spouts and rogue waves.2. Diving Bell missionsI love diving underwater. I love the exploring the wreckages, the jellyfish, sea urchins, sharks, currents and even the moray eels. I especially loved the one where searching the wreck finds a hidden path into the smuggler's den. Kudos to the game designer who thought of that.3. ParkourJump and climb anything. Almost anything. I prefer climbing special landmarks with tricks in the climb compared to boring poles and wooden A frames. E.g. The windmill where you meet Mary Ree Kidd vs the run-of-the-mill synchro points which you try to do to see all the hidden locations.4. Legendary ShipsSadly, there are only 3. 2 Man-O-Wars, 1 Heavy Armour and 1 Fog battle. They come with a minor bug where you're unable to detach from the Legendary event so you can't fast travel after a death.5. Stealth MissionsI like the ""Do not get detected"" missions the most. They make you feel more like an assassin. 6. The Ending SceneOh. I find it so well done. I was totally not expecting it. The little girl and the song. Muah..7. Hidden EnemiesThe Guardians are a good example. You can't see them hiding in the bushes unless you use Eagle Vision.CONS1. BugsLots of them. I found at least 3 in one playthough. Most of them revolve around Fast Travelling with the Jackdaw. Imagine ghost shipsa. Assassination in the Fort BugsThe designer did not consider that the players might take over the fort before taking the assassination contract.2. Not-so-amazing thingsThe synchronization for the Eagle Points aren't exactly fun. The views aren't exactly majestic. It's kind of an expectation vs reality situation. You climb all the way up and you expect something cool. Sadly, you see boring vegetation. I do this just to get Fast Travel.A good one that I've seen is in Guild Wars 2. They do know how to make their points majestic.3. Sticky HandsYou grip onto anything. If you dash into a bush next to a house, be prepared to accidentally climb up the side and hang from the ledge.4. Tailing.The dancers in Havana. You can stand directly in front of the guy you are following and the dancers will make you invisible.5. Missing SoldiersAI does not notice missing soldiers.6. Berzerk DartsWay to easy to kill my targets and complete the game. The berserk darts ensure the poisoned target dies at the end.7. Ship Repairs Mid BattleEvery time you board a ship, you are given the option to repair the Jackdaw. This can even be done when you're surrounded by enemy ships. The repair cut-scene is also pretty repetitive and gets boring.8. In-Game HypocrisyKilling humpback whales, white whales and sharks are absolutely fine. Killing a cow, goat or flamingo will result in ""This ancestor did not do anything wrong."". Pretty silly in my opinion.9. Aveline MissionToo hastily done. Many bugs. Defending the black lady in the fort was a major bug. If you didn't wait until she was next to the door lever when you killed the last guard, the game would not be able to continue.10. E for EverythingFor looting, dropping and whistling. You can imagine the problems that ensue from accidentally hiding behind a wall while trying to loot a treasure chest. They need to add an additional key called ""R"".11. Ship Combat and Travel SpeedIt's actually possible to somehow switch to Travel Speed while in mid combat. This is most annoying.12. Legendary Ship ProblemsThe Legendary Ships can spin on its axis while in combat, with sharp 90 degree turns. It's ridiculous to watch. The rewards are purely 20,000 Reale. It's not bad but not good either. I was hoping to capture the Legendary Ships and make them part of the Kenway Fleet. E.g. Flying Dutchman, Black Pearl, Mary Celeste.NEUTRAL1. SecretsI used to think the secrets were worthwhile. However, there are just too many to do, spread out over too many locations, for just an armour outfit. It's not worth the effort. I was hoping to get more story canon from the game with a secret boss. The game designer does not know how to do a proper secret. The ones that are more interesting area. Mayan Treasures b. Abstergo Entertainment colleagues computers to the c. Treasure Maps. The most rewarding ones are the computers but they have a very lousy minigame where you rotate a sphere and you try to highlight a green line. The frogger mini-game is pretty lame together with the wave mini-game.2. TeleportationIt makes the game seem smaller. It's neither bad nor good. Perhaps, an interesting travel mini-game/zone is in order. Teleportation makes it easier to get from point to point but it destroys the mystique of a large world.SUGGESTIONS1. Special AchievementsHow about an achievement will real-life value? E.g. Complete a Super Rare achievement and Ubisoft will reward you with a free Ubisoft game. It doesn't have to be an expensive game. Just an old Ubisoft game that you think that no one really buys and you're willing to give away.No DLC for the game itself. Those things ought to be free by default.2. OfficersA group of men who follow orders with no leader? Seems odd. Perhaps a captain who would be a valuable target. The captain would also be an additional difficulty level as he will investigate any men who are missing from their posts. You can see that quite a few officers all over the map but they function as a more difficult kill, not a unit leader.3. SecretsDo it Final Fantasy style. Additional story with secret bosses, not boring♥♥♥♥♥outfits.4. Advanced FishingWhat's a nautical game without some fishing? I know that harpooning is cooler but some advanced fishing would be good. Spear fishing or fishing large fish would be cool too. Fishing spots where you catch fish to eat/sell/trade would be interesting. Some fishing minigame would be interesting too.5. Improved SailsI would like to gear 3 speed and not be capped at 2.6. Night RaidsI don't know how one takes over an entire ship on his own but perhaps a night raid with your pirate crew would be interesting.7. Smuggling / TradingSell opium, spice, mangoes, guns, slaves, liquor and more. Rum and sugar seem kind of limited. If you're noted for selling illegal goods, you'll be searched. If you refuse, the authorities attack you.8. Wanted PostersAn infamous pirate ought to have a bounty placed on him.9. Enemy Ships that Run AwayAlways the enemy fights, it makes you wonder why a gunboat would think it stands a chance.10. Pearl DivingHow about giant clams that clamp down? Pearls from giant oysters.11. LighthousesThis is synonymous with nautical games. Why isn't there a lighthouse that generates interaction?12. Milky WayI've been on a ship. The sky is very different with a lot of stars and you can see the Milk Way. This would be a wondrous visual effect.13. Ship SpecialistsQuartermaster, Doctor, Cook, etc. This is from Sid Meier's Pirates. It would be most intriguing to have a crew of ""heroes"" just like One Piece.14. Changing ShipsWhy are you stuck with just the Jackdaw?			"

												As far as pirate games go, this is by far the best one out there. As for a game about an assassin... not so much. Those parts are still a ton of fun, but what makes this game great is that you are given the freedom to go pirating as you see fit in a completely open world full of enemies, activies, and tons of great sights. Not to mention that the story ain't half bad either! All in all, this is a must for fans of assassin's creed and newcomers to the series.			"

												It's not a clone nor a rehash of other assassin's creed games, and therefore it really stands out. Pirating, cool ship battles, and lack of a convoluted mess of a story makes it really refreshing to play. Looks gorgeous too, but won't run well on low end cards. Happy pirating.			"

												I have been an Assassin's creed fan sense the first one. I've always thought the story lines were profound. The story line for Black Flage  does not dissapoint at all but gives a new twist and its enjoyable. Also, it does not seem as repetitive as the others which is nice. I would  give this game a 10/10, but I'm also a hard core fan so some might see it as a 8 or 9 out 10.			"

												A lot of people say this game is good. And a lot of other people say this game isnt good. I think this game is FUN. See how I wrote FUN in capital? Yes, this game is a lot of FUN. Most people buy games and finish it quickly. I am not that kind of a person. I finished AC III in 2 years. By taking breaks and doing most of the side missions , getting the assassins in my crew etc. and I had so much fun doing those stuff. I also finished AC II , brotherhood , revelations. Those were a similar experience. But this is gameplay. If we look at the story Ac II was the best in my opinion. Right now I have spent 11 hours into Ac 4. And I am at 13%. I dont do main missions frequently. I think I am in the 3rd sequence right now in the 4th memory. I just roam around and find mayan stuff, upgrade my ship, attack ships etc. Right now im trying to get the armor that needs 4 keys. So i have a lot to go. Right now the story is going excellent. About the GRAPHICS... I play this on a laptop. So I am not able to play this on the best graphics. But even on low graphics  I think its slightly better than xbox360. I hope this helped and if you are an AC fan just like me BUY THIS GAME!!!            "

												A definate stand out in the series, possibly the best.  AC4 strips away the what was clunky about the previous title.  By pullling the camera back again giving a wider range with the big open environments we can finally fully appreciate what a next gen Assassin's Creed game can bring.The world is huge giving more than enough to exlpore after completion and ofter has you wondering far off the main storyline to persue your own interest.  As a pirate you can truly go anywhere or go at whatever you want.  Side tasks and optional missions are no longer a grind and instead have you going on just to persue them.Another cool thing is the AC4 Black Flag Companion App which syncs with your game.  While playing you can use your Andriod device for World Map and Treasure Maps.  You're also able to run your naval fleet remotely for shipping runs or look through the animus database.			"

												Forgive me, I have a tear in my eye.The only thing that keeps this game from consuming my days is my constantly overheating computer. It took everything new that worked from Assassin's Creed III, and has taken the series in a new direction through a story I'm eager to uncover. I haven't even encountered the Assassins properly yet (I assume they will make an appearance), and I'm having a great time plundering Spanish ships and bringing retribution upon those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slavers.I've played 13 hours and so far it has blown me away. I've been waiting for a game like this since the original xbox, when I played the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' game. I'm actually finding myself wanting to get all the collectibles, which is so far rare for a AC game. The dual sword combat also mixes it up a little, and multiple pistols only furthers the feeling of novelty this game has brought to the table.I still see the same kill moves over and over again, but it doesn't bother me enough to stay away from the game more than a day or two. I would not recommend this game to anyone without a good cooling system, as it's hard on your computer. My mediocre rig can actually handle the game, just not for long- so be warned!She's a devil in the sack. You'll love it.			"

												Note: I Haven't completed the game yet.I've been a long time fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise for many years, and Black Flag seems to be my favorite of the series to play. However I would have to say that Edward isn't my favorite, as it has to go to Ezio in AC2. Anyway, This game has a ton of places to explore side missions to complete and it's just damn fun. As of now my only complaints are, the endless amount of grinding to upgrade your ship, and the annoying tailing missions.  Graphically the game is beautiful at max settings.  Overall this game is great and I can't recommend it enough.  Go buy it!			"

												This is my first review and I am trying to portray everything I think so feel free to leave feedback for me or questions in the comments!Assassin's Creed IV may have reached the pinnacle game out of my Assassin's Creed collection.First the bad: Technical Issues: A pain in the a** to preload and some bugs, but Ubisoft has been pretty good about patching them out so it shouldn't apply to anybody. The worst glitch I had by far, a kill objective that wouldn't go away and led to nothing, has been patched out, and aside from that most of the bugs I encountered in the game were actually quite funny, like my ship disappearing and leaving a hole in the sea, and rising out of the hole like it was some kind of dimensional ship later. One of my friends did report a lot of crashing for him when he first installede the game, but that has been fixed. One REALLY BAD issue is that two of my Assassin's Creed-playing friends have had their save files reset by the game and had to start all over again, so keep your eye out for that. I can see why they waited three weeks to release it, as it would've been much more of a mess if they hadn't. Also on a side note, I had an SSD that made loading screens nonexistent, but when I had to move it over to my 7200 RPM hard drive to make room for BF4, and the load times were much much longer, and it took away from the awesomeness of fast traveling.Kenway's Fleet: There is a feature you unlock relatively early int he story that is similar to the Assassin Brotherhood from Brotherhood/Revelations/AC3 where you can send your ships on trading missions for easy cash. The only catch is that you have to unlock the ships from in-game (which I love) and that you have to use resources you get from fighting in ship battles inside the Kenway's fleet minigame, which is terrible. You pick ships that go against their ships, make sure the Odds of success is high, and press the space bar. You have to watch the ships slowly duke it out, and the only thing you can do during then is maybe if you feel like it use a limited fire barrel that does a very small amount of damage on the enemy ship. I know this is supossed to be for the mobile app, but it is still VERY tedious and they still have to port it over to phone. It is an easy way to get cash and I am very very happy Ubisoft didn't make this a giant microtransaciton-fest, but I only do it if I have to. Friends can help your ships out on missions by speeding them up or healing them, but overall it kinda sucks.No pets: Come on...Home island: Not too long into the game you get access to an island you can build up similar to the Homestead from AC3. However, unlike AC3, there are no missions, you just throw large amounts of money at people so they can build things for you. For example, you can build a great fire thing that will let the Drunken Pirate group you can recruit be free. It's better than nothing, but I actually liked the Homestead missions.Combat (kind of): It hasn't changed much from AC3, it is still extremely fun to kill people and I have pride in my 5,000+ kills in the game. The only thing I miss from previous games is that in this you only have three main weapons you always have with you: two swords you hold at the same time, your fists, and hidden blades. Anything else you can only pick up for a small amount of time.What is good/great:Story: I loved the story. The pirate one, while not as good as AC2/Brotherhood (and I never expect any AC game to measure up that high) it was really good. In the near future world, you play a mute first-person Abstergo employee who does things with memory and stuff because I don't want to spoil AC3 for you. While I wish the story connected a little more to the end of AC3 (aside from the ending), I know that this lets Ubisoft make as many games as they want until Assassin' Creed dies and they can make a final game. The piratey story focuses more on pirates than anything else. Edward just picks up an Assassin suit in the beginning and says ""I like this"". He doesn't become a true Assassin until the very end. However, they set a end goal with the Assassin storyline and let you go about your piratey buisnesss, mostly pertaining to Nasau, the pirate HQ of sorts.Tutorial/Controls: It is not very long, and aside from the diving bell, you get almost everyhting not very far into the game. They have definitely learned from the last game in that regard. I just switched to PC this game, I used to play them on Xbox, and the keyboard/mouse controls felt natural and all the buttons mapped out (Xbox 360 controllers are suportted but mine broke and I wanted to get used to the keyboard controls). They have a system where if the game notices you keep failing at something (like block) it will remind you how to do it. It is very cool, and if you don't like it you can turn it off (I tihnk)Multiplayer: While still not as good as single player, the multiplayer is very fun. I was able to quickly start a clan with my friends and we went on Wolf Pack which was very fun. While most of my AC friends haven't even touched multiplayer, it is a very oversighted feature that should be played for a bit at least.Graphics: I got my GTX 770 a day before my AC4 game came out, so I was able to see the glorious visuals that completely eclipse anything the Xbone and PS4 have to offer. I could max it out at 30-50 FPS (driver updates will make it run better) and if I turned down non-essential features like anti-aliasing and kept shadows and texture quality high, it looks gorgeous at 40-60 FPS. My friend has an older computer, but he says it looks decent if you don't mind turning a couple settings down. Keep in mind NVIDIA cards have bonuses like God Rays and some antialiasing and other stuff that is cool but not essential.Combat: Still very fun, very addictive, and has more challenge than the one-button Ezio days. It always makes me happy to see a room filled with dead Spaniards or British.Ship Stuff: An incredible addition to the game. It isn't a sailing sim by any means, but it is fun to sail your ship around, stopping at Caribbean islands to get some booty or to find some Assassin Contracts. Ship combat is much more compex than AC3, with many weapons at your disposal. It looks pretty too, and the best part is that if you want all the loot the ship has to offer you bring its health down then board it, going along the rope swings, manning the swivel guns, or jumping from your mast to theirs. It becomes normal Assassin's Creed again, with the objective of killing people and doing other things like blowing up gunpowder or cutting down flags/ When you take over a ship, you can either destroy it to repair your ship, lower your notoriety (it only applies to ships now) or send it to Kenway's Fleet, which I covered earlier. Either way, you get resources, crew members, and sometimes money. Resources can either be sold (like rum or sugar) or used for upgrades (like cloth, wood, and metal). More crew members means more people firing your cannons and helping you fight the people you're boarding (even though they are really bad at it) You can also ""save pirates"" in some of the land segments, where you kill their captors and they will join your crew. Also, if you're desperate, you can buy crew members or lower notoriety from people near tavens. Speaking of notoriety, if you destroy too many ships they will send bounty hunters after you. You can just attack them like any other ship, it's just that they have red sails and will look for you. I didn't find ship battles to be TOO hard because I was great at resource management and it didn't take too long to get all the best upgrades.OVERALL: Buy it. It is amazing. Friend me on Steam or Uplay (wkhammond)Time to beat story: I did many of the side quests and such before, and it took 30-35 hours to beat.Advice or tips: Uplay is required to play it as anotehr form of DRM. I didn't mind it, but some may MOR BELO			"

												The game of the Year 2013.There are always hidden treasures, hidden locations, hidden perspectives for viewing pleasure on how beautiful the world of black flag is. 3D map exploration is kinda a dead design in the last 10 years. Remember how fun we could get from a dunguon/world map exploration like old school JRPG. For whatever the reasons I found games in the last 10 years are missing that fun factor. However, the sea/land exploration aspect in AC4 black flag is amazingly crafted. It is the best game I played in the last 10 years that can bring back the feeling of adventure from old school JRPG.

												After the disappointment that was Assassin's Creed III, Black Flag is a step in the right direction for the premier run-jump-kill franchise. There's still a lot of annoying elements, such as the outdated combat system and clearly-not-fit-for-purpose control scheme, but the majority of the game is actually a whole lot of fun. The much-touted naval system is an improvement on AC3's, but I feel like they're putting too much emphasis on it. It's almost like they'd rather distract you than fix the obvious problems with the core gameplay mechanics. Nevertheless, it's a feature and a mighty impressive one at that. If you weren't a fan of the real-life side of the AC storyline, then you'll be disappointed that it's back, though it seemed a bit less pretentious than in previous outings. It's always been one of those love it or hate it scenarios, but I felt they did a better job this time. It's not a difficult game, either, which can be good or bad depending on your preference, but the lack of difficulty actually seemed to make it more fun to play, as you could set up awesome air assassinations much more easily. The stealth sections are much more forgiving than in previous titles, but still can be frustrating if you're going for undetected objectives.Outside of those issues above, the game is a gem and legitimately fun to play. Kenway has swag much like Ezio did in AC2, which filters down through the story and into the game itself, as every action he takes is saturated in swashbuckling cool. A highly enjoyable game with minor issues that don't really detract too much from the game experience.			"

												Assassin's Creed 4 is so very close to being the Pirate game I've always wanted. The variation of activities to do kept the game moving along, pacing isn't an issue when the game gives me the freedom to choose. Often times I'd spend a few hours sailing the seas, harpooning, stopping to pick up some lost treasure, or liberating ships from their captains to add to my own fleet... all between doing the story missions.Environments have been given plenty of detail and character of their own. Havana, Nassau, Kingston, and the island ports all have a unique ambience. The ocean, where you will likely spend a good amount of time, also keeps things interesting with changing weather and wave conditions. The water even has a correct appearance when you see the light shining through the wave.Combat can still have some odd stumbles, but the majority of the time it felt smooth. Weapon variation seems to have taken a backseat in this incarnation. Dual swords, pistols, hidden daggers, and fists are what you'll use the most, with rope darts making a very late entry. I didn't use the heavy weapons much in the previous games, but I had hoped to see some one handed fencing to round out the swashbuckling experience.The Good: Player character has personality, something AC3 lacked. Large open world is fun to explore. Controls feel improved.The Bad: Storyline feels disjointed at a few steps along the way. The ending wasn't very satisfying. Lack of weapon variation.			"

												Not only the best Assassin's Creed entry since brotherhood, but an excellent pirate game in its own right. The story and characters are far and away the most well-done out of any of the previous ACs, and the open world aspects are substantial and engaging. While pirating itself is done well, fleet commanding leaves a lot to be desired, and the present-day sections (in true AC fashion) can feel like a distraction from the main game. Though there is not a huge incentive to explore many of the smaller islands outside of 100% completition, other side quests and city exploration make up for it.My biggest critique is that apart from optional objectives and quests where detection results in failure, stealth is rarely the best option. The combat--while fluid and enjoyable--is easy enough that Edward will have pretty much no problem with any group size as long as you are attentive. That said, the combat is very visceral and well-animated, and enjoyable despite it's lack of challenge.Overall, an excellent title and easily one of the best Assassin's Creed games to date. The non-Desmond based story makes it ideal for new players entering the series as well.			"

												I finished this game after dicking around with it for a long time and all I have to say is...oh...my...god.This is a perfect recovery after AC3 and is one of best AC games to date. The only AC games that kept my interest long enough to actually finish were AC1, AC2, AC: Brotherhood and this AC. The story is amazing and meeting infamous, half-drunk pirates like Blackbeard, Horningold, Kidd, Rackam and etc never gets old. Their personalties make the cutscenes worth watching and the dialouge interesting. For me, the most important aspect of a game is story and characters. In AC3, Connor was very unlovable and I was always apatheic towards his situation. As for Edward Kenway, he is the epitome of a pirate character. He is charming, charismatic and extremely lovable even when he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You relate to him, feel sorry for him and desperately want him to outlive all his fast-going pirate comrades. The end of this game is also heartwarming and is extremely satisfying, leaving the player wanting more Kenway. In a world run by anarchy, debauchery and betrayal, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the epitome of a pirate experience.			"

												Arguably the best Assassin's Creed game, and a very fun pirate game on top of that. Builds on most of the mechanics of the previous games, while also fleshing out some of the half finished ideas from Assassin's Creed III (hunting, sea combat, etc) and making them actually fun and useful.The story is good. Edward's journey is a good one. The writing and voice acting are all well done, and there are some memorable characters.The 'ground' gameplay is  very much more of the same Assassin's Creed that your'e probably already used to if you are considering this. If you weren't a fan of stabbing dudes, climbing to viewpoints, parkouring all over the place, etc then you probably still will not enjoy this part of the game. It's not challenging, really, but it's fun.The sea combat is surprisingly good. Cannons are all handled well (and you have quite a few varieties). Your ship can be upgraded with better armor, cannons, new types of cannons, etc. You can board or sink ships, take their treasure or commandeer them for your fleet (sort of like the Brotherhood 'minigame' from the previous games). Well done and very fun. Sailing the high seas is made even better by the sea shanties you collect for your pirate crew to sing.There are quite a bit of side objectives to complete, some old and some new. Assassin missions, collectables, and chests are all still present. New challenges include harpooning whales, naval battles, and capturing forts (sort of like capturing templar bases in the older games). I 92%ed my save, and it took me about 40 hours. I imagine it'd be about 50 if you wanted to 100% it. Maybe a bit less.I was a fan of the modern components of the previous Assassin's Creed games, even though I understand that a lot of other people were not. A new tangent of the modern story is present in this game, and it's handled in a slightly different way. If you were not a fan, there's probably 15-30 minutes of 'modern' gameplay that you are forced to do, and the rest is optional. If you're into the series/lore, there are a lot of different tidbits you can find that relate back to previous games, future games, etc. Pretty cool.Overall, great game. Highly recommended even if you haven't played previous Assassin's Creed games, and even more so if you have and liked them.			"

												Ubisoft has done it again. I bought this game at a later date to get it at a lower price and in the hopes that all the bugs and wrinkles would be ironed out.I don't need to complete that paragraph, do I?I bought the game mainly for the multiplayer, and haven't played the single-player beyond the first island, so this review won't be going into that. I am sure it also has its share of annoyances. In any case, I was hoping that Ubisoft would have learned from all the ♥♥♥♥ups of the past, but no.There are three kinds of bugs: the first kind is the one you can live with. The other kind is one that prevents you from playing, something that is often a mercy.The third kind is the kind that is tantalizing, something you think you could ignore... but no. It is there, ♥♥♥♥ing up your day, all the time in the most frustrating ways possible.I don't get angry at games. Except... Assassin's Creed Multiplayer.The MP is a mess of connection and server-side issues. For example, for me the leveling mechanism does not work properly, and I will be rewarded with in-game skill point currency I am due if I am very lucky during a particular session. Then there are the constant matchmaking and connection issues that plague the game itself. We live in the far-flung future of 2014, and Ubisoft still hasn't figured out how to program a multiplayer game that doesn't ♥♥♥♥ with you at random.I tried to reset my password at the Ubisoft support site, but even their password reset system is bugged, because they ♥♥♥♥ed up their recaptcha system by providing two obligatory fields when the captchas themselves are just providing single-word Googlemaps address numbers nowadays.This is a good time to mention the time I discovered that when registering into Ubisoft-something-or-other the system would glady accept a password with space characters--and then not accept passwords with spaces in them when logging in, making you question your sanity as you desperately try to figure out why all your passwords don't work.This mess of frustration is just a culmination of Ubisoft's philosophy of tossing out a new game every year and trying to monetize the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it in the meanwhile, all the while ignoring the glaring problems their games have as they migrate on to their next project: their grandest, most vast ♥♥♥♥ up to date, whenever that is.I am reasonably certain that the Abstergo Credit bug is because you can now buy microtransaction currency for real money. The systems for preventing abuse are also ♥♥♥♥ing everything up for everyone else. Some people have even reported not getting their microtransaction rewards, which is the only reason why I don't think Ubisoft is preventing normal in-game currency collection to sell Erudito credits.As the multiplayer component of an AC game dies out as each new titles in the series come out, I wish that the multiplayer could be divorced from the single player in order to give it the time it needs to mature and to keep a steady long-time player base. As it is, though the MP is a beautiful, beautiful game, it is beautiful in the way that a sick person dying of consumption in some old Gothic novel is beautiful: pale, doomed and breaking my heart.

												Hands down, the BEST pirate simulation game on the market. This is the game that Disney WISHES they could make with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" license, as it accurately models all of the appropriate kinds of things that one could ever wish for from a game about pirates. Sailing the seven seas looking for treasure? Check. Intense naval battles and skirmishes that you just manage to survive by the skin of your teeth? Check. Carousing and brawling in taverns and dives throughout the West Indies? Check, check, and check. As a pirate game, Black Flag is just about perfect. As an Assassin's Creed game, well, let's just say that Ubisoft could have completely left that whole assasins versus templars subplot out of the game and none of us would have missed it. In all honesty, the AC franchise has floundered somewhat in recent chapters of the series, so if the pirating part of Black Flag weren't so strong to make up for the lackluster plot contrivances of the greater mythology, I would have come away disappointed. But as it stands, I've got alomst 100 hours in on this game, and reached 90% completion, butI could easily see myself adding to that total just trying to track down all the hidden treasures, upgrading the Jackdaw, running resources all over the world with my fleet, and plundering anything and everything that sails the open ocean. This game is amazingly beautiful as well. Not everything about it works as well as it could. The same control issues that have plagued the series from the beginning remain - Edward too often springs off in the wrong direction, or grabs a ledge when you want him to air-assassinate someone, and don't even get me started on the cluster-frak that is deck-fighting. And although there was some effort put towards improving stealth play, it's still falling well behind games where that is the main mechanic. I still found myself much too often just saying ""forget it"" and wading in with dual swords drawn. At the very least, the number of ""remain undetected"" missions is kept to an absolute bare minimum, allowing me to enjoy the campaign without screaming obscenities at the screen (so far the only real obsceneites have been directed towards the optional Legendary ships, who cheat like the floating cheaters that they are).I certainly recommend this game for fans of the series, but also for those who were never a fan of the series. Unlike previous entries, Edward Kenway is NOT an assassin, nor does he really work for them. He's out for himself and his friends, and it just so happens that their interests align at times. Because of this, you don't need to know the backstory to understand Edward's motivations or what he's doing from moment to moment. If you're a fan of pirates at all, it's well worth the price to pick up this robust game.			"

												If you enjoy frame drops, gamebreaking bugs, and poor optimization, this is the game for you. After being out for over 3 years, the PC version of this game is by far one of the worst ports I have ever seen. The game runs poorly even though I have a 980m and an i7 processor. Regardless of the settings I still get frame drops and the game bugged out so badly once that I was forced to remove the battery from my laptop because the game locked up my entire computer, even though I just got the thing. Ubisoft should be ashamed that they sell a game in this state, and there is no excuse for leaving a game in a broken state for multiple years. In spite of the horrendous performance, this is still my favorite Assasins Creed games. When it works, it is a beautiful game with mechanics and gameplay unique from all of the other games in the series. Buy this game on console if you want a working version.			"

												Hands down, the BEST pirate simulation game on the market. This is the game that Disney WISHES they could make with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" license, as it accurately models all of the appropriate kinds of things that one could ever wish for from a game about pirates. Sailing the seven seas looking for treasure? Check. Intense naval battles and skirmishes that you just manage to survive by the skin of your teeth? Check. Carousing and brawling in taverns and dives throughout the West Indies? Check, check, and check. As a pirate game, Black Flag is just about perfect. As an Assassin's Creed game, well, let's just say that Ubisoft could have completely left that whole assasins versus templars subplot out of the game and none of us would have missed it. In all honesty, the AC franchise has floundered somewhat in recent chapters of the series, so if the pirating part of Black Flag weren't so strong to make up for the lackluster plot contrivances of the greater mythology, I would have come away disappointed. But as it stands, I've got alomst 100 hours in on this game, and reached 90% completion, butI could easily see myself adding to that total just trying to track down all the hidden treasures, upgrading the Jackdaw, running resources all over the world with my fleet, and plundering anything and everything that sails the open ocean. This game is amazingly beautiful as well. Not everything about it works as well as it could. The same control issues that have plagued the series from the beginning remain - Edward too often springs off in the wrong direction, or grabs a ledge when you want him to air-assassinate someone, and don't even get me started on the cluster-frak that is deck-fighting. And although there was some effort put towards improving stealth play, it's still falling well behind games where that is the main mechanic. I still found myself much too often just saying ""forget it"" and wading in with dual swords drawn. At the very least, the number of ""remain undetected"" missions is kept to an absolute bare minimum, allowing me to enjoy the campaign without screaming obscenities at the screen (so far the only real obsceneites have been directed towards the optional Legendary ships, who cheat like the floating cheaters that they are).I certainly recommend this game for fans of the series, but also for those who were never a fan of the series. Unlike previous entries, Edward Kenway is NOT an assassin, nor does he really work for them. He's out for himself and his friends, and it just so happens that their interests align at times. Because of this, you don't need to know the backstory to understand Edward's motivations or what he's doing from moment to moment. If you're a fan of pirates at all, it's well worth the price to pick up this robust game.			"

												This game is great overall. A really fun experience from the moment you get your own ship. you can pillage and roam the seas as a pirate freely until Uplay erases all your data. This happened to me like ten minutes in and I blamed my computer, but then it happened with a 30 hour savegame and has ruined this game for me now... as an addition it took me like 20 mins to start this game up, as when you launch it from steam it opens Uplay and when you launch it from Uplay it opens steam again.... overall a great experience while it lasted.

												I've never been that much of an Assassin's Creed fan, but this time Ubisoft managed to put together a fantastic title.They seemed to have picked up the ground combat, stealth and complexity of their cities from their previous games and combined it in a land and sea open world along with exploration and hunting elements clearly borrowed from Farcry 3. And of course they elevated the naval combat from Assassin's Creed 3 to a whole new level in Black Flag.You can engage in countless activities such as whaling, boarding poor unsuspecting merchant barges, assassination contracts or simply... exploration. There's just so much to do, though by far the activities done at sea are the most fun.For those who played or still remember Sea Dogs and later Pirates of the Caribean, this title is definetely reminiscent of those and is definetely worth it. For those who have never experienced the joys of looting and pludering this is also a must play at some point. "

												A MASERPIECE!One of the best pirate games out there with stunning graphics, an interesting story, some memorable characters and especially, the naval combat system is awesome. Edward Kenway's badassness has led me to fall in love with this game and made me play other AC series as well. Personally I don't like collectibles put in-game just to extend the playtime, but I've put my best effort to collect every single thing in this game. I've spent hours and hours completing achievements and accomplished a 100% synchronization which I normally don't do.If only this was not developed by Ubisoft.♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft.Give me back my 100% sync save file.

												I really wanted to like this game, and for the first few hours I really did. As you can see by the number of hours I spent playing, I stuck it out because I really wanted to recommend this game. In the end, however, it just didn't pan out.It starts out with a lot of promise, but it gets tedious after a few hours. There are seven types of collectibles strewn about the world (treasure chests, hidden treasure chests, treasure maps, message-in-a-bottle, animus fragments, wild animals to hunt, and sea shanties) and they take forever to collect. Some are more enjoyable to get than others. The sea shanties aren't that bad, but you have to go chasing after them which can be a hassle depending on what sorts of challenges you like. The buried treasure chests are challenging to look for, but if it's not your cup of tea then the search can be irritating. The collectibles on the tiny islands in the middle of the ocean are the worst because you have to dive off the ship and go swimming to the little islands to grab a chest, then go swimming back. It takes forever! Granted, you aren't required to find most of these collectibles, but if you want to afford upgrades so that you can stand a chance in combat later on then it's a strong recommendation (or if you're a completionist, of course). Boarding ships gets especially tedious after the hundredth time, and there are many unskippable animations and mini-cutscenes that play the same every time you do a certain action. Eventually your patience will wear thin and even sending your fleet on trading missions will become dull and obnoxious. I don't know how bad the tedium would be for a casual player, but I really don't want to spend several hours trying a ""lite"" playthrough to see if it's possible.The story is so-so. Fortunately, most of the time is spent in the animus. And most of the time you just play a piratical action-adventure; until it takes a strange turn into pirates-meets-sci-fi. It's honestly not that bad, and the setting returns to normal at the end, but it could have done without. For what it's worth, the story is a mostly fun adventure and the characters (in the past) are pretty interesting, even if they're not all loveable.Pros:-Some fun weapons. My favorite is the berserker dart.-Sailing the high seas can be pretty fun and/or relaxing.-SEA SHANTIES! YOUR CREW SINGS FOR YOU!-The soundtrack in general is great.-All the strengths of the previous AC games are here.-More customization. Outfits, custom parts for your ship, and renovations for your manor.-Famous pirates such as Blackbeard and Charles Vane make an appearance. Characterization in general is pretty well-done. Kenway is charming and most of the characters are full-fledged and engaging.-Wide variety of settings. Sail around the caribbean and dive underwater at certain spots.-At times, feels like a big-budget ""Sid Meier's Pirates.""-Fast travel is a godsend.-You can pet dogs. Obviously Ubisoft had their priorities straight.Cons:-The tedium is hefty, especially if you are a completionist. On the bright side, you can collect most of the collectibles early in the game and get them out of the way. At mission 4 out of 13 I was able to get almost 75% game completion.-Some stupid scripted set pieces that look good in a trailer for E3 but make for bad gameplay. On more than one occasion I was delayed from completing an objective because it was ""too soon"" for the game's liking. Also, the canned animations that play the same way every time something happens! If one more stupid frickin' eel jumps out at me from the seaweed, so help me.... -If you don't get all the sea shanties in close succession, then the first ones you find will become tiresome from hearing them so many times. Fortunately, you can turn off shanties and then turn them back on once you've collected them all.-No one cares about the animus or the ""meta-story arc."" Just have an opening and ending cutscene in the modern day and then let us swashbuckle in peace in the middle. To be fair, there is far less modern-day stuff in ""Black Flag"" than in past installments.-Swordfighting can be frustrating because many of the soldiers are very adept at blocking your attacks.-The main game is pretty short. I usually consider this a good thing because I like games to be short and sweet when possible, but not in this case. I feel that the developers placed too much importance on collectibles to drag out the game's length instead of focusing on real substance. There is even DLC that allows the player to spend less time playing the game. This is good in a way, but also bad because it proves that the game shouldn't be this long. The amount of collectibles is insane. They could have added more missions or sidequests instead.			"

												Incredible game that I can't recommend because at the moment it suffers from one of the worst bugs I can think of: a saving bug.The first time I played this game I played it for 4 hours straight. Unfortunately, when I went back to play it I discovered that it had not saved my progress since the first half hour. I went straight to the forums and found that the UPLAY Cloud Saving feature did not work correctly. At the advice of several people I turned off the Cloud Save Synchronization and backed up my saves after every session. The next day I played for several sessions without issues.Then today, it happened again. I played for 3 hours (in which I did many challenges and hunted collectibles) and it STOPPED SAVING AFTER AN HOUR EVEN THOUGH THE SAVING SYMBOL IN-GAME SAID IT WAS SAVED!!Stay away from this game until they fix this!!

												Well, how can I start with the wonderment that is Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. Launching the game for the first time, I had my fair share of doubt, coming fresh from ACIII, with III's ambition but failure to embrace the roots of the franchise in the slightest, if at all. So one can only imagine how sceptical I must have been of Ubi's promise with ACIV, but something grabbed me about the game even before playing it. I was excited Darby McDevvit was writing another AC story, because his work on Revelations was nothing short of a masterpiece in pacing and execution (in my personal opinion). And the fact much of Far Cry 3's team moved over to the dev team for ACIV, making it a game that had that sense of sureness about it, a sense of a development team that knows what they're delivering, fully.About the story in ACIV. As much as very little of your time is spent in the modern day segments, it still plays a huge part of the game. It has now, in fact, become a canvas for pretty much an infinite (depending on Ubi) number of future AC titles. But i'll not delve into too many details at risk of spoiling anything for you all. You are the main character, and assume the role of a voiceless, faceless Abstergo employee. This first person identity approach makes for a much personal experience, and I found myself getting personally attached to the character I was controlling, simply because there was a sense of ""me"" giving the character the identity.Edward Kenway's saga. Well, what can I say, you are thrust so quickly into the shoes of Captain Edward Kenway, that you don't even get the chance to yell ""Half Sail Lads!"" (heuheuheu ;) ). It is essentially full sail and your away in this game, which is leaps and bounds from what you may remember from ACIV's prequel only but a year ago!The game's sense of progression in Edward's character as he advances through the lengthy campaign is absolutely astonishing, and you can't help but grow attached to the witty, hot-tempered, selfish, arrogant Pirate in Captain Edward Kenway, no matter how much of a bad person he may be by anyone's defenition.If you were worried that they're taking the series away from the roots, you can discard all those worries. In my opinion, using a single protagonist to play Assassins off Templars and vice versa makes this, in some areas, the more ""Assassin's Creed"" a game than any of its predecessors. It forces you to question each side, their goals, method of achieving them. And staying away from the typical biased good guy character forced to join the ""good guys"" makes for interesting plot moments throughout!The ending is satisfying and conclusive, and you are teased with enough bits of info throughout the modern day to keep you questioning about the next games in the franchise, but as for ACIV's story alone, it concludes in, probably, the most satisfying manner I've seen a game conclude, reminding me personally of the likes of Max Payne 3 and McDevvit's previous AC, Revelations.Take down forts and make them your own for the pirates, take part in Assassin hunts, Templar hunts, complete Assassination contracts, chase Shanties for your crew, collect data fragments, loot chests, find treasure maps, go treasure hunting, loot underwater shipwrecks, harpoon a variety of sea beasts for hunting goods, ranging from Whales to Bull sharks, complete naval contracts with each new fort you've taken over.. The variety of things you can do in this game is insane, and it gives me faith the Ubisoft Montreal are finally starting to deliver on their promise of ambition in open world games, whether that's only in the AC franchise, or otherwise!Visually, the game is drop dead gorgeous, no questions asked, very little texture pop-in occuring, and there is the occasional drop in frame rate, but this only really occurred for me when sailing into heavy smoke during naval battles. The game has remained a stable PC version, and at no point has it made me wonder whether it was just ""ported over"" (though Next-Gen makes that easier to get away with now, hehe ;) )Both land and naval combat have been streamlined, but not simplified! Naval combat is straightforward to get to grips with, and incredibly satisfying once you've gotten a taste of boarding and pillaging ships, and subsequently upgrading the Jackdaw.A deep upgrading system surrounding Edward and the Jackdaw make for excellent exploration ventures that are almost always fun, over the top and satisfying. Land combat is far more tricky this time, with slightly modified archetypes than we're used to, and the fact that guards no longer wait for you to finish killing their buddy before they attack you, so quick counters, breaking defences and great positioning make for satisfying kill streaks, on ship and land!Multiplayer is back and with few improvements, but whether this is positive or negative is up to you, I see it as a winning formula that's being maintained. Same great cat and mouse gameplay, perks etc etc. With the addition of the game lab, which I can assure you, is as in-depth as promised. If you digged the multiplayer in the previous AC titles, you'll have the same, if not more of a blast playing through AC multiplayer-Black Flag edition (my name for it ;) )Well, that concludes my review for this excellent, excellent game, I can only wish everyone else on this planet could have experienced it with me! :')I give Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag a solid : 10/10 ! An absolute must play worth the price tag!			"

												Assassin's Creed Black Flag is a game that brings you the awesome pirate life.The main charater's name is Edward Kenway, father of Haytham Kenway which you met in Assassin's Creed 3.He leaves home for a pirate life, hoping for great fortune and riches, but it turns out to be a more bumpy ride than he first had thought.After some missions you will get your own ship, which you can upgrade by increasing the number of cannons, the armor of your ship, mortar cannons, a battering ram so you can crash into enemy ships and so on.The game encourages you to sail around and fight other ships, board them and steal their cargo in order to upgrade your ship with metal, wood, cloth and money. Rum and suger can be sold to get even more money. When you destroy enough ships you will get more wanted stars, the more stars you get the stronger pirate hunters will be spawned, and they will hunt you until you manage to remove the stars.The seas are vast and there is loads of stuff to do, be it gathering mayan secrets for something to be revealed, or following treasure maps and finding your treasure. And don't worry, after completing the main story you can still sail around and do these things.And if you are done with the main story or everything, what I love to do is to put on some epic Pirates of the Carribean music while sailing!However this is still an Assassin's Creed game, so you will still be doing missions quite similar to the previous games. Like ""Tail the target"", ""eavesdrop the conversation"", ""kill target"", ""escape area and become anonymous"" and so forth. But there are also missions where you sail with your ship to destroy another enemy ship.The main story is worth completing, because it is really entertaining and you will meet many interesting and cool characters, the ending was to me quite touching in different ways.If you (like me) doesn't like the ""new futuristic world"" where you sit in a machine, then there is both a positive and negative side.The negative side is that you are in a kind of machine. The positive side is that they have removed many of the animations inside the world where it continously remind you that you are not in the world, in the previous games you would see things manifest around you like you were in a machine, you don't see it as much in this game. And you are only drawn out of the world about 5 times.So because of this I feel that this is an improvement.I recommend this game to anyone that is interested in the pirate life, sailing around in your own ship, fighting the royal navy or pirate hunters! This is without a doubt my favorite Assassin's Creed game so far!			"

												UBISOFT HAS HIT ROCK BOTTOM IN TERMS OF CREDIBILITYUbisoft MUST hate the PC community; they just assume we are ALL hopeless pc pirates who won't support any game, be it good or bad, even in the Steam era, ... so what do they do? : a) they FORCE you to launch that Uplay crap everytime you wanna play the game: Uplay has KNOWN problems to load saved games in the cloud, and they DON'T give a damn about itb) they make sure the game is bigger than 30 GB so nobody can't even dream about pirating itc) they sell you for 29,99-49,99 a CONSOLE PORT which is NOT, and I mean N-O-T optimized for PC, even for 2012-2013 decent-good pc computers; I can run Tomb Raider, Far Cry 3 or Deus Ex like a charm on high settings...I can't even properly run AC 4 BF on medium settings; my guess is that Ubisoft WANTS you to buy the console port of their gamesthis is the end of the line for me, NO MORE UBISOFT GAMES, AND NO MORE ASSASSIN'S CREED GAMES (the franchise has gotten old already, anyway, they'll never surpass the early peak which was AC II)F*CK UBISOFT, a bunch of french canadians who are even worse than EA (and that's a HUUUUGE accomplishment)oh, the game itself is alright, nice pirate story, nice naval battles, nice environment (too bad you WILL have to enjoy it with low-off settings, unless you have a state-of-the-art 2013-2014 table computer), ...also the same old block and parry combat, same old parkour,...same old eavesdropping sh*t and repetitive side-missions,...AND same old Abstergo/First Civilization stupid nonsensethe game : 7,5-8/10pc port/support: 0/10buy this game for consoles if you NEED to play it, ignore the pc port, just IGNORE it			"

												Okay, lets be honest  here... Thats the last good Assassins Creed game we got from Ubisoft. After Blackflag we took a huge `leap of faith` in some weird direction which makes us appriciate this game even more. The atmosphere is the strongest benefit of this title. The cities, the islands, the ships, the music - all you need for a good atmosphere is there.The Story is not so deep but it keeps you entertained. The beginning was somehow rushed - from a simple sailor to a master assassin in a matter of one cutscene. You meet some interesting characters along the way which is pretty good considering the fact that our main character is kinda dull and boring.Graphics. Nothing new to tell here - the visuals are pretty good, the sun reflecting in the water while you sail trough the waves is an experiace worth enough to buy the game. You will see what I mean. The world is very detailed and beautiful. Gameplay. Well... Where should I begin... The gameplay is great. You dont feel forced to do the storyline quest, you have enough things to do and explore, the world is huge, the ship management and everything involved in it is great, the treasure maps and the shark/whale hunting are like the salt and the pepper of the game.  In a few words - well created open world is ready for you to dive in, promising you a good 40+ hours of diverse things to do.P.S. The only Assassins Creed where I actually enjoyed playing multiplayer, but it is now dead... Dont think about it. If you want a good singleplayer adventure game with a pirate thematic then buy it. It is a solid 7/10I said  it earlier and I will say it again: It is the last good Assassins Creed, so enjoy because it is not getting any better from here :)			"

												Some people might argue that it's not the best Assassin's Creed game ever made, but it's the one I like the most. Ubisoft took the elements that made AC a good series and mixed them with the open world features that made the success of Farcry 3.The pirate setting is one of my favorites, and is very well represented here, with likable characters, a vast sea area full of islands and hidden treasures, as well as enemy ships to sink or board. The story is pretty good, although I'm only at 15% of progression. It's easy to get distracted by the big number of side activities. You don't have to do them all, you pick what you want, when you want it. I think that AC4 can be fun for different types of gamers in different ways.On the technical side, the game is pretty, with detailed models, textures and lush environments. The water/waves simulation is impressive and makes the navigation and naval combat or hazzards (like storms) quite realistic and fun. The PC optimization could be better, although I think it runs pretty well on my laptop with i7, Geforce 680M, SSD and 8GB RAM, around 45-60 FPS.I encountered no bugs or crashes so far, although the Ubisoft servers were down once, which prevented me to use the (minor) fleet system in the solo game.The multiplayer modes are the same as previous games, although you now have the possibility to define your own rules and create your own game modes to play with others. I like some of the multiplayer modes, but prefer the solo experience of AC4 a lot more. In previous AC games, it was the opposite for me.I recommend this game to anyone, even those who didn't like the AC series. It's worth a try as the sea gameplay is completely different and the game world is much more open now.			"

												Black Flag is a prettty amazing game. It take far too long to get behind the wheel of your own ship and until then the game is a litle too linear and dull, but once you're actually a pirate? It really opens up. The various types of gameplay - style, freerunning, fighting, piloting your ship - all work very well together. There's an element of grind when it comes to upgrading your ship -which is essential - but it took a very, very long time for me to get bored of attacking and boarding ships. Kenway is also the most interesting AC protagonist, I'd argue, as he's not even as Assassin most of the game, is ridculously (suicidally) stubborn and has a playable psychotic break. Amazing stuff. The loss of Desmond is welcome and the stuff in the modern day is less intrusive and actually more fun. I liked being a faceless, voiceless first person guy with a tablet way more.  "

												Cannot recommend this game enjoy. Huge open world, with loads to do. Some tasks are a little repetitive with the side missions, main missions have way too many follow and eavesdrop missions but otherwise they are quite varied which is great. These 2 points are my only real issues with the game overall.Sailing, harpooning, collectables, hunting, ship battles, looting and so much more. Doesn't really feel like an AC game though but is definitely the best Pirate game I have ever played. Main campaign: 15-20 hours.Been playing over 40 hours and still have side quests, legendary ships to destroy and will be going back to complete these.The atmostphere is the game is also fantasic and drags you into this world and you won't want to leave.Overall score: 9.6/10			"

												Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an amazing, open world game. Ubisoft has done an amazing job at immersing you in a fun, realistic, and tense Pirate Experience. The game is set in the west indies, and you play the role of Edward Kenway, Grandfather of AC3's protagonist connor. As you play the game, you will find countless treasures, ranging from upgrades to your ship to treasure maps. Everything is incredibly customizable - From the giant sails  you will see on your ship as you sail along, to the tiny details of the wheel that steers the ship. The combat is slightly bland, and very repetitivebut can be satisfying after taking down an enemy. The game gives you many ways of dealing with targets, but I only had to use half the tools the game provided. I didn't feel that much like an assassin in this assassin's creed game, but being a pirate was incredibly epic anyway. At the endgame, it becomes incredibly easy, but there are still a ton of side activities to complete, from assassination contracts, diving into lost ship wreckages, hunting down templars, destroying enemy ships, capturing towering fortresses and SO MUCH more. The environment is stunning and the music is beautiful. It really does make you feel like a pirate. Everything can be upgraded, which drives a need to go hunting, fighting and diving for lost treasures. Between some segments, the game throws you out of the immersive pirate world to do tasks in the modern world, which breaks immersion and is annoying. Overall, I would rate Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag my favourite PC game of 2013 and that is why it earns an enthusiastic 93/100, brought down slightly by the combat and the easy endgame. I didn't like nor play much of any of the previous assassins creed games,  but this one I coukd just jump straight into and play. I highly recommend this game for ANYONE looking for an immersive, fun and awesome Pirate Experience. A must buy.			"

												I'm not going to rate the story, which has thus far been pretty amazing. I have spent forty-two hours in this game and I've only managed to get through maybe a little under half of the main storyline. The reason for this is the vast amount of gameplay to be found. In previous AC games I would beat the game first and then go through and unlock everything. However, this game is so good that I havn't been able to stop doing the extra side missions in order to finish the game. Needless to say, that is the highest praise that I think can be laid at the feet of any video game. So enjoy, this is amazing. On the other side of things I do want to point out that there are some glitches: few and far between thankfully. Also, and I'm not sure if this is just because I use a controller, but occassionally I'll have issues with the free running mechanics.			"

												I love the Assassin's Creed series, and this is the best one yet. It does a great job of taking historical figures and making them into vibrant characters with whom Edward can interact. The sailing/naval combat portions of the game are also well done; traveling between locations almost always felt like an adventure rather than a chore. One of the few downsides of the game is that several of the mission types (such as eavesdropping missions) become repetitive. Collecting sea shanties was surprisingly fun. I even thought the usually boring out-of-animus portions of the game were fun (and rather meta in this game).			"

												The best addition to the series since Assassin's Creed II has got to be this one - Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.    It's got a revolutionary new open world consisting of hundreds of different looking islands with a hole bunch of various things to do. While not on an island or in one of the three major cities, you're on your ship. This ship, called The Jackdaw, can be upgraded with a dozen of very diverse and funny upgrades which really add to the fun.    Furthermore, they've added additional completetion stuff eg. the ""Templar Armor"". This can be unlocked by completing a serious of ""Templar Hunt""-missions which almost act as different story-lines.     The epic sea-fights are, yeah, epic... You never get tired of them, especially if you happen to run into a storm while fighting. In this scenario you'll have to steer your ship through tornados and rouge-waves while the thunder rages above you and at the same time keeping an eye out for the enemy ship whose cargo were the only thing you wanted. It dosn't get anymore intense than this.When adding that much new content to a game that already has a flawless gameplay, you're sure to make something great. It is obvious that this game is the result of long and tough working process, but it really payed off. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the best game in this series ever released.			"

												AC4 was my introduction to the Assassin's Creed series, and I'm hooked. The single-player mode is fun, but the multiplayer mode is even better. You play through a story in single-player mode, which seems pretty standard to me, and you can really benefit from being sneaky and assassin-like instead of just running in and killing everyone, which is neat. In multiplayer, you get to choose characters, level up by playing various modes (both co-op and adversarial), and customize abilities and appearances. Wolfpack mode lets you play through a number of sequences with different objectives, all of which involve assassinations, of course, either solo or with friends or strangers online. The other modes are PvP, some in teams and some free-for-all. You can choose the game mode that is most appealing to you, and get a bunch of friends to play with you or just wait for a lobby online. The levels system is a bit misleading, since being a high level or prestige doesn't necessarily mean you're good, it just means you play too much (very true in my case...I find it a great deal of fun even though I am not good), but when you're in the middle of a game that's hardly the first thing on your mind anyway.Overall, it's a pretty diverse game, with game modes to appeal to many different types of gamers. The graphics are gorgeous even with everything on super low, though some of the more graphic kills may be disturbing to more squeamish folk (you can always tell when a kill animation will happen though, so you can look away if need be, and blood can be turned off). It's a good option for people who tend not to have fast reactions but still like action games, because there is some subtlety involved in the gameplay. I definitely recomend this to anyone remotely interested, particularly if you can find it discounted somewhere, as it is a bit pricey (but worth it!).			"

												Love this game, if you like the pirates of the caribbean movies this is perfect to get the feel of plundering a ship and salvaging a ship you just plundered to repair your ship or keep it for your fleet to help you do missions and earn gold and others stuff to help you threw out the game.  If you hated the other creeds but always dreamed of a good pirate game this one defiantly works :D hope you enjoy like I have			"

												Surprisingly, the best game in the series. The plot is interesting, but more importantly the team has managed to make every activity fun. The overworld map is very useful for hunting down collectibles, and the rewards for completionism are (although unnecessary) well worthwile.It gives me great hope for Liberation after being very disappointed with AC3.

												Being only the second game outside of the ""standard"" AC pack (2, Brotherhood, and Revelations), I originally thought that this would be Ubisoft playing it safe and just fixing problems from AC3 and regaining some reputation for the series. I was so wrong. The writing, voice acting, cinematics, and characters were so lifelike, believable, and just real. Easygoing conversion flowed and even the smallest movements were realistc. The script was also amazing, it was the first time that a game made me laugh with what was going on both in the cinematics and in-game, bringing me to gameplay. Amazing gameplay, really refined and redesigned in some places. Stealth has been expanded and now there are many more places to hide. Eagle vision has also recieved a new update. Naval combat is in a league of its own. Copmlex, but easy to use, there are limitless oppurtunities and the constant loot needed keeps you taking over ships. Every ship behaves differently and boarding are chaotic and each is a little different. With the loot you gain you upgrade your ship, and extremely needed thing. Without upgrading, good luck. The system forces you to put time into farming materials and it is extremely satisfactory getting a hard to get upgrade. Also, stores now have been update. For the first time in a long time, there were moments were i needed to upgrade a sword or pistol to get through a hard part. Weapons are diverse and you need all you have, even those smoke bombs no one used. Outside of the animus, the story was actually entertaining and I found myself leaving the simulation many times to hack some computers. The Edward storyline was amazing, relentless, emotional, and filled with twists. An extremely vast, polished, and beautiful game, AC4 is a huge push for the series.9/10			"

												Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag really brings back the glory to the Assassins Creed series, as Revelations and AC3, somewhat let us down. In the beginning however, we had a bit of a rough patch with some players such as losing Saved games, and hours of play time spent. With constant updates, it shows Ubisoft still cares about it's PC gamer community (Optimization being another topic) for the most part. Now, optimization isn't much of an issue to me, as my Rig is pretty powerful, but for others whom don't have this, it's a real pain, as you have to play on the lowest of low sometimes, just to get a decent frame rate. Even with some of these cons though, it's a really quite beautiful game. It brings the best of both worlds, Pirates and Assassins, with the occasional Templar. Now not to spoil anything from AC3, but in this one you may be confused as you play you, in the beginning and not Desmond. This to me is a really great aspect of the game, as you get to be yourself. Now, don't take this as you get to customize how your real life character looks because you can't, I just find it different, and kind of nice for a change. Just like Ezio, even though he was great, it was time to move on after 3-4 titles with him in it. Overall however, this game is a great buy. If you have a decent gaming PC, make sure to give this a go. Final Score would be: 8.7/10			"

												Repetitive combat (and land gameplay in general) aside, this game is absolutely incredle. Fans of the series won't mind the Assassin sections of gameplay whilst those who even go as far as to hate the core gameplay of AC will adore the Pirate sections. This is by far the best attempt at piratry that we have in gaming, and hopefully the huge hype that AC4:BF has generated due to it's naval gameplay will open a floodgate for other studios to create similar games just like Bohemia did with DayZ.£39.99 is a hefty pricetag, but you'll get your monies worth with this one, it is huge. It has seemless online features that allow your friends (sadly only your uPlay friends, not your Steam friends) to find special events such as huge ships with booty to plunder and rare animals needed for certain upgrades. The multiplayer is the same as it has been since Brotherhood, and the graphics are the best we have to date for an open world game. I very highly recommend ACIV:BF.			"

												Well, this was a suprising hit.When I first heard of Black Flag, I must admit I was a sceptic. A new Assassins Creed only a year after the last one... Bet this is going to be like Call of Duty. I was pretty happy with Assassins Creed (AC) 3 singleplayer. The story was desent, and the maps were pretty good - but like with all other AC games, I never got into collecting or multiplayer.I desided to go around AC4, 'cause how can it be any good so close to the last one?I had my birthday just after New years, and desided to try out AC4, due to good reviews.And boy was i pleasently suprised! First of all, they cut back on all that Animus crap from the other games, so that was a great suprise.The story is ""okay"", nothing like AC1 or AC2, but good enough to keep you moving forward.You play a pirate that engages in navelcombat with a random boat, that has an Assassin onboard. You both end up on the beach, and after abit of learning the movements and combat, you end up killing him and taking his clothes. Turns out he was a traitor, and you use this for personal glory. I wont spoil it all here :)The big thing in the game is the sailing. And do it deliver big time. I love roaming the sea, having my crew sing different songs, and plundering innocent merchant ships from Spain or Great Britain. The naval combat functions really well, and it is easy to switch between weapons, controling the ship and boarding other vessels.Its so much fun, that after reaching Act 8 (of 13) i totaly forgot about the story and just went around plundering and upgrading my ship.After a while I desided to get back to the story, and finished it rather quickly. But the game wouldnt let me go there.After finishing, I really wanted to collect stuff. You can see on your map, when a location has been depleted of all activity (it turns yellow). And it didnt take long for me to make them all turn yellow!The most tedious part was the diving missions, because you have very limited movement and time (and no weapons). But ive heard from others they found them to be the most thrilling parts of the game...Ive now fully upgraded my ship, got a badass Mayan (bulletproof) Armor and almost collected everything in the game. Ive spent 60+ hours, and was very entertained all the way.And on a end note, may I recommend watching the Black Sails (starz) serie that is currently running in between gameingsessions, just to keep the mood going! :DTL:DR; Desent singleplayer, great navalcombat and really adictive! A must buy for every Assassins Creed fan!			"

												This game is actually very good. Assassin's Creed is not a series that I can play every year, the last ones I've played were 1 and 2. Black Flag actually feels like a good step foward primarily due to the much more open ended world, and of course, the ship mechanics.  The only draw back that I have is that the main missions feels somewhat repetitive, it's always listen to someone for 5 minutes, then kill someone.  Despite the small set back, the ship mechanics and missions pertaining to upgrading the ship more than makes up for the story missions.			"

												After finishing every Assassin’s Creed game since the original as an obsessive completionist, Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag is my favorite by far.  Playing as a pirate, exploring the beautiful seas and islands, made me feel like a kid again.  The thrill of stalking an enemy fleet, launching a surprise attack with heavy mortars and a broadside fusillade of cannon fire, and boarding the crippled ships to seize them in hand-to-hand combat never got old.  I felt like the heroic Errol Flynn in his legendary pirate movies!AC4’s story wasn’t fantastic, but it was the best one in this franchise after the original AC2.  The protagonist in AC4 is eminently likeable, a charismatic and tough-but-caring rogue far more like AC2’s flamboyant Ezio than AC3’s boringly stoic Connor.  The characters in AC4, particularly some of history’s most-famous pirates, were generally a lot of fun.  And the modern-day Animus hokum that rips you out of the meat of Assassin’s Creed games was thankfully kept to a minimum.  Most of the out-of-Animus activities, which were actually the most entertaining of the series, were fully optional in AC4.  I’m glad the developers are hearing us that the modern-day stuff in Assassin’s Creed is a jarring waste of time.The missions are classic Assassin’s Creed, with lots of tailing, stalking, assassinating, and escaping after the deed.  The optional objectives in missions were much more manageable than some in AC3, generally achievable without excessive retries.  There is also the option to restart missions at checkpoints within them, rather than at the beginning.  That made the game a lot less frustrating for people like me who want to get all objectives but don’t have tons of time to play games.  Tailing sections in some missions were used to advance the dialogue, which I enjoyed much more than just watching a static cut-scene.  Using stealth-craft to tail targets unseen was often a fun challenge.The hand-to-hand combat is excellent, easily the best of the series yet.  The animations of our hero and his enemies are exquisitely fluid, with natural transitions between different moves and when switching between enemies.  Unfortunately the weapon options were dramatically reduced from AC3, to essentially just hidden blades, dual swords, and pistols.  The explanation given was pirates prefer a sword in each hand, but it would have been nice to have the larger weapon set from previous games.  You could still disarm enemies to take different kinds of weapons, but they got dropped soon after combat.  The combat isn’t up to Batman Arkham’s stellar standards, but it is still a lot of fun.  Particularly in ship situations, swinging from ropes on the masts to jump into the middle of a scrum and massacre all.The ship-to-ship combat was utterly amazing, AC4 is easily the best pirate game I’ve ever played and this is coming from a lifelong gamer born in 1974 who started gaming on an Apple ][.  The seas are absolutely beautifully rendered, with the ships acting realistically on the waves with the exception of faster responses than possible in the real world.  The tactics of naval combat can actually be quite deep, such as approaching enemies from the stern to deny them a broadside shot at you.  Blasting enemy ships to splinters with cannons just never gets old, and boarding them to steal their cargoes to upgrade your own ship is very satisfying.  The seas are lousy with ships, so there are always plenty to fight, board, and loot at every turn.The open-world exploration aspect of AC4 dramatically expands on AC3, and was very addictive.  Between missions you can sail wherever you want whenever you want with virtually no restrictions, discovering new villages, smugglers’ coves, and even underwater shipwrecks.  There are many local assassination missions, which are short and sweet and fun if you like remaining undetected until the killing stroke.  There are tons of collectibles that unlock everything from ship upgrades to new weapons and armor to cheats to multiplayer customization options, and I was surprised how compelled I felt to get absolutely all of them.  That isn’t hard, as after conquering naval forts commanding the open seas or scaling traditional viewpoints in cities the collectibles all appear on the map.  Most are easy to get, and satisfying to collect.I wholeheartedly recommend AC4 to any fans of this series, and any fans of the oceans, tall ships, the golden age of pirates, or classic naval combat.  I hoped to get 30 hours out of this game, but it was so fun and addictive I nearly doubled that.  While I still think AC2 probably had the best story of the series, AC4 is the best game hands-down.  It is amazing how great this game is considering it only took a year (albeit with a huge team) to produce and came right after the middling-in-many-regards AC3.  It is a strong buy at any price below $30.  Enjoy me trumps!			"

												I love the Assassin's Creed series, and this is the best one yet. It does a great job of taking historical figures and making them into vibrant characters with whom Edward can interact. The sailing/naval combat portions of the game are also well done; traveling between locations almost always felt like an adventure rather than a chore. One of the few downsides of the game is that several of the mission types (such as eavesdropping missions) become repetitive. Collecting sea shanties was surprisingly fun. I even thought the usually boring out-of-animus portions of the game were fun (and rather meta in this game).			"

												Because of all the horror stories I've heard about the Assassin's Creed series I've stayed far away from these games. However, this Christmas sale I was relentlessly throwing my money at games, like you do, when I saw this gem for 7$. I did some research and saw some good reviews. I bought it and loaded it up. I've enjoyed this game for about eight hours now and I cannot pull myself away. The satisfaction of sinking Spanish frigates and looting gold from a body you just shanked with a wrist blade is indescribably awesome. The open world just makes it better. The PC port info:It's not a very good port, to be honest. The graphics aren't as good for the performance you actually get out of the game. Other games with bigger worlds and better graphics run twice as fast.The vertical sync is absolutely awful. If the game drops below 59 fps the game locks itself at 30 fps, so just keep it off. (The game is hard-locked at 61 fps anyways so no point in keeping it on.) Use D3DOverrider to tripple-buffer the game.TLDR:Exciting pirate simulator.Combat is satisfying.PC port isn't good, but isn't awful.			"

												It's been awhile since I've played Black Flag. I've had fun playing some of the other Assassin's Creed titles such as the first two, about half of three which I found disapointing and that one during the French Revolution which just felt so crummy I can't even remember it's proper title. The series has been jarring. Some are good and some are just disasters. The first two are good but silly in the sense that the story is taken so seriously by the characters they all feel almost robotic as lines of code are shoved down their digital throats to spew funky exposition.Black Flag more or less has the same problems, but overall this game was saved by two things alone in my mind. Ship battles and taking down forts with me cannons. Aargh. Booty. Yadda yadda. This is very much an Assassin's Creed game, as you spend the first thirty or so minutes following people and listening in while hiding in the surroundings, unless you speed off around the first few accessable areas and try and grab every possible collectable. Being an Ubisoft games, some crazy madman feels it necessary to put enough collectables on the Assassin's Creed games I'm sure that's where some total lunatic got the idea in the Batman games to put a riddler trophy in every nook, cranny and butt hole.As for combat, it's decent enough. At times things can feel a little clunky, but it's smooth enough without having awkward controls that you'll sometimes feel the morbid repetition in how most sword fights will go. Though you can mix things up by employing other methods by taking small advantages of the games mechanics to lull yourself away from noticing any repition, it's the gameplay which involves piloting your own pirate ship which really takes the cake. Raiding vessels for gold, harrassing forts and using a diving bell to find. . . collectables. And dodge sharks and hold your breath for a time long enough to make Olympic athletes blush a little bit.But overall, it's a fun game. If you see it on sale, go ahead and snag it. You'll have to skip through U-Play, but so long as your not a total ding dong, you shouldn't ever have a problem using it U-Play, I've never had a problem with it and can't imagine why anyone does. Also, the games optimization is funky. For the most part in my experience, I was able to play with some very good graphics, but at seemingly random times for reasons I cannot say, my fps would soar to new lows and chug along for a few moments before everything returns to normal. I found knocking off things like anti-aliasing solve any real graphics problems. I'll put my pc specs on the bottom of the review for comparison.I can't really give any solid pros or cons on this one. It has a charm of a great game lightly hidden away behind the typically storytelling of the Assassin's Creed series which uses more scape goats and cop outs than I care to even remember. But, in the end, I had a lot of fun with some of the mechanics of the game.MSI MS-7850Intel Core i5-4670k 3.40GHz (4CPUs) overclocked @ 4.0GHz12GB RAMEVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB ftw edition1920x1080 display (32bit) (60Hz)			"

												Where do i begin with this game, well its pretty damn good and probobly the best Assassin's Creed that is out.lets start with what the game does right. The story is top notch. in this AC title you review the memories of Edward Kenway a man who became a pirate to try and become rich to support his family. well on one unfortunate day the ship he was on wrecks and he is stuck whith what you think is an assassin on a beach so you end up cassing said assassin down killing him and taking his outfit and a object to be dilivered to the govoner of Havana. Well turns out that they are templars the assassin that you killed betrayed the assassin's and guess what the templars are searching for an object that will give them the power to take over the world. So you gotta kill them and get the object easy enough. Ok well the story might sound a bit dull but trust me its good. Character development is outstanding and there were quite a few twists  and scenes that left me saying ""♥♥♥♥ you game"" in a good way of corse. also you play as an employee for Abstergo to make movies so the templars can find a peice of eden.Gameplay is pretty much the same just with a few diffences wich mostly pertain to naval combat so all of that is good. And finaly the look of the game. The graphics are outsanding. Nice texture quality, reletivly good lighting, and the enviornments were really well done. Also if your pc can handel maxing out water do it cuase it looks really nice.Alright so what are the flaws of this game. Lets start with naval combat. Now dont take this the wrong way, The naval combat is well done but my god if i dont want to do naval combat to grind ship upgrades for the love of god dont put 2 man o wars infront fo a missinon zone as well as a naval fort please. That is probobly the biggest flaw this game has. Like i said naval combat is well done but some people are not fans of naval combat.And then another flaw i have is with the Audio. It seems like there is a bug with rain and your audio settings where once it starts raining Kenway turns into MR. Elephant man and start stomping arround causing all sorts of ear♥♥♥♥♥♥ it got tot the point in some parts where i could not stand to have my headset on my neck because of how loud the game got. So  how do i rate this game i give it about a 8 out of 10 and definatly worth your time if you like the AC franchise  "

												This would be an amazing game if it would not be an Assassin's Creed, but it's still a great game.Sea battles and activities are spot on awesome. Ship combat feels easy and challenging at the same time. Ship boarding is great way to test your melee combat skills and tactics. On land combat and activities feel same old ""Assassiny"", that get boring after a while, island exploring is sometimes challenging for no reason, making full exploration a pain to do, when you can't seem to locate one particular chest.Stealth ""bush"" system is great new addition to the tactics, and add some stealth element to rather boring town combat/exploration. The pirate story side is really great apart from boring Assassins and Templars for the 4th time. There's lack of melee and ranged weapon variety, and once you get couple thousand R (money), you don't have to invest in those.Personal gadget upgrades are a nice touch to make you hunt for specific animals and their hides/bones. Ship upgrades are really nice, and require you to obtain cloth, wood and metal for them via sea battles, apart from R (money) and schematics. All around it's a nice pirate game, even if it's the same old Assassin's Creed under the cover.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag was a lot of fun. Comparing to AC III, the combat was a lot more fun and enjoyable, the characters were a lot more likeable, and the protagonist didn't insist on being a♥♥♥♥♥♥throught the entire story. When I played AC3, after not too long I got bored with the game - then I started to burn through the story to feel better about putting the game down. With AC4, though, I spent lots of time having fun exploring, finding collectibles, doing side-missions, building up my ship, and of course, being a pirate. The Ship-Ship combat is, in my opinion, stellar. Not too difficult to get the hang of, but it stays fun, from the first few ships to the 100th and beyond. Looking back, I think there was a 15 consecutive hour period of gameplay in which I by-passed the main story entirely, focusing on the side missions and taking over ships.Comparing to the earlier AC games, especially AC3, the controls were MUCH better in this game. I remember half of the rage I had in AC3 was due to unexpetedly jumping to my death innumerable times just to get to a viewpoint or something. There were a few instances of this in AC4, but they were far fewer and more manageable than I've previously experienced. I experienced a few bugs during the game, but only once was there an interruption - luckily I only had to re-play five minutes worth to get back to where I was, but it's still bothersome.With the - to me- somewhat lackluster enjoyability of AC Revelations and the rather boring and annoying AC3, I wasn't fully sure about spending the money on AC4. Now that I've played it, I'm glad I did, and this game has restored my hope that this series still has some life and fun left in it.			"

												After 84 hours, and 75% of the game completed, I really think this is one of the best (if not the best) AC concept ever.A large map (almost) free to roam, plenty of different activities to waste your time with, and some very nice detailing like all the sea shanties, different types of ships, animals, environments, etc. And of course to top it all - It's about pirates! Arrgh. ;)However - There are plenty of problems as well. First of all, Uplay - What the F*** Ubisoft? If you force people to use your software, please, make sure it actually works without problems. My installation works OK, haven't had much problems, but pretty please, don't ever gamble with peoples save game files - I've lost count of all the discusssions I've already seen about lost saves. (!) (Oh and with a game offered on Steam, could you also consider not having the same default hotkeys for some actions, like screenshots, as Steam has?) Second, No Ubisoft, NO! Bad boy. You DO NOT SELL cheats and timesavers as DLCs. That's just wrong, and takes away much from the actual gaming experience.. It is an accepted part of games like this one, that you should either waste your time playing right, or waste your time cheating on Google. It is all a vital part of the complete experience.I've also seen plenty of people wondering how to deactivate their purchased cheats, after they've made the MISTAKE of activating a cheat pack. ( I'm not one of them, don't know if there is a way to do this?) Third, a game still actively sold and supported as far as I know, should really be a finished and polished product by TWO YEARS after release. But NO... There are some crazy bugs out there, like for instance - Today I was carrying out an assassination contract. Killed everyone I found in the target area, but did not find my target. Tried this for multiple times, until I decided to try and drown myself. Strangely, that helped. o_O The target appeared. Don't want to go on whining, so I'll just end this by saying that this actually is a great game,but be prepared for all sorts of small glitches and problems, and keep in mind you are likely to end up seeing some crazy s**t that's (hopefully) not there by design, before you've reached 100% in game.P.S. POSSIBLE SPOILER: I was really disappointed to see we only got a glimpse of some of the most interesting characters in the game, before we lose them for good. I would have wished to see much more of Blackbeard and Mary. Specially I think it's a shame how soon Mary was just ""written off"", without a good background story...			"

This game does not feel like an assassin's creed title, but it feels like teh Far Cry 3 of the AC series. The gameplay is beautiful, and the sailing is majestic and fluid.

This game is truly next to A.C II in its quality and any true fan of 3rd person character action/ truly dramatic storytelling, pick it up. 10/10			"

												Before I start my review, I would like to say that I'm a fanboy of the AC series so I may overlook issues with the game.Story:- Likeable personality for the protagonist- Interesting and fleshed out side characters that you will get attached to.Mechanics:- Ship-Ship fighting mechanics are very enjoyable and sometimes actually quite challenging- Melee fighting mechanics were slightly changed in this game and were not as enjoyable as it was in AC3 (not as satisfying combos)- Range fighting is much better with the use of multiple pistols, berserk/sleep/rope darts.- The guards AI is not very much different from the previous games (I do like the introduction of guards with a long range rifle on guard towers).- Stealth is much improved by the addition of stalking zones.Conclusion:I am enjoying this game quite a lot and would definitely recommend it to fans of the series as well as players who are new to the franchise.

												Forward: I've been playing this game in offline mode so my hours haven't been officially logged, but I've probably put close to 30-40 hours in at the time of this review.This game competes for the best Assassin's Creed title to date since AC II. And AC II is in my top 10 games of the past 20 years.First off, the gameplay. This game definitely take a bit of a change from the AC titles of old that put emphasis (ish) on stealth. You're a pirate with two swords. And four pistols. And a lot of other tools in your arsenal. If there's no stealth bonus for the particular mission you're playing, or the game doesn't require you to stay hidden, it's actually to your advantage to go in guns blazing and swords flashing. You'll get the job done quicker and if you're even moderately okay at countering enemy attacks, it's possible to get through the entire game without taking a single point of damage to Edward. Pretty cool. The kill animations are also pretty satisfying, so bonus for that too.The climbing animations are fantastic as well. Scaling tall buildings in mere seconds has never felt so good. That 5 story church tower over there? You can climb it in probably 6 seconds. Edward climbs fast, and his agility is definitely a focal point of his animations.The story. I haven't finished it yet, but I think I'm probably 80ish percent done. The story is probably the second best part of this game. As is AC's trademark, there are famous people integrated quite well, and you can actually develop feelings towards these different characters, including Edward. Without saying much, it is a long story in comparison to the previous AC titles because of.....The sailing. The naval mechanics of this game are EXTREMELY well done. This alone could have sold this game. The camera angles look good and aren't crazy, and changing the angle is as simple as can be. The ship you sail on, the Jackdaw, comes with plenty of weapons too, and changing which weapon you fire is as simple as changing the camera angle. The story takes so long because it's absolutely essential you upgrade your ship to progress. Edward upgrades come last (unless it's crafting. Those don't cost reales), Jackdaw upgrades are hugely important.Basically, 9.5/10			"

												In my opinion the best Assassin’s Creed game. Sadly, you have to play occasionally the Abstergo parts, to get back to the pirate part. This is very annoying.There are a few bugs, sometimes you get stuck in the environment and you have to restart the game. But not too often, about every 5-10 hours.The movement-control is ok, but sometimes it drives you mad.The sword combat is lame: perry, hit, parry, hit, parry, hit, hit & hit. You have to do that frequently and it does not functions really. You better sneak, it's much more fun.Graphics are stunning, and no other game gives you an experience like that.The seafarings are the heart of the game and battles on the sea are great.I would give 8/10, because of the annoying Abstergo part and the lame close combat part.I bought the season pass too, but it's kind of dispensable.Someone here explained how to activate it.Right click on Assassins Creed Black Flag in the library.Then choose View CD key and copy the season pass key into clipboard.Paste it in your Uplay account under activate product. Now you get a few new contents, two new harbors with missions and the Single Player Campaign Freedom Cry.			"

												The last Assassin's Creed I truly enjoyed until now was Brotherhood. It was fun, it was in Rome and the AC story had not been dragged on for an eternity. Now the Desmond is dead and his autopsy is there for us to watch, AC Black Flag adds a lot of life to this never ending series. I loved the sailing missions from ACIII and I was sad when they were finishded. I guess Ubisoft loved those missions too, because Black Flag is all about sailing! Between story missions I spent hours pirating and sailing the seas. The money you make has an actual use (unlike brotherhood or III), that is to upgrade the Jackdaw. The story was great and the gameplay was awesome. Black Flag took some pointers from Far Cry 3. Inorder to carry four pistols you must first hunt and skin a bunch of animals. These animals range from wild pigs to humpback whales. Black Flag truly understands that in a sandbox game the player should get lost in the world that has been created.EDIT: One negative thing I just noticed is the Time Saver DLC. WHAT?! That's just ridiculous. Pay us money to play the game for you, yeah right. The the beautiful thing about AC Black Flag is the exploring of the world and finding that hidden treasure. Not to have the game developers point it out and say here you go. If you use the time saver dlc, shame on you. But, then again it is your money, waste it how you will.EDIT 2: This game still holds up as the best AC game.			"

												Some fondly remembered game designs have aged poorly, but if I didn’t know that The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker came out 10 years ago on GameCube, it would be easy to believe that this HD re-release was a brand-new PC game. That’s how well this classic action adventure game holds up. Its admirable longevity stems from excellent combat, charming characters, fun side-quests, inventive dungeons, one of the series’ best stories, and a cel-shaded art style that, while divisive, still looks great. For the re-release, Nintendo made very smart decisions about what to update and what to leave alone.			"

Similar gameplay to AC3 and Liberation, except for ship battles have changed from AC3 to become what I found more easy.			"

												Controls suck and will screw you over alot.  You will probably rage alot playing this.  That being said the game is still alot of fun, im enjoying the story thus far (~30% completed) Graphics are great and it performs well for the most part.  The characters are likeable and the locations are great.  Game mechanics leave alot to be desired though.Update:  Game is still good.  Programming is horrible.  These missions that require you to tail someone and also requiring you to keep them in your sights is terrible.  You can literally be standing next to your target but if you arent looking at them you can fail if you dont reacquire them quickly.  That along with how often the parkour system does the opposite of what youre trying to accomplish this game is a programming nightmare. Also, and one of my biggest issues with this game.... there is no stealth mode/crouch/duck at all.  Im on rooftops and people on the ground that didnt know i was there yet will see me.  There is no way to sneak across, you will be standing straight up like an idiot.  Its baffling that a game with stealth in mind doesnt offer you a way to conceal yourself without bushes or hay piles.Update:  Controls really suck.  Really bad.  If you are trying to run in one direction the game will make you try and climb something in another direction.  Especially while chasing someone, and how are they faster and better climbers than your guy?  This is every single person you may chase.  Ubisoft has a bad habit of seeming not having any quality control.  Its like they never have someone test the game, or they just refuse to fix minor issues that can really ruin gameplay.  I cant tell you how many times im trying to move into a better positon for an assasination or actually trying to make the assassination and my guy jumps to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ area instead.

												I really love the Assassin's series. Always buy them to support the developers. In addition I already played the whole game on my PS3 I wanted it on my PC too, after a couple of years. I decided to buy the game and load in a savegame so I can roam around and stuff but it wont let me. Uplay is a little b!tch and I am a cry baby. Im going to refund this awesome game cause I got no other choice then download the game from a torrent site. -1 for Uplay. ... ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is probably one of my personal favorites when looking at the franchise as a whole. It is incredibly immersive and really gives you a glimpse into some basic pirate culture of the early 1700's. The reason this game was one of my favorites was because it played quite differently to the other AC games. Naval combat was enjoyable and never got boring or repetitive no matter how many times you did it. It was a great addition to the game as it allowed the player to sail freely around a large carribean ocean to various islands, forts, and ancient ruins in search of treasure. Upgrades to the ship were rewarding and never felt overpowered, while they did not take a terribly long time to achieve either. There wasn't a feeling that you had to grind for hours upon end to achieve a single upgrade that gives you a minor improvement. It was well balanced in my opinion and was nice to see your ship grow as the story progressed on.In actual gameplay mechanics and performance; it was great overall. Being an Assassins Creed game, it is mainly stealth based and did quite a good job at fulfilling that goal. The stealth system in this game is much improved over past AC games such as II, Brotherhood, and Revelations. It is not nearly as clunky and feels much faster and refined for a better gameplay experience. Graphic wise, Black Flag looks amazing, which is mainly due to the ""next gen"" effects such as torrential rain, sun glares, and vastly improved water reflections. I have to say, getting into a naval battle in the middle of a huge sea storm is spectacular, while also a bit tense, and probably one of the coolest things I have ever seen in a game. It is hard not to admire the scenery at times, no matter what it may be, ranging from lush and living jungles teeming with wildlife, to traversing the oceans and exploring the landscape. The only drawback to these features is that they are very taxing on performance and require a fairly good machine.Overall, I thought this game to be a brilliant addition to the franchise, and a solid game overall with very few arguments against it. I would highly recommend this game and it is a must have for any Assassin's Creed fan.			"

Best AC game in the series too. they kept the animus mumbo-jumbo to a minimum this time compared to the previous games. the graphics are gorgeous and the main character Edward is likeable rogue (just replaced Ezio for me!). the ship battles are a lotta fun and there's plenty things to do beside the main storyline as well. The Uplay bits can be a bit annoying at times but i can live with it i guess.Highly recommended. A 9/10!			"

												First 15 hours of this game is new adventures and features that Assassin's Creed three did not get right. The upgrading of your ship and weapons as well as adding more guns and bombs to your arsenal keeps you in the game. My main problems with this game is that it does not challenge me. By hour 25 I was the god of all combat and entire armies can be killed off by the main characters combination of guns, bombs, and blades. If you have played other Assassin Creed games you already know what to expect with the added bonus of the naval battles which early in the game are challenging and fun. By late game you have so much armor and cannons you can defeat several large ships at once. Also sea shanties are fantastic. Love the game but by the time I was near the end I was sick of it and did not feel challenged. Some people like that but I do not.			"

Long version: You're a privateer turned pirate who gets involved in the Templars VS Assassin conflict and try to make money off it. Short version: Sneaking and Stabbing with Ships and S*it. There arer so many tailing missions you'll feel forced to finish them. I also felt that there lacked detail in general.EDIT: Freedom Cry story is pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥ Nice way they touched on such a sensative isssue without being called racistsVERDICT: 8.5 out of 10 It would be a perfect 10 if the story was a little better but I have to say all the characters were very realistic and at times you felt really into it. Howver, most of the game is like a never cuming organsm (pardon the pun). Your waiting, waiting, waiting, and the games over. The open world neverending side quests and activities makes up for that tough .			"

												So far AC Brotherhood was my favourite from the series but Black Flag is a serious contender to dethrone it. Hell, if it goes for main campaign I actually enjoyed almost every single bit. Cons:- Glitches: They are back. Not many, but some of the most irritating ones I've ever witnessed in the series. Example: your quartermaster's voice is just not there after certain (luckily far) point in the game. Ade from DLC also was blessed with sweet female voice for a while. (Now everything makes sense!). Also once I've found myself trapped inside the ship during boarding. I couldn't swim out. It was awkward.- Moving on ramps/masts during boarding: I wanted to jump lower on the mast, instead Kenway grabbed the line... Sometimes he flew on it so far, he ended up in the water far from the ship boarded. There were few situations like that, oh boy, and was I not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Freedom Cry DLC: it's not as good as it could be. In fact, after pure joy that main campaign was, this DLC drastically cooled it down after first two - three missions. Potential wasted.- Honestly I cannot think of anything else.Pros:- Environment. I guess that's the strongest side. Everywhere you look, it's gorgeous: from the sea, sandy beaches, to vegetation and wildlife. All is lively, sunny (or stormy) it makes you want to sit on the stool and drool... I mean, watch the sunset. There are taverns where a very nice songs can be heard. You can also get drunk. (Although effect isn't nearly as epic as when you get a wasted Witcher).- Music: always one of the strongest aspects of the series. No different here. - Characters: extremely well done, voice-acted and presented. Main character is also a joy to witness. [Benny Hornigold, my favourite scallywag, I liked him even after.] - Education: I've learned more from this game about pirates and the Caribbean during XVIIIth century then from any other source. True I was never much interested, but hey, don't let fools tell you games cannot teach!- Story: it was good despite my fears (ignited by malcontents who wouldn't recognize a perfect game even if they ripped on it) that it may have little to do with the Assassin's Creed story from the previous games. There is a continuation and it's not that silly.- Outfits: decent number of them, few really really good ones. - Weapons and combat system: same old, same old, and old is gold. You can have up to 4 pistols now. Shooting them is fun.- Jackdaw: your very own ship, you can change its appearance and upgrade it. You can have your crew and best of all - you can have shanties. What's not to love. - Cheats: this was the first AC game I was tempted to use some. Some are hilarious, me hearties!- Underwater missions: cool new addition. Irritating at times, but magical too,  especially with the sounds of marine life. In fact, I wish there were more. - To get full sync was not as irritating this time around (for the main campaign that is). Requirements not maddening. - Present part: I liked the twist and connection between AC in the past and the present Abstergo. I honestly didn't expect that and well... I like being surprised. Other then that, it was a bit tired after some time.- Multi-player: if anybody cares.This game is a gem. Even if someone is not very much into Assassins - Templar tough love, it is a joy just to play it. "

												This game is alright. It places a lot of stress on boat exploration. Which is good considering it is the best part of this game. However, running across the rooftops of Rome or Venice is more fun than riding a boat. Naval battles are where your computer will be put to the test. If you have anything lower than the recommended equipment, you'd might as well buy Revalations.Boats:Naval battles provide hours of entertainment. There is nothing more fun in an AC game to date. Riding around in the Jackdaw will keep you hooked on this game for a long time. If you like the running across rooftops of older games, however, this game won't suit your fancy. Like Assassin's Creed 3, there are very few giant cities for Edward to run around. But honestly, the boats alone are great enough to merit a purchase.Gameplay:There's still no sneak machanic, however, this game doesn't need one. You spend so little time assassinating people that a sneak feature wouldn't really help you. Instead, you get tailing missions (Yeaaaaaah). I never really noticed how many tailing missions you could fit into a game. Now I know: enough to make the story not worth following. Story:Ehh... I didn't finish the story, it isn't really that interesting. For me, the game ended when my ship was as overpowered as I felt like making it. Edward is a fine main character, I guess, but Ezio is still better. Heck, you could even argue that Connor is a better main character. Edward is the first assassin in the series whose goals involve money, rather than furthering the assassins and providing order. Which is fine, but that makes him really unrelatable. Overall, the story and main character are both a hit-or-miss.There are other features to this game, but if you're buying this game for those, you're wasting your money. I give this game an 7.5/10. It's fun, but the tailing missions and lack of things to do (and climb) on solid ground are dissapointing.			"

												A diamond in the rough. AC IV has a fair few un-fixed bugs, parts of the game are via a website that frequently fails and claims that it's a Beta, and there's various oddball moments such as punching someone or using a sleep dart and having it register as a kill. There's a lot of clipping errors in the clothing and  other small matters.None of these prevents you from enjoying the game though - And at about 80 hours of gameplay, with a nice variety of outfits and upgrades to chase, it's a worthy chapter in the Assasin's Creed series.Especially once it's on sale.

												This might be the best pirate game ever made. (It's a so-so Assassin's Creed title)At the time of writing, I've played 59.4 hrs. I'd say 30 hours of that is sailing the open sea.I absolutely loved this game and the fact that Ubisoft actually tried something different.Prepare to literally set sail across the open sea looking for plunder be it sunken treasure, Spanish/British Treasure Galleons, or release hell from your broadside cannons on enemies forts.All the while listening to crew singing sea shanties and your praises cap'n!The gunplay and swordplay are very good and satisfying. You sail from island to island playing the single-player gathering crewmates. After a while you can capture ships and add them to your ""fleet"". Basically other assassins like you had in AC: Brotherhood. These ships can go off and do cargo missions and give ya more booty.So if you're looking for a Pirate game you have to pick this up. For fans of the (in my opinion) weakening Assassin's Creed narrative, this game is somewhat lacking. It's still leaps and bounds better than Assassin's Creed III.			"

												Now, after finishing the game's main storyline, I can really recommend it - Black Flag is immersive, interesting, full of different choices, things to do, places to go, people to meet (read: kill) and secrets to unravel. It's all really cool. But - there is always a 'but' - when playing the very first Assassin's Creed the whole idea of a technology which sends the player's avatar back into the memories of someone who lived centuries ago was interesting and captivating and the whole story-within-a-story was original, then in Black Flag the whole Abstergo storyline is not just boring - it's a complete intellectual failure, an irritating feature which disturbs by the gameplay and doesn't ad a thing to the gameplay. On the contrary - it only takes some of the fun away with needless, utterly boring and impossible to follow breaks in Edward Kenway's otherways great and interesting story.			"

The campaign along with the things you do roughly add to only 50-60 percent of the game and the other percent is leveling up your character and your navy, collecting all the animus fragments, chest and hidden treasures, The game overall is a must have, the ammount of things to do are endless.

												Where do i begin with this game, well its pretty damn good and probobly the best Assassin's Creed that is out.lets start with what the game does right. The story is top notch. in this AC title you review the memories of Edward Kenway a man who became a pirate to try and become rich to support his family. well on one unfortunate day the ship he was on wrecks and he is stuck whith what you think is an assassin on a beach so you end up cassing said assassin down killing him and taking his outfit and a object to be dilivered to the govoner of Havana. Well turns out that they are templars the assassin that you killed betrayed the assassin's and guess what the templars are searching for an object that will give them the power to take over the world. So you gotta kill them and get the object easy enough. Ok well the story might sound a bit dull but trust me its good. Character development is outstanding and there were quite a few twists  and scenes that left me saying ""♥♥♥♥ you game"" in a good way of corse. also you play as an employee for Abstergo to make movies so the templars can find a peice of eden.Gameplay is pretty much the same just with a few diffences wich mostly pertain to naval combat so all of that is good. And finaly the look of the game. The graphics are outsanding. Nice texture quality, reletivly good lighting, and the enviornments were really well done. Also if your pc can handel maxing out water do it cuase it looks really nice.Alright so what are the flaws of this game. Lets start with naval combat. Now dont take this the wrong way, The naval combat is well done but my god if i dont want to do naval combat to grind ship upgrades for the love of god dont put 2 man o wars infront fo a missinon zone as well as a naval fort please. That is probobly the biggest flaw this game has. Like i said naval combat is well done but some people are not fans of naval combat.And then another flaw i have is with the Audio. It seems like there is a bug with rain and your audio settings where once it starts raining Kenway turns into MR. Elephant man and start stomping arround causing all sorts of ear♥♥♥♥♥♥ it got tot the point in some parts where i could not stand to have my headset on my neck because of how loud the game got. So  how do i rate this game i give it about a 8 out of 10 and definatly worth your time if you like the AC franchise  "

												So far so great! I am really enjoying this game so far. Once I realized that for some silly reason Steam couples the game with a wickedly outdated version of Uplay and then just hopped over to their site and got an updated version it works great. On a quick side note I love that I can launch the game with the controller once I open Uplay, without any third party software at all. So really to all the people who are bad mouthing this game becuase of Uplay, Google is not just for porn, and their are plenty of helpful threads on Steam as well. I just had to throw that out there and get that over with.As for the game itself it is a lot of fun and thus far the story is really interesting and engaging. I could do without the sequences outside of the Animus though, to be honest, that feels a little tacked on. Other than that it is good though. The boarding cutscenes are sadly dissatifying though since they are all the same, if you could skip them I would be super happy, happier if they didn't phone that in, but that is pretty easy to overlook in the long run. I would love to write more right now but I have the high seas to sail, and swashes to buckle! YAR MATEY!			"

												I haven't played much of the campaign but these are my current impressions:Pros:- Sailing and sea combat is really fun and addicting.- Ship and weapon upgrades require materials which you get from raiding other ships.- Assassination missions are fun and sometimes challenging.- Collectibles are kinda fun to collect.- Base building is fun and makes useful buildings.- Graphics and water textures are really nice.Cons:- A bit laggy if you have a lower end PC or laptop.- Story didn't catch my interest.- Kenway's Fleet* was fun at first but then started to feel like a chore.- I wasn't interested in what I saw of the present storyline (but it might get better.)- Multiplayer didn't have anything to do with ships.All in all, I enjoyed playing this for the time I did, I suggest getting this if you think you will like the sea battles.*Kenway's Fleet is a mode where you select your ships and send them on missions and have to wait in real time for them to complete. It's like a freemium app.			"

												Well, if you're readng this, you've probably played 1-3 Assassins Creed games already so you probably know what to expect. Probably the last Assassin's Creed game that my computer will be able to run so i guess i'll have to live it up. Anyways less about me. The game is nice, clearly Ubisoft has done something about some of the worst mechanisms of AC3, sailing is better and such, very similar to AC Rouge if you've played thatPRO TIP:The game will run at around 7-10 fps on the average computer so if you expect more, disable some of the useless features in the graphics settings, disable things like ""high quality water"" and ""improved shadow textures"" and the game will run smooth as hell			"

												Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag is a refreshing take on the Assassins Creed series (almost its own genre now).No longer are you an assassin from the get go. No longer are you hunting templars from the get go. No, this story pulls you in gradually, making you care more for its characters than its overarching plotlines. And that's not a bad thing. In fact, its the characters that will leave the most lasting impression on you in this game. Well, that, and blowing the heck out of the British navy, but meh... that's just fun for a few times, right?Wrong. The gameplay in this game is, dare I say, wild, ambitious, intense, adventorous, and risky. Yes, risky. There was never a gaurantee that ship based naval combat would work in a series like Assassins Creed, but Ubisoft flexed their muscles on this one. Not only does it work, its plain fun. Sailing the seas and riding the waves is peaceful, but its the cataclysmic storms that blow in your way whilst you're engaged with a Spanish frigate that really spices things up. Things like using waves as cover, and trying to time your shots just right so you maximize damage and unload with your swivel guns. It's damn intense. And no, it doesn't get old fast. After the 30th ship, its still fun. Damn fun (again). Pumping that action and exploring along is a score that, again, might be the best in the series. Nothing has made me feel more like a pirate up to no good since Zimmer's classic campaigning themes from the Pirates of the Carribean films. I'll just say... music is suppose to enhance the experience; this score does that. Therefore it succeeds. I don't want to go into nitty gritty details about the story, but I will say there is no 'one story'. It starts off making you think its that simple, but as it goes on, things crumble, loved ones die, priorities shift, and Edward changes. It's a great progression, and one I'd enjoy seeing more from this series. Edward is extremely likeable. Even when plundering and scavenging. Even when being the badass pirate he is, there's a lot to like about this man who's simply looking for an easy life. Albeit, one that cannot be obtained easily. And that quest for riches and a quiet peaceful living soon take a turn when he's caught up in much larger affairs.There are a few errors for all its glory, though indeed they are few. Some graphical glitches here and there, including the occasional pop in textures. The modern day story line succeeds in really doing nothing but pulling you away from the story you *actually* care about. There's also some AI bugs that could use some attention. The graphics in general, while beautiful on the seas, begin to show their age on land. That, likely, being the outcome of it being a cross gen title and not running on a pure 'next gen' optimized engine; something we'll have to wait for Unity to bring.All in all, this is a great one. The best in the series, I would say. Definitely the best since the second, which seems to be most people's favorite. But for me the bombastic score, adventurous theme, intense naval battles, and superior character writing to anything Ubisoft has put out so far in the franchise, puts this entry a wave above the rest.Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag sails in high at a score of 8.9			"

												It's the best AC game that I've played so far.Pros:- Does an excellent job of transforming an assasin game into a pirate game. It goes further than Sid Meyer's in terms of what you can do as a pirate.- The ship upgrade system was well done, and had good progression.- The gameplay at sea is completely new to AC, and done very well. It's not like a minigame thrown together.- The map is vast, but not needlessly so. Huge, where everything still feels like it belongs and has a purpose.Cons:- I didn't like the ""real world"" pieces outside of the 18th century that all AC games tend to throw you into. It felt like busy work and the story was not interesting enough to make me want to do any of these things.- The underwater exploration parts of the game felt tedious, and unfortunetly all the major ship upgrades require you to do some of these. The least fun part of the game in my opinion.- I would have liked to see harder ship battles beyond the high-level ""man o' war"" war gallions. The legendary ships were decent, but when you destroy those you're basically the king of the sea, and nothing feels threatening anymore.			"

												Refreshingly better then the last few Assassin's Creed games but I can't help but think this series is in decline.Black Flag is definately better then Assassin's Creed 3 and Revelations, but imo the series peaked at Assassin's Creed 2 and they've been doing little more then stamping out sequals for cash since.The navel combat introduced in Assassin's Creed 3 has been polished and is now a main focus in this installment of the series; if you are a fan of the Assassin's Creed series then this one won't dissapoint you, however the epic feel this series used to have is just gone and probably won't ever come back.

												Well after playing alot of the Singleplayer and Multiplayer, I think I can do an accurate overview of the game.PROS/CONS IN SINGLEPLAYER{+/-}+Better graphics+Fun and interesting story/plot which will guarantee alot of hours spent towards Singleplayer+Nice combat system+You can use many different ""tools""(secondary weapons) such as smoke bombs, blow darts, and having 4 guns at the same time!+As this is a ""piratey"" Assassin's Creed game, there is obviously alot of emphasis on sailing/privateering and its also alot of fun to just destroy different ships and then choose what to do with them (e.g. send to ""Kenway's Fleet or Lower your wanted level"")+So many different locations you can travel to and explore+Aside from the main missions, there are also a ton of side quests, treasure chests, assassin contracts and more which will keep you occupied and playing this game-As you can tell from many other reviews, Poor Optimization for PC (even if you have a decent graphics card/cpu there will still be frame drops and low fps)-Some missions/memories are just annoying usually because you do one small mistake and you have to restart the whole memory (this is just my view and the amount of these memories is very little)-Kenway's Fleet takes a long time and is also annoying8.5/10 for most people, 9/10 for me because I just love this gamePROS/CONS IN MULTIPLAYER{+/-}+Very fun to play+There are many different game modes (such as Manhunt, Wanted, Artifact Assasult etc.)+Wolfpack is also nice (although playing against other people is much more fun than playing co-op against some AI)+NEW FEATURE: Game Lab lets you customize gamemodes and create your own ""modes"" that you can save and play with friends (for example never ending Manhunt games that take soooo long or super hard Assassinate matches where you gain less points for doing things once you locked a target, the target is locked FOREVER or until you kill him/her)+You can customize all the characters and your profile and there are many ways to do so+Nice leveling system that always has motivation to not only play for fun, but also to level up and unlock a lot of stuff-Wierd bugs/glitches were you sometimes just randomly go into Limited Mode-Uplay...-There was a HUGE bug in the Quick Match matchmaking where you could never join games and had to make custom games by inviting and having A TON of people as friends (Which was a pain in the a**) but I think they fixed the bug the day I made this Review7/10Overall, I would definitly reccomend buying and playing this game as it is a TON of fun (assuming you dont mind the cons and gltichy Multiplayer) especially if it is on sale for like $10/$20 as full price might not be as worth the money. 8/10 for the game as a whole.P.S. Also keep in mind that this is my second AC game and the only other AC game I played was Brotherhood, so obvously my review can be a bit biased as I could only compare to that game which was released 3 years ago.

												I've never really been drawn into the Assassin's Creed franchise. I've played a solid ten hours of the first, dabbled in the second and spent a little more time in Assassin's Creed 3. None of them reached out and grabbed my attention, demanding I play them until conclusion. Black Flag has certainly done that. While the endless tedium of ""tail"" missions and the sudden jarring jolt of the present day sections are in danger of marring this almost perfect game, it's other elements more than make up for these faults. The atmosphere, music, story, setting and sheer beauty of this game are unrivaled. It feels very much like a modern take on Sid Meyer's Pirates, and that's something I've been waiting a long time for!This is my personal Game of 2013 and easily the best Assassin's Creed game of all time.

												If you were wondering about buying this game and have spare time, stop reading now and buy this game. If you are that kind of person and are intrested in a complete review, read on!OK. I'm going to write a complete review with PROS and CONS of this game. Before that let me say that Assassin's Creed is a game where you play as an assassin. You have your main mission but there is nothing saying that you can't wander off and cause trouble with the guards and what not. There are always side missions and the map is HUGE!PROS:Easy to pick up and play.Combat is simple with the attack+counter keys. You can also break an enemies defense or throw them. Why not?Free running is insane fun. Run up buildings or climb all the way to the top of the ship and plummit down to your death! Or if your precise you can land in the water! Why not?The main missions are always fun, but if you somehow get tired of that you can go and travel+explore, or go try an assassination mission.Graphics are beautiful.Gameplay is smooth and fun. You will never find yourself in a dull moment. Even the parts where you just stalk someone while listening in to their conversations sometimes lay in restricted zones and always are intense.SWORD FIGHTING!!!!!!!!! BLADE FIGHTING!!!!!!!!!!!! MUSKETS AND GUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!! WEAPONRY IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!The ocean is a vast place! Take your boat anywere! Enter a restricted zone? Why not? Need crew or supplies? Raid an ememy boat and take their supplies! Take over a fort? Who says no!!!YOUR NOT JUST AN ASSASSINS. YOUR A FREAKING PIRATE!There are so many more PROS in this game, that I recommend just buying it and finding out for yourself!CONS:The multiplayer isn't the absolute best, although it is fun.The game runs and feels like assassin's creed 3, but this should not stop you from buying this.You can replay missions, but you have to replay the whole entire mission. For example. Say you want to replay the mission where you steal your first boat, then escape in bad weather with rouge waves and tornadoes. Before getting to the part where you drive the boat, you have to spend 30 minutes before hand finding your crew, and this can get annoying if you just want to drive the boat. (INSANE FUN IN THAT KIND OF WEATHER)I know that this has been going on for every game, but I think that you should be able to at least harm civillians. They are technically impervious to everything. It can get a little annoying not being able to just stab them. lol. You can control all the cannons on either side of the boat when you drive it, but I think it would have also been cool if you could have controlled one cannon specifically. That option could have made the boat funner.This took me a long time to write because this game is so much fun that I was having difficulty coming up with cons for the review :DSo go buy this game now.I really love it and I think everyone reading this will love it too.11/10			"

												I've played every single AC game since the first, and this one is definitely the best since AC2 (I'm not sure if anything can beat AC2).The world is massive, there are various cities and towns dotted across the map (rather than just a few big ones)...and these cities/towns are still pretty big and cool to run around in. The real eye-candy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. Even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. The water, the weather, the day/night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at.And the main character is finally likable in an AC game again. Connor in AC3 was just annoying to me, so Ezio was the last really likable character in the series. Edward is a bit of an anti-hero, but that's what makes him likable. Not only is the acting done really well, but he has no issues with doing what he pleases for whatever he wants...as you would expect a pirate to be like.So yes, great title and very worth the buy			"

												Ewally good game, and this isn't being said from a ""fan boy"" perspective as I really haven't played any of the AC games before this one. The controls seem to be pretty smooth, the story is pretty good, and there is an immense amount of things to do in this game. The only drawbacks that I saw were that at times you were limited with collections due to not being able to access an area, such as the Mayan Stones, Yes, the reward was nice for completing this collection, but I felt a little underwhelmed with it due to not being able to complete it until so late into the game.

												What can I say? This is a marvellous game. Pirates! Boarding enemy ships! I think this could be the best Assassin's Creed game in the series.We play as Edward Kenway, a man who wants to see his pockets full of coins and will stop at nothing to acheive that goal. Coming from England, he wants to try his luck as a privateer. Yes... a privateer, of course...One day, an unexpected event changes his life forever. He is now aware that something called The Observatory exists and if he can find it before any other, he'll be the richest man of the seven seas.Where do Templars and Assassins fit in this plot? Well, that you will have to find out for yourself.I'll try to make a list of the things I love about this game.-You are a pirate.-Edward Kenway has a great personality and you'll fall in love with him as soon as the story begins.-Upgrading your ship, the Jackdaw, is a lot of fun.-Battles over the seas.-Boarding enemy ships.-Did I mention you are a pirate?-Hunting whales and sharks.-Nice parkour.-Edward Kenway is brutal when fighting.-Main plot has a good length.-Conquering forts has never been better.-Use the maps you find inside bottles to unearth great treasures.-Side quests, such as Assassination Contracts are really fun to play.-YOU ARE A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PIRATE.-First person POV when outside the Animus.-The sea is alive, it's really beautiful.-Sea shanties! How could I forget? GIVE US A SONG, LADS!I really mean it, I think what I loved the most about this game was navigating with my crew, the sun high in the sky, singing Old Billy Riley, Drunken Sailor and Leave her Johnny.This game is worth every cent. You should grab it right now. It's a real gem.			"

												I'm a grown man and this game actually made me cry at the ending sequence and song!Black Flag will take you on a roller coaster of emotions. It actually inspired me to go to Caribbeans next years and visit all of the islands you get to see in the game. I was having a lot of trouble in my personal life, job etc. at the time and playing Black Flag actually made me remember how amazing and beautiful this world can be, but you just need to follow your own dreams and be in the right places with the right people!11/10 Best game I have ever played, and I have played a lot of games in the last 20 years!

												Very good departure from the tired AC formula. Leaving the stealth elements to a bare minimum and focusing on naval combat and exploration of the caribbean makes this a worthwhile standalone game if not very assassin's creed-y one. The present time storyline manages to be little more than an anchor hindering your progress through the game and its passable actual story and characters. To quote Deadpool: ""He's not here ten seconds before he starts boring us with his dire warning-from-the-future crap!"" Seriously Ubisoft, just drop it and pretend it never existed and everyone will be happy. Other than the story, combat is entertaining enough for the duration of an average playthrough but is a bit on the easy side again, an issue that seems to haunt AC games for all eternity. It looks very cool and the finishers feel satisfyingly brutal, but it really needs some challenge to it. Best point of the game is definetly the naval combat, which feels pretty epic and took the majority of my playtime. Boarding the ships is okay, what with the occasional, no wait, constant crew members hacking you in the back and generally being in the way of cleaning the deck effectively. But despite its many flaws I had fun with this title, more so than previous AC's. Maybe not worth the launch price which I paid but good game overall.			"

												A new and interesting setting as well as a great naval battle system make this game an exceptional derivation from the Assassin's Creed Franchise. Sure, the land combat system is simple and boring, and gameplay in general on the islands consists of the same elements as its predecessors, but the nice looking large open world and entertaining writing could make up for it.If you liked previous Assassin's Creed games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.If you're interested in the setting, you may enjoy this if you have no greater problem with Assassin's Creed.If you neither like pirates nor Assassin's Creed, I honestly could not think of a reason for you to even read this.

												I've played every single AC game since the first, and this one is definitely the best since AC2 (I'm not sure if anything can beat AC2).The world is massive, there are various cities and towns dotted across the map (rather than just a few big ones)...and these cities/towns are still pretty big and cool to run around in. The real eye-candy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. Even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. The water, the weather, the day/night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at.And the main character is finally likable in an AC game again. Connor in AC3 was just annoying to me, so Ezio was the last really likable character in the series. Edward is a bit of an anti-hero, but that's what makes him likable. Not only is the acting done really well, but he has no issues with doing what he pleases for whatever he wants...as you would expect a pirate to be like.So yes, great title and very worth the buy			"

												AC4 was great game, even though at stages it felt like I was playing Pirate's Creed, rather than Assassin's Creed. This change however is quite welcome as the storyline is that of a pirate pretending to be an assassin instead of just an assassin. Similar gameplay to AC3 and Liberation, except for ship battles have changed from AC3 to become what I found more easy.			"

												Quite possibly the best AC game to date, rivaling even the beloved Assassin's Creed 2.  Black Flag takes all of the elements of past games that you love from the stealth and parkour to the battles and story improves them, then adds to them.  The combat system no longer feels like counter after counter and now flows with secondary items fitting into the mix very well.The game also stays fresh by adding a fun, and exciting new element through sailing and ship battles.  Rather than becoming a tedious nuisence like one might expect, fighting on ships and upgrading one's vessel is fun and rewarding, allowing you to take on truly fearsome opponents and capture enemy ships for your own use.Some long time fans of the series critize this game for not being a true Assassins game as for much of the game the protaganist is not truly an assassin.  In my opinion however the game does something far more interesting than tell the story or an assassin.  It tells the story of someone who becomes one.  You learn his motives and watch as he adopts the creed because he believes in it, not because he was born into it.  Something I find to be more compelling.The only downside to this game are the parts that take place in modern day.  You play a voiceless protaganist working in Abstergo and hacking computers to learn more about the world.  All in all it's very boring and adds nothing to the game itself let alone the overarching plot.  Still it's owrth playing and is definitely a better buy than Unity or Rogue.			"

												The best Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2.This is coming from someone who hates pirates.This game comes in three parts being a Assassin, being a ship captain, and being a ubi.... I mean Abstergo employee.The Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved.- Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batman-like (Arkham games) and less Counter-kill spam. - Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered.- They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! (You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around)- Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games.- Side missions are amazing too, they range from under-sea diving to whaling to taking over forts.Being a ship captain is the best part of the game.- I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline.- Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive.- Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.Being a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it.- Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.Multiplayer- haven't touched it, but maybe interstedOther Stuff- Optimization could be better, but it`s a beatiful game.- UPLAY :((   (it`s uncomfartable programm for me. idk about you.

												This game is awesome!The best thing with AC3 was the naval elements.Here is a game built on that, and you are taking the role of a Pirate!! Do I need to say more?One negative thing I can say is that they should have dropped the whole Abstergo and AC aspect of it, and got all in Black Flag with a new start!			"

												In my opinion the best Assassin’s Creed game. Sadly, you have to play occasionally the Abstergo parts, to get back to the pirate part. This is very annoying.There are a few bugs, sometimes you get stuck in the environment and you have to restart the game. But not too often, about every 5-10 hours.The movement-control is ok, but sometimes it drives you mad.The sword combat is lame: perry, hit, parry, hit, parry, hit, hit & hit. You have to do that frequently and it does not functions really. You better sneak, it's much more fun.Graphics are stunning, and no other game gives you an experience like that.The seafarings are the heart of the game and battles on the sea are great.I would give 8/10, because of the annoying Abstergo part and the lame close combat part.I bought the season pass too, but it's kind of dispensable.Someone here explained how to activate it.Right click on Assassins Creed Black Flag in the library.Then choose View CD key and copy the season pass key into clipboard.Paste it in your Uplay account under activate product. Now you get a few new contents, two new harbors with missions and the Single Player Campaign Freedom Cry.			"

												Possibly my favorite of the AC series. Initially, the amount of things to do is rather time consuming and at times, overwhelming, but personally I found the game to be rather enjoyable. Visually striking and an in depth story really made the hours pass by. Whether it was sailing the seas for ships to plunder, or completing missions for the pistol swords, Mayan Armor, and Templar Keys, there was never a boring moment. Cant wait to see what Ubi has in store with AC: Unity			"

												I've played the AC games since the first one appeared on XBox and I must say, this is probably the best Animus endings in the whole series. It actually gives you closure to this man's life. I gave up on events outside the Animus because it's obvious that UbiSoft won't get anywhere with the main story anytime soon. So I try to enjoy the ride whenever a good one comes along. I had so much fun with this game that this is the only game I put in the effort to finish all the side stuff. I do agree with what someone else posted before, that it shouldn't be called Assassin's Creed. It was just a really really really good pirate game. After I beat it I felt so damn tired but; the effort you put into doing the side activities was well worth it. The templar outfit to be more resistant to attacks, the Mayan outfit to repel all bullets, and a fully upgraded boat to take on all the legendary ships; these were well worth the time and sleep I lost fully completely this game. Well done Ubisoft for making a pirate game enjoyable. Probably should have named it Pirates of Nightmare instead of Assassin's Creed though. Just like the trailer in the game lelz.			"

												I didn’t believe when I heard that this game would be focused on ship battles, something that I hated in Assassin’s Creed III. Luckily, I was wrong. Ubisoft delivered an amazing game, not just by it’s story, but all of it. I always thought that any other game could be better than the second one, but they made it. It’s not just entertaining, it has amazing scenarios and many, many places to explore. Another thing that impressed me was the weather system. I risk saying that it’s the best I’ve ever seen in a game. The only complain I have is about the PC version. It’s graphically amazing, but not well optimized. Nothing compared to ACIII, of course. Anyway, thank you, Ubisoft, for making me believe in Assassin’s Creed again.			"

												As a big fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise I would say it is one of the best in the series. The storyline is interesting from start to finish. Graphics look great at sea and on land. The one complaint about this game I would have is that on PC the game does glitch out occasionally. 9/10, highly recommended, for those who played previous AC games as well as those who haven't played a single one.

												Easily one of the best games I've played recently.Graphically beautiful, the textures are high enough resolution that they don't look like a bleary mess when objects are near the camera, godrays are exaggerated enough to be atmospheric but not enough to be intrusive on gameplay, lighting and shadow in general are beautiful and the water is gorgeous despite a few trifles, particularly when you're out at sea and all of these factors combine, the sun shining through your sails and refracting through the waves. TXAA does its job correctly as well. I've rarely seen a game that looks this nice unmodded, though it obviously doesn't stack up to the likes of, say, Crysis 3.While the freerunning is a bit sloppy as in past titles, it's easily manageable, and the handful of forced stealth missions in the game are compensated for by a fair share of naval combat missions.Most of the time I've spent on the game has been sailing, capturing ships, sieging forts, whaling, hunting and collecting the various collectibles strewn around the Caribbean, and it's these things that I've enjoyed the most about the game. I would say the games' strongest points are its appearance and theming, and most of the aforementioned activities build into the latter, setting a distinctly swashbuckling mood.Against the game are a cheesy plot and a reliance on quick time events for encounters with predatory wildlife, particularly sharks which are moderately difficult to avoid and cannot be dealt with in any other way. These aren't big concerns for me. The game also has a definite point where there isn't much left to do, the story is completed, everything there is to be collected is had and you've seen every bit of the world and conquered every enemy, but that isn't a complaint so much as what's there, which has been over 175 hours' worth in my case, being good enough that I want more.

Expect that? Well that's fine if you did, because I know I would have.This game was announced ""Most Pirated Game 2013"", you know, because of the people who pirate the game...oh... I can tell by the dumbfounded look on your face that you're not getting the joke... *face palm*.No worries, don't worry about it. They're not real pirates with guns and swashbucklers, they're internet thieves I tell you, THIEVES!Pirates mainly say such a gray hat comment for why they do it though, ""We want to try out the merchandise before buying it"", well that's not true, you're 7 hours deep in AC 4 Black Flag, I ♥♥♥♥ing doubt you want to replay through that whole scenario and level up everything. Yeah let's be real, you're going to finish the game and be all, ""Yeah AC4 was good, I 'would have' boughten it.""Now let's get off piracy issues;Lots and lots of  Naval Battling, SADLY NO KRAKEN! >< NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!I was hoping for DLC, well if you want to fight one so bad, just go play ArcheAge the MMO of Pirates.Gameplay is rather fun, 4 guns, it's downright ridiculous! 4 ♥♥♥♥ING GUNS!!!! <3The combat mechanics are a lot smoother and duel weilding blades as well as dual hidden blades as well like the prior games.It's rather odd because in this game you're Edward Kenway, Conner's grandfather >.>so the storyline takes a turn and you're doing crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥like WHALING!!!! :O dat whale oil doe sells for high dope $$$$$$$$ you know?

												You may be thinking whether you should buy the game or not after the dissappointing Assassin's Creed 3. Trust me when I say, this is a huge step up from that game. The story has drastically improved and is such an incredible experience throughout the game, the gameplay has been improved and the combat system is as smooth as ever. The ship driving mechanics has been improved a lot and makes it easier to navigate during the naval combat. Every part of the game has been stepped up by Ubisoft since the failure of AC:3. Great game, would recommend to anyone who likes AC series and even the ones who don't.			"

												After the dissapointment that was Assassin's Creed 3, Black Flag really was a surprise. The developers have managed to create an interesting group of characters straight from the history books (Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Anne Bonny etc.) but added their own creative twist to them all. The sailing mechanics introduced in AC3 are even better this time around and for once the side quests are really worth playing. The storyline is a bit difficult to follow and it has some weird time jumps that are never really explained, but the events that take place are are captivating and the player character really evolves from a scurrvy roque to a true assassin. All in all, 4/5 would play again!			"

												I don't really review games that often, if, really any at all.The story was phenomenal, best in the Assassin's Creed series, and one of the best I've honestly seen in a single player game, close up with Deus Ex and a few others.Gameplay was standard AC formula when on land, but with minor, yet crucial differences like the addition of the pistols, and blowdarts. Though, on sea, it was completely different. Imagine AC3's ship combat, but a hundred percent more fluid. Traveling was also a truly immersive experience, the various collectable shanties making the ride just that much more pirate-y.Honestly, my game of the year, even if it came out awhile ago.			"

Whether you're battling a Bull Shark with a harpoon, leading a boarding assault on an enemy frigate, or skulking through the jungle looking for a target to assassinate, the game is beautifully done (in game looks as amazing as the cinematics you see in the trailers), and control is intuitive.  The voice acting is top notch, the characters are distinct and engaging, and most of all; it's a *fun* game.  The various side missions don't feel repetitve and ""chore-like"" as some of the previous games did.  Ultimately, this is a definate buy.  Enjoy the high seas!			"

												Best Assassin's Creed out there by far I'll list my favorites.-Pirates (Upgradable Ships)-Soundtrack (I like the music that plays while in battle)-The automatic parkour system-Story is greatNow here are some cons-Fairly short story (Beat the game on ps4)-Enemys are fairly stupid so battles and or escaping is easy.

												Ahoy mates! This game is an endless open world RPG with pirate ships. If you liked the ship playing aspect from AC3 (or never played that and just want to play a game focused on being a pirate), then this game truly capitalized on those aspects. Sailing the seas in search of undiscovered territory/treasure, completing assassin / main / side quests, going against the templars, parkour style moves, and problem solving through areas. Best thing about being the captain of the Jack Daw? Being able to capture ships to be a part of your fleet, and the awesome crew that sings for you if you want! Better than the radio (since there weren't any). This is a great addition to the AC games, and I highly recommend it.			"

												Well after 44 hours on this game and the main storyline finished i guess i do a review on it.This is to be honest the best game in the series since ac2. The story is good with a lot of charathers and fun but at times repetetive missions. The biggest and best part about this game is the open world, The world is HUGE and the sea is gorgeus. This game also looks SOO good if you only have a decent pc :)So my final verdict for ac4 (black flag) is:8/10 =D			"

												Black Flag is definitely my favorite game in the Assassin's Creed franchise. This is mainly because it brings something new to the table. Instead of focusing solely on regular combat as with past games, you have the opportunity to play as a pirate. This aspect of the game was phenomenal, I found myself spending many hours on raiding ships to find loot and such. It was  really fun to just simply explore around to find hidden treasures all around the map. The stealth gameplay was great as usual with past Assassin's Creed games. I really admired the plot of the game, especially the amazing and emotional ending that it had. Awesome game overall.			"

												Absolutely amazing. Frankly, I would hardly call this game Assassin's Creed. It's just so different from other entries in the franchise, and it's just so much better. I love this series, even despite bad entries like AC3 or Unity, and this game is exactly the reason why. This game proves that Ubisoft actually isn't a bunch of idiots. This game ditched the overly preachy Assassins v Templar shtick that all the other games had, sure both of these are still present, but they are pushed so far to the background that they hardly matter. This game is really about PIRATES. You don't see Assassins or Templars or historical figures on either side taking the stage for this game, you see the famous Caribbean pirates of the 18th century. Edward Kenway, who is the first main character of an Assassin's creed game to not even be an Assassin in any way, takes the spotlight, befriending such characters as Blackbeard, Stede Bonnet, Bart Roberts, all famous pirates of the Caribbean. You won't be confined to a single large city or multiple small cities like previous titles, instead you'll be able to set sail across the Caribbean, attacking other ships and exploring small islands. The story, as usual, isn't much to look at, but the gameplay and characters are FANTASTIC. To anyone who felt burned by other entries into the franchise, I implore you to try Black Flag.			"

												I have played this game little while now and this is what i can say about the game.In my opinion the best assassin's creed game in the serie. A couple of years old but it still checks out with great grafics and probably the best story and gameplay.I love that you can acually purchase a pirate costume in the Uplay store that was a big attraction for me. Realistic also with long reloadtime which makes you have more than 1 gun, badass!!Downsides! The first downside is the ""in combat"" animations walking around. Looks quite awkward and doesn't feel as smooth as Assassin 's Creed Syndicate but its a couple of years old so i forgive.The biggest issue I've spotted so far, is the fact that it's Ubisoft. The game isn't super buggy as other ubisoft games but the server connection in kinda very sh*t.But i would still recommend this game even if the on foot combat is wanky af and the server sucks its still being a pirate owning a ship thats dank af c;			"

												Paid $30 for a steam activation of this game on Amazon. Way more fun than ACIII, being a pirate is great, have been having tons of fun in my first ~10 hours of gameplay. Stay tuned for a better review once I've actually finished the game but for now, totally recommended. Tons of collectibles, as always, and bonus points for the Voynich Manuscript being among them.After ACIII, people probably have a lot of doubts about whether Ubisoft Montreal blew it again on Black Flag. Let me just say that I played a couple hours of ACIII before putting it down in disappointment, and so far Black Flag looks like another game I will strive to 100%, just like II, Brotherhood, and Revelations. Don't let the disappointment of 3 influence your judgement of this game.While the game itself is truly great, you should be warned. While I haven't experienced the serious technical issues that many claim to have encountered on PC, this game does force you to use UPlay, and its not a secret to anybody that UPlay is super-duper-♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game also mysteriously decides to minimize itself every so often if I input too many xbox360 controller commands too quickly.			"

												Very good departure from the tired AC formula. Leaving the stealth elements to a bare minimum and focusing on naval combat and exploration of the caribbean makes this a worthwhile standalone game if not very assassin's creed-y one. The present time storyline manages to be little more than an anchor hindering your progress through the game and its passable actual story and characters. To quote Deadpool: ""He's not here ten seconds before he starts boring us with his dire warning-from-the-future crap!"" Seriously Ubisoft, just drop it and pretend it never existed and everyone will be happy. Other than the story, combat is entertaining enough for the duration of an average playthrough but is a bit on the easy side again, an issue that seems to haunt AC games for all eternity. It looks very cool and the finishers feel satisfyingly brutal, but it really needs some challenge to it. Best point of the game is definetly the naval combat, which feels pretty epic and took the majority of my playtime. Boarding the ships is okay, what with the occasional, no wait, constant crew members hacking you in the back and generally being in the way of cleaning the deck effectively. But despite its many flaws I had fun with this title, more so than previous AC's. Maybe not worth the launch price which I paid but good game overall.			"

												A new and interesting setting as well as a great naval battle system make this game an exceptional derivation from the Assassin's Creed Franchise. Sure, the land combat system is simple and boring, and gameplay in general on the islands consists of the same elements as its predecessors, but the nice looking large open world and entertaining writing could make up for it.If you liked previous Assassin's Creed games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.If you're interested in the setting, you may enjoy this if you have no greater problem with Assassin's Creed.If you neither like pirates nor Assassin's Creed, I honestly could not think of a reason for you to even read this.

												I've played every single AC game since the first, and this one is definitely the best since AC2 (I'm not sure if anything can beat AC2).The world is massive, there are various cities and towns dotted across the map (rather than just a few big ones)...and these cities/towns are still pretty big and cool to run around in. The real eye-candy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. Even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. The water, the weather, the day/night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at.And the main character is finally likable in an AC game again. Connor in AC3 was just annoying to me, so Ezio was the last really likable character in the series. Edward is a bit of an anti-hero, but that's what makes him likable.

The only drawbacks that I saw were that at times you were limited with collections due to not being able to access an area, such as the Mayan Stones, Yes, the reward was nice for completing this collection, but I felt a little underwhelmed with it due to not being able to complete it until so late into the game.

												this is hands down one of the best games i have ever played, mesmorised by the graphics i found the open world had very little littmits to what i could do, this game is full of suprises, but instead of going into the best bit will first strart out with the negatives just to get them out of the way, i noticed a few bugs in the game like the jackjaw (the main ship in the game) to be rising out of the ocean, but i couldn't really say this was a neggative because it looked balls deep in  the awesome factor, so forth i found that the free running wouldn't be as accurate as i hoped it would be and i often found edward repelling off objects which was slightly annoying as well as the Animus scenes taking me away from the fun in the story line and i found that the pc version had a graphics fault by not having tripple buffering locking the game at 30fps, but this was an easy fix if anyone else has this issue i would seek advise on you tube. With this out of the way i can now explain why this is a difinate recommendation, again the graphics are amazing the huge open world looks beautiully expansive stretching right through the Caribbean and is unlike anything i have seen in games yet, the graphics on the waves are uniquely lifelike, as for the combat the fighting looks almost corriagraphed with flowing combos. i again now go to the possibilities of the open world, i found myself lost in all the side quests as they were so fun and adverturous, by taking fortresses, exploring islands and hunting for treasure, overall this is a fantastic game and i would recomend it anyone			"

												Really darn Fun! some idiot had a negative review for this reason                                                                                                    Great game. Easily the best of the AC series so far imo. My problem is that I WOULDN'T be able to recommend this to ANYONE on PC. Consoles... fine... it's obviously just a port anyway but my game is unplayable for months at a time. I'll be able to play it for a few hours one day and then it crashes on start up the day after and won't work again until it randomly decides to. Have contacted Ubisoft but they've been useless at trying to figure something out.I know a LOT of other people have had this issue too.I'm very angry as I've wasted £40 on a game I can only play once in a blue moon when it's on a 'good day'.Some people are idiots with reviews and i wanna tell him this is the only way i can IDIOT IF YOU GOT A CRAPPY MAC YES! IT SUCKS FOR CONSOLES COMPARED TO PC!..... That is all..			"

												Excellent; easily the best of the franchise.  Commanding your own ship, sailing anywhere pillaging and looting as you like; all in the most immersive experience they've ever delivered.  Whether you're battling a Bull Shark with a harpoon, leading a boarding assault on an enemy frigate, or skulking through the jungle looking for a target to assassinate, the game is beautifully done (in game looks as amazing as the cinematics you see in the trailers), and control is intuitive.  The voice acting is top notch, the characters are distinct and engaging, and most of all; it's a *fun* game.  The various side missions don't feel repetitve and ""chore-like"" as some of the previous games did.  Ultimately, this is a definate buy.  Enjoy the high seas!			"

												Ah, Assassins Creed.... So Black Flag is a fantastic pirate sim. I loved how they took the historical characters and made them believeable. They took historical fact and weaved it into the game so as a Historian I found myself smiling rather than fuming.My main annoyance with this game (and the entire series) is the Open world aspect. As I first started to play I wanted a total finish, after getting stuck in the quagmire that is chest after chest, ship after ship, stupid artifact after stupid collectable I quickly realised I was up to 21 hrs of game play and roughly 20% through the game I was bored stiff.  I had forgot the entire story and was looking for pastures new.I left the game for a week or so and then decided to return, this time I quick traveled as much as possible ignored every side quest, something unthinkable in a RPG like Mass Effect / Dragon Age and stuck to the bare bones of the game.In doing this I found a superb and immersive storyline. I enjoyed my play through far more by just sticking to the plot with the occasional ship battle thrown in. A couple of plot twists I didnt see and the inevitable ending (no spoilers) twinned with a very ironic achievement which was a nice nod.The Caribean (played on a high end pc) is lush and looks stunning. The view points being one side quest I did do simply for the panoramics. An aspect I find is really missed is the music. The score to this game is perfectly placed and very emotive. Probably one of the best soundtracks on a game ive played in years.A friend told me that this was a Great Pirate game but bad Assassins Creed game. Being a fan of Sid Meir's Pirates or as it was called in 1996 Pirates Gold! on the Amiga....this is probably the best evolution of that game play. So a tick in the box for pirate sim. As for Assassin's Creed game, I was confused as to why Edward was an Assassin yet not however this was developed in the story and was given real reason and legitimacy for me. At the mid point id say a bad Creed game but by the end I'd say the best Ive played yet.My only real sore thumb is the ""real world"" aspects. Totally pointless and a waste of my time unfortunatly, they are only made relevant in the last half hour of game play and was met with a. ""Ahhh ok, see what you did there......"" rather than a really cool plot twist. I think the whole meta plot Assassins Creed Eden device stuff needs to be buried or made relivant. Almost like they wrote thier cannon before they realised they had a francaise on hand!This said, by the end of the game I had developed a real soft spot for Edward Kenway.			"

												This is like the Need for Speed of pirate games. It isn't super accurate but it is certainly fun. The Far Cry 3 outpost elements work well, as does the PETA trolling whaling/shark hunting mini game. The grind for upgrades/the need for DLC to give you stuff that should be basic/and the remaining Assassin's Creed game elements are dubious at best. The main character is much more likeable than AC3, but the villains are decidedly less interesting. I really love the sea shanties and the pirating sequences but this is the sort of game that's worth it more when it goes on sale unless you must have a pirate game/love them.			"

												A diamond in the rough. AC IV has a fair few un-fixed bugs, parts of the game are via a website that frequently fails and claims that it's a Beta, and there's various oddball moments such as punching someone or using a sleep dart and having it register as a kill. There's a lot of clipping errors in the clothing and  other small matters.None of these prevents you from enjoying the game though - And at about 80 hours of gameplay, with a nice variety of outfits and upgrades to chase, it's a worthy chapter in the Assasin's Creed series.Especially once it's on sale.

												Well after playing alot of the Singleplayer and Multiplayer, I think I can do an accurate overview of the game.PROS/CONS IN SINGLEPLAYER{+/-}+Better graphics+Fun and interesting story/plot which will guarantee alot of hours spent towards Singleplayer+Nice combat system+You can use many different ""tools""(secondary weapons) such as smoke bombs, blow darts, and having 4 guns at the same time!+As this is a ""piratey"" Assassin's Creed game, there is obviously alot of emphasis on sailing/privateering and its also alot of fun to just destroy different ships and then choose what to do with them (e.g. send to ""Kenway's Fleet or Lower your wanted level"")+So many different locations you can travel to and explore+Aside from the main missions, there are also a ton of side quests, treasure chests, assassin contracts and more which will keep you occupied and playing this game-As you can tell from many other reviews, Poor Optimization for PC (even if you have a decent graphics card/cpu there will still be frame drops and low fps)-Some missions/memories are just annoying usually because you do one small mistake and you have to restart the whole memory (this is just my view and the amount of these memories is very little)-Kenway's Fleet takes a long time and is also annoying8.5/10 for most people, 9/10 for me because I just love this gamePROS/CONS IN MULTIPLAYER{+/-}+Very fun to play+There are many different game modes (such as Manhunt, Wanted, Artifact Assasult etc.)+Wolfpack is also nice (although playing against other people is much more fun than playing co-op against some AI)+NEW FEATURE: Game Lab lets you customize gamemodes and create your own ""modes"" that you can save and play with friends (for example never ending Manhunt games that take soooo long or super hard Assassinate matches where you gain less points for doing things once you locked a target, the target is locked FOREVER or until you kill him/her)+You can customize all the characters and your profile and there are many ways to do so+Nice leveling system that always has motivation to not only play for fun, but also to level up and unlock a lot of stuff-Wierd bugs/glitches were you sometimes just randomly go into Limited Mode-Uplay...-There was a HUGE bug in the Quick Match matchmaking where you could never join games and had to make custom games by inviting and having A TON of people as friends (Which was a pain in the a**) but I think they fixed the bug the day I made this Review7/10Overall, I would definitly reccomend buying and playing this game as it is a TON of fun (assuming you dont mind the cons and gltichy Multiplayer) especially if it is on sale for like $10/$20 as full price might not be as worth the money. 8/10 for the game as a whole.P.S. Also keep in mind that this is my second AC game and the only other AC game I played was Brotherhood, so obvously my review can be a bit biased as I could only compare to that game which was released 3 years ago.

												There are 2 ways to look on this game and because of it, I will review both of themReally mediocre Assassins Creed experience:- History and narrative are really boring and barely make better then Assassins Crap 3- Assassination dialogues are the worst in the series- Monotonous and repetitive main quest missions - Bizarre homo flerting that turns on bizarre hetero flerting which is by the way the best plot twist in all game- I found controls were a little clumsy compared with other games in this serieFantastic Pirate Simulator:- Game engine is put to its limit and environment graphics are really amazing and convincing- Huge world and plenty of content to do and explore- Very nice ship battles (this is the best part of the game)- Several chanties for your sailorsI recommend the game considering all above and getting this by no more than $ 20 since the Assassins Creed part of it was really flawed			"

												I've never really been drawn into the Assassin's Creed franchise. I've played a solid ten hours of the first, dabbled in the second and spent a little more time in Assassin's Creed 3. None of them reached out and grabbed my attention, demanding I play them until conclusion. Black Flag has certainly done that. While the endless tedium of ""tail"" missions and the sudden jarring jolt of the present day sections are in danger of marring this almost perfect game, it's other elements more than make up for these faults. The atmosphere, music, story, setting and sheer beauty of this game are unrivaled. It feels very much like a modern take on Sid Meyer's Pirates, and that's something I've been waiting a long time for!This is my personal Game of 2013 and easily the best Assassin's Creed game of all time.

												Refreshingly better then the last few Assassin's Creed games but I can't help but think this series is in decline.Black Flag is definately better then Assassin's Creed 3 and Revelations, but imo the series peaked at Assassin's Creed 2 and they've been doing little more then stamping out sequals for cash since.The navel combat introduced in Assassin's Creed 3 has been polished and is now a main focus in this installment of the series; if you are a fan of the Assassin's Creed series then this one won't dissapoint you, however the epic feel this series used to have is just gone and probably won't ever come back.

												Best game of the year. After you beat the story there is just so much to do! Pros: Graphics are amazingOpen world (so much details)TOO MUCH STUFF TO DOGreat customizationOnline is also loads of funCons:In general I love AC story plots but this game kinda lacked in it. Long version: You're a privateer turned pirate who gets involved in the Templars VS Assassin conflict and try to make money off it. Short version: Sneaking and Stabbing with Ships and S*it. There arer so many tailing missions you'll feel forced to finish them. I also felt that there lacked detail in general.EDIT: Freedom Cry story is pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥ Nice way they touched on such a sensative isssue without being called racistsVERDICT: 8.5 out of 10 It would be a perfect 10 if the story was a little better but I have to say all the characters were very realistic and at times you felt really into it. Howver, most of the game is like a never cuming organsm (pardon the pun). Your waiting, waiting, waiting, and the games over. The open world neverending side quests and activities makes up for that tough .			"

												Before I start my review, I would like to say that I'm a fanboy of the AC series so I may overlook issues with the game.Story:- Likeable personality for the protagonist- Interesting and fleshed out side characters that you will get attached to.Mechanics:- Ship-Ship fighting mechanics are very enjoyable and sometimes actually quite challenging- Melee fighting mechanics were slightly changed in this game and were not as enjoyable as it was in AC3 (not as satisfying combos)- Range fighting is much better with the use of multiple pistols, berserk/sleep/rope darts.- The guards AI is not very much different from the previous games (I do like the introduction of guards with a long range rifle on guard towers).- Stealth is much improved by the addition of stalking zones.Conclusion:I am enjoying this game quite a lot and would definitely recommend it to fans of the series as well as players who are new to the franchise.

												This would be an amazing game if it would not be an Assassin's Creed, but it's still a great game.Sea battles and activities are spot on awesome. Ship combat feels easy and challenging at the same time. Ship boarding is great way to test your melee combat skills and tactics. On land combat and activities feel same old ""Assassiny"", that get boring after a while, island exploring is sometimes challenging for no reason, making full exploration a pain to do, when you can't seem to locate one particular chest.Stealth ""bush"" system is great new addition to the tactics, and add some stealth element to rather boring town combat/exploration. The pirate story side is really great apart from boring Assassins and Templars for the 4th time. There's lack of melee and ranged weapon variety, and once you get couple thousand R (money), you don't have to invest in those.Personal gadget upgrades are a nice touch to make you hunt for specific animals and their hides/bones. Ship upgrades are really nice, and require you to obtain cloth, wood and metal for them via sea battles, apart from R (money) and schematics. All around it's a nice pirate game, even if it's the same old Assassin's Creed under the cover.			"

												After 84 hours, and 75% of the game completed, I really think this is one of the best (if not the best) AC concept ever.A large map (almost) free to roam, plenty of different activities to waste your time with, and some very nice detailing like all the sea shanties, different types of ships, animals, environments, etc. And of course to top it all - It's about pirates! Arrgh. ;)However - There are plenty of problems as well. First of all, Uplay - What the F*** Ubisoft? If you force people to use your software, please, make sure it actually works without problems. My installation works OK, haven't had much problems, but pretty please, don't ever gamble with peoples save game files - I've lost count of all the discusssions I've already seen about lost saves. (!) (Oh and with a game offered on Steam, could you also consider not having the same default hotkeys for some actions, like screenshots, as Steam has?) Second, No Ubisoft, NO! Bad boy. You DO NOT SELL cheats and timesavers as DLCs. That's just wrong, and takes away much from the actual gaming experience.. It is an accepted part of games like this one, that you should either waste your time playing right, or waste your time cheating on Google. It is all a vital part of the complete experience.I've also seen plenty of people wondering how to deactivate their purchased cheats, after they've made the MISTAKE of activating a cheat pack. ( I'm not one of them, don't know if there is a way to do this?) Third, a game still actively sold and supported as far as I know, should really be a finished and polished product by TWO YEARS after release. But NO... There are some crazy bugs out there, like for instance - Today I was carrying out an assassination contract. Killed everyone I found in the target area, but did not find my target. Tried this for multiple times, until I decided to try and drown myself. Strangely, that helped. o_O The target appeared. Don't want to go on whining, so I'll just end this by saying that this actually is a great game,but be prepared for all sorts of small glitches and problems, and keep in mind you are likely to end up seeing some crazy s**t that's (hopefully) not there by design, before you've reached 100% in game.P.S. POSSIBLE SPOILER: I was really disappointed to see we only got a glimpse of some of the most interesting characters in the game, before we lose them for good. I would have wished to see much more of Blackbeard and Mary. Specially I think it's a shame how soon Mary was just ""written off"", without a good background story...			"

												9/10.Really enjoyed this game, while retaining all the Assassin’s Creed gameplay elements, Black Flag's main selling point is no doubt the sea battles and free sailing. Good character and ship customisation brings a lot of fun to the game and motivates plays to go out and collect treasures and blueprints on remote islands. Although in my opinion the customisations were limited. Combat system is great, many approaches a player can use when it comes to land combat. Whilst at sea combat tent to get repetitive after reaching higher levels. The forts/cities are designed amazingly, lots of things to do and discover. NPC dialogues were well made and the campaign was well presented.  "

												It is common knowledge that after Revelations, the franchise sort of went down hill. However, Black Flag may be the exception as it offers a completely unique perspective of pirating. This game is absolutely amazing, sailing the crystal clear waters of the Carribean and plundering English and Spanish ships. Upgrade the Jackdaw to take down bigger ships with better loot. I must admit though, I purely enjoy this game for the gameplay. As a seperate game from the Assassins Creed franchise I might have rated it higher, but as it is an AC game I must admit, in terms of story it was judt lacking compared to the Ezio/altair story and there is far more emphasis on pirating around than being an assassin saving the world. As I said though, the gameplay is great and you are guaranteed to have a lot of fun (and a lot of retrys on the Legendary ships).I would recommend this game but not for those who want the story and architectural richness of other assassins creed games but as a pirates of the Carribean type game.7/10			"

												Эдвард — официально вроде бы не ассасин, но действует он точно так же, как и все члены братства: так же дерется, так же карабкается по крышам и так же прячется в кустах. Все ключевые механики Assassin’s Creed толком не обновлялись со времен первой части, и Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag в этом смысле ничего не меняет. Все сражения, как и шесть лет назад, выигрываются контратаками, любые высокие сооружения покоряются одной кнопкой, а прятаться все так же можно в траве высотой по колено. Враги не стали умнее, нового оружия и приемов практически нет, а все сухопутные задания — сборник примитивных поручений из предыдущих выпусков: догони, убеги, проследи и подслушай разговор. Заняться на суше в Black Flag совершенно нечем.Но, к счастью, спускаться туда нужно только по ключевым сюжетным делам, все остальное время можно проводить в открытом море. Уже через пару часов игры вы получаете собственный корабль (Эдвард назовет его «Галка») и можете тут же отправиться грабить и убивать. Ощущения — потрясающие: ворочая штурвалом, вы тактильно чувствуете исполинские размеры и мощь вашего брига, каждую волну и каждое дуновение ветра. Даже самая пустяковая битва — масштабное шоу: посудины кружатся, выцеливают друг друга, обмениваются серией залпов, все горит, дымит и взрывается. В этом контексте даже устаревшие механики работают по-новому: давно надоевшие бои и паркур на время вновь увлекают, когда берешь на абордаж чужой корабль, прыгаешь между мачтами и фехтуешь с вражеским капитаном.Отправляясь в открытое море, никогда точно не знаешь, что тебя ждет. Можно нарваться на других пиратов, можно попасть в шторм, можно грабить одинокие шхуны или выслеживать жертв покрупнее, можно купить водолазный колокол и погружаться под воду, можно искать сокровища или брать штурмом укрепленные форты. Добыча идет на апгрейды: если не наращивать огневую мощь «Галки», можно легко потонуть при первой же встрече с небольшой вражеской флотилией. Наконец, нужно помнить о команде. После особенно громких столкновений может погибнуть чуть ли не половина всех матросов, и придется набирать новых: спасая пойманных бандитов от расстрелов и виселицы, нанимая пьяниц в тавернах, переманивая на свою стороны пленных или подбирая на борт случайных утопающих.Если первая и третья части Assassin’s Creed претендовали на какую-то псевдоисторическую постановку, то Assassin’s Creed 4, как и Assassin's Creed 2 — это скорее пестрое тематическое шоу из казино в Лас-Вегасе. Все ходят в ярких одеждах, большие шляпы украшены смешными перьями, убийцы носят на себе сложные системы из поясов и ремней, чтобы брать в бой сразу десяток пистолетов, и если в кадре появляется, скажем, Черная борода (а он — далеко не единственный исторический персонаж, который вам встретится), то выглядеть он будет так, как выглядел бы в мультфильме.Но именно этого и ждешь от игры про сокровища, ром, моря и джунгли. Black Flag — игра для тех, что любит флибустьеров скорее образца «Пиратов Карибского моря», чем реконструкций канала BBC. Большая любовь к пиратам наверняка заставит кого-то исследовать мир до последнего квадратного сантиметра, но вообще игра к этому не особенно располагает. Слишком похожи друга на друга острова, слишком обычный сценарий, слишком мало мифов и легенд вокруг тайников, слишком мало интересных мест, слишком мало сюрпризов в принципе. Авторы все же гораздо чаще, чем нужно, заставляют вас заниматься привычными ассасинскими делами, а для того, чтобы стать Sid Meier's Pirates! нового поколения, у Black Flag мало контента. Не хватает интересных побочных заданий в море, не хватает подробной кастомизации корабля и детального менеджмента команды, не хватает, в конце концов, интересных ситуаций. Штурмовать форты и захватывать суда по одной и той же схеме невероятно интересно первые пять, десять или пятнадцать раз, но потом хочется какой-то перемены в правилах.			"

												Lets be clear here, this game is a techincal mess and is the the only reason I cannot recommend this game to anyone.You see it crashes.... alot. You must be prepared to accept this as it is a huge widespread issue (just Google it) but basically you'll either CTD or your PC will hard freeze requiring a reboot.You'll also have to be prepared to go out yourself seeking ways to limit how often this occures via forums, as Ubisoft has given the finger to us PC gamers regarding this.However..... If you can get it to work, it is a brilliant game - the graphics are some of the best I've seen yet, the story so far (45% completed) is thrilling and has me hooked, only thing I dont like is how Edward loves to climb over everything - can become very frustrating. But its a small forgivable gripe.I can easily foresee myself loosing hundreds of hours in this game (that is if the game lets me and does not eat my save, yeah you should look out for that as well)The world is beautiful, expansive and alive. There is so much to do, think GTA + Pirates = AC4.You see its a great game but you are running the risk of not being able to play it at all, or at the very least crashing atleast once everytime you play.I've heard many people are also having major FPS issues as well and they have Beast or Monster pc's - although many dont give details so I cannot say if this is just an issue with their PC's or just lazy programming by Ubisoft.I'm running on a I7 3770k @ 4.2ghz, Dual 590GTX's, 650GTX for the PPU, 32gb ram & an SSD, have everything on Ultra / Max on 1080p and have to use Vsync to keep my FPS locked to 60 otherwise it tears like mad.+ Great graphics+ Great Story+ Great gameplay+ Great world+ Great sound- Crashes alot, I'm one of the lucky ones that can play the game. There are people who cannot play at all and are still waiting to hear back from Ubisoft's tech team.			"

												TL;DR: it is still a good game but the combat is a downgrade and I don't care for these social aspects at all.  I recommend it but don't expect it to top AC2, ACB, nor ACR.  Combat is important to this series and it just isn't satisfying like those previous iterations of the series.The free run/combat mechanics are disappointing...-Trying to free run up a rock that is no more than one step...Kenway acts like it is a wall.-Trying to free run up the side of a building...Kenway can't find the obvious foot/arm holds without adjusting one way or the other a tiny bit.-In some places trying to jump from corner to corner of a building, Kenway deems that inch-worth of a crack is insurmountable.-When you break defense, the game should assume the next attack is going to be directed at that guard.  Nope, 90% of the time, it will target someone else near by.  This makes brutes annoying to take down.-Perspective, in combat, is too close to Kenway.  It's way to easy to get attacked from the blind spot.  I recall the previous games panning the perspective out in combat to give better awareness.-It seems to like to ignore the counter button in heavy combat.-Combat on ships is atrocious not only because of the above points but also because the AI pirates interrupt your attacks and screw up targetting priorities.  I can slay all of the hostiles on a Man of War but the moment the pirates start coming over, it goes from fun to not.  EDIT: I discovered the reason for this is that allies keep attacking me which loses the combo.  On the average ship, I get attacked by their swords & pistols.  I don't even...-On the last ship I tried to take, the game didn't register the counter command half a dozen times in a row.  I died.  Not in this instance but in others, I have noticed enemies attack without the red ! appearing above them.  Both of these bugs occur randomly.A lot of these problems were introduced in Assassin's Creed III.  The way I see it, AC2 lacked training wheels with free move and combat; AC3 added training wheels and the AI playing a more prominent combat role in AC4 exacerbated the existing flaws in AC3.Another fatal flaw in this game is the ""social"" events, especially chests because of their miniscule detection range.  You can play the entire game without ever finding one; what's more, to 100% the game, you need to find 3 chests, 3 whales, and 3 convoys.  This feature was probably pretty awesome back when the game debuted and lots of people were playing it.  Now it is a chore because no one is playing the game to find these things for you, internet threads pointing to them have died down, and they're all time sensitive so if you search for them yourself, you only have a 2 hour window (give or take) before you might as well start all over searching.The final flaw that is SUPER annoying is the scripted, force-look.  99% of the time, I don't want to look at whatever they're forcing me to look at.  They already have the option to manually look at something, they should use it in all instances.			"

												Some people might argue that it's not the best Assassin's Creed game ever made, but it's the one I like the most. Ubisoft took the elements that made AC a good series and mixed them with the open world features that made the success of Farcry 3.The pirate setting is one of my favorites, and is very well represented here, with likable characters, a vast sea area full of islands and hidden treasures, as well as enemy ships to sink or board. The story is pretty good, although I'm only at 15% of progression. It's easy to get distracted by the big number of side activities. You don't have to do them all, you pick what you want, when you want it. I think that AC4 can be fun for different types of gamers in different ways.On the technical side, the game is pretty, with detailed models, textures and lush environments. The water/waves simulation is impressive and makes the navigation and naval combat or hazzards (like storms) quite realistic and fun. The PC optimization could be better, although I think it runs pretty well on my laptop with i7, Geforce 680M, SSD and 8GB RAM, around 45-60 FPS.I encountered no bugs or crashes so far, although the Ubisoft servers were down once, which prevented me to use the (minor) fleet system in the solo game.The multiplayer modes are the same as previous games, although you now have the possibility to define your own rules and create your own game modes to play with others. I like some of the multiplayer modes, but prefer the solo experience of AC4 a lot more. In previous AC games, it was the opposite for me.I recommend this game to anyone, even those who didn't like the AC series. It's worth a try as the sea gameplay is completely different and the game world is much more open now.			"

												Where do i begin with this game, well its pretty damn good and probobly the best Assassin's Creed that is out.lets start with what the game does right. The story is top notch. in this AC title you review the memories of Edward Kenway a man who became a pirate to try and become rich to support his family. well on one unfortunate day the ship he was on wrecks and he is stuck whith what you think is an assassin on a beach so you end up cassing said assassin down killing him and taking his outfit and a object to be dilivered to the govoner of Havana. Well turns out that they are templars the assassin that you killed betrayed the assassin's and guess what the templars are searching for an object that will give them the power to take over the world. So you gotta kill them and get the object easy enough. Ok well the story might sound a bit dull but trust me its good. Character development is outstanding and there were quite a few twists  and scenes that left me saying ""♥♥♥♥ you game"" in a good way of corse. also you play as an employee for Abstergo to make movies so the templars can find a peice of eden.Gameplay is pretty much the same just with a few diffences wich mostly pertain to naval combat so all of that is good. And finaly the look of the game. The graphics are outsanding. Nice texture quality, reletivly good lighting, and the enviornments were really well done. Also if your pc can handel maxing out water do it cuase it looks really nice.Alright so what are the flaws of this game. Lets start with naval combat. Now dont take this the wrong way, The naval combat is well done but my god if i dont want to do naval combat to grind ship upgrades for the love of god dont put 2 man o wars infront fo a missinon zone as well as a naval fort please. That is probobly the biggest flaw this game has. Like i said naval combat is well done but some people are not fans of naval combat.And then another flaw i have is with the Audio. It seems like there is a bug with rain and your audio settings where once it starts raining Kenway turns into MR. Elephant man and start stomping arround causing all sorts of ear♥♥♥♥♥♥ it got tot the point in some parts where i could not stand to have my headset on my neck because of how loud the game got. So  how do i rate this game i give it about a 8 out of 10 and definatly worth your time if you like the AC franchise  "

												So far so great! I am really enjoying this game so far. Once I realized that for some silly reason Steam couples the game with a wickedly outdated version of Uplay and then just hopped over to their site and got an updated version it works great. On a quick side note I love that I can launch the game with the controller once I open Uplay, without any third party software at all. So really to all the people who are bad mouthing this game becuase of Uplay, Google is not just for porn, and their are plenty of helpful threads on Steam as well. I just had to throw that out there and get that over with.As for the game itself it is a lot of fun and thus far the story is really interesting and engaging. I could do without the sequences outside of the Animus though, to be honest, that feels a little tacked on. Other than that it is good though. The boarding cutscenes are sadly dissatifying though since they are all the same, if you could skip them I would be super happy, happier if they didn't phone that in, but that is pretty easy to overlook in the long run. I would love to write more right now but I have the high seas to sail, and swashes to buckle! YAR MATEY!			"

												I haven't played much of the campaign but these are my current impressions:Pros:- Sailing and sea combat is really fun and addicting.- Ship and weapon upgrades require materials which you get from raiding other ships.- Assassination missions are fun and sometimes challenging.- Collectibles are kinda fun to collect.- Base building is fun and makes useful buildings.- Graphics and water textures are really nice.Cons:- A bit laggy if you have a lower end PC or laptop.- Story didn't catch my interest.- Kenway's Fleet* was fun at first but then started to feel like a chore.- I wasn't interested in what I saw of the present storyline (but it might get better.)- Multiplayer didn't have anything to do with ships.All in all, I enjoyed playing this for the time I did, I suggest getting this if you think you will like the sea battles.*Kenway's Fleet is a mode where you select your ships and send them on missions and have to wait in real time for them to complete. It's like a freemium app.			"

												I have horrible framerate and my computer barely meets the minimum requirements.  Even playing in slow motion with spaghetti mouth cut scenes, this is still one of the coolest games I've ever played. It's Super fun just to cruise around and play pirate, and all of the islands from the Florida Keys to Jamaica are beautiful and a joy to explore.  All in all, a nice improvement over what I thought was the best part of ACIII.			"

												Disclaimer: this is a long review, and I may have spent a bit too much time on the negative side of things. Hang in there.I came into Assassins Creed 4 with a few fears, as I was mildly dissapointed with Assassins Creed 3. My qualms with that game include the reliance on a sub-par stealth system, and a combat system that is just ridculously easy. To be honest, none of that has really changed with Assassins Creed 4. It definitely has problems. It is still a game that has an incredibly flawed stealth system. Edward is incapable of crouching, unless of course, he is in a bush. Enemies will sometimes be completely clueless, watching complacently as you stab a man 10 feet in front of him and throw him into a haybale. Somtimes, they'll be ruthless, like they have magic sonar and can spot you from huge distances. And of course, there's always everybody's favorite: Trailing Missions! Oh yeah, they're in full swing here! One detection and instant failure state! I understand that these are sometimes necessary sequences in the story, but, please! For the love of god, please just give us this exposition some other way. These trailing missions are infuriating! Also: Boat Stealth! Yep, not kidding. It's also broken. Lookouts on enemy ships are apparently worthless, or blind, in this game. They only are capable of looking for only 30 feet IN FRONT of the ship, not behind AT ALL. Honestly, how in the world can you not notice a hulking brig lurking around in the water in clear daylight? Boat stealth sections really took me out of the moment, and they just seem ridiculous.  Since AC3, the combat system has largely stayed the same. Don't get me wrong, it is fun to rack up the combo kills, but it just feels so easy. Prolonged fights are nearly impossible, unless you're trying to prolong them. Fights that are supposed to have weight end up falling short because of this. Honestly, the fight with the Assassin at the beginning of this game is extremely anticlimactic. There's a long, dramatic chase sequence that leads up to a dramatic confrontation on the beach. This is an assassin, a legendary killer. How will you defeat him?!! And then he dies in one swing. REALLY? This may seem insignificant, but it just seemed steange to meLike I said, this game has problems. But, If you can look past them, this game is the best Assassins Creed game in the series. But, to me, this really isn't even an Assassin's Creed game anymore. It's a pirate game, up there with Pirates of the Carribean and Sid Meier's Pirates. When you play this game, you feel like a pirate. Once you get through the opening story missions and get released into the world, at the helm of the Jackdaw, with a crew of fearsome men ready to take on the world, this game shines. You can do whatever you want. Attack ships at random, racking up notoriety until you are wanted dead. Sailing to parts unknown, discovering mayan artifacts and hidden treasure. Hunting island animals and fearsome beasts of the sea, and crafting items from their skins and bones to further your character's abilities. Diving underwater and exploring shipwrecks, while avoiding the fearsome jaws of a shark {Speaking of which, these underwater shark-stealth sequences are tense, and honestly scary. They are the only stealth in this game that I enjoy}. Upgrading your ship into a vessel to be reckoned with, and engaging in epic naval battles with legendary ships. All of these side activites are a welcome distraction from the usual sneaking and stabbing of an Assassin's Creed game, and they work extremely well, because they are always enjoyable. Not to mention the fact that all this is being realized in stunning graphics. This game has an unbeleivable amount of content, and it has never felt like a grind. I have spent close to 80 hours in this game, and I still haven't completed the main story, because I didn't have to. I was busy being a pirate, not an Assassin.TL;DR: At the end of the day, this is a good game. It has its problems, and they are numerous. But if you think of this as a pirate game and play it like a pirate game, giving marginal attention to the story missions, you will love it.			"

												Эдвард — официально вроде бы не ассасин, но действует он точно так же, как и все члены братства: так же дерется, так же карабкается по крышам и так же прячется в кустах. Все ключевые механики Assassin’s Creed толком не обновлялись со времен первой части, и Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag в этом смысле ничего не меняет. Все сражения, как и шесть лет назад, выигрываются контратаками, любые высокие сооружения покоряются одной кнопкой, а прятаться все так же можно в траве высотой по колено. Враги не стали умнее, нового оружия и приемов практически нет, а все сухопутные задания — сборник примитивных поручений из предыдущих выпусков: догони, убеги, проследи и подслушай разговор. Заняться на суше в Black Flag совершенно нечем.Но, к счастью, спускаться туда нужно только по ключевым сюжетным делам, все остальное время можно проводить в открытом море. Уже через пару часов игры вы получаете собственный корабль (Эдвард назовет его «Галка») и можете тут же отправиться грабить и убивать. Ощущения — потрясающие: ворочая штурвалом, вы тактильно чувствуете исполинские размеры и мощь вашего брига, каждую волну и каждое дуновение ветра. Даже самая пустяковая битва — масштабное шоу: посудины кружатся, выцеливают друг друга, обмениваются серией залпов, все горит, дымит и взрывается. В этом контексте даже устаревшие механики работают по-новому: давно надоевшие бои и паркур на время вновь увлекают, когда берешь на абордаж чужой корабль, прыгаешь между мачтами и фехтуешь с вражеским капитаном.Отправляясь в открытое море, никогда точно не знаешь, что тебя ждет. Можно нарваться на других пиратов, можно попасть в шторм, можно грабить одинокие шхуны или выслеживать жертв покрупнее, можно купить водолазный колокол и погружаться под воду, можно искать сокровища или брать штурмом укрепленные форты. Добыча идет на апгрейды: если не наращивать огневую мощь «Галки», можно легко потонуть при первой же встрече с небольшой вражеской флотилией. Наконец, нужно помнить о команде. После особенно громких столкновений может погибнуть чуть ли не половина всех матросов, и придется набирать новых: спасая пойманных бандитов от расстрелов и виселицы, нанимая пьяниц в тавернах, переманивая на свою стороны пленных или подбирая на борт случайных утопающих.Если первая и третья части Assassin’s Creed претендовали на какую-то псевдоисторическую постановку, то Assassin’s Creed 4, как и Assassin's Creed 2 — это скорее пестрое тематическое шоу из казино в Лас-Вегасе. Все ходят в ярких одеждах, большие шляпы украшены смешными перьями, убийцы носят на себе сложные системы из поясов и ремней, чтобы брать в бой сразу десяток пистолетов, и если в кадре появляется, скажем, Черная борода (а он — далеко не единственный исторический персонаж, который вам встретится), то выглядеть он будет так, как выглядел бы в мультфильме.Но именно этого и ждешь от игры про сокровища, ром, моря и джунгли. Black Flag — игра для тех, что любит флибустьеров скорее образца «Пиратов Карибского моря», чем реконструкций канала BBC. Большая любовь к пиратам наверняка заставит кого-то исследовать мир до последнего квадратного сантиметра, но вообще игра к этому не особенно располагает. Слишком похожи друга на друга острова, слишком обычный сценарий, слишком мало мифов и легенд вокруг тайников, слишком мало интересных мест, слишком мало сюрпризов в принципе. Авторы все же гораздо чаще, чем нужно, заставляют вас заниматься привычными ассасинскими делами, а для того, чтобы стать Sid Meier's Pirates! нового поколения, у Black Flag мало контента. Не хватает интересных побочных заданий в море, не хватает подробной кастомизации корабля и детального менеджмента команды, не хватает, в конце концов, интересных ситуаций. Штурмовать форты и захватывать суда по одной и той же схеме невероятно интересно первые пять, десять или пятнадцать раз, но потом хочется какой-то перемены в правилах.			"

												Quite possibly the best AC game to date, rivaling even the beloved Assassin's Creed 2.  Black Flag takes all of the elements of past games that you love from the stealth and parkour to the battles and story improves them, then adds to them.  The combat system no longer feels like counter after counter and now flows with secondary items fitting into the mix very well.The game also stays fresh by adding a fun, and exciting new element through sailing and ship battles.  Rather than becoming a tedious nuisence like one might expect, fighting on ships and upgrading one's vessel is fun and rewarding, allowing you to take on truly fearsome opponents and capture enemy ships for your own use.Some long time fans of the series critize this game for not being a true Assassins game as for much of the game the protaganist is not truly an assassin.  In my opinion however the game does something far more interesting than tell the story or an assassin.  It tells the story of someone who becomes one.  You learn his motives and watch as he adopts the creed because he believes in it, not because he was born into it.  Something I find to be more compelling.The only downside to this game are the parts that take place in modern day.  You play a voiceless protaganist working in Abstergo and hacking computers to learn more about the world.  All in all it's very boring and adds nothing to the game itself let alone the overarching plot.  Still it's owrth playing and is definitely a better buy than Unity or Rogue.			"

Its not just an extention of the game, its part of the game...I was trying to wait for this game to go on sale, with the way money is so tight, but I would call it best game of the Year hands down, specially finding out and using the app when im playing the game, and have my tablet next to me, telling my fleet to clear a trading route, and make me some Money!

												Absolutley love this game! The first assasins creed game I have played and I will wait for the next newest one because of the crummy reviews on the newer games. Being a free roaming game, there is nothing to stop you to continue exploring the game after the story is over! Furthermore, if you want to continue with the game after you have done the story, you have to wait for the game credits at the end to finish, on the bright side of waiting half an hour for the credits, there is a secret which gives you alot of U-play points and XP.With my Micro ATX Zoostorm PC I managed to run this game at about 60 fps (V-sync on) with the occasional lag spike when boarding a ship, however the Nvidia 960 2GB and intel i5 4460 plus the gigabite gaming motherboard handled it well.It had a brilliant story, with a touching end!9.8/10(Because of the weird glitches; when I killed a solidier, it's waist tightened up and went spazzing about!)

												The best Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2.This is coming from someone who hates pirates.This game comes in three parts being a Assassin, being a ship captain, and being a ubi.... I mean Abstergo employee.The Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved.- Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batman-like (Arkham games) and less Counter-kill spam. - Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered.- They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! (You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around)- Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games.- Side missions are amazing too, they range from under-sea diving to whaling to taking over forts.Being a ship captain is the best part of the game.- I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline.- Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive.- Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.Being a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it.- Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.Multiplayer- haven't touched it, but maybe interstedOther Stuff- Optimization could be better, but it`s a beatiful game.- UPLAY :((   (it`s uncomfartable programm for me. idk about you. And sometimes she wasnt save my games)Rating: 10/10 -0.5 for UPLAY => 9.5/10			"

												If you like the Assassin's Creed mechanics, you’d love it.Also, if you like Pirates, this is probably the best pirates game you can find. The Caribbean map is huge, you have plenty of stuff to do, from assaulting forts to harpoon different fish and mammals to explore underwater wrecks, plus exploring islands, and the most important of it, naval battles, with cannons and boardings, all very well done and very fun to play it. As most of the Assassin’s Creed games, it may get a bit repetitive at the end, but it is still worth it.The main story is not bad, has some good missions and keep you entertain, which is the ultimate point.

												Ubisoft have proved that they could make a best carribean pirate game in the history. Yet they have decided not to do that.  Great cinematics, good story, some incredibly immersive details. But there are some mechanics in this game that might make You hate Ubisoft for ruining Your pleasure. The trading mechanic is just a dumb minigame. Crafting also is just a minigame for the marketing department to claim that there is one. Upgrades are dumb and linear. I would also like to challange the developers at Ubisoft to show me at least one brig in the world that had a ram installed. I wish, a russian developer team NMG in 1995 had this engine when they made their game ""Sea Legends"".I recommend this game only because the sailing part is really good and makes this game worth the price.

												How to get this game up and running right the first time:The game's great. You don't need me to tell you that. You can see for yourself all the negative reviews are b/c people can't get it running on Uplay. I'm here to tell you how to fix that.1. Go to uplay.com, make an account, and download the latest version of Uplay. Open it and log in2. Download Assassin's Creed 4 from Steam.3. Make sure you have Uplay open and logged in, then launch AC4.4. Steam will give you your Uplay Keys. Copy it to clipboard.5. Uplay will ask you for your code. Paste it in.6. Play the game. If you wish to play offline, under the Uplay Menu, click on ""Go offline.""7. Enjoy!			"

												Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag was a lot of fun. Comparing to AC III, the combat was a lot more fun and enjoyable, the characters were a lot more likeable, and the protagonist didn't insist on being a♥♥♥♥♥♥throught the entire story. When I played AC3, after not too long I got bored with the game - then I started to burn through the story to feel better about putting the game down. With AC4, though, I spent lots of time having fun exploring, finding collectibles, doing side-missions, building up my ship, and of course, being a pirate. The Ship-Ship combat is, in my opinion, stellar. Not too difficult to get the hang of, but it stays fun, from the first few ships to the 100th and beyond. Looking back, I think there was a 15 consecutive hour period of gameplay in which I by-passed the main story entirely, focusing on the side missions and taking over ships.Comparing to the earlier AC games, especially AC3, the controls were MUCH better in this game. I remember half of the rage I had in AC3 was due to unexpetedly jumping to my death innumerable times just to get to a viewpoint or something. There were a few instances of this in AC4, but they were far fewer and more manageable than I've previously experienced. I experienced a few bugs during the game, but only once was there an interruption - luckily I only had to re-play five minutes worth to get back to where I was, but it's still bothersome.With the - to me- somewhat lackluster enjoyability of AC Revelations and the rather boring and annoying AC3, I wasn't fully sure about spending the money on AC4. Now that I've played it, I'm glad I did, and this game has restored my hope that this series still has some life and fun left in it.			"

												Ah, Assassins Creed.... So Black Flag is a fantastic pirate sim. I loved how they took the historical characters and made them believeable. They took historical fact and weaved it into the game so as a Historian I found myself smiling rather than fuming.My main annoyance with this game (and the entire series) is the Open world aspect. As I first started to play I wanted a total finish, after getting stuck in the quagmire that is chest after chest, ship after ship, stupid artifact after stupid collectable I quickly realised I was up to 21 hrs of game play and roughly 20% through the game I was bored stiff.  I had forgot the entire story and was looking for pastures new.I left the game for a week or so and then decided to return, this time I quick traveled as much as possible ignored every side quest, something unthinkable in a RPG like Mass Effect / Dragon Age and stuck to the bare bones of the game.In doing this I found a superb and immersive storyline. I enjoyed my play through far more by just sticking to the plot with the occasional ship battle thrown in. A couple of plot twists I didnt see and the inevitable ending (no spoilers) twinned with a very ironic achievement which was a nice nod.The Caribean (played on a high end pc) is lush and looks stunning. The view points being one side quest I did do simply for the panoramics. An aspect I find is really missed is the music. The score to this game is perfectly placed and very emotive. Probably one of the best soundtracks on a game ive played in years.A friend told me that this was a Great Pirate game but bad Assassins Creed game. Being a fan of Sid Meir's Pirates or as it was called in 1996 Pirates Gold! on the Amiga....this is probably the best evolution of that game play. So a tick in the box for pirate sim. As for Assassin's Creed game, I was confused as to why Edward was an Assassin yet not however this was developed in the story and was given real reason and legitimacy for me. At the mid point id say a bad Creed game but by the end I'd say the best Ive played yet.My only real sore thumb is the ""real world"" aspects. Totally pointless and a waste of my time unfortunatly, they are only made relevant in the last half hour of game play and was met with a. ""Ahhh ok, see what you did there......"" rather than a really cool plot twist. I think the whole meta plot Assassins Creed Eden device stuff needs to be buried or made relivant. Almost like they wrote thier cannon before they realised they had a francaise on hand!This said, by the end of the game I had developed a real soft spot for Edward Kenway.			"

												The very first true Assassin's Creed anti-hero.Edward Kenway takes us on a journey, from one island to the next and back again. This game does not feel like an assassin's creed title, but it feels like teh Far Cry 3 of the AC series. The gameplay is beautiful, and the sailing is majestic and fluid. Once you step on the Jackdaw, you'll be seldom wanting to leave. This game is truly next to A.C II in its quality and any true fan of 3rd person character action/ truly dramatic storytelling, pick it up. 10/10			"

												Before I start my review, I would like to say that I'm a fanboy of the AC series so I may overlook issues with the game.Story:- Likeable personality for the protagonist- Interesting and fleshed out side characters that you will get attached to.Mechanics:- Ship-Ship fighting mechanics are very enjoyable and sometimes actually quite challenging- Melee fighting mechanics were slightly changed in this game and were not as enjoyable as it was in AC3 (not as satisfying combos)- Range fighting is much better with the use of multiple pistols, berserk/sleep/rope darts.- The guards AI is not very much different from the previous games (I do like the introduction of guards with a long range rifle on guard towers).- Stealth is much improved by the addition of stalking zones.Conclusion:I am enjoying this game quite a lot and would definitely recommend it to fans of the series as well as players who are new to the franchise.

												This would be an amazing game if it would not be an Assassin's Creed, but it's still a great game.Sea battles and activities are spot on awesome. Ship combat feels easy and challenging at the same time. Ship boarding is great way to test your melee combat skills and tactics. On land combat and activities feel same old ""Assassiny"", that get boring after a while, island exploring is sometimes challenging for no reason, making full exploration a pain to do, when you can't seem to locate one particular chest.Stealth ""bush"" system is great new addition to the tactics, and add some stealth element to rather boring town combat/exploration. The pirate story side is really great apart from boring Assassins and Templars for the 4th time. There's lack of melee and ranged weapon variety, and once you get couple thousand R (money), you don't have to invest in those.Personal gadget upgrades are a nice touch to make you hunt for specific animals and their hides/bones. Ship upgrades are really nice, and require you to obtain cloth, wood and metal for them via sea battles, apart from R (money) and schematics. All around it's a nice pirate game, even if it's the same old Assassin's Creed under the cover.			"

												I have to disagree with the majority of reviewers. While it is a good game, I felt it wasn't true to the Assassin's Creed experience for example, you cannot call Assassin recruits and (SPOILER: Edward doesn't even become an Assassin until the very end). The open-world wasn't really impressive, mostly very similar locations with only a crapload of chests to open. Also, both me and my friend had terrible lag while playing this, while our PCs can handle most other games. Edward's story is good and unique, but not befitting a proper AC game in my opinion. If you are a new AC fan or if you want something different from the past games, go ahead and try it out, but if I could go back in time, I would tell myself to wait for next year's Steam sale to buy it.

												Just when the Assassin Creed formula was getting stale it jolted to life just enough to make one more innovative game. Black Flag is more enjoyable less as an assassination game but more as a swashbuckling pirate adventure. You be spending most of your time on the high sea's upgrading your ship, exploring islands for treasure and attacking British and Spanish ships. Such elements are the hightlight of the game. The game is let down however when it sets in that it is still an Assassins Creed game and you will occasionally be grounded do assassin like things. Still the games characters are colourful and intresting and I was kept intrested in the game for many hours.			"

												Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the usual Assassin's Creed game, with open world exploration, free running, epic combat and a historical setting. This time, however, the setting is 18th century Caribbean and that means pirates. Assassin's Creed and pirates, need I say more? :PWhile the modern arc of the storyline is really weird, I found that the historical arc was very interesting and engaging. Definitely a major improvement over Assassin's Creed III. The combat system is even more advanced that ever, with the usual counter-kills and assassination moves, but now including even more pistol usage and interaction with the world around you. Naval combat, being the main focus of the game, has been revamped and upgraded since the previous title. One thing I did notice was that compared to previous Assassin's Creed games, makng money (in order to buy new weapons, outfits and upgrade your ship and mansion) was a lot more difficult.Black Flag was a really fun game to play and I highly recommend getting it, especially if you're a fan of the Assassin's Creed series. Or pirates. :P			"

												The best Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2.This is coming from someone who hates pirates more than democrats hate republicansThis game comes in three parts being a Assassin, being a ship captain, and being a ubi.... I mean Abstergo employee.The Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved.- Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batman-like (Arkham games) and less Counter-kill spam. - Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered.- They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! (You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around)- Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games.- Side missions are amazing too, they range from under-sea diving to whaling to taking over forts.Being a ship captain is the best part of the game.- I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline.- Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive.- Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.Being a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it.- Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.Multiplayer- haven't touched itOther Stuff- Optimization could be better, but it is a beatiful game.- Best play with a controller IMO, until you have to aim with a pistol.- UPLAY :(Rating: 10/10 -1 for UPLAY => 9/10 "

												One of my favorite assassins creed games of all time. It's simply amazing how the development team were able to turn these heartless plunderers into honorable warriors that you would want to protect.

												Best Assassin's Creed out there by far I'll list my favorites.-Pirates (Upgradable Ships)-Soundtrack (I like the music that plays while in battle)-The automatic parkour system-Story is greatNow here are some cons-Fairly short story (Beat the game on ps4)-Enemys are fairly stupid so battles and or escaping is easy.

												- Graphics: The graphics are good (could have been better but still good). (3,5/5)  - Sound: The sound is awesome. I really like the singing when you are sailing. (5/5)- Gameplay: The gameplay are really good, the battles (both with swords and in your ship) are awesome. The storyline is also good. (4,5/5)- Other stuff: The difficulty is good, not to hard and not to easy. Theres a lot to do in the game so you can play it for a while. (4/5)Total score: 17/20It's a good game but then we have a problem, as many people probably know the game crashes and your save files get's deleted which not are good. I haven't even completed the storyline thanks to that. So if you want to buy this game, you should have that in mind.			"

												+Standard AC combat system with parries and different weapons but proven sufficient and fluid+Whole open sea pirating idea is done perfectly in the atmosphere+Charismatic, relatable and interesting main protagonist with hunting dilemmas, everlasting greed, lust for power and moral difficulties+Best feeling in the whole series Ive played was cruising on Jackdaw aimlessly+There are many leisures to spend money and resources on (weapons, armor, ship, mansion etc)+Lots different type of enemies (spanish, english, soldiers, ships, naval forts etc)+Quite long main game even without extras +Lots of extras (treasure maps, contracts, mayan puzzles, armors, side quests etc)-Some glitches here and there that really not a big deal but still existing-Main protagonist still cant see the logic to use ladder instead of a unclimblable wall even though i spesifically drive him to it-Swords are mostly useless after getting a good one (which i bought in the first 1 hour and never changed it)-Not RPG game but they tried to add some little rpg elements here and there but unsuccessful-Fleet ""mini game"" really feels like farmville and lacks the depth-NPCs are not that rememberable and influencial in gamers mind (Blackbears should be more on the front imo)All in all, I think AC4 is the best game in complete series (March 2017) 9/10			"

												Well after 44 hours on this game and the main storyline finished i guess i do a review on it.This is to be honest the best game in the series since ac2. The story is good with a lot of charathers and fun but at times repetetive missions. The biggest and best part about this game is the open world, The world is HUGE and the sea is gorgeus. This game also looks SOO good if you only have a decent pc :)So my final verdict for ac4 (black flag) is:8/10 =D			"

												This game is fun mix of Pirates of Carribean, Assassins Creed and Star Trek. The last one only is reference to the main character Edward Kenway aka Captain James T Kirk as a Pirate. A brash wise cracking lady killer and former drunk turned hero, essentially Star Trek 2009 in the Golden Age of Piracy. Of course you have the AC elements present as does every installment but this time its very downplayed as an almost side story and completely focuses on you being a swash buckling terror of the high seas. You go after a variety of nations colonizing the Carribean. Cuba obviously is owned by the Spanish, The Dutch are more scattered, the Bristish have a presence. So if you can imagine Chris Pine's James T. Kirk personality, with Chris Hemworth's face in a Rated R Pirates of Carribean spinoff then this is your game. Highly recommend it.			"

												Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag (PC): Finished this over the weekend around 48 hours game time. Very good game especially with the expanded ship battles from ACIII. Beautiful game too, the setting was absolutely gorgeous, islands, jungles, under water caves all fantastic. Edward is my least favorite AC character so far, yes I much preferred Connor’s personality and story over Edwards. Ran great on PC with KB/M controls. I did have to use the D3DOverrider fix to get a solid 60FPS with everything maxed. Everyone knows the AC games so there is no need to go into details about gameplay however the lack of daggers really upset me, they have always been my weapons of choice in any AC game and they are completely nonexistent here BOOO. For those that like the Animus stuff (I love it) there are plenty of very cool tidbits of information if you go around hacking each machine. The possibilities for an AC game are endless and it’s awesome to think about where they could go with it. If you are an AC fan do not miss this game.			"

Think Sid Meyer's Pirates only you can straight up stab fools in the neck. The runny-stalky-stabby part of the game is basically the same from previous games, you still need to follow dudes and creep on their chats but you leave feedback at the end of each mission so you can be all ""one-star"" in protest.

												Spiritual successor to Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned. A fun pirate game with the general things you'd expect: killing, building a ship and attacking the British and Spanish navies. Typical Assassins Creed movement and combat, with a disappointing lack of weapons in comparison to AC3. The Assassins Creed part of the game feels more like it was attached to what should have been just a pirate game, but it doesn't take away from the fun of the game. Worth the money. Best parts of the game are exploring the islands/sea, customising the Jackdaw and Edward's loadout, and the sea-shanties.			"

												I tried to play first Assassin's Creed game in past, but it bother me a lot by dull and repetitive objectives. I have bougth Black Flag in sale and also thanks to positive ratings and I totally don't regret. Its catchy and I have fun to do all the side objectives. The ""mini"" game with the ships by looting other ships is great. The only things I hate are the diving bells location. And the control of the character is little bit cumbersome in some situation (in comparison with Batman series for example).			"

												There are not enough games about Pirates, and most of the ones out there aren't very good. But Black Flag is good. It's fun. It's got some lovely visuals and some very satisfying combat, both at sea and on land.The worst thing about this Assassin's Creed game is the assassin's creed parts. The modern day section where you play a game developer working for an evil quebec based games company feels half baked, and the story about how the developers got a massive and lengthy insult at their company past them is probably more interesting than the story the modern section tells.  The other Ubisoft-isms, like the weird mesh of linear and open-world and the watchtowers don't improve the game either, and overall I feel like it could have been much better if someone else was making the game. Also Uplay is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you probably knew that already.In summary, it's a good game, I just would like it more if it was made by a different company.			"

												If you have played any Assassin's Creed game, and you can stomach the rather simplistic nature of straight-up fights, then this is by far the best entry in the franchise to date.  Both the multiplayer and single-player are in top form here, with the campaign enlivened by the *very* open world and wonderful Sid Meier's Pirates!-esque naval combat/metagame, and the multiplayer being yet another improvement on some of the most unique competitive gameplay to be found in current AAA games.  A huge variety of things to do, and almost all of them are presented impeccably.			"

The land missions are very stealth focused, the formerly abominable eavesdropping missions have been polished, and the story is probably one of the best of any of the games.

Sailing the sea, fighting and looting ships, taking over the ports and hunting down ocean game. once I was done taking over all the ports, hunting all the animals and, it left me wanting more. The songs just adds to the atmosphere. I do not like the fact i have to download U play, that is kind of annoying, I bought steam for that reason, so i dont have to download yet another stupid program just to play other games.			"

												Good game, although really poorly ported from console, still suffers framerate issues even when you have twice the horsepower needed as recommended.The main mission is what it's all about, the side missions are too tedious, repetitive and boring.The fighting mechanics could be better, since most of the times you find yourself  just throwing a smoke bomb and assassinate a bunch of people, templars whatever is out for you.Pushing you to upgrade the ship is well done, this way you will be able to conquer Man o' War class ships.It bothered me throughout the game that Edward Kenway isnt a true assassin in a traditional way, he basicallly stole his way in. Also I  don't like his face/jawline so much with his perky blue eyes, the cover art of the game isn't even the face of Kenway lmao, the cover art looks more like Ezio's face from ACII which is more badass.I actually quit playing AC Unity after suffering all the horendous bugs and issues, after trying for 8 hours I just gave up, besides the fact I forgot along the way what the whole purpose of the mission was. It just seemed pointless killing random people and continue with the struggle, therefore I picked up Black Flag which is in any way superior in gameplay, Ubisoft where did you go wrong with Unity.All in all its 3rd on my all favourite AC's (above AC1 and AC2)  , so recommended game for sure!

												Assassin's Creed Black Flag is probably the best Assasin's Creed game that there is. The combat is the the fun, bloody, skilled fighting you've gotten used to through the previous games but with new weapons and gadgets to help make the experience fresh and updated. The story's ok, i mean its an assasin's creed game, they basically all have the same campaign but with a different reskin each time. But hey, that's not why you're here, you're here for the boats. Probably the best thing ever to happen to the Assasin's creed franchise, they made the entire game around the new, extremely fun mechanic of boating and pirating. The exploration and raiding you'll do out on the open seas will keep you excited and busy for hours while also being intertwined with the story. This is what made this game better than all the others. So many people loved this part of the game so much, it just has to be a part of the newer games, r-right guys? They wouldn't risk taking it away from the newer ones.			"

												I'm having an incredible amount of fun with this game. Aside from the last-gen-looking skin shaders, the game is visually glorious. The lighting is amazing. TXAA is incredible (goodbye temporal aliasing). Variable penumbra shadows are always awesome (as that's how shadows work in real life). And, of course, the ocean looks completely beautiful. I spend half of my time just staring in awe at how pretty it all is. They even managed to implement blurry screen-space reflections here and there (which BF4 doesn't even have). When sneaking around in foliage, I love the way the leaves shift around. The game reminds me a lot of Far Cry 3 which I also loved. The naval combat is great. I love the upgrades. It's safe to say that I'm hooked. Best game I've played in a while. Get it!			"

												Well, yes this is another Assassin's Creed game and it is a slight improvement over the third game, some of feels more like a patched version of the third game as improves over major negative parts of the previous games. A big and important change about the game is the story as this time you are presented with Edward Kenway (grand father of the main character of the third game) and the big twist about the story is that Kenway was a pirate and so much likable character rather than the dull and forgettable from the previous game, so if you like pirate themed games, this game is right at your alley as you will be doing the pirate part for the bast majority of the game.After playing for the first 10 to 20 hours you kinda realize the Assassins and Templars seems kinda forced into a pirate game. Don't get me wrong, while the whole assassins and templars might be interesting there is so little about it in the game to make it really interesting. Probably, the worst part of the game is when you are not playing as Edward Kenway and you are in a first person mode in a modern times office of Abstergo like doing a regular job with a separate semi-plot of the assassins VS templars in modern times; just forget this part, like I did.If you played the third game and remember the naval parts, in this game you will get a fully fleshed version of it as it was improved a lot. You have the ability to upgrade your ship, get a ""control"" a fleet as you can capture ships to get more resources which can help you during your journey in the game. If you are going for the  100% completion, like I did be prepared to spend a lot of times collecting stuff and exploring the map which is quite huge, took me around 60 hours to be able to complete it at 100%.The Combat part of the game it is even more simplified than the third game, therefore you will be able to take down around 20 guards without any problem as long as you follow the chain kills. Of course, during the game you are suppose to use the stealthy approach, but if you don't like said approach... well, you can go through a great group of guards without any problem as long as you learn the combat system, which don't take much to get used to. The soundtrack of the game gives real immersion to the whole pirate them, but if you are not into the whole pirate song chanting might become a little repetitive when exploring the world as you will spend a good portion of the time in your ship going from point A to B; of course you have the ability to fast travel all you need is to explore an area just one time and after unlocking the fast travel point will make your life easier, so you travel from one island to the other in seconds rather than doing it using your ship.Multiplayer, again a patched version of the previous game but this time pirate themed, no real difference in many of the different modes you can play. To be honest, 5 - 10 hours was the most time I did for the multiplayer mode at the most. Lastly, with this version of Assassin's Creed I got the opportunity to play the Assassin's Creed IV: Freedom Cry which is included as part of the season pass. Of course, you can get the standalone version of it, but is more of the same, just different main character; in this one you are Adewale, the first officer of Kenway after the events of Assassin's Creed IV when Kenway and Adewale decide to take their own way. Slight differences really, you are in for a 10 hours at the most with this section of the game, if you are going for a 100% completion run, the story is quite short and not as good as the Kenway section, but more content nevertheless.All in all, if you liked the previous games (even the third one) and any pirate related stuff, you are in for a treat. If this is your first assassin's creed game be prepared to be a little bit confused about the Assassins and Templars in modern times part as it doesn't get explained too much and you might feel lost during these sections.

												There's been a long time since i've enjoyed Assassin's Creed as much as this. The story wasn't as captivating as some of the previous games, but the missions, unlocks, freedom and improvements to mechanics - as well as the awesome ship combat - made this game amazingly fun to play. Invested around 40 hours into it, where most time was spent in sandbox mode attempting to become the greatest pirate on the seve... hmm.. one sea!On a sidenote, the story was less frustrating and confusing with a smaller focus on the Astergo trouble.I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoyed parts of any assassin's creed game.

												This is the first game I have played in the Assassin's Creed franchise, but frankly, I bought it because it looked like a nice modern pirate game in the vein of Sid Meier's Pirates! I was not disappointed in the slightest, and in fact, I liked all of the gameplay enough that I bought the rest of the games in the series when they went on sale.Fantastic sailing and ship combat, and the parkour and melee combat are both well done and lend themselves well to both land and sea-based encounters.  The story was pretty well done, and I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of many of the famous pirates of the time.  The present-day stuff was a little strange and jarring, but with a little research into the previous games, it wasn't too bad. Still, I feel the game would have been better without it. It's really the only complaint I had about the game, and it's a minor one at that.Overall, a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.			"

The Graphics on ultra look absolutely fantastic, the story while not amazing is still very good the gameplay is excellent and for the first time ever an AC game has  comfortable controlls on pc without remapping.

This game is a masterpiece, easily the best in the AC series. Who would have known in AC1 one that Altair's climbing, parkour, and wrist knives would eventually evolve into the ULTIMATE pirate game.. I've always wanted to be a pirate, and this game let's me live out that fantasy. I want more pirate adventures like this!  On my facebook I said this was my 2013 Game of the Year. I am now going to say it's one of the best games I've ever played. 10/10.			"

												This game was a birthday gift to myself, (though it came out a day after my birthday... Nov 18) and boy has it been worth it. I have never played any of the previous assassin's creed games, but I believe I picked the perfect one to start with. I am totally enamored with it. The ship to ship combat is easily my favorite part of this game, and on many an occasion I have fistpumped with my virtual crew on the successful boarding of a larger Spanish or British ship. In short... this game brings out the pirate in me! ARR!I have run into little to no bugs at all in the game, and it runs fine on my system, especially with the big screen as my main monitor, and the surround sound. I am pretty sure the neighbors think I am conquering the block, and probably expect me to swing through their windows any minute, yelling ""Heave to, mi hearties!""I have yet to try the pvp aspect of it, as I am not much of a pvp player, but I am loving the heck out of the story mode, even the parts in the Montreal office. Well designed game, well written story, highly immersive. All of the characters I have encountered thus far have a certain charm to them, including the one I am playing, Captain Kenway. I have been posting pictures of my adventures on facebook, and I may even blog about it in the very near future, or at least post some youtube videos.Hats off to the crew at Ubisoft who put this game together, as it was just what I needed to scratch my looting and pillaging itch!

												I'd recommend the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this!! Sure, it has that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-ness that comes with every AC game, but my God, It is fantastic. The last AC game I played was revelations to which you are constrained to a fairly big map, but constrained non the less. As soon as I got a chance i looked straight at the map... and ""holy ♥♥♥♥ it's big"". Not only do you get to charter most of the islands AC style you get to do awesome battles in a ♥♥♥♥ing ship. A ♥♥♥♥ING SHIP. And to top it all off it has, in my opinion, the best protagonist in all of the AC saga and one of the greatest story's to accompany it. After my first playthrough 21.1 hrs of game time, to which I plan on going 100% and then start all over, I can comfortably say that this truly is one of the most memorable gaming experiences I have had!!   My only complaint was that it was released too early. If this game had VR headset crap I would j**zz myself until my balls were dry!			"

Ubiosoft may be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but this game is an emotional action filled ride.The story is really good. I was suprised. I have not ever seen a pirate game so well pulled off. I dont have many bad things to say about it besides a few these few things. The combat is pretty easy. All you have to do is wait to counter. The boarding process gets pretty old pretty quick. Same thing over and over. The last thing being its not Assassin's Creed really. Edward doesn't have to many missions with the Assassins until the last 5ish hours of the game (not including the contracts). The sea shantys are great, its fun to use the Jackdaw the story was slow at first but then kicked in a little while in like most AC games. Sad game but sort of happy in a way. If I where you I'd buy it when you get the chance. Buy it for sure when it goes on sale. I'd dare say I liked Edward more then Ezio. why are you still reading this. BUY THIS GAME.

												What can i say?Finally an story orignal idea! instead of the usual ""oh my father was an assassin, better start jumping on living thing to make them dead"" Eward ends up being caugth in the templar/assassins war against his will. It has the usual elements, jumpy jumpy, stabby stabby, hidey hidey that we expect from an AC game, not that thats a bad thing, HOWEVERwhat really sets this game apart from the other games is the excitement and engagement, the ship battles are perfect, thrilling and satisfying, the missions are fruitful, always introducing new advantages in stealthing or downright rampaging, he is a pirate after all, which ubi captured well. Edward is focused and acute, no faffing about like in ACRev (have to write it like that now, thanks ACRogue)  and i know its a grevious sin to praise this... but the environments, the isalnds, the trees, the beaches, are all so lovely to look at.

												I got into PC gaming just so I could play this game above 30fps. Sadly it trashes the hell out of dual core processors. If you have an I5 CPU then by all means, check this game out. If you like pirates and killing then this game is for you.			"

												Yet another amazing Ubisoft game. Ubisoft seem to be making nothing but good games recently and their uncomming game look amazing as well. By far and away the best Assassins Creed game yet would highly reccomend this game 10/10. The Graphics on ultra look absolutely fantastic, the story while not amazing is still very good the gameplay is excellent and for the first time ever an AC game has  comfortable controlls on pc without remapping.

												This game is fun mix of Pirates of Carribean, Assassins Creed and Star Trek. The last one only is reference to the main character Edward Kenway aka Captain James T Kirk as a Pirate. A brash wise cracking lady killer and former drunk turned hero, essentially Star Trek 2009 in the Golden Age of Piracy. Of course you have the AC elements present as does every installment but this time its very downplayed as an almost side story and completely focuses on you being a swash buckling terror of the high seas. You go after a variety of nations colonizing the Carribean. Cuba obviously is owned by the Spanish, The Dutch are more scattered, the Bristish have a presence. So if you can imagine Chris Pine's James T. Kirk personality, with Chris Hemworth's face in a Rated R Pirates of Carribean spinoff then this is your game. Highly recommend it.			"

												Spiritual successor to Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned. A fun pirate game with the general things you'd expect: killing, building a ship and attacking the British and Spanish navies. Typical Assassins Creed movement and combat, with a disappointing lack of weapons in comparison to AC3. The Assassins Creed part of the game feels more like it was attached to what should have been just a pirate game, but it doesn't take away from the fun of the game. Worth the money. Best parts of the game are exploring the islands/sea, customising the Jackdaw and Edward's loadout, and the sea-shanties.			"

												Definitely one of the best AC games, next to II and Brotherhood. The land missions are very stealth focused, the formerly abominable eavesdropping missions have been polished, and the story is probably one of the best of any of the games. Kenway is the first AC character I've actually cared about. And previously, when the out of animus missions have been a boring, the ones here are nice and short, and simply make you interested.			"

Short Version:Get this game! The only flaw with the game itself is there's virtually no replayability & multiplayer sucks, hovever, the singleplayer's story, graphics, & music alone make Black Flag one of the best games I've ever played. I got the digital gold edition, and in my opinion, it's worth the $60 price tag. I would highly recommend this to anyone who considers themself a gamer.Extended Review:Graphics - The graphics are amazing. I have no complaints.Music - Possibly the best soundtrack I've ever heard. There's one song in the soundtrack called ""The British Empire"" and I was tearing up when I heard it. Look it up on youtube and you'll hear what I mean.Story - I loved the story. It kept me interested & engaged till the very end.Gameplay - The ship combat is amazing, intense, and exciting. Some people have said the melee combat is too easy or overpowered. I would agree it's much easier than other games, but make no mistake, you will die if you're not careful. I like the approach Ubisoft took with Black Flag and Rouge, having the assassins be these highly trained death machines who can fight anyone. The assassins remind me of the Jedi from Star Wars in that reguard, and I like that much more than the ""realistic"" combat Ubisoft put in AC Unity.Replayability - Once you've played through the missions, side missions, and captured all the forts, there's nothing really interesting to do. I highly recommend you do the side missions and capture the forts as you go through the story, rather than waiting till the story's over. It will keep you interested in the game much longer.Companion App - I thought I should mention this because Black Flag has one of the best companion apps I've ever seen. You can mark stuff on your in game map in real time and make money in the game, with ships you captured in the game, when you're not playing the game. If you've got a smart phone, get the companion app. It's free too!Comparison to Other Assassin's Creed Games - I've played AC3, AC4:BF, AC Rouge, and AC Unity. Black Flag is the best out of them all. AC Rouge is a close second though since it uses the same engine and gameplay mechanics.I'm giving this game a 10/10 with multiplayer & replayability being my only issues with it. Heck, they aren't really issues considering singleplayer mode is so amazing! I got the AC Black Flag Digital Gold Edition, and in my opinion, it's worth it's $60 price tag, especially since it includes all of the dlc & the Freedom Cry campaign. If you like games with good stories, graphics, and music, there's no reason why you shouldn't buy this game. I highy recommend it.			"

												By Far the best Assassin Creed I've played. Storyline is not the greatest but the free roam aspect of the game is really well done. Not to mention the awesome naval combat which is nothing short of outstanding. The idea of managing your ships crew, taking down and boarding other vessels is one elemnet which they really perfected in this game. The character customization could be worked on and their are a fairly small amount of weapon choices which could also be improved. The melee combat is one of the best ever with a wide range of moves and some awesome different stealth takedowns. Not to mention the amazing graphics which are one of the best i've ever seen, let alone in an Assassin Creed game. Overall I highly recommend this game, by far the best Assassins Creed and deffiently worth a play.			"

												The game's port is terrible..It's true, it is.But if you can get around that issue, and play it anyway, is the game decent?No.It's flipping glorious!The graphics are amazing, even if the render distance could use some work. There's a sense for every detail(While sailing in travel mode, your crew actually sings AUTHENTIC, time-period accurate sailor's songs.You can change your outfits to your liking, which ACTUALLY ports over to the cutscenes(IN YOUR FACE STAR WARS: THE FORCE UNLEASHED AND YOUR GAMEPLAY-ONLY SKINS!)The story is compelling, but a bit vague, and it takes some effort(And more than one google search) to figure out exactly whats going on.The only downside I have, is that the combat is still the same old, way too simplified style of every other Asscreed. You hit things with X, you auto block PERFECTLY, EVERY TIME, WITHOUT FAIL, with B, and you automatically regain your health points when out of combat. I have yet to die in this game, because every precaution, every safety net, every death-fire wall, that one could POSSIBLY want, is in place. Perhaps if you're either 10 years old and purely inexperienced with these kinds of video games, or if you're an adult with no talent for pushing a button that you're PROMPTED to push with a big red dot over the attacking enemy's head? Then perhaps this game might be challenging, but to an avid gamer who knows the ins and outs of real time 3rd person freecam combat? This game is a walk in the park combat wise.Except for naval warfare.And yes, naval warfare is actually a BIG thing in this title!Take the traveling between cities from the original Assassin's Creed on Xbox 360(I feel old for remembering playing that game till my hands were numb). Now turn that traveling between cities on open roads, into a vast ocean, with islands, and treasure, and enemy ships, and plundering, and boarding, and swinging from the rigging of your own person ship while your comrades and crew whom you have personally saved from certain death, fight to that aformentioned death to make their brave captain proud; you.It's simply amazing, extremely entertaining, and flawlessly immersive. Only when you want to open the 'real life' aspect of the game, does it show itself, by 'exiting the animus' you can switch from your 15th century pirate self, to your 21st century scientist self, with the push of a button, and do different things depending on which existence you're in!Ubisoft effed up, it's true, they did, and they should be feverishly scolded for it. It's inexcusable to make such a PERFECT, AMAZING, INCREDIBLE game, and make it inaccessible to the PC race simply due to a terrible port job. It should be criminal in the game development world to allow this!But...If you have my graphics card(GeForce GTX 980 ti) or better? Then I suggest getting this game immediately. You will not regret it. The best Asscreed ever developped(Apart from the bullcrap port...YOU BLEW IT UBISOFT!!!			"

												How else can I say this? (Note that my review is based on what i experience on the laptop i play this on)Pros:- Open World to explore- Awesome Graphics- LOOT- BEING A PIRATE- Boarding ships- The long winded and amazing storyline.- Online collaboration with Royal Convoys and certain chests.- Amazing graphics and framerate even at semi-low settings - Awesome ship upgrades- Major DLC's are a must (Freedom Cry and Aveline)Cons:- During the first time start up, there may be a problem with logging on to the ubisoft servers which may crash the game. In this case, the game has installed incorrectly and must be uninstalled and redownloaded (Happened to me.)- Smoke when you constantly fire the ship's cannons at one place and never move (can't see ****)- Ubisoft potato serversThat pretty much sums up the game.Played on Asus N550JK.

												Black Flag was the first game purchased from the AC Series by me. Although I watched a lot of You Tube Videos to learn strategy use of the controls and gameplay for the mouse and keyboard  player, it was worth it. This game kept me spellbound. It is full of action and adventure, justice and revenge, educational and historical references, love and romance, happiness and extremely sad at times and much more. I found myself drawn into the story so much so that I never relized how much time I spent playing. I only wish the writers would have prolonged the story's ending, although it still ended well. I highly recommend this game especially for beginners.			"

												This game was the spawn of an exceptionally positive response from the publishers about the naval combat system present in Assassin's Creed III.  Well, did the full game add enough variety to the formula to differentiate itself from the sub game present in the game prior?  Well, I think so.The story, to avoid any spoiling, is comprised primarily of our main character, Edward Kenway, seeking out wealth and glory to support his wife and himself back at home.  Edward Kenway feels like an actual person, with his decisions emotionally weighing in on him.  This is not to say that there is a decision aspect of the game, because there isn't.The gameplay is split up into 2 sections: On your ship and on your feet.  I will cover the foot section first, as that has the least do discuss:ON FOOT:  Not much has changed since Assassin's Creed III.  The combat system is the exact same, with that in mind.  The stealth elements were enhanced by the introduction of darts.  The darts replace the bow and arrow, and now allow Edward to either knock an enemy out or to drive him mad, attacking everybody around him.  In addition, there is now an alarm placed in some scenarios.  You can destroy the alarm, but if the alarm gets triggered, everybody is coming to you.  Ultimately, this doesn't do enough to change itself substantially since it's game prior.ON SHIP:  Free roaming has been added! With free roaming, the overworld has added in cargo ships, storms, and forts.  The combat itself didn't take many risks.  The only substantial feature added was mortars.  There were also explosive barrels, but I didn't find myself using them.  They also added in ship leveling, which was difficult considering while you could see other ship levels, you couldn't see your own.

												Very fun if you like a normal assassin's creed game but you also like sailing and plundering and killing and hunting although it's role is very minimized because you have a ship now not other stuff.  Hunting is only required for upgrading your persona and even then is best done with a sleep dart then walk up to them and kill them unlike in assassin's creed iii where you had to load bow your now loading a dart which you get in sequence 4 and it is very useful so overall a great game.

Now that i see it on sale for lunar revel I purchased it without thought. So after 3 hours of downloading i launch it, and uh oh uplay... At the time i didn't think that much of it, and went on to create a uplay account and launched black flag from steam. BUT WHOOPS UPLAY SERVERS DOWN SINCE 3:00 PM! I waited for this game and now the fact that I guess i need to be online for this game to work... EVEN THOUGH I WILL ONLY PLAY THE STORY THAT HAS NO NED FOR ONLINE CONNECTIONS. Why steam, why.			"

The game is very unique, and absolutely love the fact you can get a ship and customize it to become the scourge of the seas.

												This game was very fun, graphics are incredible, it used a lot of the new features that Nvidia has displayed. The story plot is good, displaying interesting characters and unexpected twist plot. And you can sail on a boat and control a fleet. That was so nice, I used my ipad to manage the fleet which was a really nice touch.You need a very good computer to play the game with full details. If you like to collect things, this game won't disappoint you. There are tons of little things to collect. So sad achievements are not handled by steam...I hate ubisoft platform, but that is the way you have to play it. I used an Xbox controller ant it works flawlessly.I suffer a couple of bugs once in a while when you use fast traveling, since the ship emerge from the bottom of the ocean, sometimes the character gets trapped. I played the game for a long time and only happened it to me like 3 times.In summary, this is the first Assassin's Creed game I start playing and cannot stop until I complete it. I hate that I have 98% of the items but the map doesn't help me to know where is the missing 2%.I will recommend this game even not to fans of the franchise. "

												What can i say?Finally an story orignal idea! instead of the usual ""oh my father was an assassin, better start jumping on living thing to make them dead"" Eward ends up being caugth in the templar/assassins war against his will. It has the usual elements, jumpy jumpy, stabby stabby, hidey hidey that we expect from an AC game, not that thats a bad thing, HOWEVERwhat really sets this game apart from the other games is the excitement and engagement, the ship battles are perfect, thrilling and satisfying, the missions are fruitful, always introducing new advantages in stealthing or downright rampaging, he is a pirate after all, which ubi captured well. Edward is focused and acute, no faffing about like in ACRev (have to write it like that now, thanks ACRogue)  and i know its a grevious sin to praise this... but the environments, the isalnds, the trees, the beaches, are all so lovely to look at.

												Adorable art of assassination and play-style meets the amazing islands of seven seas. With its great customization, wide map, treasures, assassin and naval contracts, side activities, long and beautiful story, the best parts of history, and every possible thing you can see in this game is awesome. Playing a Welsh character against templars and he is a little far away from brotherhood. You've got your hood, hidden blades, two swords (I prefer cutlasses), pistols, a beautiful brig with a crew , going around the West Indies, assassinating, fighting, hunting, looking for medicines, liberating the islands. You won't need anything else than a good PC, that's the only problem. I like the AC3 which is about civil war, and the other Italian protagonist Ezio and the others (Altair, Arno, Aveline etc.) Even if they are all old games except Unity, my pc can't handle them with a proper 60fps while I can beat the 100 fps in every Crysis or Far Cry. Unity lacks of historical parts of French Revolution and the other AC games are very good but, the Black Flag, this was the game I always wanted. Assassination and piracy. I would really want to be able to play this one without no problem about optimization... Anyway, its a great game and if you have a mid or mid-high end gaming gear (for today), I strongly recommend you to buy this one. It's an intense experience that you don't really want to miss.			"

												As a die hard fan of assassins creed,this game is like assassins creed 2 but even better.You will spend hours boarding ships to get cargo and upgrade your ship to board more cargo .It sounds repetitive but its really fun.Plus new graphics are amazing if you are playing on an good gaming PC.Even on medium its beatiful and on high its real life graphics almost.World is big as russia plus china combined.You will start to fall in lvoe with your crew.When you are sailing they sing sea shanties which are really fun to listen.Combat returned with the counter=never die which i like ,im to used of orginal ezio games that used counter as life forever button.New pistol aiming is amazing,and the swords are good,but i much more prefer stealth so i use hidden blade,which is as always same.So many details and amazing story i cant explain it all in this review.You have to try it to get the feel.Overall its a great game and must have for any assassins creed fan.

Short Version:Get this game! The only flaw with the game itself is there's virtually no replayability & multiplayer sucks, hovever, the singleplayer's story, graphics, & music alone make Black Flag one of the best games I've ever played. I got the digital gold edition, and in my opinion, it's worth the $60 price tag. I would highly recommend this to anyone who considers themself a gamer.Extended Review:Graphics - The graphics are amazing. I have no complaints.Music - Possibly the best soundtrack I've ever heard. There's one song in the soundtrack called ""The British Empire"" and I was tearing up when I heard it. Look it up on youtube and you'll hear what I mean.Story - I loved the story. It kept me interested & engaged till the very end.Gameplay - The ship combat is amazing, intense, and exciting. Some people have said the melee combat is too easy or overpowered. I would agree it's much easier than other games, but make no mistake, you will die if you're not careful. I like the approach Ubisoft took with Black Flag and Rouge, having the assassins be these highly trained death machines who can fight anyone. The assassins remind me of the Jedi from Star Wars in that reguard, and I like that much more than the ""realistic"" combat Ubisoft put in AC Unity.Replayability - Once you've played through the missions, side missions, and captured all the forts, there's nothing really interesting to do. I highly recommend you do the side missions and capture the forts as you go through the story, rather than waiting till the story's over. It will keep you interested in the game much longer.Companion App - I thought I should mention this because Black Flag has one of the best companion apps I've ever seen. You can mark stuff on your in game map in real time and make money in the game, with ships you captured in the game, when you're not playing the game. If you've got a smart phone, get the companion app. It's free too!Comparison to Other Assassin's Creed Games - I've played AC3, AC4:BF, AC Rouge, and AC Unity. Black Flag is the best out of them all. AC Rouge is a close second though since it uses the same engine and gameplay mechanics.I'm giving this game a 10/10 with multiplayer & replayability being my only issues with it. Heck, they aren't really issues considering singleplayer mode is so amazing! I got the AC Black Flag Digital Gold Edition, and in my opinion, it's worth it's $60 price tag, especially since it includes all of the dlc & the Freedom Cry campaign. If you like games with good stories, graphics, and music, there's no reason why you shouldn't buy this game. I highy recommend it.			"

												This is the only Assassin's Creed game I've played to date so that might set a bit of context. I just heard it was the best one from a friend and so jumped straight in at number IV. Well I'm half way through a second play through and decided to give this game a BIG thumbs up review. I just love it; the theme, setting and ambience created in this game is brilliant and I can't help myself but to sing along with the shanties as I pirate around on the salt seas. Things I like;- Sailing and pirating mechanics are masterfully achieved; simple enough to get to grips with quickly but engrossing enough to want to do for hour upon hour. Boarding enemy ships is great fun and the shanties really give a depth of experience to sailing the waves. - The parkour is very well executed with only a few issues such as unrealistic snapping to certain edges and rocks that should be scalable but aren't. Sometimes farting about in the rigging and platforms of big ships results in an annoying death fall. Overall a great job with some occasional annoyances that any mature gamer should look past.- The characters are fantastic and I love the protagonist, I won't say too much to spoil; I found them all entertaining and interesting plus I really like the nod to real people from history of the era.- Stealth mechanics are easy to master so within a few hours of play you'll be performing awesome ninja death stunts. Perhaps it is a little too easy in some respects, such as AI stupidity, but that's just taste. All stealth games are like that.- The legendary ships provide amazing battles that are hard won, even with all upgrades for your ship. I love the Man o' War with the naval ram, El Impoluto; probably the hardest ship battle in the game.- Love the powder shot pistols; when you get to having a full set of four with two strapped to your chest and one on each hip; what a badass.Things I liked less;- I feel that the throwing knife is a great weapon so it surprises me that you can only get it from certain enemies and only one of them. It's easily retrieved and you can always get another, but still; why not have a set of 5 or so knives available in shops? Just a bit of an odd choice.- Fighting mechanics could have a hard mode; it's like in the movies (think Kill Bill) when the protagonist is surrounded by gyrating opponents (to give the illusion of action) who attack one at a time. I've got to the stage where dying in battle is just not on the cards; no valhalla for me!- A little more depth in the story would be nice but I still enjoyed the story immensely. I came away feeling I wanted more but I guess that's just how it feels upon completing a great game; can it ever be enough?- The fleet system is a good idea for a long distance trade mechanic to bring in the Reales but it just gets a bit wearisome after unlocking all sea routes. You wipe them clear to free up the routes for trade then a day or so later you have to do it all again. And again. And again. Tedium.- REALLY don't like the cuts to the modern era in the Abstergo Entertainment HQ or whatever it is. I get that they're trying to push the genetic memory idea into the story but it feels contrived, weird and doesn't seem to add to the game experience. I have no interest in hacking computers for emails and vids that try to add depth to the genetic memory thing and it just breaks the story up.Amazing game. Combines pirating, ninja-ing and a historical context to create a vibrant world to be a double hard bast$%d in. Ignoring the modern era scenes, which can be breezed fairly quickly, I give it a 10/10 for sheer delight in piracy. I did pay for the game however.			"

												Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm.

												If you enjoyed all previous Assassin's Creed games, or you're new to the series, and you've always wanted to be a pirate, pilage and steal precious booty, blow up enemy ships, board them for more booty and sail the seas while hunting shark and whale for loot. Then this game is for you! Amazing graphics and game play, plus bonus missions to keep you amused for hours on end!@TasteyTV			"

												I've spend more time on this title then any other in the AC franchise and its not even close to it's end. What a gorgeous game ! I was unsure about it when i first saw it, then a friend told me it was good i decided to try it out, and i'm loving it ! You get this huge open sea and land, sail to where you want sinking everything you see, its great ! There is so much to do, it's even hard to decide ^-^ The only thing i noticed about this one is that the climbing  mechanics are a bit broken, it feels so automatic and very often your character will jump off the course you are trying to go for, or will not grab objects/walls that are within his reach.But for me, it's been i think the best game of the AC series.

												This is the first game I have played in the Assassin's Creed franchise, but frankly, I bought it because it looked like a nice modern pirate game in the vein of Sid Meier's Pirates! I was not disappointed in the slightest, and in fact, I liked all of the gameplay enough that I bought the rest of the games in the series when they went on sale.Fantastic sailing and ship combat, and the parkour and melee combat are both well done and lend themselves well to both land and sea-based encounters.  The story was pretty well done, and I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of many of the famous pirates of the time.  The present-day stuff was a little strange and jarring, but with a little research into the previous games, it wasn't too bad. Still, I feel the game would have been better without it. It's really the only complaint I had about the game, and it's a minor one at that.Overall, a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.			"

												There's been a long time since i've enjoyed Assassin's Creed as much as this. The story wasn't as captivating as some of the previous games, but the missions, unlocks, freedom and improvements to mechanics - as well as the awesome ship combat - made this game amazingly fun to play. Invested around 40 hours into it, where most time was spent in sandbox mode attempting to become the greatest pirate on the seve... hmm.. one sea!On a sidenote, the story was less frustrating and confusing with a smaller focus on the Astergo trouble.I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoyed parts of any assassin's creed game.

												Basically the best and most entertaining title in the AC franchise to date, primarily owed to the sailing and pirating part of the game. Think Sid Meyer's Pirates only you can straight up stab fools in the neck. The runny-stalky-stabby part of the game is basically the same from previous games, you still need to follow dudes and creep on their chats but you leave feedback at the end of each mission so you can be all ""one-star"" in protest. Played 82 hours despite the fact the game crashed every 30 minutes, thanks Ubisoft, you guys are amazing. 9/10 would pirate.			"

												I tried to play first Assassin's Creed game in past, but it bother me a lot by dull and repetitive objectives. I have bougth Black Flag in sale and also thanks to positive ratings and I totally don't regret. Its catchy and I have fun to do all the side objectives. The ""mini"" game with the ships by looting other ships is great. The only things I hate are the diving bells location. And the control of the character is little bit cumbersome in some situation (in comparison with Batman series for example).			"

												Stabed a pirate. Got attack by authorities. Evade them with parkour. Got away. Would stab pirate again.Assassins Creed 4 is the best Assasins Creed game in my opinion. You get a huge open world, a great story, a great main character and none of the dramatic real world garbage. The game is set in a huge open word with three main cities and a lot of islands to explore. The naval combat is amazing and I would play a game based on this mechanic alone. The rest is pretty typical Assasins Creed stuf.			"

												I picked this game up on steam sale for $10 a couple months ago. Once I started playing it, I couldn't put it down. However, now that it's over, I'm suffering from Ubisoft fatigue and can't envision playing another one of their games for a while. I had a big gap between Assassin's Creed's as the last one I played was AC2 on PS3 about 5 years or so ago. I will say, that of AC1, AC2 and Black Flag, i enjoyed this one the most and actually almost 100%'d it. I got 100% of everything but main mission side objectives. I didn't have the patience for a lot of those. The stealth could be annoying and I'd rather rush in like Galahad and kill everyone in sight.I feel like $10-15 is the perfect price range for this game and would recommend fans of open world games to check it out.

Including pirate ship battles unlike any game you have ever played.Great story like all the assassins creeds.Multiplayer is dead except for a few die hards, so get that out of your head.You get a base island as well, nice spot to upgrade and plot your next evil deed.Bottom line is, really, Who doesnt like being a murderous pirate ?Game is still worth an easy 40$ but its worth it and its probably even cheaper now.If you like pirates and murder this is all you ever wanted.Followers of the church of zordon: you will love derpin in this game.Ominoh.

												*SPOILER ALERT*Assassians creed IV...how do i rate this? firstly i would like to say with 2800+ hours on the ps4 version i have expereienced the full game and may i just say the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s i have had in this game is too much. i recently brought this game on steam and it is once again my favourite game already. I've played 10 hours in one sitting so far and have had an absurd amount of fun. Those onion cutting ninjas when blackbeard dies... ive had way too many fun ties with this game for it to not have a special place in my heart would be unlikely of me. This game will definetly go down as one of the greatest releases of all time in my opinion as the sheer vastness of the game is so amazing. Sinking your first legendary ship is one of the best part of the games and the dlc's are just outstanding, i have no negative things to think about this game besides the fact that they tricked us into believing mary read was james kidd which i guess is a part of the story. If i had to recommend anyone of the assassians creed games it would efinetly be black flag as the sheer amount of fun a first time player can have is too good not to be mentioned. everytime i come back to this game i am never dissapointed and reminds me of a time when ubisoft never ceased to fail with game production and i am still wondering how they could go from this glory of a game to the massive cluster♥♥♥♥ that was unity. Overall i would give this game a 10/10 and definetly reccommend this to a person new to the ac saga.			"

												For those not familiar with the franchise of Assassin's Creed, there is a big storyline behind every single game. After purchasing this game, I highly recommend you play the Assassin's Creed 3 and Assassin's Creed Rogue, When you have played all these games the storyline would make more sense. But for this game review, personally I have enjoyed this game, the game can be rather boring at sometimes, but it still motivates you to come back and kill some more templars (Templars are the bad guys) This story goes on about a pirate named Edward Kenway, who adopted the Assassin's life, However this game can be drawn to take you away from the Assassin's life, and play more as a pirate. There are ship battles which are amazing, but they can be frustating as some point. The combat is ok, to a simple counter an opponent's attack them kill them. There is also a multiplayer. The mutiplayer is also very fun, but it can be very hard to find a game, unless you can play with your friends. This game would also need a Uplay account. Overall this game is very fun, and is very unique from any other Assassin's creed game you have ever played, So I recommend this game, because you will not regret, well maybe when you finish the game, you probably will regret it. ;)			"

												How else can I say this? (Note that my review is based on what i experience on the laptop i play this on)Pros:- Open World to explore- Awesome Graphics- LOOT- BEING A PIRATE- Boarding ships- The long winded and amazing storyline.- Online collaboration with Royal Convoys and certain chests.- Amazing graphics and framerate even at semi-low settings - Awesome ship upgrades- Major DLC's are a must (Freedom Cry and Aveline)Cons:- During the first time start up, there may be a problem with logging on to the ubisoft servers which may crash the game. In this case, the game has installed incorrectly and must be uninstalled and redownloaded (Happened to me.)- Smoke when you constantly fire the ship's cannons at one place and never move (can't see ****)- Ubisoft potato serversThat pretty much sums up the game.Played on Asus N550JK.

												Well, this was a very nice surprise from the people who buggered up Watch_Dogs. Assassin's Creed IV - Black Flag can be seen as a new high point for the franchise and with the ability to traverse the world in a boat Wind Waker style, the hours of playtime don't take long to pile up.This time the setting is the 18th century and the player is in control of swarve pirate captain Edward Kenway (the father of the very ""British"" Hatham Kenway and the grandfather of the very angry Conner Kenway). Throughout the game, Edward will sail the high seas in search of a great treasure and like him you will lose yourself in a lust for gold. Then you'll remember that you're playing an Assassin's Creed game and you'll have to spend a decent amount of time tailing someone before you get to feel the sea breeze in your beard again. But fear not, your missions on land can lead to great rewards and eventually you'll earn enough money to fully upgrade your ship, giving it enough firepower to blast the entire Caribbean to hell and back.Although this game does have a few issues, mainly the fact that its optimisation is all over the place (a deal breaker for some of you out there), I can recommend this game simply based on the hours of fun that I got out of it. With a large map, that's mostly made of seawater, and the songs of sailors filling the air, you'll have a decent amount of fun sailing your ship into the horizon.DRINK UP ME HEARTIES, YO HO!Update: I've found a fix for the FPS issues, there's a really good guide on the AC4 Steam community hub.

												Paid $30 for a steam activation of this game on Amazon. Way more fun than ACIII, being a pirate is great, have been having tons of fun in my first ~10 hours of gameplay. Stay tuned for a better review once I've actually finished the game but for now, totally recommended. Tons of collectibles, as always, and bonus points for the Voynich Manuscript being among them.After ACIII, people probably have a lot of doubts about whether Ubisoft Montreal blew it again on Black Flag. Let me just say that I played a couple hours of ACIII before putting it down in disappointment, and so far Black Flag looks like another game I will strive to 100%, just like II, Brotherhood, and Revelations. Don't let the disappointment of 3 influence your judgement of this game.While the game itself is truly great, you should be warned. While I haven't experienced the serious technical issues that many claim to have encountered on PC, this game does force you to use UPlay, and its not a secret to anybody that UPlay is super-duper-♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game also mysteriously decides to minimize itself every so often if I input too many xbox360 controller commands too quickly.			"

I have bougth Black Flag in sale and also thanks to positive ratings and I totally don't regret. Its catchy and I have fun to do all the side objectives. The ""mini"" game with the ships by looting other ships is great. The only things I hate are the diving bells location.

												Assassin's Creed 4 may be the best game I have ever played.With only a few bugs, it has amazing graphics, outstanding gameplay, and a good storyline. With plenty of suprises (like most pirates you meet eventually turn on you), it is a game not to miss. I would recommend this game to anyone. The only downside is that you should probably expect frustration, because some missions are very hard, like Nothing is true... I enjoy the game a lot and whoever reads this I bet you will too.			"

												If you have a strong gpu, you gonna need D3DOverrider to boost up your FPS from 30 lock to 60. something is wrong with their V-sync and optimization that causes this.Overall very fun game. I still prefer Assassin's Creed 2 though, but this one is still one of my favorite Ascreed of all time.Multiplayer is still breathing a bit, but It's not that fun due to balancing issue.For all perfectionists, 80 hours. 80 hours is all you need to complete all achievements and all collectibles in the game. If you're not a perfectionist and only aiming for end game, you just probably need 60 hours of gameplay.			"

												After the intro sequence,you engage in the first hour of the game,where you impregnate a sea turtle and give birth to a bunch of baby assassin turtles that look so gothic you swear they were Hot Topic Hipsters,air assassinate boars and violently cut them till there is no flesh left,and have a emo whale commit suicide by jumping out infront of your ship.You then exit the Emous,and are greeted by a red hair emo pig ♥♥♥♥♥,who rants about how awesome it is to cut and feel depressed,she then takes you around shows the other emos(who all wear glasses,wear black clothing,black makeup,and have cuts on their wrists o.o),then I am compelled to go to the coffee stand and get some coffee.The guy yells,""I DON'T SEE NO CUTS ON THEM WRISTS BOI!!!""So,I had to take out my hidden blade and slit my wrist just to get a cup of coffee.Then she takes me into the main lobby and she is greeted by another 4 eyed emo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,he headbangs her two times then talks to me about his day and how he sat in a tub all day with a knife.She then says,""It is time to initiate our new guy into our suicide pact!""So,he raises his hand towards me,showing all the cuts on his wrist,and yells some emo ritual and I am now part of a suicide pact.I enter the Emous and load the game,and the logo comes up with a fancy insignia that has a skull with a headshot,and the title,Emos Creed IV:Black Emo.10/10 would cut again.

												The frame rate on this game is terrible.. locked at 30 but then will hit 60 when i stand still. moving through towns i got as low as 20fps...My PC FAR exceeds the minimum spec for this OLD title (god knows how anyone played this when it first release on older hardware).Ive researched this and apparently im not alone, this is simply a poorly optimised port that runs like a dog for alot of people.Buyer beware.--I have however stuck with the game despite its Frame rate limitations and can say unequivocally that it is by far the best pirate game out their. Forget that its Assassins creed. This is a wonderful pirate conquest and management game.Any devs out there looking for ideas...  this is it, a Pirate Game. Buy, build, manage, conquer, plunder, open world.			"

												To me, this is the only Assassin's Creed game that I could stomach to play.I like pretty much everything about it, and the graphics still look good to this day. The only thing I dislike is the running, and how it automatically jumps onto walls, sometimes when you're running past them, which throws off the whole chase if you were doing a chase mission, but that's a crap feature that's included in all AC games.Dying Light did parkour right, not Assassin's Creed. Assassins Creed made it too easy.Still worth buying, definitely.			"

												This game wasnt as good as I thought it would be, I liked AC3 so much that I bought this one on the fly without looking at reviews, that was a mistake. Here are my reasons why this game wasnt worth $60.00. Im going to start with the good parts....Good storyNice lush environmentSecret islandsGreat characters (like fat merchant guy)and you also get to work at abstergo with this janitor guy whos kind of a jerk, but neat at the same time :DStill, with all these good features, the open world didnt sum up for me like AC3 did.I could get bored of one tiny land mass in about a week and a half, and there were only 3 main land masses. One didnt even have enemies until later in the game.So I WILL recommend it because of the story, but the open world is not what I was hoping for.			"

												This is really awesome game - as a part of AC series, and as a pirate simulator. It's up to you how to play (though mostly you'd prefer stealthy way) - as a silent assassin, or as a crazy pirate.I didn't liked AC 1 and 2 - not my type, and I would have skipped this game just as I skipped AC 3 - but playing as a pirate really hooked me up - and after a first mission I was so astonished by the game so I've played several hours in a row (though it's hard for me to find so much free time). I won't tell you anything about story - you should see it yourself. Go buy this game!P.S. Don't be afraid of UPlay, it's not as bad nowadays as it was few years ago.			"

												Here is my honest opinion after 70+ hours of this game:The main storyline in the beginning was very entertaining but the further I got into it the worse it became eventually at the end I just wanted to get through it,and it was a really bad experience.Despite this the SIDE MISSIONS are just wonderful,atleast I enjoyed them even thought I'm the kind of person who hates grinding.The scene is beautiful and there is a lot to do in the Caribbeans.Unfortunately I often had bugs in combat when I wanted to do things fast to pull off a fancy combo but aside from that the game was correct.All in all I would recommend it for those who like open world games and pirate adventure.8.5/10			"

												The best thing about this game are the ships, really. While I do like Assassins Creed, I am beginning to feel tired of them repeating the same game mechanics in every version they release. While the ship mechanics are new, it is not what I am referring to. It's like they keep making maps that they sell as full games, when in reality they could just a easy have been DLC. I do wish they come up with something different. Every game is at their base the same, climb up, hide in secret spot, stand on top of something, dive into a bush (or similar), hide in crowds etc.. I have already played the next episode (Unity) and yet again they will use the same mechanics. That said, the story is why at least I play these games for, and they have all been good so far. Not the best (or even the most original) but really quite good. And this is no different. I also enjoy playing in different ages, and this is another reason why I like these games. I feel a bit like being in a Highlander adaption (from the movie) which is also a reason why I liked that first movie so much. But I digress, and I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone. But like I said, I just want them to improve the game mechanics. It is getting really.... really repepetitive (that spelling wasn't a mistake :) ) and I do hope they improve it. I actually get the impression that the mechanics feel like they sometimes get in the way of the fluidity of the gameplay. Still, a very good game and you should absolutely try it, if by any chance you are one of the few who have not yet.			"

												This pirate game is the best Assassin's Creed I've played so far, and its still one of my favourite games. What I really like about this game is that you have your own ship that you can sail on a big map. The map is located in The Caribbean sea, and the game has lots of IRL cities like Havana and Kingston, and everything is timed in the early 18th ceuntury. If you're thinking about buying this game, don't hesitate to click that ""Add to cart"" button because a history lesson is waiting for you. "

												I LOVED Assassin's Creed 4, it is absolutely one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time.I hadn't played an Assassin's Creed game since the original one came out on consoles back in 2007. That was a fun game at the time. It had surprised me because the gameplay was easily accessible and it had a unique concept and setting. I never got back into the series after that since for one, I didn't think the Renaissance setting would be as interesting, but after the success of Assassin's Creed 2 they beat it to death. Also, the original Assassin's Creed was cool in that it gave you a lot to do outside of the main story, but had no tangible rewards for any of it, making the side activities pointless.So picking up Assassin's Creed 4 was the first time I had bought an Assassin's Creed game since the original. The thing that tipped me over the edge? Pirates.I love Pirates. See my review of Sid Meier's Pirates for more proof of that.I think that high seas piracy is a perfect setting for video games in general, but for whatever reason, very few games have tried this setting, and only a couple games have managed to do it well. Assassin's Creed IV is one of those games. It's like the pirate game I've always wanted but never knew it.So overall, the gist is that you start off as a crewmember on a pirate ship. After being wrecked in a storm, you end up stranded on a Caribbean island, then murdering and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting your way onto a merchant ship bound for Havana. In Havana, you learn some of the basic controls of the game and get an introduction to the main story before the Big Bad throws you in jail. You break out of jail and steal your own ship with your own pirate crew, and then BAM! you're a real Caribbean pirate and the game opens up, with an open world to explore, items to collect, missions to complete, etc.You notice how I haven't mentioned anything about Assassins yet?That's the thing about this game, although the plot and gameplay on land is still reminiscent of the Assassin's Creed series, where the game really shines is where it focuses on the piratical aspects of the experience. Not that I disliked the Assassin stuff. I really did feel powerful and stealthy when utilizing the skills the game gave me to perform assassinations. But they pale in comparison to the feeling you get when you're exploring the seas as a pirate.I tend to do shorter, to the point reviews so I feel like if I keep going about this it's going to run really long, but there's a lot of stuff this game does right that I want to touch on.One thing, is that the soundtrack is amazing. The ambient music that plays on land and at sea tends to fit the tone just perfectly. Also, while you're at sea on your ship, your crew will regularly engage in sea shanties. That is traditional working songs sung by sailors while on ship. It's a small but wonderfully atmospheric touch to the game, adding a level of immersion that I wasn't expecting to the experience.The graphics are utterly beautiful as well, although I wonder how much of that is due to the setting. The game is lucky enough to benefit from the lush tropical islands populating the colonial Caribbean sea as it's backdrop. But in addition to that, this game has some of the best looking water and water physics I've ever seen in a game. In fact, I often wondered how it was possible for the game to accomodate all the intricacies of the ocean physics, as well as my crew and enemy ships in the middle of a battle. I'm impressed just from a technical standpoint. But amazingly it does work, and it works almost perfectly.Also, you know how I mentioned that one of the problems I had with the original Assassin's Creed game was that it gave you a bunch of things to collect and explore, but nothing really came out of that collection and exploration? AC4 is slightly guilty of that (Animus Fragments) but for the most part the game is very good about there being a reason and a reward for collecting everything that you do and exploring as much of the game as possible.I love games that encourage exploration, and Assassin's Creed 4 is definitely one of those.Now that i've gushed a lot, I guess I'll talk about some of the faults.First of all, like I've sort of already said, this is a great game, and one of the best pirate games ever, but it may not live up to what some people want out of an Assassin's Creed game. It just doesn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game most of the time. In fact, the final mission in particular, felt completely out of place from the rest of the game, as it focused on completely different skills and actions than everything else you'd been doing in the game.The game also could benefit from cutting out the non-Animus parts entirely (if you've played an Assassin's Creed game you know what I'm talking about) they feel completely pointless and tacked on.Also, although I enjoyed some of them, the underwater sections of the game were mostly frustrating and not fun.As I mentioned before, although the game does a good job of actually having a reason for you to do the collecting and exploration, there were a few things that didn't go anywhere, the Animus Fragments being the biggest example, but also, I sorta expected there to be bigger rewards for collecting a large percentage of the collectibles, or for getting the entirety of a certain type of collectible. Also, I don't care about concept art, or multiplayer rewards, I want rewards that translate to things that I can actually use or interact with in the single-player game itself.Also, the hideout at Inagua was a good idea, but is poorly executed. After you receive the hideout, and purchase the first 3 or 4 upgrades, there's really no reason to return there, or to continue upgrading it all. I was hoping there would be more customization and use to it, but there really wasn't. Also, you can collect several items and artifacts that are stored there, but that's really all that happens with them. You collect them, and then they just sit there in your hideout. It's disappointing.Overall, this is one of my favorite experiences with a video game, ever, and in appreciation of it, I'm planning on giving more of the Assassin's Creed series a try. Despite the flaws, I think this would be a great game for everyone.One final note though, the DLC is not worth it. Do not buy.			"

												Haven't really finished the game, but the naval warfare is the feature I love most in the game. While some of the missions are repetitive and the landscape is quite boring, there are some memorable side quest like hunting fish and raiding bigger ships and upgrading my ship to which I really enjoy. The sailing it self through the ocean with beautiful sunset in the horizon is a pleasure on it's own.It may not be the best in the franchise, but I don't mind on recomending it to my mates.God bless you "

												After 37 hours of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, I don’t know which AC I love more now. Black Flag or 3 :/ This game is far more improved than any AC game before it and the story, especially the ending, just captivated my heart and through my emotions around, making me actually feel sympathetic for the characters, and Edward and especially Kidd. This game is worth the buy at any price. In 37 hours, I did all the missions (except the assassin’s mission) but my only problem is the extras… they were the same thing… over… and over… and over again just in different locations. Didn’t make it worth the time :( Overall, I absolutely LOVE this game!			"

ACIV:BF introduces underwater missions, which were quite thrilling at first but in true Assassin's Creed style were massively overused in the end. The Ship battles, by far the most prominent feature in the game, were absolutely great and there were efforts made by the developers to ensure that there was a decentish amount of difficulty in some of them. In all honestly, I expected to be able to sweep the board clean straight off the bat when it came to naval battles, but I was pleasantly surprised to find my♥♥♥♥♥got kicked more than once when tackling bigger targets like legendary ships. You can capture these legendary ships for your fleet which can acquire a great range of both story-related items and wealth-building necesseities, although the fleet battles are sort of just a dumbed down Xcom/MGS Peacewalker minigame that the player hardly needs to interact with. I can't really criticise them for that though, because if they crammed any more repetitive obligatory sub-missions in there the game would burst at it's seems.The story I found to be surprisingly lacking for a series which has it's main attraction in story-telling, and there are some silly bugs in there that, while they don't hinder the player's progression, are massive and bizarre and completely ruinous to a person's immersion. How they missed those, I do not know.The combat system they've changed a little but not in a good way. When the series made the jump from Ezio Auditore to Connor Kenway the protagonist fighting style had become dizzyingly fast and fluid, which was exciting at times. In Black Flag they've slowed it down slightly to sit somewhere between the two to reflect the weight difference between beefy Edward and slinky Connor. This makes sense to story, but regresses gameplay and I think it was a poor decision.There are many things I do like about ACIV:BF:The graphics are superb. Because of it's unpredictable patterns of movement, water is notoriously difficult to animate as is fire and smoke and there are plenty of all 3 in this game and they look GREAT. The use of music is top-notch. As a lover of Western folk music and someone who studied it academically I knew a lot of the tunes and they were very obscure and hard to find and there were many gems in there, both sea-shanties and ballads, that I had never heard before. A staggering amount of care and research went into compiling that music and it results in what is still, years later, the best and most well though out soundtrack I have ever heard in gaming. Another thing I like is that Ubisoft listened to what their fans asked them for. After ACIII's Naval battles people were clamouring for an Assassin's Creed pirate game and Ubisoft delivered. However, I don't know for certain that this game was developed as a reaction to that, but playing it through made me feel that the game was rushed out with very little post-production care taken. This was the first in the Assassin's Creed series to feel like that and the whole series has felt like this since, which is unfortunate.If you're looking for a game about pirates, albeit clunky and a bit loveless this is the one for you. However if you're not bothered about graphics or AAA game status, I would stick to Escape from Monkey Island or Sid Meier's Pirates for a much more rounded game on the whole.			"

												Assassin's Creed Black Flag is a game that takes players back to the point that we were at in previous Assassin's games, by giving us back control. Assassin's Creed III took that away and made the game a nearly unplayable mess of a title. However, while Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag gives you back control in SOMe areas, it take it away in others.The game starts of with a more than welcome jump into the open world. Much faster than previous Assassin's games, it assumes you know it's purpose is to break rules and have fun. Edward is a more intersting character in some respects than Connor was, Connor being the cut-and-dry hero we've come to grow sick of during the years, and Haytham (Connor's father and Edwards son) being the textbook villain. No, Edward traverses the line between good and bad for quite some time during the course of this game. Which makes his introduction into the Assassin's a far more intersting and palpable experience.That said, he is not nearly the character Altair or Ezio were. Altair was a brash, hotheaded yet good-hearted Assassin who needed guidance. And Ezio was a noble, wise, and brave Assassin who endured many losses in his life. They spent far less time developing Edwards character in Black Flag than any other Assassin game thus far. I spent time wondering who people he was reffereing to were, and what significance they had in the first place. The flash-backs are odd and ill-timed and do little to answer question I may have had. Only at the end do you get somewhat satisfying resolutions to your questions.The supporting characters are well fleshed out, however. I felt that, despite having little back story, their convictions and drives were evident from the start. And it was nice to see the evolution of Black Beard from a normal helmsman to the feared pirate he was. The story itself is good, while again pointing out that Edward is somewhat aimless through the game. It felt like the game was a great and amazing world to be in, but Edward was only the lense through which we saw it. Almost as if he was placed there as an excuse to relive this time-period and not the focal point of the game.Most of your time will be spent on the high-seas, unfortunately. This is inescapable seeing as Edward IS a pirate, however I missed the classic free-running time, spent on rooftops in the woods and in Templar forts. Now, Templar forts are found, and fought at sea. You have no option to disembark and take them out on foot, no, your only option is to wail away at them little by little until the fort collapses into the surrounding water. Needless to say the sea battles get repetitive, quick. And the attemted stealth section at sea make no sense. Why is there a deep, thick fog blocking my way? Why can't I attack them? Why do I have to be so close to follow them? These questions and more are the ones you will asking yourself as you play mission after mission after mission at sea.The fighting and movement systems are still top notch, having a nice flow to the battles that makes each one unique. Sometimes you'll be facing 10, easy henchman, or 3 knuckledragging supwerpowerful henchman. Is varies in almost every fight, forcing you to change techniques to finish them off.Also worth mentioning, rooftop freerunning is back with a vengeance! In AC3 it was almost impossible to go on rooftops, for the fact that you would be spotted within moments of doing so. Not only that, but when you were spotted enemies on both the ground and rooftops all of a sudden all knew my location. In Black Flag, while there are enemies on rooftops it is now much easier and more fun to traverse them without the fear of insta-death-by-soldiers.The performance for this game could use improving, however. I had to run it at 720p (no 720i support, thank you very much) and put every setting on low or off for the game to run at 50FPS. Max. I have an Nvidia GTX 560, 16gigs of ram and enough memory to last me 'till the worlds end. So why do cutscenes lag behind, and have to wait for the characters action to catch up with their audio? Why does it stutter so much when I'm in Abstergo Entertainment? Is there any reason why I can't turn my graphical settings past OFF!?!?!?!?!?When it's all said and done, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag does feel like an Assassin game. However, it's failing are evident and many. Despite that, it still manages to pull you in with it's story and supporting characters.Pros:+Flawless Combat+Varied Enemies+Great Freerunning+Amazing Locations+Good StoryCons:-Poor Performance-Crappy Cutscenes-Repetitive/Overused Naval Combat-Poor Character Development7.8/10 Good Game			"

												The visuals in this game were impeccable. Very well done, and even the tiny details were thought out (like rainbows forming when viewing mists / falls with the sun in the background). Beautiful scenes.As for the story, I was less impressed. It was more of the same mechanics from AC3, with carbon copies of items, houses, etc; ... and yes, those board games. They are ALL back; though you don't have to do rediculous things with them anymore. As for the main storyline -- it is weak, and I didn't like it -- they tried to force piracy into the Assassin's Creed and draw out some similarities to make a bridge so that when Edward did start running with the Assassin's, you would believe it. The entire time I kept calling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It was out of character for Edward, as well as for the Assassin's. Seems like they fixed the naval battles though, so the ones you need to do for the plot can't be 'upgraded past' (this happened in AC3 where your ship would be so upgraded that the mission would be very hard because you would insta kill instead of disabling ships).I'm all for being pulled out of the animus for breaks between chapters, but in 4 they took this too far. So many minigames and collectibles, that I felt the outside stuff was a chore just to get to 100% completion. Grinding is a problem in this game. I finished the game with all of my equipment / weapons upgraded, but forgot to tackle Kenway's fleet -- which means I am basically logging into the game every other day to check on mission progress (which is multi-day real-time missions). It sucks. It's grindy, and it has no affect on you except for pointless artifacts for your base and unlocks that you must get for 100%. Chests and animus fragments were a chore too. Legendary ship battles are insanely difficult and not really worth the reward -- again, don't even bother with them unless your ship is fully upgraded and you want to spend a day in frustration.On that note, the social sharing for rare finds is terrible. This mechanic allows you to share rare finds with your friends, which gives them a chance to find them as well. This is only enabled during community events (which is never explained or shown). I've put 82 hours into the game and have found 3. (A community event is set in the Initiates site, which you then have to meet the requirements for the rare stuff to trigger. acinitiates.com with your uplay account).Edit: Turns out they've disabled social stuff until it is patched, expected in January.Must be played with a controller.All in all, a solid game. Stick to the main missions and don't worry about the out-of-animus crap, collectibles and other junk unless you are going for 100%4/5			"

												I love this game, but not to be an assassin, to be a pirate. The Assassin's Creed games have become a little stale over the last few years and being an annual franchise has basically turned it into another ""Call of Duty"" for me. Having said that, it's like the pirate game iv'e always wanted but never got. The pirate part is where it truely shrines and if if Ubisoft was smart they'd listen to the fans that think as I do and make their own stand alone pirate game. I love the Creed games but there hasn't been enough innovation lately to keep me really interested for a long time, until this game. They did it right here because it was something fresh and had new mechanics such as true open world gameplay and brings back the sailing mechanic from ACIII, but making it 10 times more enjoyable this time around. Sailing around the Caribbean plundering and pillaging ships, settlements, and hidden coves alike was an exciting and new take on the series and is by far my favorite part of this game. They also have an interesting story to tell which involves famous pirates from history including the notorious Blackbeard. Once again the pirates is where the draw to this game is for me and i couldnt get enough of it. Here's hoping they hear those of us asking for more and give us the pirate game we deserve thats not held back by the now lackluster assassin story. 9/10Edit: So here I am  a couple years later and my opinion hasn't changed on this game. It's still the best pirate game out there and while I feel for the people that hated the pirate aspect and just wanted a good assassin game, I want a good assassin game as well, I still feel like we need more AAA pirate games and this game still beats everything else out there in my book. Having said that, I think this game deserves a 10/10 now because it's stood the test of time so far as the best.			"

												I feel this is a large improvement over III, the focus on ship combat/exploration works well. I've personally experienced a few glitches but mostly humourous and nothing game breaking and it feels really solid for a game that came out exactly one year after III which caused me to have doubts but so far I'm enjoying it a lot and it's reminding me of Sid Meiers pirates at times which is another great pirate game from 2004.Though as an Assassin game ie: when you're not on your ship the game does feel like a bit of the same old song and dance, kill this guy, tail that guy and so forth. I hope you like tailing missions because there are at a least a dozen or so which can make the story and some side missions drag on longer than desired and the free running can have some issues at times not going where you want it to, leading to you running up walls you don't want to and if you're unlucky ruining your stealth.Outside the animus this time around you play in the first person as a silent & faceless protagonist who just does what he's told, there's very little freedom here until later on where you get to interact with other computers and collect sticky notes and in my playthrough I collected all these to no reward as far as I know.I didn't play the multiplayer but I did check out the menus and such which enable you to buy just about any upgrade, weapon, cosmetic etc for real money as well as in game currency which can lead to a sort of pay to win attitude since you can just buy anything you need with microtransactions.Overall the game is pretty fun as long as you stay on your boat as on land there is not a lot in the way of new content if anything different at all gameplay wise. The world itself is fairly pretty though after a while you may notice some copy pasted structures and landmasses. In closing I do recommend this but as a pirate adventure game and not an Assassins Creed game.			"

												So I have played this game allot, and i want to do a deep review into the game, I am going to do this in sections, so here we go.Settings:This game does a good job. Maybe some gamers may see it quite minimal but it is simply laid out and is good enough for most gamers. The sound is simple and has an option to turn off the shanties so thats nice. Of course there are key bindings which are now an essential for almost every PC game. Making it a great settings menu.Story:I am not going to give any spoilers because it has a very good story. There are many heart throbs in the story and can make you hysterically sad. But if you were here for an assassin's creed game you may be terribly disappointed. This game is a brilliant Pirate game, with assassin's creed on the side. So it's a great story but not really an assassin's creed story.Gameplay:The gameplay is not to hard, and extremely satisfying. For some fans of the franchise the combat may be a little easy for you, but the brutal kills are so satisfying. The parkour is as smooth as ever and sort of reminds me of assassin's creed 2's parkour but on PC leaps of faith are not as smooth as you would get with a controller. The sailing and naval combat were introduced in this game, and they nailed it, it's a joy to sail through the sea and attack navy ships. Fans of the stealth will not be disappointed it has the wonderful hiding in brush and taking cover behind walls, also the classics hay boxes are still in the game. The free roam is stunning, conquering naval forts reveals the huge map giving you an advantage in finding locations. Another great feature is the naval contracts and assassination contracts, which will give you a nice reward for completing them. As you can see i am humbled by it.Multiplayer:I hate to say this but I feel the Multiplayer is stale and a waist of time. Firstly it is very hard to find a game. Secondly the only rellevant gamemode there is, is killing your target before someone else kills you. As you can see i don't have much to say about this.DLC:Sadly the Downloadable content felt sloppy and the developer's really let me down on this. I am yet to play assassin's creed liberation but it is more of a separate game. I have played assassin's creed Freedom Cry and got bored of freeing slaves the whole game this gameplay was very stale. I'm sad about this because they gave us a great open world but they didn't use this world to it's fullest.Conclusion:I beleive this is a brilliant base game, the DLC and multiplayer were lacking but the other aspects of the game are brilliant and can't want for the develepors of this game to release assassin's creed: Empire and that's why I am giving this game a 90/100.RATING 90/100 "

												It's awesome Fun. I played all Assassin's Creed titles, and this is definitely THE BEST for me. It loosened the personal Story elements for more extended, varied gameplay while still keeping the historical Aspect. The ship combat is gorgeous and well-executed. Everytime a Broadside rips through a Man o' War you can breathe in the virtual gunpowder smoke and feel like a true Third-person Pirate.The only grief I have with it - and why I personally can't play it that often - are the System Requirements. This Masterpiece requires a ton of PC in order to run correctly. And so, I take my Steam Account to a friend to play the game there. If you don't have such an Option and a low/medium End PC, you might wanna step by the Console versions or leave this game Entirely.Recommended? Yes. Definitely.			"

												This is the first AC game I've played so I can't compare it to the other yet, but what I can tell you is I've played a lot of good games in my life and this game quickly rised up to being in my top 3 favorite games of all time. The ship mechanics are pretty good and the actual use of said ship isn't just a burden, it is actually fun. As for the rest of the game, the story is engaging, The controls are good once you get used to them, the gralhics arn't exactly REALISTIC but they do still look standard for AC games, and I would recommend using a computer designed to run games like this and if you don't have one, then get a higher voltage charger, I don't care what voltage charger you have, unless you for some reason WANT to run the game at 2 frames per second, get a better one. Upgrades aren't irrelevant, and in general, this is just a really good game and I would HIGHLY recommend it.			"

												The only AC game that matters.  All else is hogwash.  Don't buy this game because parkouring across buildings is fun (it's not).  Don't buy this because you care about the over-arching story of Templars vs Assassins in the future/past (you don't).  And, please friend, don't buy this game because you think context-sensitivity is smart gameplay (press A to win).Buy this game because you're an f-ing pirate.  Sail the salt sea as your crew sings chanties.  Harpoon whales and dive with sharks.  Explore ancient ruins on jungle islands.  Casually dispatch enemies by the dozens as you board their vessel.  This is the best pirate game by a long sight.  (The story, excluding the Animas portions, is fairly good.  The characters are likable and well realized, and the voice acting is superb.  But, damn, those Animas parts of AC games have to go.)			"

												Okay, I'll try to write down my commentary to AC4 (comparing it sometimes to AC3 too), remember that it is MINE OWN opinion, so it might vary from yours (though I will try to judge fairly). Minor spoilers awaiting!                                                                                          *****Concept*****The idea of Edward Kenway is... kind of weird. I'm not against it, but not on it either. Yes, he might be the one that have some genes in him or anything that makes him being able to do all the assassin's feats while being a simple pirate from the beginning and NEVER pass training like previous characters (that stuff took Connor some years if I remember correctly). But also you'll never see in these games a lot of such people, so why there can't be one? It kind of makes sense though.Also it is original, apparently thought through and looks cool! But still that's a little weird...                                                                                          *****Storyline*****""Main missions"" in the game, which I consider as storyline, I found rather short. Yes, I mean that I do not really like that there's too little story missions in the game. But when I finished the story and looked on Steam to see how much time I spent on this - Oh my god - it's been about to 211 hours! Total sync was, like, 61% I think (did a lot of side activities too, like missions in town, upgrading the ship and character, looting chests and etc). So when I summed it up, it was clear that those hours just flew by - I liked it a lot. But still, I think some measures not to be able to rush down the story would be ok (like, making story mission appear only after certain time spent on side-activities or such, but even better would be making story just longer). I don't really know, but I recall that AC3 had much more main missions, or they were longer. But at the same time, I do like the Storymode overall. Even though it was a too fast adventure, I ""liked"" or ""really liked"" all the missions except one (not gonna spoil it though), because they all are well-made and aren't empty: there's a lot of action in every of them. So, I could basically just not rush it down and try to be more patient in the game, basically, there's might be no wrong in the story mode at all.                                                                                          *****Combat System*****Combat in AC4 was harder than one in AC3. And I really do like it. Back in the previous game, I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about how easily you can slash people down, how op counters are and how useless is parry. Now, when the slow-mo in counter is gone and you can no longer counter Brutes attack (you always dodge 'em), the combat became far harder. Also the Human Shield mechanic and idea of gunners is also splendid - it made combat actually challenging, but maybe not too much (yet if you think about it, why would it be hard combat if you fighting, like, one against ten people? That'll be too hard). I also still think that parrying is rather useless, unfortunately, but it was buffed and, in vary rare situations, it actually helped me, so it's not hopeless. And the thing that I actually missed in this game that is arsenal. AC3 had MUCH more different types of weapons and had more tools, so I was expecting this in AC4, but it didn't come true, sadly. However, new mechanics (like, four pistols and darts, as well as new shenbao (rope dart) are cool). Combat in the seas is even more challenging that the one on earth. It is kinda making no sense that you can aboard one of five ships you fight, and other ones will do nothing, while after that you repair your ship because of boarding and fighting like a god damn vampire-ship-thingie (on other side without this strategy you do not survive grand battles against strong opponents). I don't approve that idea. But in 1v1 fights overall navi combat is nice, though I don't really see use for chain missiles. I also was dissapointed about maximum of infamy your Jackdaw may reach. I really hoped this cap was far higher, so at it's peak you'll be hunted by legendary hunter or something. Overall, I think that combat system needs some more tweaks, but mostly it is fine and entertaining.                                                                                          *****Stealth System*****Stealth is the great part of AC games, but in this game i found Social Stealthing in the Single Player being freaky and mostly ineffective when stalking zones are overpowered. In Multiplayer, reverse is true: haystacks are mostly useless, while social stealthing is too useful. The mechanic that you move with the crowd in MP should have been also in SP, otherwise you need to speed up from time to time to keep up with crowd and it makes already hilarious stealthing even more broken. So, AC4 is rather ""stealthing"" game than ""social-stealthing"", as it was used to be. But overall the mechanics became better compared to AC3. It now makes a little more sense - standing in the crowds in AC4 became better (by means of animation and that's not too laughable right now by realistic means), and stalking ""in the wild"" is keeping up, too (AC3 bushes made no sense - you CAN'T hide in so thin vegetation, but AC4 is almost perfect in these means). The AI of enemies is still lacking and very badly at some points (not too buggy but mostly irrealistic), yet overall I think it is on right course.                                                                                          *****Side activities*****The Assassin's Creed 4 contains a lot of side activities, including harpooning, collecting stuff, side missions and so so on. The first thing I experienced about that - side missions - vary in the game and are a little less exciting than ones in AC3. Still, pretty enjoyable and so they are fun (Templar Hunt is like a little story line which I appreciate very much). Fleet, however, is a great failure for me. A minigame? Are you kidding me? This is a FLEET. I really am dissapointed about that, I thought it'd be far more epic. However, Diving is also very exciting, but sometimes a little to hard (for example, hint about new hostile creature in the seas appeared only after it hit me. How's that fair?). Still is well made activity. Harpooning is very enjoyable though - you need to charge, to aim harpoon, to counter attacks of the prey by interrupting it and stuff. About collecting... Well... I am not a fun of this type of things yet they did not annoy me too much in AC4. Actually, if you'll try to collect them while sailing somewhere you actually would like to sail (we're passing by, why not stop for a three minutes or so?), they are ok. But the way they are in the world... It's a pain, but the best I can imagine them to be. They are spread in the world, but strangely - seems to be close, yet you need to drop to the island, collect stuff, jump again to the ship, sail to the another location for a little while, repeat. That's how you collect them. Even if you do it only when it's not so hard to do, it still is a painful thing to add into the game - even the chests ain't worth picking up by the loot they have inside (cargo standing on the ground won't worth a single button pressed for them). That makes collecting stuff for me purely rating-challenge based activity, where you  ladder up above some people you don't even know. But yeah, those three chests probably will move you upwards on ladder for 1 000 people who do not care about such stuff. Yaaay. Much pride. So wow. However, collecting some things from different sources (treasure maps and diving for example) gives you plans for your ship to make it stronger or some other huge bonuses, making collecting somehow useful too. So, the side activities mostly do give you some in-game stuff after the story mode, yet it might be boring and also ain't endless. I wanted to tell more, but that's limit of symbols. Overall - recommend.			"

												Okay just to start off, this game requires Uplay. I know thats an issue for some people so take that as you will.Anyway more imprtantly to the game itself and i was quite happy to find there's been an improvement over the last couple of AC games particularly the awful AC3.In this game you play Edward Kenway who's a pirate in the Carribbean and it makes for a great setting and experience. Edward is the best lead character since Ezio and is a likeable guy with plenty of personality. The games setting is fantastic as well with loads of beautiful tropical environments with the oppurunity to sail around the Carribbean and explore. You've got Havana,Nassau and Kingston as your 3 main cities though these are a bit dissappointing particularly Nassau and Kingston as they are pretty unimpressive compared to some of the great cities of the older games.As for the gameplay it's also improved. All the pirate stuff you can do like attack and board ships and sail around looking for treasure is a lot of fun. The assassin stuff almost feels boring in comparision. There is also a lot of ""follow"" missions in this game as i've always hated these missions the most in AC games and this one is littered with them. That said there still is a lot to do and explore and you will get your moneys worth from this game.Surprisingly the music in this game is probably one of the best parts of this game. As you sail your crew will sing sea shanties which is brilliant and really gives it that pirate atmosphere. I've found myself humming the tunes after playing. You can also collect more shanties which will be unlocked for your crew to sing.The Good:- Great interesting protaganist in Edward Kenway and a few more interesting characters as well- All the pirate activities are a lot of fun.- The Carribbean looks great in this game and you've a big area to travel and explore in.-The music in this game is brilliant.The Bad: -The story isn't particularly interesting and a bit hard to follow at times- The assassin stuff is pretty boring and there's way too many ""follow"" missions-Controls still feel awkward and fiddly at times-Game can be fairly buggy at timesOverall this is a step in the right direction again for the AC series and probably my favourite since AC2. It gets an 8/10 from me.			"

Also the Human Shield mechanic and idea of gunners is also splendid - it made combat actually challenging, but maybe not too much (yet if you think about it, why would it be hard combat if you fighting, like, one against ten people? That'll be too hard). I also still think that parrying is rather useless, unfortunately, but it was buffed and, in vary rare situations, it actually helped me, so it's not hopeless. And the thing that I actually missed in this game that is arsenal. AC3 had MUCH more different types of weapons and had more tools, so I was expecting this in AC4, but it didn't come true, sadly. However, new mechanics (like, four pistols and darts, as well as new shenbao (rope dart) are cool). Combat in the seas is even more challenging that the one on earth. It is kinda making no sense that you can aboard one of five ships you fight, and other ones will do nothing, while after that you repair your ship because of boarding and fighting like a god damn vampire-ship-thingie (on other side without this strategy you do not survive grand battles against strong opponents). I don't approve that idea. But in 1v1 fights overall navi combat is nice, though I don't really see use for chain missiles. I also was dissapointed about maximum of infamy your Jackdaw may reach. I really hoped this cap was far higher, so at it's peak you'll be hunted by legendary hunter or something. Overall, I think that combat system needs some more tweaks, but mostly it is fine and entertaining.                                                                                          *****Stealth System*****Stealth is the great part of AC games, but in this game i found Social Stealthing in the Single Player being freaky and mostly ineffective when stalking zones are overpowered. In Multiplayer, reverse is true: haystacks are mostly useless, while social stealthing is too useful. The mechanic that you move with the crowd in MP should have been also in SP, otherwise you need to speed up from time to time to keep up with crowd and it makes already hilarious stealthing even more broken. So, AC4 is rather ""stealthing"" game than ""social-stealthing"", as it was used to be. But overall the mechanics became better compared to AC3. It now makes a little more sense - standing in the crowds in AC4 became better (by means of animation and that's not too laughable right now by realistic means), and stalking ""in the wild"" is keeping up, too (AC3 bushes made no sense - you CAN'T hide in so thin vegetation, but AC4 is almost perfect in these means). The AI of enemies is still lacking and very badly at some points (not too buggy but mostly irrealistic), yet overall I think it is on right course.                                                                                          *****Side activities*****The Assassin's Creed 4 contains a lot of side activities, including harpooning, collecting stuff, side missions and so so on. The first thing I experienced about that - side missions - vary in the game and are a little less exciting than ones in AC3. Still, pretty enjoyable and so they are fun (Templar Hunt is like a little story line which I appreciate very much). Fleet, however, is a great failure for me. A minigame? Are you kidding me? This is a FLEET. I really am dissapointed about that, I thought it'd be far more epic. However, Diving is also very exciting, but sometimes a little to hard (for example, hint about new hostile creature in the seas appeared only after it hit me. How's that fair?). Still is well made activity. Harpooning is very enjoyable though - you need to charge, to aim harpoon, to counter attacks of the prey by interrupting it and stuff. About collecting... Well... I am not a fun of this type of things yet they did not annoy me too much in AC4. Actually, if you'll try to collect them while sailing somewhere you actually would like to sail (we're passing by, why not stop for a three minutes or so?), they are ok. But the way they are in the world... It's a pain, but the best I can imagine them to be. They are spread in the world, but strangely - seems to be close, yet you need to drop to the island, collect stuff, jump again to the ship, sail to the another location for a little while, repeat. That's how you collect them. Even if you do it only when it's not so hard to do, it still is a painful thing to add into the game - even the chests ain't worth picking up by the loot they have inside (cargo standing on the ground won't worth a single button pressed for them). That makes collecting stuff for me purely rating-challenge based activity, where you  ladder up above some people you don't even know. But yeah, those three chests probably will move you upwards on ladder for 1 000 people who do not care about such stuff. Yaaay. Much pride. So wow. However, collecting some things from different sources (treasure maps and diving for example) gives you plans for your ship to make it stronger or some other huge bonuses, making collecting somehow useful too. So, the side activities mostly do give you some in-game stuff after the story mode, yet it might be boring and also ain't endless. I wanted to tell more, but that's limit of symbols. Overall - recommend.			"

												Okay just to start off, this game requires Uplay. I know thats an issue for some people so take that as you will.Anyway more imprtantly to the game itself and i was quite happy to find there's been an improvement over the last couple of AC games particularly the awful AC3.In this game you play Edward Kenway who's a pirate in the Carribbean and it makes for a great setting and experience. Edward is the best lead character since Ezio and is a likeable guy with plenty of personality. The games setting is fantastic as well with loads of beautiful tropical environments with the oppurunity to sail around the Carribbean and explore. You've got Havana,Nassau and Kingston as your 3 main cities though these are a bit dissappointing particularly Nassau and Kingston as they are pretty unimpressive compared to some of the great cities of the older games.As for the gameplay it's also improved. All the pirate stuff you can do like attack and board ships and sail around looking for treasure is a lot of fun. The assassin stuff almost feels boring in comparision. There is also a lot of ""follow"" missions in this game as i've always hated these missions the most in AC games and this one is littered with them. That said there still is a lot to do and explore and you will get your moneys worth from this game.Surprisingly the music in this game is probably one of the best parts of this game. As you sail your crew will sing sea shanties which is brilliant and really gives it that pirate atmosphere. I've found myself humming the tunes after playing. You can also collect more shanties which will be unlocked for your crew to sing.The Good:- Great interesting protaganist in Edward Kenway and a few more interesting characters as well- All the pirate activities are a lot of fun.- The Carribbean looks great in this game and you've a big area to travel and explore in.-The music in this game is brilliant.The Bad: -The story isn't particularly interesting and a bit hard to follow at times- The assassin stuff is pretty boring and there's way too many ""follow"" missions-Controls still feel awkward and fiddly at times-Game can be fairly buggy at timesOverall this is a step in the right direction again for the AC series and probably my favourite since AC2. It gets an 8/10 from me.			"

												This is the first AC game I've played so I can't compare it to the other yet, but what I can tell you is I've played a lot of good games in my life and this game quickly rised up to being in my top 3 favorite games of all time. The ship mechanics are pretty good and the actual use of said ship isn't just a burden, it is actually fun. As for the rest of the game, the story is engaging, The controls are good once you get used to them, the gralhics arn't exactly REALISTIC but they do still look standard for AC games, and I would recommend using a computer designed to run games like this and if you don't have one, then get a higher voltage charger, I don't care what voltage charger you have, unless you for some reason WANT to run the game at 2 frames per second, get a better one. Upgrades aren't irrelevant, and in general, this is just a really good game and I would HIGHLY recommend it.			"
