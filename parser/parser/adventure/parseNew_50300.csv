												Playing this game is rather like watching the proverbial train wreck: you'll be horrified, but you can't look away. This is in no way a bad thing. Spec Ops wants to tell a story about soldiers in war. But unlike games such as Call of Duty, it doesn't want you to feel like an awesome, unstoppable killing machine that's fighting terrorism FOR 'MERICA!!! or whatever; it wants you to see that war is not glamorous, awesome, fun, or desirable. It wants you to see the terrible toll that combat can exact on those who experience it. And above all, it wants you to see that in real conflict, there are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" and the world is full of gray areas. War is hell, and anyone who goes in will either join the fortunate dead...or have to live with what they've done to survive.Spec Ops is a third-person cover-based shooter that alternates between desert environments and crumbling urban ruin. You have two squadmates who can be directed to attack specific targets or heal a fallen comrade; they're pretty good at following orders in a timely fashion and, unlike some other AI partners, they're not highly prone to getting themselves shot constantly or hung up on the level geometry. Enemies are decently clever, more than willing to flank you, toss grenades to get you out of cover, or trick you into walking right into a Heavy Trooper's line of fire.The game also offers the clever idea of having drifts of sand piled up on fragile surfaces like windows, which you can shoot out to bury your enemies. It doesn't show up that often, but it's kind of neat when it's there.There's the usual shooter stable of weapons: pistols, heavy pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. They sound good and feel decently punchy, and aiming is never a problem. Most weapons also have an alternate fire mode, which does add a little depth to the combat.I didn't play the multiplayer, so I can't honestly review it. I will say the developers originally didn't even want multiplayer, and the campaign is designed well enough to stand on its own, so make of that what you will.I highly recommend this game. It is a breath of fresh air in an over-crowded genre that's becoming increasingly generic. This game is also visually stunning, with exceptional voice acting, and sound. It is definitely worth the money and the effort to play the game from the beginning to the end.			"

												About halfway through Yager's third-person-shooter Spec Ops: The Line, in one of the game's most controversial moments, I found myself disgusted and infuriated. Not at the scene I'd just witnessed, or at the game's statement as a whole, but rather that it even needs to be said at all. Two of the ten bestselling video games of all time are Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The ""military shooter"" is one of the most successful genres of the last ten years, and the objective of these games is to kill people. Lots of people. We eat it up non-stop, and always, always ask for sequels seconds. In order to keep the profit margins wide, we are encouraged to never think about it, to never stop and look at ourselves with a critical, compassionate, clear eye. Of course, it's not only Hollywood that benefits from the blinders we've all put on, since only the desperate and crazy would fight our wars for us if it weren't for the glorification of war peddled by the governments of this strange, sad world upon which we find ourselves spinning through the abyss.In an ideal world, these things wouldn't need to be said and all of this would be a moot point. Games like The Line would be seen as a gratuitous miserywank, and people would rightly ask, ""Why do we need something like this?"" But we don't live in an ideal world, and as gamers, we inhabit a very flashy and seductive yet still a very small and confined space where, ever since John Carmack created Wolfenstein 3D and Doom and ushered in the era of the ultraviolent shooter genre, there is an elephant in the room covered in blood and gore. As such, The Line is a game that needed to be made, its message one that we need to listen to.The plot, involving a small group of elite U.S. soldiers sent to Dubai on a rescue mission in the midst of a freak sandstorm that all but destroys the city, is adapted from the novella Heart of Darkness[en.wikipedia.org] by Joseph Conrad, which also inspired the movie Apocalypse Now[en.wikipedia.org]. The themes of both are intact here -- the horrors of war, the darkness that lives in the soul, and the lengths to which the human mind will go to rationalize its own nature -- but I would argue that they are made much more effective by the vicarious immediacy of the video game medium, and because so much of gaming involves visiting death on whole populations of pixellated AI effigies. Here, the formula is largely unchanged; indeed, you mow down an impressive number of folks with a variety of well-represented handguns, rifles and heavy weapons, but unlike your regular military shooter, The Line invites and occasionally straight-up forces you to think about the enemy soldiers: who they are, what their motivations are, and of course, how they die. The writers at Yager accomplish this in several ways, some with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face, but others which surprised the sheer hell out of me with their deft use of the medium's voyeuristic and user-participation elements. Spoiler: There's one such moment available in the demo after you use a zipline to reach a building where you sneak up on a pair of soldiers overlooking the ruined city. Their quiet, wistful conversation together is human, poignant, and, because you have no choice but to kill them to proceed with the mission, painfully affecting.A lot has been written about this game[en.wikipedia.org] and I doubt I'm saying anything new. It is well-deserving of its praise. It's mature and uncompromising. The characters are believable, sometimes heartbreakingly so. At one point I questioned Yager's decision to use the third-person perspective instead of first-person; it seemed to me that the latter would have been much more powerful. But when you stop to wheel the camera around and look at your character, you don't see your typical hardcore BAMF with the obligatory, almost muscular, furrowed brow, the thin, tight, all-business lips, the hard eyes, etc. You see a soldier scared for his life, scared for his soul. His eyes dart everywhere like a cornered animal, he breathes unsteadily, he looks like he feels: horrified, nauseated and on the edge of tears.The devs say that the story is open to interpretation, but for me, the game is at its heart an honest illustration of post-traumatic stress disorder, or as George Carlin would say, ""shellshock"":

			this is my tribute to George Carlin. the teacher teaches. i do not own this video.		

If George were still around and had been a gamer, he probably would've approved of Spec Ops: The Line. He was first and foremost an observer of life, a philosopher who just happened to be funny as hell. This is not a funny game. One of the characters starts off as the typical comic relief character that all shooters seem to require, but like Pvt. Joker in Full Metal Jacket[en.wikipedia.org], he sobers up fast and his wisecracks dry up completely during the events of the game. It's almost a shame the cover-based shooting mechanics are so well done, because I find myself torn between wanting to do another playthrough and not wanting to feel the way this game makes me feel. Because this is where The Line lives: the duality of our chosen brand of entertainment, where we ""play"" at the deadly game of simulated mortal conflict, and never stop to ask ourselves: what does my kill/death ratio mean for my soul? Does blood still stain if it only exists in my head? Should I even care?A man broke into my neighborhoodHe threatened the family with a loaded gunHe tied them all up and beat 'em real goodHe took everything and he got away cleanAnd I can't believe that anyone wouldWanna do such a terrible thingBut why should I care?Every time I look around this placeI see them scream but I hear no soundAnd the terrible things happen down the roadTo somebody else that I don't even knowNothing bad ever happens to meNothing bad ever happens to meNothing bad ever happens to meNothing bad ever happens to meWhy should I care?Why should I care?Why should I care?Oingo Boingo - Nothing Bad Ever Happens To MeSpec Ops: The Line is a game that needed to be made. It is a game that, in my opinion, needs to be (I hesitate to use the word ""played"") experienced. It is a powerful milestone in the ongoing evolution and maturation of gaming, and it asks hard questions that deserve to be heard. It's up to you whether or not to listen. To paraphrase Kenneth Jarecke, a Gulf War photojournalist whose photograph of a dead Iraqi soldier was pulled from the U.S. media outlets because it was deemed too shocking for the public[www.theatlantic.com]: if you're big enough to fight a war, you should be big enough to look at it.

												Spec Ops: The Line might be dismissed at first glance for being just another modern military shooter. That assumption couldn’t be more wrong though.Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Spec Ops provides one of the strongest and mature narratives in recent memory.The story revolves around Captain Walker and his two wingmen, Lugo and Adams. Their latest mission sends them to a post-catastrophic Dubai to find Colonel Konrad who was in charge of evacuating the civilian population. Captain Walker is often forced to make difficult decisions and any pretense of him being some badass hero is quickly removed as it's clear that sometimes there's no correct decision to make. The character progression is strong and the voice acting is phenomenal.The art direction is spectacular as Dubai provides almost a surreal experience. When you’re not avoiding sandstorms, you'll travel through luxury hotels and buildings that have all been submerged in sand. The game also gives you a taste of PTSD as you’re sometimes left wondering whether or not certain things are real.The combat plays out similarly to other third person shooters. It will have you taking cover, blind firing and issuing commands to your squad mates. The AI is well done, making Lugo and Adams feel very capable while the enemy AI on the other hand could use a bit of work. The combat is solid but it makes no attempt to do anything new or innovative.The soundtrack is fantastic, including a lot of real songs along with ambient guitar pieces that match the mood perfectly. The inclusion of Jimi Hendrix and other classics really give the game an ‘Apocalypse Now’ type of feel which was another Heart of Darkness adaptation.Unfortunately, Spec Ops is fairly short (around 5 hours) but the different endings offer some incentive to replay the game. There’s a multiplayer mode that offers a few different game types, weapons, and stages but it feels a bit tacked on. It’s fairly clear that Spec Ops was designed to be experienced as a single player game primarily and it’s one I strongly recommend.For a more detailed review, here’s a video by my friend and fellow reviewer, Trent:

												This game, is most likely one of the most depressing games I have ever played in my entire life. What does that mean, does this game suck? No. In fact, this game is incredibly beautiful in many ways, and when you are done playing this game, the whole game story is stuck in your head and makes you think about it. Definitely not some game that is recommended for those who only play Call of Duty multiplayer and such, but for those who are able to appreciate such an amazing story that this game offers. But the problem is that I do not know why this game is called ""Spec Ops"". I have been avoiding this game for a while, not knowing why and now I know the reason. Because this game is associated with the franchise ""Spec Ops"" that existed in the past, and Spec Ops games generally were not really good games when I was a kid. So, when I googled the name Spec Ops, I thought ""Oh man, now I remember this name Spec Ops...now I know why I have been avoiding this game....all simply because it is associated with the franchise that I was avoiding as a kid."" I honestly wish this game was rather called something else. Probably 33rd. The name ""Spec Ops"" might be the reason why the sales of the game was not that good as well...when the game is absolutely ""nothing"" like the Spec Ops games that I have played in the past, which is a good thing, a great thing even. The only complain I have would be that....probably as a TPS game, it is not that amazing to be honest. It doesn't mean it is bad, but it is just...not that amazing. But I really liked the fact that at some point, you can choose to do what to do. Such as disobeying the command, or you could simply just choose to obey. I guess the story alone covers everything in this game and this game is essentially worth taking a look at, all just for the story alone.This game, is about the horrors of war. This game, is about the value of life. But this game is not about good and evil, or mayhap, it indeed is. But that depends on how you look at it. As a philosopher myself, this game is what I would call, a game for the thinkers. Who is Captain Walker in the end? What happened to him? The only person who can find out, is you. 9.3 out of 10			"

												Finishing Spec Ops The Line was a dreadfully exausting experience. I walked along a man who's mental brakedown was more stable than my own, I felt remorse and sickness of everything I've done, I reflected upon war, death and life and in the end, I was sitting in front of a PC , trying to figure out why Yager hates me so much and why they would make such a horrible, HORRIBLY harsh journey to drive me into depression.After a walk on the park, a cup of tea, donating to a charity and helping an old lady cross the street, I still feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing monster, a cruel, unmerciful, selfish meatbag....and probably will for the rest of my life.EDIT :Since this is somehow once of the most popular reviews of the game (top 10) I rather expand my thoughts.This is pure and simple, one of my personal favorite games of all time. I just cant put into words how powerful it was to me. People will be against this opinion, but this is no doubts in my book the Culmination of what a game can be narrative wise. Last of Us, Undertale , nothing comes closer.So, as someone who digs story and literature, this game sounded like a treat! A great 3rd person shooter with unique setting and a good story. I quickly realized that it was a not mistake to go in full blind. Honestly, it was the most twisted , exausting, tense, emotion packed experience I ever encountered in a medium. The sheer raw brutality and straightfoward truth of the whole narrative drew me in from the get-go.Everything helped to make the game feel incredible (in a harmful way)The controls are a bit cluncky at first, but nothing some practice can fix. Its still a very accesible game, that anyone who played shooters (or not) before can handle.The voice acting is Oscar worthy. Not a single line was wasted or weak. Especially the main cast really nail the dialouge. Belive me when I say few times I really FELT a game protagonist was a human being. Nolan North really sounds like a tired, angry, traumatized war victim.The graphics, especially with everything cranked up to the max, are ****ing beautiful, the aestetic is superb and the levels are very well desinged.The sound is overall intense and loud, each fight is nerve wracking to the extreme.Soundtrack is outstanding and fitting to the themes.The overall story is open to your conclusions, which leads to very interesting interpretations from players.Multiplayer is NOT totally dead. A fellow user has made up a group that organises matches frequently. You can join if you want ! MP is sorta good. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Expendables-realityI could go on forever, but I rather not saturate you.Just buy it whenever possible.This was the most incredible game I ever played, and I hope you can someday see why.""We do what is nesessary...and If we are lucky, we just die"".

												It's been a year since I picked up the game, and I still cannot bear to play it again when I think of what overcame me when I finished the game.As my playtime indicates, I finished this in a massive rush. I played from 11pm to 4am, expecting that the game was some sort of quick-play game that I could put down easily at any time, like, say, call of duty (oh good grief, even the comparison makes me cringe). I was so driven to finish the game (the mission, as it were) much like Walker was. This revelation made me hate myself beyond belief, as I realized the very same determination, the self-same urge to commit to a goal made me ignore warning signs all over the place. This game makes you truly explore yourself, the deepest darkest recesses of your psyche where the hidden threads of psychopathy lie. When I finally finished the game at 4am, I was unable to sleep. I stayed awake, tormented by what I had done and the face of the white phosphorus burnt mother and child. I kept telling myself: ""This is a game. Get over it and get to sleep."", but I just couldn't get over the fact that at the heart of every human is the capability to take things to an extreme in order to pursue a perceived greater good. It is the very thing that drives the best of humanity and the worst of humanity. Medical scientists pursuing a cure, versus the extremists ♥♥♥♥ing up Syria as I type this. This game revealed an inner heart of darkness that needs to be understood, addressed and controlled. If only every one of us could think about it with the due weight and clarity that is needed in such a discussion.Play the game, and finish it, please. Do yourself a favour and finish it. Understand how dangerous it is to be unaware of your own actions, and bloody well learn from it.			"

													Every once in awhile, what I call a crime is committed in this industry, a game will be released and end up being one of the greatest games I've ever played. However for one reason or another, it ends up doing horribly. Spec Ops: The Line may be the biggest crime I've ever witnessed...	 Spec Ops puts you in the shoes of Captain Walker, you and two squad mates are sent into a sandstorm destroyed Dubai to find survivors. At first glance the game may appear to be another Call Of Duty type of modern shooter. Disaster occurs and America comes in to save the day, but that is definitely not the case.	The first thing I noticed about this game is how beautiful it is, some may disagree, but Spec Ops on PC with max settings truly looks next gen to me, and this game was released a good while before next gen was a thing. The animation complements this point, for example since Dubai is a city destroyed by uncontrollable sandstorms, you will be traveling through a lot of buildings that are now buried deep below the sand. The moment when I first shot out a giant window I gleefully watched as the sand poured in and buried alive an entire squad of soldiers.	Everything that should be good in a 3rd person shooter gameplay wise is present in this game, but I do not want to waste any time so I'll just tell you about the one thing in Spec Ops that will make you love it, the story. This is hands down the greatest story I have ever had the pleasure of playing in a ""Modern War"" shooter. Within the first couple levels, Spec Ops shows you that unlike what other games will tell you, war nowadays isn't as clear as ""America=good guys, Foreigners=bad guys"". Without spoiling too much you quickly see other American soldiers killing innocent families. What choice do you have? Will you just stand by and let mothers and children get burned alive? No of course not, you are going to take action and start killing your fellow soldiers. While going through the campaign I couldn't believe the light Yager was casting on the American military...and I loved it. Just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you are a good, or sane, person. Your squad has to witness the entire breakdown of a city, piles of bodies litter the streets, peoples are dying of everything you could imagine, soldiers killing the innocent for sport, but Walker keeps pressing on, because he believes he is doing the right thing.  	The voice acting is also great and it isn't just because Nolan North plays the main character, it is because not only do you see, but you also hear the changes these characters are going through due to what they are forced to live through. Once again I do not want to spoil anything, but Walker starts off as a by the book, top tier soldier, and North does an incredible job showing just how much war can change a man.	Spec Ops: The Line is an incredible game that will blow you away. The graphics are beautiful though the images you will see are gut-wrenching. The voice acting is fantastic though what these characters go through is horrible. The story is perfect, you will feel like you have walked through hell with these soldiers. If you are not interested in the ""Modern War"" genre because of it's glorification and unrealistic approach on war, play this game. If you do like the ""Modern War"" genre because it is fun, action packed, and brutally violent, play this game. If you haven't figured it out yet what I'm trying to say is Spec Ops is a game you should play, easily an unforgettable experience. Play this game and lets give Yager the praise and recognition they deserve. "

												A series of dust storms has destroyed much of Dubai, leaving countless civilians stranded. The 33rd Battalion, a United States infantry unit, is sent to provide aid but soon disappears. In a last ditch effort, a three-man Delta Force team is sent in to find out what happened and rescue survivors. As captain of this reconnaissance team it is up to you and your teammates to fight your way across the city and find answers.Spec Ops: The Line is a third person shooter where you will find that you are heavily reliant on cover. You have the ability to command your teammates in battle, telling them who to target. Combat is fast paced and fun, albeit a bit generic. My main complaint with combat would be that the AI sometimes feels a bit clumsy, but nothing bad enough to be game breaking. The game is very story rich and is definitely worth paying attention to. Occasionally you will be forced to make some very difficult decisions. What I liked about this is that there is never really a “right” or “wrong” answer. Unlike some military shooters, this game does not glorify war. Instead it touches on the horrors of war and the profound psychological impact it often has on those who experience it.The environment is absolutely breathtaking, by far my favorite in any game ever. They did a wonderful job at making Dubai look so ruined yet beautiful, resulting in a few areas where you have to stop just to admire your surroundings. I realize that this can vary quite a bit from person to person but I was pleasantly surprised by the music used in the game. Quite a few classics including Hendrix and Deep Purple, as well as some more modern but worthwhile bands such as the Black Angels. If that’s not your thing, it’s still worth mentioning that the original score is pretty solid.  I’m normally extremely skeptical of military shooters, but this game is something else entirely and is now considered among my favorite games.  A bit shorter than I would have liked it to be, but still one that I would highly recommend.			"

												Right now, think of the ""BEST"" war movies that you can, just off the top of your head.You probably got ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", maybe even ""Come and See"".It's weird that all the ""fingerquotes"" GOOD war movies are decisively anti-war (which, really, any realistic portrayal of the horrors of war will be seen as ""anti-war"", it's our natural human reaction) - and yet, all of the ""fingerquotes"" GOOD war video games are Michael Bay-level masturbatory murder-fests that run in the completely opposite direction...Spec Ops: The Line is the kind of game I've been waiting for, for a long time.  It is a ""GOOD"" war game in the sense that ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are good war movies.  It uses the video game medium to convey the horrors of war and a soldier's descent into madness in a way no movie ever could.  Admittedly, it's not the best gameplay you'll ever see...And yet this game has challenged every preconception I had about war crimes, and has completely changed my understanding of the difference between ""what is right"" and ""what is necessary"".GETDIS			"

												Pros:- INCREDIBLE story- Immersive environments- Appropriately timed battles- Setting actually feels like a post-apocalyptic Dubai- Interesting political twists- Vibrant graphics and texturesCons:- Controls are meh- Slow start (not in vain, however)- Gameplay is mundaneI enjoyed playing Spec Ops: The Line, but nothing blew me away, except for the story. It took me a while to really understand it, and the significance of the ending was a little bit Bioshock: Infinite-esque, so I'd really suggest paying attention to the cutscenes. The gameplay was pretty average and mundane for a third-person shooter, but the controls were the only nuisance I had. By default, they're unconventional and require some time to get used to. They remind me of the Mass Effect controls, but aren't nearly as polished. For example, sometimes I died from jumping over a box instead of taking cover behind it. Despite these cons, the atypical, dark, and twisting story overshadows its faults. The length of the game on the normal setting is just right. I can't think of any gaps in the plot that would extend the length. Overall, it was a comfortable game to play and I would definitely recommend grabbing it when it goes on sale.			"

tl;dr.If you think this is just another military shooter like CS:GO or Call of Duty, you couldn't be more wrong. You owe it to yourself to read this review and others like it :)full review.People who know me, know that on first blush ""Spec Ops: The Line"" is not my kind of game.  This game sat in my library for a long time collecting dust.  I am not sure what prompted me to load it up and give it a try....but will I be forever grateful that I did.  This has instantly become my Game of the Decade so far.  There are parts of this game that will stick with me for years to come.  To suggest that this is mearly a game would be an injustice; it is a masterpiece.  It is a well-crafted story that took me places I never wanted to go, and will never forget.  Like Oliver Stone's Platoon, it's a powerful story with a strong narrative and superb voice acting that must be experienced to be understood.  To go into any more detail, would be giving away too much. If you don't own this game; buy it.  If you have this game sitting in your library; play it. And tell everyone you know to do the same.PROS+ Strong, unexpected story/narative+ Well thoughtout and beautiful level design+ Killer game soundtrack+ Superb voice acting and compelling characters+ Intelligent and aggressive AI+ Excellent optimization / run it at 1080p 60fps on low-end cards+ Four endings, easily accessible from Chapter Select menu+ One of those games that gets better with a second play-throughMEHS= Solid cover-based shooting mechanicCONS- Tack-on multiplayer feature- Cover and melee mapped to the same buttonPlease hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.  Thanks :D			"

												This game is a more than a common modern military shooter. This is the truly brilliant art, not just a videogame. The art blending into the storyline and force the player to feel it. And it works. After played this. I think I lost faith & humanity. I crossed the line that I've should never do it. It freeze me about a half hour to think what I have done. Am I a horrible person? I don't know what is right. I don't know what is wrong. All things become blur. And its really haunted me than any horror game that I've ever play.			"

I will only review the Singleplayer aspect of the game.My ImpressionOk... I was about to write a negative review for this game - it was a really hard way for me to play through it, but I finally managed to, after completely uninstalling the game twice.Why I, despite that, do recommend this game and why I had so much difficulty getting it done I will tell you soon.SummaryYou might be able to tell from this short overview, otherwise, you just have all the points clearly visible.PositiveMediocreNegative+ Great Message+ Good Story~ quite short+ Cover System- Controls feel unresponsive and messy+ Realistic Damage- too slow recovery time~ I couldn't play properly with keyboard/mouse- aiming with a controller is a pain+ Using the environment, especially sand, to your advantage~ not possible everywhere+ Beautiful Dubai~ not so beautiful textures- Some really bad rendered cutscenes+ Cool and atmospheric music- Quite a few sound bugs+ Characters Evolve+ Choices matter~ or do they?The StoryA three-headed Delta squad led by yourself is sent on a rescue mission to the once beautiful city of Dubai - now a wasteland covered in sand. In this hostile environment you are to find survivors of the 33rd Infantry Battalion who volunteered to evacuate the civilians of the city, afterwards received orders to abandon them and leave but disobeyed and broke contact since.Throughout the game, you will see what happened in the five and a half months and how the order of command in the city turned around.As it is, I think it's not a great story but it is beeing told in a unique way that shows a perspective you are normally not shown by the media. At the end of it, you will be able to emphasize with everybody but yourself - you might hate yourself, you might want to kill yourself (not in real life, mind you, but as the character you are playing) and you will regret everything.The WorldDubai is beautiful - it has always been and even all those sandstorms couldn't take the beauty of the city away.What however takes aways it's beauty are the tributes of war and the things that have long left the definition of 'war' and go into the fields of mutilation and violation. There is quite a lot of detail - many posters and grafiti with different messages - some from the old face of Dubai like expensive cars and then the messages of the survivors, sometimes written in bloody red.The textures are ok for the age of the game I guess and they are not your main focus anyway, they are pretty mushy at places, though.The CharactersThe first man of your squad is 1st Lieutenant, heavy gunner, Alphonso Adams - a really loyal and devoted soldier - at the beginning, that is. However as the story progresses his attitude begins to change... for better?Additionally, there is Sergeant John Lugo - your man with the Eagle Eye and the trusted engineer of the force. He makes it pretty clear what he thinks of the whole mission and the choices you make and his opinion is mostly not in your favor - you can image that this will not become better in the hot wheater of the desert.Last but not least there is yours truly Captain Martin Walker, the character you get to play and make the decisions with, for your team. Decisions you won't like, decisions that are bad and worse - but that's just how decisions are in a war. His mental stability will begin to fade in the heat of battle and you won't know whats true and whats not anymore - whats good and whats bad - who is a friend and who is a foe. It becomes clearer that he suffers from PTSD[en.wikipedia.org] - which is not too unusual in the light of the situation.But wait? I am forgetting John Konrad - Colonel John Konrad, commander of the 33rd Infantry Battalion who intended to help the people of Dubai but damned them instead... or did he?The GameplayIt plays as a third-person shooter with quite a lot of tactical elements.Control your squad: You can order Adams and Lugo to attack certain targets, it is also possible to ask for a distraction in the form of a flashbang. However be mindful that in the case of them going down, you have to get your men back up.Stay in cover: The game has a simple cover system and you definitely have to use it - or die. Thankfully the linear levels are designed with a lot of cover in mind, so you will find something to crouch behind most of the time.Use your environment: Sand... sand everywhere - but why not use it? Shoot windows and glass roofs to unleash a sand avalanche upon the members of The Damned or make your bullets find some explosives positioned near enemy cover.To be or not to be: It's your choice - you make a call to live or let live... or do you? You get to decide between bad and worse, there isn't anything else in a war anyway... is there? Whatever you do, at the end of it, you have to go through with it and live with what you have done. You can keep telling yourself, that your hand was forced and there was no other way but is this what you really think?However, there is a big problem with all this: the movement. I used to play this game with mouse and keyboard, but just couldn't navigate really well from cover to cover like this and soon found a lot of bullets in my belly, so I switched to my XBOX360 controller which made moving easier but aiming all the harder. Therefore, I could only play on the lowest difficulty and still died quite a lot.Enhanced was this problem by the fact, that the damage you take is quite 'realistic', meaning you can endure some 3 shots at most. There is a regeneration system but it takes so much time to recover from just one graze that it makes the firefights feel like walking through instant glue.This resulted in me quitting the game so many times - I could play through it, after all, mind you, but it was no fun at the beginning.The SoundYou will get to enjoy quite nice and atmospheric music while you play - provided by Robert Darden - the Radioman of Dubai. The voice acting is good but not all too good in my opinion, at times it just wasn't matching the situation however at others it perfectly did.But I experienced a lot of sound bugs such as hearing my own steps behind me, noise while inside of a sandstorm - which was not resulting from it and the like. This often hurt the atmosphere and, therefor, decreased immersion.The VerdictAt the end of the day, the game has a great anti-war attitude which is shown directly through the eyes of a high-ranking soldier suffering  and losing himself in what started as a rescue mission and ended as a suicide commando. Nevertheless, it's being held back a lot by the gameplay, which feels poorly ported.If you can live with the problems it has and manage to maneuver your squad safely through the sandy wasteland you are in for good a story.NoteIf you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

												Spec Ops: The Line is not a game. No, I refuse to call it a game. Instead, a more fitting way to label this piece of work would be, 'art'. Plain and simple. Just as the 'Fountain' by Marcel Duchamp was a big slap to the face for the art commmunity on 'What is Art?', Spec Ops: The Line does the same for the Gaming Community on, 'What are Modern Military Shooters?' It takes the Badass, Stone-Cold, Heroic and invulnerable killing machine protaganist typical in your everyday Military Shooter and tears it to pieces with its masterful story.This poigant work will really help making you wonder what it means to be a hero and needs to be played in order to be understood. To be honest, I feel like I ripped off the developers for buying this game when it was on a $6 deal.The less you know, the better the game.________________________________________________________________StoryDubai was hit with a series of sandstorm that ravaged the city and turned it into a Kid's Sandbox basically. Colonel John Konrad, a decorated Officer in the US army and the 33rd 'Damned' Infantry Regiment volunteered to help the evacuated the city. Nothing was heard from them ever since until 6 Months Later when a Distress Signal by Konrad himself reaches out to the world. This is where you come in. You're Captain Walker, leader of a 3 Man Delta Team Operative sent to investigate Dubai for any survivors. (Cliche, Badass 3 Man Special Forces Protaganist trying to get stuff done and take care of business where others failed.)This is about as much as you need to know to understand what's going on.________________________________________________________________Gameplay(AI)Enemy AI seem to be good enough, alway shouting out what their doing and responding to each other in turn. There are 4 types of enemies Regular, Close-Combat, Sniper and Heavy. * = can be armoured, ie more durableRegular* - The Grunts. SMG/Shotgunners/Assault Rifle all day, everyday. Shotgunners tend to charge at you which can be a dangerClose-Combat - Remember that Banzai Soldier from World at War? This is him except that its 1 hit kill, he dodges and insta-kills you with his knife when he gets close (Yes, no QTE)Sniper* - He snipes? Also has shiny red laser sight which you can see since its tagging youHeavy* - Always comes armoured and just like the Bulldozer from Payday 2, his face is his weakspot. There are 2 varieties of the 'Heavy', M249 Saw or AA12. Either way you're boned as they love walking straight up to you... JerksDon't worry about your AI though as they are okay-ish enough to get stuff done though they tend to go suicidal when you issue an attack order. They have no problem in getting kills or distracting enemies and will always shout out enemies of interest during a firefight such as, ""Shotgunner coming from the right!"". Take note that this needs to be heard as battle lines are not subtitled. What can be annoying though is when they take too much damamge, they need to be revived and you have a time limit but you don't have the ability to be revived (On Hard, idk about normal and easy)(Core)The meat of the game comes from being a Cover-Based Third Person Shooter reminiscent to that of games like Gears of War. Basically, you sprint form cover to cover (Using a Toggle Key 'Space') and rely on Regenerating Health. The lower your health, the more bloodied your screen becomes in addition to being Black and White (CoD anyone?). There are 15 weapons in total give or take which felt the same with only the diffference being its 'Alternate Function' key which is 'C'. There are also 3 grenade types, Frag, Sticky and Stun which are pretty self-explanatory. You can carry 2 weapons and all 3 grenade types at once. However, you are only limited to 3 grenades per type making the total number of grenades which can be carried to 9(3 Frags/3 Stickies/3 Stuns). Different from other games is how ammo is obtained here. While there is still the basic, 'pick up ammo from dead body so long as same weapon' concept, what Spec Ops has added to spice it up is that in this game is that you can actually Execute wounded enemies to get ammo for your current weapon type. Because you know.. Executions are fun. Be fast though or they'll bleed out to death(GoW anyone)In a nutshell, it's your run of the mill Third Person Cover based shooter like Gears of War or Future Soldier.. Just like any other games where you're the unstoppable saviour of your country.(Command)As Leader, you have control of 2 Squad Mates who use order via the MMB. They are:Lieutenant AdamsYour Heavy Weapons Specialist carrying the M249 Saw. Order him to attack an enemy so long as their close and he'll do two things. FIrst, he unleashes hell on them with suppressive fire from his weapon. Second, he throws a frag which finds its mark 90% of the time, the 10% due to the enemy running away from itSergeant LugoYour Sniper. Order him to attack an enemy from long range and he'll kill the guy so long as he has vision. Though it takes some time for him to pull the trigger, its usually a 1-shot killAs you can see, the command aspect in this game is very weak but simple enough to make life easy.(Environment)Alongside your Red Explosive Containers, you also have the sand which can either help or hinder you. Firstly, Sand can act as either an alternative form of Explosive Barrels. Secondly, throwing an explosive into a pile of sand would create a sand cloud which effectively stuns all nearby enemies for a nice amount of time, similar to Stun grenades if I'm not mistaken. Later in the game at set stages, you'll come across Sandstorms which does two things. Making you unable to issue orders and increasing weapon spread. Extremely frustrating, especially on harder difficulties (15+ deaths on Hard)Nothing revolutionary here really though I'll admit its interesting in theory.(Misc)Collectables are available in the game and are called Intels. The number of intels available in each level is shown by pressing Escape. It offers backstory to the world of Dubai and its inhabitants. As of the time this review was written, no Steam Trading Cards are available. Checkpoints in this game seem to be fair enough. 1 checkpoint pre and post engagement.________________________________________________________________Music and SoundI like the music. It's nice... very Vietnam War-esque and is also perfectly timed and well-executed. It's either Gung Ho adrenaline fueled action or music that make you muse over your actions.Sound also seems to be quite good though the sound of the AA12 doesn't seem to have too much force behind it. Other than that, the sound can of this game can really make firefights here intense, especially on higher difficulties.________________________________________________________________GraphicsIt looks nice enough if you really care so much about it. It's able to capture the violence and carnage you unleash (Yay carnage and violence cause that's what every military shooter needs right!... right?)________________________________________________________________MutiplayerThere are two types of Multiplayer here.Co-Op2 players, 4 levels. A bit of a challenge when communication between the two is lacking. Can be fun for the first few times though I believe that it will lose its charm as fast as you finish itCompetetive4v4 PvP from what I heard though sadly the cream of this game comes from the SP hence why I never bothered to try it out.________________________________________________________________OverallStory is honestly speaking the saving grace for this game. It's what made it so spectacular as the entire gameplay is bland, rehashed and has been done countless times though it can be argued that the very fact that it copies its gameplay from other Military Games is what makes this so good. This is because of how Spec Ops question our beliefs on said game. Must buy.			"

												Being from a military family, and being a soldier myself, I know what war can do the human mind. Listening to kids wanting to join the military because they ""totally are awesome at COD, which is the same thing"" annoys the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. I've had many of those kids play this game, and *No spoilers* when they reach a certain point in the game they actually get really quite and stop making jokes. This is a wonderful trip into the dark side of war; the side of war we never see, or hear about. They say there are always two sides to every story; well this is the story you never hear about. It's a beautiful mind trip into the (getting deep here yo) personal working's of the human mind, and the effects that war has on it. Very few games have actually made me feel for the consequences of my actions before. That is the sign of a game truly immersing you within itself. A wonderful buy, perhaps a bit generic with the gameplay at times, but the story makes up for it in all ways. You owe it to yourself to play this game.			"

Spec Ops: The Line is influenced by the novella ""Heart of Darkness"" and by the movie ""Apocalypse Now"" The Line is an emotional rollercoaster that makes you question your actions and motives.The Gameplay:Spec Ops: The Line is your typical cover based TPS (Third-Person Shooter). It features your average modern weapons that you can see in other shooters that take place in a modern day setting: Call of Duty, Battlefield etc.There is also the two gun limit like in many other modern shooters: Primary weapon / Secondary weapon.The gameplay itself is not innovative at all. It doesn't add anything new to the genre: Shoot, take cover, shoot, run to the next cover, shoot - repeatYou can assign different tasks to your two squadmates but you don't need to use them THAT much...or you barely use 'em at all. The tasks themselves are quite basic: ""Mark and attack that target"" ""Shoot that thingy over there"" etc.I have to say, though, that the gameplay in The Line is very smooth and the cover mechanics are one of the best i've seen. Sprinting to cover and vaulting over cover is very smooth. The gameplay is good, fast and smooth...very well done. It's just that it doesn't add anything new. The StorySpec Ops: The Line may seem like your average military shooter at first but make no mistake! It is quite the opposite.The game doesn't glorify war. You may play the game for 30-40 minutes and think that it's another one of these ""murika fu'k yeh"" games but it's not. The story will change soon and it keeps coming up with surprises till the very end of the game. I can't say much about the story without giving away spoilers but all you need to know is this: This game has a story that has NEVER been done before in the TPS/FPS genre. When it comes to video gaming then this story is an unique pearl.You have to trust me on this one.Alright, let's break it down, shall we ?Pros:+5 different endings+Very good voice acting+Very well done characters+Epic Story+Nice graphics+Awesome music (Hush by Deep Purple; Rooster by Alice in Chains etc)+Good and smooth gameplay+Can be challenging at times. Especially on the hardest difficulty+FREE Co-op DLCCons:-Gameplay doesn't add anything newGameplay: 7/10 - Very well done but it's the same old formula done a hundred times overStory: 10/10 - It's just perfect!Overall score: 9/10 - A must have!

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Spec Ops: The Line Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Third-Person; Shooter; Story Rich; Action; Psychological My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-14 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWSpec Ops: The Line is a modern-combat, over-the-shoulder shooter set in a post-cataclysmic event themed Dubai.  Unrelenting sandstorms have all but destroyed the city entirely; and the evacuation (aided by the US army) was a failure.  You go in, with your two Delta Squad buddies, to try to assess the situation and rescue any survivors.The combat is solid, if not simple.  You take out enemies in standard over-the-shoulder shooter fashion mostly, with some ability to dish out commands to your squad members.  The atmosphere is top notch, and the visuals can be quite stunning.  The voice acting is solid, but some of the lines are cheesy in trying to be funny.  The controls are good, and the game itself is stable.  The gameplay is fun, but a little limited.  You won’t see very much variety in terms of squad commands, grenades, or guns; and can only have 2 equipped guns at a time—which fits the story but somewhat limits gameplay.  Still if you switch your weapons out here and there, picking them up from fallen foes (which you probably need to, as ammo is scarce) you can get just enough variety.One major strong point for the game is the story.  And not just the story itself, but the way it is told.  The pacing of the story keeps you moving from one combat scene to the next, intrigued with the notion of finding out what comes next.  There are some minor decisions to be made here and there; they don’t have a major effect on the progression of the game—they more so just allow you define the character you play.  The final decisions you make, however, will determine which of several endings you will see.  (You can see all endings by replaying just the last level, no matter the other decisions you made).Another major strong point for the game is the atmosphere.  The setting and general theme of the game are constructed quite well.  It is a bit Hollywood-style sensationalist with the sandstorms completely destroying Dubai; but at the same time it’s pretty awesome because it makes for quite a novel setting for a modern-combat game.  However, it does put a restriction on the variety of locales in the game, but that’s OK.All in all, Spec Ops: The Line is a very well put together, story-driven, third-person shooter experience with a great setting.  Highly recommended for fans of a good story, modern-combat FPS/TPS, and a powerful atmosphere.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												SO:TL is dark. Don't be fooled by the sun reflecting off Dubai's sand dunes, this game pulls no punches in bringing the horrors of war to you.The game plays like a standard 3rd-person cover-based shooter, but all the interesting aspects of the game simply use that as the foundation. You control a small squad as they search for what happened to the American troops that were sent to help evacuate Dubai, and slowly uncover the truth. Its all brought home by some stunning environments and incredible sound design, and the story itself challenges the player to maintain their own humanity when there's none left around them.The campaign is quite short, but I played it through on FUBAR difficulty as I enjoyed the game so much. There are a couple of scenes where the difficulty spikes (the ""Freebird"" scene being the main offender!) but for most of the game it is fairly well paced.There are plenty of twists and lots of clues as to what is going on, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Anyone who enjoys modern shooters owes it to themselves to complete this game at least once.			"

												Spec Ops really is as good as people say it is.  I'm extremely surprised that 2K didn't promote it more, it just popped out of nowhere without much of an explanation.The game is a third-person cover shooter, which I thought was an odd choice given the type of game it is.  That said, it actually works very well.  While I'm not a particular fan of cover shooters, I actually enjoyed it here.  There's a decent variety of military weapons to work with along with several grenades including a sticky grenade which I'm pretty sure isn't real so I'm not sure why they included it.  It's fun to use though.Graphics are decent, nothing special.  It was designed as a console game with no special PC features so I was able to get a constant 60 FPS on a GTX 260 at max settings.The real strength of this game is the story.  It is extremely well written, perhaps one of the best written games I have ever played.  No other military shooter comes even close.  I'm not going to give any spoilers, but it really draws you in and makes you feel part of the story.  It is a lesson to the Call of Dutys and Battlefields how a single player experience should be.There are a few tweaks you should use to fully enjoy the game.  If you want to use keyboard+mouse like I did, you will need to visit the game forum and download an INI decrypter so you can disable the mouse acceleration (it's REALLY bad.)  Flawless Widescreen also has support for this game so you can increase the FOV.  Once you do that, the game handles very well, though the combo controls can be annoying.Pick up this game when you can, you won't regret it.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is probably the hardest game to play. Not so much because of its difficulty but because the theme it presents, the settings.You take control of a 3 man team, capt. Walker, Lugo and Adams are sent into the deep end of Dubai, tasked to find the 33 squad. But the more they go further, the more they realise that the once luxurious city became a living hell, where its every man for himself. There are no heroes,  there are are no good or bad choices you need to make: but to sometimes having to decide between the lesser evil. While many games nowadays tries to dehumanise war, this one pulls no string to show you the consequences of your actions, without trying to do any sort of guilt- tripping.   Even more depressing to think that while this may be just a game, in many countries this is an everyday reality.........The game  breaks the fourth wall at many occasions and among other things  asks one simple question to the player: ""Do you feel like a hero yet?"", which never felt as gutt-wrenching and tear-jerking as it did in this game.

Its very rare that a game has made me feel such a range of emotions. Sadness, Anger, Despair. But this made me feel all the above listed and more. It explores the blatent corrouption and glorifacation of the american millatery. As you fight your way through the streets and rooftops of dubai. You will be faced with numerous decisions wich will tear your moral compass to pieces, Although it may be rather short the beautifuly crafted atmosphere and masterfully written story more than make up for it. So in conclusion buy this mother ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece and then tell everyone you meet in the street to buy it and get them to tell everyone they meet in street to buy itinfinity/10This is the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooter ever made,			"

												I'm going to go ahead and say it: This is the best game ever made.If you were to ask me about this game purely based on genre, I would tell you it's a third person shooter where a yankee comes in a foreign land and shoots people. Sounds boring and overplayed, right? That is the impression I had when I bought this game. What I found, as stated beforehand, is the best game ever made.Sure, Grand Theft Auto V, San Andreas and the Witcher III all have large worlds to explore in and much to do. However, this game is the only one I have played up til now that is perfect. It is absolutely infalible.I've just finished my first playthrough of the game, and let me tell you that this game exposes me and humiliates me simply by giving me a situation where lives hang on the line and the choice on how to act. I have been kept awake by the decisions I have made in this game and what they tell me about myself.The blurb of this game says it's ""designed to question players' morality"".  You're damn ♥♥♥♥ing right it questioned my morality.  This  is what videogames can do that no other kind of entertainment can do: challenge the player. Give him responsibility and tell him to own it. I wasn't able to tell Upham to save Mellish  when he watched on in cowardice as he got stabbed,  so I felt free to trash him in frustration. I wasn't able to be mad at the dealer who shot the litle girl in Pac's ""Dopefiend's Diner"", so I felt absolved from guilt. Spec Ops: The Line put up a ♥♥♥♥ing mirror to my face and said to me you're no better than the rest of us and it was 100% right.To anyone who is reading this: Play this game and come back to this review. Do you feel like a hero yet?  "

												The exploration of PTSD in this re-imagining of Heart of Darkness is where it really shines. The gradual loss of sanity - in Walker, in Dubai, and even in the game interface - is palpable and powerful. On its own, Spec Ops' gameplay is plain, but it's also never bad, and the game uses it masterfully and fluidly to further embed the player in Walker's mindset.			"

												Full Review: Read at your own riskI have to be honest, this game got to me, got inside my head and made me feel things I didn't think a basic, cliché, third person shooter could. There are plenty of games that show you violence, plenty of games have you run through all sorts of firefights and battles that are visually stunning making you feel awesome. You walk away from most firefights in this game feeling many feelings; sadness, guilt, horror and sickness. You start the game as a strapping commander of a small team of Special Forces, the serious ""Captain America"" type and sarcastic joker. You are entering the city of Dubai, struck by devastating dust storms trapping the 33rd and all the civilians they were trying to evacuate and of course, you know the CO of that unit, he was a good man who helped you in a past theater of war. All very, run of the mill story of a canned modern shooter. This is remarkably misleading. As you work your way through the city you find that order has utterly collapsed, you help soldiers under fire from apparent insurgents and as you go farther, you find American soldiers rounding up and gunning down civilians. You are forced to defend yourself when the turn their fire on you. It tears your team up and it is simply the beginning. The game constantly confronts you with choices between one evil or another. No one is the good guy, each side commits atrocities against each other, and if you hope to survive, you have to do the same. There are literally a pair of achievements named ""Damned if you do"" and ""Damned if you don't"". The game drags you through the mud watching soldiers, civilians and even your own team die. Your character's dialogue slowly devolves from in control tactical commands to screaming obscenities at the enemy and eventual hallucinations. This game brings themes from Apocalypse Now and The Heart of Darkness into the gaming world and confronts us with the true horrors of this level of violence. You don't walk away from this game feeling good about playing it, the game even goes meta, insinuating that you caused this violence; you could have shut it down and walked away at any time, why did you keep going? They are questions that demand answers. It is a game I think all gamers should play; it rocks you, makes you feel uneasy and forces you to appreciate the true nature of violence. The gameplay itself is smooth and user friendly. Basic squad commands and different guns give you multiple approaches to different combat scenarios. The gameplay is linear and simply escalated as different guns and enemies are introduced with smarter AI and better fighters, much like most of the Call of Duty franchise, although this game, I enjoyed more. Overall, this game is deeply dark and challenges you to confront its own violence. I believe that anyone who plays shooters should play this game to remind them how horrific true violence is; there is nothing wrong with playing our video games that are violent, we just can't become numb to it and this game keeps us grounded.

												Maybe you came from Call of Duty? What about Battlefield? Perhaps you came from ArmA? It doesn't matter.What does matter is that Spec Ops: The Line is different from all 3.In a good way.A very good way.A ridiculously good way that will make your eyeballs explode (ok maybe not that last part).Truth is its hard to recommend Spec Ops without spoiling anything. So go out and look for yourself. If it doesn't capture your interest, then that's fine. I can't persuade everyone to buy. But if you decide to buy it, then by all means: go ahead. You're in for a wild ride my friend.So pack away those old so-called 'War Simulators' because even though ArmA may be the most realistic, in terms of emotion, this game takes the cake.Welcome to Spec Ops: The Line. Welcome to emotion hell. Welcome to PTSD simulator.Welcome to Dubai.			"

You can change the the story and the ending of the game - after some chapters in the game you will be prompted to choose the action that in the future will change the course of events.Graphic and gameplay: Excellent graphics and physics, great gameplay: destroy the glass ceiling in a building with sand or wall holding the sand and it will kill your enemies. Large selection of weapons (several types of grenades).Multiplayer: I was not able to play multiplayer, because the server was not the players. But I was able to see part of the gameplay in multiplayer: large choice of game modes, choice of class soldier (medic, attack, etc.), the choice of weapons and more.			"

												This game is incredible. It's essentially a dissection and satire of video games themselves under the guise of a spunkgargleweewee dudebro action couch shooter. While playing the game, you see a group of gruff, hardened soldiers (stereotypical of those that you would see in CoD or Battlefield) deal with the harsh realities of combat. The combat and story all seem generic, but you will learn that this is intentional. This game really makes you consider the repercussions of your actions, and it forces you to make difficult choices. Make no mistake, however, there are no 'right' choices here... not even 'good' choices. Only bad choices and worse choices. Sometimes, you aren't even given a choice. People, for lack of understanding most likely, think that this reduces the impact of the results. If you think this way, you are really missing the point. Go into this game with an open mind and no expectations.I pity anyone who fails to realize this game as the masterpiece that it truly is. If video games were treated as serious forms of media like books or movies, it would be called a must-play, like how The Great Gatsby and 1984, for example, are considered some of the must-reads of literature, and Citizen Kane and 2001: A Space Odyssey are considered some of the must-watches of film. This game is on a level of brilliance only shared by the likes of Half-Life 2 and other landmark games, and is criminally underrated. Although it may be short, with me beating it in 5.3 hours on hard mode, it is well worth it. There is probably also some replay value if you want to see how much your choices don't matter. Don't bother with the multiplayer, it's some tacked on garbage that is dead anyway. I actually feel that the inclusion of multiplayer at all is actually satire that wasn't really intended to be played. Anyway, get this game because it is good.			"

												""It takes a strong man to deny what's right in front of him....""I would have never found out about this if it weren't for the multiple posts on Reddit claiming this to be one brilliant game. Do you want a game that leaves you satisfied, happy or fulfilled? Then don't buy this. Spec Ops: The Line will force you into the harsh truth of war.You play as Cpt. Martin Walker, a soldier sent to investigate a distress call alongside Sgt. Lugo and Lt. Adams, only to find out something more terrifying than what any of them expected.The story is set in a fictional Dubai where it is undergoing a state of emergency and destruction. Unlike other war games, the story has a really powerful impact on one's emotional and psychological health. There was honestly one point where I had to stop because it was all too much to handle..... It's one of the best war stories ever told in a videogame.Visuals look amazing, plus I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs and it plays really smooth. It's set in Dubai so expect lots and lots of sand, and repetetive locations. There some areas where the music feels satirical and I love it :) The ambience plays a huge role in story, so I'd say they did a pretty good job in making this game the way they intended it to be.Gameplay is probably their weakest point, it's awkward and sometimes will get you in trouble. Some buttons do multiple commands, depending on where you are and what you do and it makes the gameplay confusing at times. It's definitely not enough to ruin the experience though ^_^ I recommend using a mouse and keyboard primarily because of the aiming. I'd say the game can become brutal at certain points :( I played through this on normal and was killed several times to the point where I almost rage-quitted.Overall Experience: This game was very hard for me to finish because I don't want to keep playing it, not because it's bad but because it forces you to commit atrocities and actually shows you the devastating truth. I don't feel like a hero, I feel like a monster and this game shames you for the acts you've done..... I love this game and I hope I never play it again. I highly recommend that you experience this game at least once (I'm sorry) because it's horribly amazing. "

												This is one of the only AAA games i can think of which actually attempts to say something to the player. I mean in the end it amounts to the ol' ""War is hell"" thing, but when EVERY other shooter game is trying to get you off on the violence and present you as the ultimate badass hero, Spec Ops says not only are you not the hero but you actually made things way worse than they would have been had you not intervened. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.It’s hard to go in depth on what makes the game unique compared to other shooters without spoiling the experience. The story carries the gameplay, unlike a ""normal"" shooter such as COD where the campaign mode is just there to have set piece after set piece. To be fair to COD there were times when it tried to say something. In COD 4 a nuke goes off and the character you played as on that level slowly dies from radiation as you crawl around on the floor. A powerful moment undercut in the next level when you just start as someone else and continue your killing spree.In Spec Ops the situation you find yourselves in just gets progressively worse as you go through sandstorm ravaged Dubai, and you either get tricked into doing things which have a bad effect on the civilians you are there to protect, or you inadvertently kill them trying to fight the enemy.The actual third person gameplay I found enjoyable, a lot of people don’t give the cover mechanics their due respect because the story is so far above the gameplay, but play Binary Domain (another third person cover based shooter) and then play this, Spec Ops is way less clunky than that one.I enjoyed it, when most other games don’t even attempt to say anything meaningful, this game goes all out trying to f*ck with you. I do think it’s slightly overrated, but that’s just because this is the only AAA game to try something different with the story so everyone crowds around it and champions it. That says more about all the other games that toe the line though in my opinion.			"

												This game is a fantastic story inside of a god awful game. If you've read a review of this game, it probably praises the story more than anything else, and rightfully so. Nolan North is his usual fantastic self, and the voice work of Bruce Boxleitner is always top notch. This game explores the psychology of the average military shooter protagonist and flips it on its ear and shows us how truly psychotic these people actually would be. It starts off fairly generic, but becomes something unique and special. Unfortunately, poorly designed gameplay mars the experience. There are bugs that will cause progression events to not trigger. The cover system sometimes doesn't work. Moving out of cover is dangerous because it puts you in to a sprint. Vaulting over cover requires pressing the same button that you use to melee, so you'll occassionally punch at the air above a chest high wall instead of going over it. On and on, I would run in to situations where the basic mechanics wouldn't work. I could forgive all of that if the actual shooting weren't so monotonous and boring.  The most intense fire fights become are pace killing once you realize that your best strategy is to move at a snails pace. Pop out, shoot, wait for health to regen. It's basically modern whackamole. This is a problem that these cover shooters have had for a while now, but the best games find a way to circumvent that inherent flaw. Not in this game. In some cases it takes one second to almost die, and nearly 15 seconds to get all of your health back. So slow progression and unspired game play put together means that the actual game is boring. I honestly just wanted it to end.  If you do buy this, it is the story that will get you to finish it. However, I don't believe story is enough to save a game. Novels exist. I'm judging this purely as a game, and as a game I don't recommend it.			"

I rarely play third person shooters but this is my favorite third person shooter now and has opened me up to the third person games style. well executed. Tells you what war really is and the consequences of war.Grafix are very good, voice acting, top notch.I only played the single player campaign.Since this is on sale today 75% off (on sale for another ~30 hours), definetely pick it up.

												""The truth, Walker, is that you're here because you wanted to feel like something you're not; a hero.""A savage deconstruction of the modern military FPS game, Spec Ops: The Line is one of those games you play for its story and little else. The gameplay is rather bland and isn't really worth talking about because its clear that that is not where the focus of this game lies. No... instead you are here to play a story campaign that digs into some seriously dark and unpleasant material, with particular focus upon wartime collateral damage and PTSD. For those who can't handle gruesome images, be warned that this game has them in abundance.And... that's pretty much all I can say because spoilers. In short,Spec Ops is a game with mediocre shooting, but an excellent narrative that serves as a much-needed criticism of modern war ""America ♥♥♥♥ yeah"" power fantasy games like CoD or Battlefield.Play it.

												This game is truly one you will never forget.There are a couple of aspects about this game, some are generic and familiar (like the gameplay, if you think Gears of War you've pretty much got the picture drawn for you), while others are not generic, like the storyline.We begin with the gameplay, which is actually very simple. A third-person, over-the-shoulder view. In the game you take cover, you shoot blindly or get up from your cover to shoot , and then move to a different cover. If one just goes all-out, you will be dead pretty quick, this game takes a little thinking and a wee bit of patience. Also, since the game is set in a post-cataclysmic Dubai, there is sand everywhere, including on top of buildings that have huge windows. Shoot these windows and watch the tons an tons of sand crush your enemies (even though you don't get the chance to do it that many times).The storyline is the driving force of this game, without it, it's not pleasant to get through some levels (in my opinion). This is one of the few games that will make you feel as if your brain was deep-fried, frozen, then smashed into little shards with a hammer. Seriously, this game is not for those who get shocked easily. It is gruesome, disturbing, and appalling. But at the same time, it has a feeling of serenity, ever so faint.It is an amazing game. Definitely worth the money, go buy it.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. "

												I'd be lying if I said that this game was the best thing since sliced bread. The gunplay is fairly average, the cover system needs a bit more work and the sand mechanic is simply too contextual to be of any interest. However, the game contains what is quite possibly the most profound story I have EVER experienced in a game. This is story that won't just make you question the motives your character has for fighting, it will ask you in quite a lot of different ways ""Why do you enjoy playing these sort of games? Do you enjoy butchering and slaughtering people on screen?"". It is a game that will ask you, the player ""Do you feel like a hero yet?"". Couple this with fantastic environments and you will be in an experience you will NEVER forget. It may not be game of the year, but Spec Ops: The Line might be the most important game of our generation in terms of its story and the questions it asks.The Good+Gripping story+Brilliant post-disaster Dubai setting+Interesting, well-developed characters+The engaging narrative is bold, and flies in the face of its contemporaries+Beautiful locations and fantastic set piece battlesThe Bad-Can be frustrating-The spotty cover system-Sand amounts to being nothing more than an explosive barrel "

												Intense would be a good way to describe this story. Shocking would be another.Although this is an average shooter, fun enough as it is, with a decent cover system, nice weapons, and good level design, including a few jaw dropping sequences, what really sets this game apart is its story. As far as shooters go, I cant think of too many that can rival this one in that regard, and it really elevates this game above most of its peers.It didnt take too long to finish (around 6 hours), and you don't have to replay the entire game to see all four endings, which is nice.this is a game you will definitely keep thinking about long after you finish it, revisiting a lot of the really, really disturbing scenes and decisions that led up to the variations on the ending, all of which have more to do with your characters ability to cope with what he did than the actual gameplay choices you will make throughout.This game is NOT for the overly sensitive. Some of the scenes might legitimately bring some tears out of you, and even if they don't, you wont feel great about them regardless. It's pretty rare that a game can mix action with such an evocative and emotional story.I give this game 9 out of 10, and I feel it is a must own, must play for anybody (but you should also be of age before giving it a go...definitely ""mature"" topic and content due to the intensity and violence.

												I never wanted to hurt anybody...Spec ops the line is something you can seperate from other shooters, not because of the gunplay, but rather the usage of the storyline.Now some choices may render obselete, which I find quite disappointing, considering they are there but do not have any impact whatsoever on the story finale. But where this game truly shines is its storyline, and Walkers journey throughout, where you expect a standard stopping-terrorists-saving-the-world scenario, they present you with a debacle of what you are doing is actually right.The gameplay is standard for TPS games and does not really bring too much new to the scenery and honestly gets quite boring after a while, or at least repetetive, but the game is quite short so you will not be suffering for long if you despise it.In conclusion, buy this game if you want a game with a great plot which seems to both make a great storyline and subtely mock other games in similar genres where everything is seen from a black-white perspective. If you are here for the gameplay exclusively, I would not recommend this.			"

												This game took all my years of desensitization to video game violence and gore, and actually challenged them.  I'll never forget the loading screen ""Do you feel like a hero yet?"".  It took a while, but I feel the main character's attitude and mine had switched by the end of the game.  Being an always evil RPG player, I was quick to slaughter everyone, while the character in game grimaced or reacted.  At the end, he may actually enjoy killing, but your tired of it...damn tired of it.10/10Would go back down the rabbit hole.			"

Posted: August 16, 2014
												This is a cover based regenerating health over-the-shoulder shooter that has you roaming the desert city of Dubai with 2 other soldiers under your command. The game has a lot going for it, gorgeous vistas, licensed music, a villain that blurs the line of who is the villain, story choices, but the real thing Spec Ops: The Line can hang its hat on is the engrossing story. I'm not a story person, but this would make a great movie watching the story unfold. There are brief cut scenes here and there, but nothing that gets in the way of the action. You are even given choices, so there is some interactivity to the story, but the choices don't have any real impact on the story.The story is simple, subtle and deep all at the same time, you are sent in to find what happened to a group of soldiers in the 33rd and you quickly discover in the first 10 minutes they've gone rogue. You're not just fighting inhabitants of Dubai, but US soldiers and other factions that I can't name since spoilers. Dubai itself is in a post-apocalyptic state, because it has been hit by a major sandstorm destroying the city except for pockets of civilians and soldiers. You'll come across both. There are elements where you can use the sand to defeat your enemies, such as destroying glass will send sand oceans burying enemies. There are blinding sandstorms. The game makes good use of the environment and city. You'll be in the sand oceans full of wrecked yachts, on top of towering skyscrapers, inside falling buildings and junkyards, this game has a great variety of areas. Each area is gorgeous, no matter how depressing and shambled they are. When you execute enemies at close range, you'll see the detail on their faces. A lot of detail was put into this game beyond the gorgeous scenery.Since this is a cover based over-the-shoulder shooter, it feels extremely familiar to others especially Uncharted, especially when the main character is voiced by Nolan North who played Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series. Left stick to run, right stick to aim, left trigger to aim, right trigger to fire, left button to throw something, left and right on the D-pad to cycle through your grenades, Y to change weapons (between two, but you can pick up others), X to reload, B to melee, execute downed enemies and leap over cover. Up on the D-pad will let you alt fire weapons, but its mostly forgotten about. The only unique touch to this game is the right button will command your followers. Tap the right button and Lugo will send out a flash bang that on the PC seems virtually useless. I rarely see it even effect people. Holding the right button and aiming at an enemy will have your sniper take out a long range foe, but really when I'm aiming with the right button I can literally just shoot someone myself if I'm aimed at him. On top of that, it seems like commanding your sniper doesn't work on PC when it does on PS3. The final button is of course the all purpose A button that tap it to run, hold it to run and slide to cover, standing next to cover will make you stick to cover, but really this needs a lot of work. I find my character running in and out of cover or sticking to the cover behind me instead of in front of me. It is quite frustrating and results in most of the deaths I had while playing.The enemy AI seems smart enough and they will flank you, just like you can flank them with your squad. The enemies are similar for the most part, but with AI so good, that means every enemy can kill you. They boil down to standard soldiers, snipers, shotgunners that come to you, bladers that will run at you to knife you and heavy soldiers that walk slowly at you and take a lot of bullets to kill. Its a lot like playing the Uncharted series. You and your allies get put into big open areas with a lot of cover and you need to stay there until everyone dies. Your allies feel competent enough and will take out enemies on their own and call out things to warn you.  They will need to be resuscitated if they take too much damage, but that rarely happens and you can command the other one to bring the fallen back to life. Your teammates serve as guides without seeming too overbearing. The voice acting in the game is great and its probably an unseen high point in a game full of amazing highs.For the most part this feels like a fun game with an incredible story, despite frustrating cover and run buttons being the same. I can't say the game is worth $30 and I'm really surprised that its not $20 yet. Get it on sale. Its worth it for the single player.			"

												This might be one of the few shooter games where killing an enemy puts me at unease.You play as Martin Walker, commander of Delta Forces, who is on Dubai trying to evacuate the civilians from sandstorm. The 33rd Divison went there first, but never returned, so it is up to you to continue their task... or not.I mispredicted the game would take the usual cliche ""rescue mission gone awry because someone screwed it up"" - but I was wrong, completely wrong..With its gripping storytelling, the game it delves to the traumas of war, the ambiguousness of war (that war isn't black and white), and. most importantly, how accustomed we are in murdering faceless people as entertainment. The game started with the usual heroic ""we're going to save the day, lads"" pro-war stance shooter games usually have, but as you progress, it turned its head to portray how terrible trying to act as an hero can be.I also like the minor details. In every cutscenes, you're given options how to deal with conflicts presented. E.g., should you rescue the civilians or an agent? Should you shoot the enemy or let them talk first? Should you shoot that guy, this guy, or... abandon order at all?The consequence doesn't have major effect, but it opens up different reaction and dialogues. Even the smallest ones like standing in front of your teammates while they are ziplining. The environment is also rich in details: barricades are destructible, bullet goes through clothes, etc; sometimes giving you different tactics to progress through the levels.The cons of this game - well, the covering system sometimes doesn't really work well. So sometimes it's kinda difficult to move from one cover to another. But mostly it's not really a problem. Also, the game punish you for running and gunning; it's more tactical shooter like, so if you're coming from Call of Duty or the like, you would need to adapt.This game has one of the most intense and gripping story I've played since long; I'd say it's fitting to say this game as a war thriller movie bundled as a third person shooter. The game deserves an award for its mind-blowing narrative.Where war games give you the ultimate feeling of completion, Spec Ops: The Line asked you the grim question, ""do you feel like the hero yet?""

												Walking blind into the thought piercing sand granules of Spec Ops The Line, not knowing or understanding what lies in wait, is akin to drawing near the railing on the roof of the Burj Khalifa and looking out into a haze expecting to clearly see the now obscured majestic definitions of the Dubai landscape below.   Perhaps intentional design, perhaps not and most likely subject to the perceptive cognisance of those lost in the immersive sea of Dubai's blood stained sand.  For when the credits roll and you ponder the rich story inspired* by Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness and influenced by Francis Ford Coppola's iconic Apocalypse Now, Spec Ops The Line is elevated past common war time yarns denoted by the computer game genre.Where the repetitive Gears of War, run, cover and shoot mechanics overrun, thankfully the avant-garde psychical linear narrative blisters continuously, frequently exposing enough underlying ethical wounds to metamorphosize the title from combat to psychological horror.Endowed with multiple endings, I researched for a definitive authoritative source that would define which ending is lore and which ending was designed to be deceptively tangential, thus further encapsulating this deep and vividly imaginative work.Special mention for the soundtrack and the inclusion of Deep Purple and Jimi Hendrix.  Highly recommended.+ Reshade + SweetFX for post processing effects.+ Flawless Widescreen for FOV control.			"

TL;DR: This game is missing the ""Kill Yourself"" button but otherwise plays just fine!Story time:Few of my friends already played this game, I played the demo, so it was on my wishlist for quite some time... so yesterday I bought it. Oh man.I knew this game was gonna be story driven and kinda dark.It firstly appeared as the two guys talked on the staircase, but I was like, ""Hey, the game is just trying to scare me off, pfff!"". Then there was the weird fact that the guy we just saved was more hostile towards us than the man we saved him from, but okay, the game has some character. The postapocalyptic atmosphere was nothing new, I used to read Metro series before going to sleep, I love that!Sure, when we failed to rescue the man AND it meant the civilians were probably going to die and the characters got all emotional over it, it was tougher, but I just thought ""That's the basic 'dark game' stuff"".But then it came.That moment.I already got spoiled that we're going to use white phosphorus to kill some enemies and I was mentally preparing for that. I told to myself ""Hey, I play dark and deep games all the time, just turn off your brain for a while and let's do this"".It was so easy. You were just pressing a button to fire. ""Hey, look, the idiots are so close to each other..."" ... But it started to feel bad when I saw how many of them were there ""Huh, I get why it's so controversial, those will be some huge casualties"".I thought it was over. That the 'look how mature our game is' moment passed and I can get back to saving people.Oh man, was I so wrong. SO WRONG.After all that, you have to walk RIGHT through the battlefield you just bombed with white phosphorus. You see the men dying there... some are trying to reach you and you want to help them, but you're afraid to touch them. ""Oh sh*it, is this one missing a part of his leg... oh wait, so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead here! This is terrible! ... Heads up, standing guy, there's gonna be a firefi-. Forgot I thought that. Forgot I thought that. This is terrible. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible.""Oh good, cutscene, wonder what's-And then you find out that... you killed... all the civilians. With white phosphorus.  All of them are dead. You see a woman with a child. There's still a part of her face left. I wish I didn't noticed that.Oh, and you wanna hear the best part? Really? Yeah, I mean it's really good, because the best part is IT WAS ALL ♥♥♥♥ING POINTLESS.I haven't finished the game yet. I'm not sure if I can do that. I'm afraid to hit the play button. And I feel like I'm not even close to the end....But hey, at least I finally remember what white phosphorus is. Education, I guess...Oh god...			"

												The arrange of this review may seems a little confusing. But the game is ""little confusing"". It's like the movie ""The Usual Suspects"", you can't play the game with the same experience, twice. The players who completed the game knows that. That's why I want to make a spoiler free review. The Spec Ops: The Line is the 10th game of the Spec Ops series. A not very memorable and commercially successful series. That's why the publisher bets on the successful formula of the ""generic third person console shooter"" with exrtas-multiplayer; co-op, achievements. And they received by the developer a ""generic third person shooter""..... or sort of...  The multi-player: There is a multi-player and co-op but it's deserted. No one plays it. The good thing is that there aren't achievements attached to it.  The achievements: Like I said, you will not be forced to play the multi-player just to get all of the achievements. There are only single-player ones. But It's hard to get them, not because the single-player is difficult. The single-player: Like I said, the game is a generic third person console shooter like ""Gears of war"". You command a team of two NPCs, you shoot people and you go from one area to another. Technically the game is good: no bugs or glitches. The control and respond of the NPCs may feels awkward only on the highest difficulty- they can die much more faster and thanks to this it's difficult to them to complete the given orders. But the ""main problem"" is that the developer took this generic formula and put one of, the best military story ever, in it. Not a ""Michael Bay, Top Gun, Call Of Duty"" kind of story. More like ""The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket"" anti-military kind of story. Some people are seeing this game as the newest modern multimedian adaptation of ""Heart of Darkness"", after the film ""Apocalypse Now"". Everything inside the game is design to support the grim story. The design of the enemies- Travis Bickle will try to stab you. The soundtrack resembles many anti-""Vietnam war"" songs- lots of psychedelic distortion rock. Even the loading screens will start to give you ""useful"" information. The game will try to drown you into madness.I can even add that the use of the ""generic"" gameplay formula is adding much more darker (I think unintentional) ironic line into  the satirical part of the story. The story of game is asking questions about the violence in the same generic type of  video games. After finishing this game I doubt that you will have the will to replay it. (I said that, the achievements are hard to get;)  This game is ""underground hit"". It's a very mature story, some will not understand it. This is a ""You must to have it!"" game. The value of this game rises with every year, with every review. This is the end and probably, we will never see another game from the Spec Ops series. Or not as good, as this one. Maybe this game is not a commercially successful but it's definitely a cult classic.			"

												I felt like playing a shooter. So I choose to install this one (from a long list of possibilities).En then you get into it...At first you are walking into a desert (or what used to be Dubai) and you start to shoot some enemies.I'm feeling it...Then sh*t starts hitting the fan real bad and the story starts to get really good...So then I couldn't stop playing, because this is actually a really GREAT story...And to conclude, this might be on of the best story-driven third-person shooters ever made!And now I need to make an appointment with a shrink for PTSD.10/10 would visit shrink again			"

												This was a brilliant game. The graphics were truly amazing. Game play was stellar third person shooter action with plenty of weapons and grenades. One thing that did annoy me was the game persists on telling you the xbox controls even if you are using a keyboard/mouse. I would normally play third person games with a controller but found this to be a lot easier to handle with a mouse. The story on Spec Ops is one of the best I've played. You get a real feel of desperation towards the game and you can really make a difference to the outcome with the choices you make.Highly recommended, what are you waiting for? Go buy it!			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Spec Ops: The Line 

			Views: 3,479		

			Join Senior Reviewer Trent as he covers Spec Ops: The Line. Spec Ops: The Line is a game that is often overlooked but features one of the strongest and most mature narratives out of any game released...		

It would be easy to look at Spec Ops, groan and promptly write it off as another addition to the bloated cabal of modern military shooters, but to do so would be a mistake. What, on the outside, looks like a game about three hardened delta force commandos shooting up brown people in another sandy Middle Eastern hell hole defies outward appearances and proves to be a bit more clever and surprising. Given the fact that the earlier entries in the Spec Ops franchise preoccupied themselves with cut and dry tactical military action you would be forgiven for making such an assertion. The game opens with a bombastic set piece that seems to have been ripped out of Call Of Duty. It looks like a deleted scene from True Lies, with your character manning a mini gun, shredding lesser enemy helicopters between the sky scrappers of Dubai. You shoot through large glass walls at choppers on the opposite sides of buildings, one unfortunate bird smashes into a crane as things are constantly going boom. It's what we have come to expect from this kind of game. The sequence ends and you flash back to the beginning of the sequence of events that led to that point. No surprises so far. You play as Walker, a Delta Force operative (voiced by Nolan North of Uncharted fame) and are accompanied by Adams and Lugo, your trusty wing men, on a mission to rescue the people of Dubai and locate Colonel John Konrad. The narrative is loosely based on Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and it takes a lot of cues from Frances Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, which is also based on Conrad's novella.   The not-so-unusual set up is followed up with some not-so-unusual third person cover based shooting as the game introduces you to Dubai and your squad mates. The shooting mechanics work well enough. You take cover, blind fire, pop out of cover to take precise shots, order squad mates to throw flash bangs and attack. Left to their own devices, Lugo and Adams prove themselves to be competent. They will kill enemies and they generally stay out of your way and make an effort to preserve themselves. It's very refreshing to have AI squad mates that do more than shout, “Reloading!” and “Stay frosty!” every five seconds. In short order, the first wrinkle to otherwise not-so-unusual formula is introduced—environment based attacks. You will find the sandstorm has left mounds of sand heaped behind fragile barriers that can be destroyed in an effort to bury your foes. These environmental advantages are sprinkled throughout the campaign and really brings the setting to life. Engulfing enemies in sand isn't enough to warrant playing any game, but from here Spec Ops only gets more interesting. The second major deviation this game makes is placing you in the middle of moral dilemmas. These sections don't have any lasting effects on the game's narrative but act as a means of reinforcing the game's themes. These are not about playing a “good” soldier or a “bad” soldier but rather having to make a choice you may not want to make. Making these choices strips any pretense of being a bad♥♥♥♥♥hero, they remind you that you can't save the the day all of the time and sometimes you might not be able to save anything at all... One of the most uninspiring and unappealing aspects of modern military shooters is the art direction. I can only wade through so many brown mud huts, gray warehouses made out of tin and steel, and dilapidated villages before I want to gouge my eyes out. In spite of all of the sand, Spec Ops offsets the sandy, sun baked sections with vibrant, colorful interiors. You wade through seas of abandoned cars on highways, blast your way through luxury hotels, crawl out of the apocalyptic center of the city, and bounce across glass filled rooftops. Dubai, as depicted in Spec Ops, is a surreal place. The art style lends itself to the narrative—more specifically the character's mental states. What you see may or may not be real. The characters themselves are detailed and they become more haggard and war torn as the game progresses, animations are altered a bit to reflect the change in characters. There are some visual metaphors sprinkled about if you pay attention (and you should) to the detailed and engaging setting. It's not the technical marvel that the more recent Battlefield games are but the art direction makes this infinitely more interesting to behold. Also the soundtrack deserves special attention. Dubai has also been rigged with speakers and a DJ, known as The Radioman, is broadcasting throughout the city. He sounds like an aging hippie and the music he plays kind of reflects this. Did you ever think you would have a shoot out in a modern military game while Deep Purple's Hush plays in the background? What about Martha and the Vandellas Nowhere to Run? It's fantastic. The juxtaposition of these tunes with the violence of the gun play creates and truly unsettling tone. It seems really obvious that Apocalypse Now was a huge influence on this aspect of the game. There are also some noteworthy ambient, largely guitar-based compositions that sew together the sections of the game that don't have licensed tunes playing in a cohesive manner. The voice acting is also commendable and the writing is very self aware of genre tropes and plays off of them. The whole game centers around critiquing and in some ways defying what you have come to expect from other games in this genre. You won't play anything like it.  What sets Spec Ops back, and is likely to turn off most gamers, is its short length. It is completable in a single sitting and most players will clock in about five to eight hours depending on skill level. The moral dilemmas are not designed to alter the game but rather to set the tone for your play through and experiencing their different outcomes really doesn't extend the game play experience in any meaningful way. Spec Ops was clearly designed as a single player experience and the multiplayer is best ignored altogether. Playing the game in co-op will only further shorten the experience. It's a shame that completing the main single player experience doesn't unlock bite sized missions or episodes from your squad's past. Given that PTSD and war induced stress are huge themes it would have been an appropriate way to add to the game's content without artificially extending the main campaign.  Spec Ops is one of the most mature and interesting games of the year. It is an experience. One unlike any other in terms of the way the game mechanics reinforce the themes and concepts put forth by the narrative. It should be on your radar but don't expect to put dozens of hours into it. In terms of gameplay it's competent rather than exceptional, but where it excels is where other games in its genre need to take a hard look at what they are doing. Games like Spec Ops and Bioshock will be important examples in video game history for integrating gameplay mechanics with narrative themes. This alone makes it worth playing and possibly revisiting in a few years time.			"

												First things first, *NO SPOILERS*. I get this game during the Christmas sale last year, but I never get the chance, or the will, to install and play it. Friends have told me it was a game I have to tried, in which I felt a bit unnerved since I have also hear the 'notorious' reputation this game has. Now that I have installed and played it to the end, I am not sure what to feel.....Spec Ops: The Line is an old game (since I can run it on very high with my potato). On first glance, its main theme centers on shooting, and war. While it is played with 3rd person view, people will group it with other 3rd person view titles, such as Tom Clancy, or the other, more famous AAA titles, like Battlefield and Call of Duty franchises. In general, they have similar game modes i.e. multiplayer, in-game mechanics (although the latter titles are first-person shooters) i.e. vaulting over cover, melee attacks. Nonetheless, I had planned this game to be finished quick, and move on. I was wrong. The game-for some reason-from the moment I start playing it, I can't stop.The only time I stopped, it was to eat dinner, and sleep. Even then, I can't stop thinking about it. D:The game starts in an aerial fight scene, helicopters buzzing around, shooting other helis down using minigun. Sounds familiar? For people who have played other similar themed games, you would know what I mean. Then, the sandstorm comes in. *̶c̶u̶e̶s̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶r̶u̶d̶e̶ ̶-̶ ̶s̶a̶n̶d̶s̶t̶o̶r̶m̶ ̶s̶o̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶m̶e̶m̶e̶s̶ ̶i̶n̶c̶o̶m̶i̶n̶g̶*̶  Then, a crash.Then, the game starts. In a desert, one plays as the main character, Captain Walker. Accompanied by his two subordinates, Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams to Dubai, trying to find Colonel Konrad and the 33rd Batalyon along with survivors. This 'search for survivors' does sound like an over-used plot device utilized by so many game companies, I had consider it to be the most basic 'norm' developers use to start any similar themed games. However, after the first few chapters where I somewhat understands the basic gameplay (cover and shoot, give orders, etc.) I did think that this is similar to Tom Clancy's franchises. However, as the game goes deeper, I start to understand why the game had the reputation which sets itself apart from other titles. The actions; words that the MC, Lugo and Adams used; enemy executions (Yes, there is an option for that); their clothes and wellbeing; the words on screen that appear when you die and restart from the last checkpoint; even the early game backgrounds when the game starts up, REALLY CHANGE as the game goes on. I start to question, what was going on.Then, at one point, one scene was particularly... unsettling. It was one of that 'What did I just do"" moments. Through out the game, I was presented with choices that I have to make in a limited time. However, there are multiple times when one is presented with choices where choosing either of them will lead to bad situations.  In this type of moments, one usually chooses the one which is the lesser evil. Still, how do one knows that the choice IS the lesser evil? At that moment, no one knows. Only later on in the game, one finds out and it is not a pretty one. The later stages in the game are a bit frustrating since I failed and died a few times (which even prompted the 'do you want to lower the difficulty' sign). I have to remap the controls since vaulting over cover and melee attack are mapped originally at the same key, which made it difficult. Ammos are also limited, forcing you to drop and switch weapons to deal with certain situations i.e. snipers, juggernauts. Movements are a bit mechanical (which caused several deaths) but I put it down to my ability since I was not accustomized to the playstyle. I have to give props for the AI enemy who are particularly challenging (even on normal difficulty that I was playing) which will force you to get out of your cover by throwing grenades, flanking you and will kill you when they had the chance i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶m̶i̶d̶s̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶r̶o̶c̶k̶ ̶m̶u̶s̶i̶c̶ ̶b̶l̶a̶r̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶a̶k̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶a̶s̶ ̶b̶u̶l̶l̶e̶t̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶z̶z̶e̶d̶ ̶p̶a̶s̶t̶ ̶b̶y̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶g̶r̶e̶n̶a̶d̶e̶s̶ ̶c̶a̶u̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶ ̶m̶o̶m̶e̶n̶t̶a̶r̶y̶ ̶s̶t̶u̶n̶. AI friendlies are surprisingly useful, helping during tough battle scenes, even though sometimes they went down because they just stand there while the enemy shoots at them. :/Into the 5th or 6th hour, in my mind, I started to think how does this game end? How? Who is Konrad? The earlier chapters I have played is already.... confronting enough. And then I played the last few chapters. Watching everything I hold dear, MC, the other guys, break and fall. Sometimes I don't even know if these guys could've reach this far, considering what they went through. Then, the final chapter, and epilogue came. It was... an emotional rollercoaster. For the first time when I play a game, as the credits roll, I tried to gain some understanding on what had happened up there. For the first time, when I played games of such genre, I feel... mainly upset. However, to call it just upset is not exactly correct.  Of course,  I feel upset that I had played this game, as one starts the game thinking of what was the general norm in such games, and in the end... felt empty inside. There is also a combination of conflicting and mixed feelings of confusion, and relief. Why I put relief? Because, I get the chance to play this game. It was one of those games where you just have to experience it once, without spoilers, and knowing nothing about the game at all. I have been particularly late in playing games that are not popular anymore but people still consider it timeless. It has been the case for a few games I own i.e. Bioshock, Bioshock 2, Bioshock Infinite, and Walking Dead: Season 1. I was glad, I had the chance to try a game that invoked such conflicting emotions and thoughts, even after the game have ended.8.5/10Oh, yeah. I don't feel like a hero anymore.:(			"

												Spec Ops: The Line may seem like a typical military shooter at first, but it isn’t... not at all. Its strongest point, the story, makes up for every flaw that this game has. I won’t give you any other detail about it, with the exception that it is one of the most intense stories I’ve heard from a game and you just have to trust me and play through it. I don’t believe that there is any other game with such an unique plot and, in terms of how good the narrative is, it can be easily placed at the same level with other good story-driven games like The Last of Us and Alan Wake, which I highly recommend if you are interested in intriguing stories. Also, it is filled with lots of action, which makes it a good choice, even if you want to play something just killing some people, but, in my opinion, if you choose to play this game without paying attention to the story, you are simply wasting your time, as probably there are other mindless shooters out there which excel at this category. The cover system is pretty well done, even though your character will sometimes get into the wrong cover, which can instantly lead to your death if you are already being shot, especially on harder difficulties.  The AI of the squad mates sometimes made my enemies' lives easier, by going out of cover in critical situations and dying, which, combined with a hard difficulty, made it impossible for me to get my squad mate revived. Neither of the above is game breaking and, fortunately, these things rarely happen, so I can say that the gameplay itself is well polished. One thing I want to point out is that the enemy AI is pretty challenging, forcing you to take tactical approaches instead of getting out of cover and shooting everyone. Also, I feel that the sand mechanics were not used at their maximum potential and the developer could do much more with the idea.The sound is another aspect of the game where it can be seen that the developer put a lot of effort.  The voice actors did a tremendous job, succeeding in making players easily cope with the characters. Fun fact: every single line of the script was recorded in just one day. You’ll probably think that the actors didn’t manage to do this without getting tired. Firstly, that’s the point: the developers wanted the voice acting to closely follow the game, which, with the help of the actors, they did. Secondly: you are talking about professionals. Should I mention that the main character is voiced by Nolan North, the one who was featured in games like the Uncharted series and The Last of Us? Also, the OST fits the game perfectly, giving you an adrenaline shot every time you find yourself in front of many enemies. (I have to admit that I’m into rock/metal music, but in my opinion, the music you’ll find in the game is best suited for this genre.)The graphics are pretty amazing! Everything takes place in a post-sandstorm Dubai, which was very well represented by the developers. You get the opportunity to see a beautiful sight of the ruins of Dubai from one of its tallest buildings. Also, the great lightning effects and the attention to details makes up for some minor texture loading issues. There isn’t really anything else to complain about the graphics! I didn't experience any FPS drops, graphical artifacts or any other technical problems throughout the whole campaign.I was looking for a game with a good story and I gave this one a chance when I caught it on sale. I have to admit that I don’t regret a single penny I spent on this game and even if I had to pay the full price, I would not complain, because it is one of the few games that sent chills down my spine. So, if you are wondering whether to buy this game or not and it happens to be on sale, do yourself a favor… buy this game. I can assure you that you won’t regret it at all.			"

												We begin the analysis of Spec Ops: The Line from the element characterizing the entire experience, or the environment and - in principle - the story that, while not being able to completely leave out the door certain naivety typical of militarism gaming, It tells something really unusual. The thing is already apparent in the first minutes of the game. Despite the first sequence seems taken directly from the market of ideas badged Tom Clancy, the home screen instead shows an American flag upside down and a hymn US entrusted with the notes of a distorted electric guitar. The thin line of ombraUn'immagine that provides a strange impact, considering the context of a video game from the apparent military realistic tone. On the other hand, as we reported previously, the narrative model taken as inspiration by developers is not exactly trivial, since the Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. A model that is not immediately apparent from the context and from the action of the game (aside direct references such as the name of Colonel Konrad, a sort of mix between the writer's name and that of Kurtz, from the same book), but that plan emerges plan, as covered by sand windy, when we realize that the mission of recovering the Colonel turns into something different and deeper, reflective, like a voyage of discovery and formation within a wild environment that has lost all its landmarks, returning to the primeval chaos. The thin line of ombraUn strange place where the misery of survival lies between jewels and opulent furnishings, the legacy of a rich and hedonistic humanity on which nature has returned to take over, throwing strong man into chaos. Then you realize that crossing the desert ruins (but not empty) is really ""like taking a trip back in time, to the beginning of the world"" and that ""in the warm, thick and heavy"", as in the book of Conrad, ""There is joy in the shine of the sun."" The experiment of Yager, as a shooter in the third person from entering the structure on a substrate rather mainstream narrative has a certain importance and originality, he certainly succeeded.			"

												To save a fellow American soldier or a civilian. To follow orders or go against them. By the end of it all, are you done serving your country?Brief game summary:You play as Captain Martin Walker who is accompanied by a Delta Force team sent to Dubai to rescue civilian survivors. But as you progress through the game, you are faced with betrayal, horror, hallucinations, and a heck load of sand which forces you to make moral decisions. Ultimately, whichever decision you make, you'll have to live with it. As you spiral down the horrors of war, your fellow squad mates will react differently to your chosen paths. Review:This game takes on a perspective where you place yourself in the shoes of a soldier tasked on a rescue mission. Throughout the game, you'll be faced with moral dilemmas, just like the trolly effect, and you will have to choose your own path. I really like the story line (hands down, the best story line I have ever seen) and the combat in it was entertaining enough. You have to use your environment, which is sand, to your advantage. Your 2 squad mates, unlike other game bots, are very effective. You are literally in control of the outcome of the game. #1 PTSD simulator.-Storyline: 11/10 (Hit me right in the feels)-Gameplay: 8.5/10-Combat: 8.5/10-Graphics: 9/10-Sand: infinityEDIT: Finally completed the game and will very likely be playing it again. Storyline again, is beyond phenominal which also made an impact on me while playing--had to take breaks in between because it got really intense after a few unfortunate  events where it made me feel like sh*t. won't spoil it for the unlucky people who haven't played yet. Unlike other war games, this game takes you on a different perspective, you experience the horrors of war, the aftermath of war, the PTSD experience, and most importantly, it forces you to make unspeakable decisions under very stressful circumstances, in which you would have to deal with the consequences of your actions.I can definitely say that if you were Anakin Skywalker, you will probably sit this game out. But you're not Anakin! Sand doesn't scare you! So what are you waiting for? There's a demo for you to try, however it'll probably end before you even get to the good parts. Or even better, you can just get the game during a sale and experience it yourself.In the end, do you choose to save a fellow brother in war? Or do you finish what you were sent to do?			"

Survivors... one too many.Spec Ops: The Line is the latest installment in the until-release relatively obscure Spec Ops series, and on the surface looks, sounds and plays like your incredibly generic Gears of War game, with a hint of tactical shooter. However, it is a very plot heavy game. The game's premise is set around the attempted reconnaissance and rescue of Dubai's remaining citizens, after vicious sandstorms have all but razed the city to the ground.Everything is presented as a generic shooter. Everything. You have achievements and awards, multiplayer, co-op, difficulty selection, and a trio of military grunts fitting the charismatic leader, wisecrack cold sniper and big scary black dude tropes to the letter.Graphically, it is decent. A selection of ""filters"" let you play the game with vibrant and saturated colours, the standard settings or the overused ""real is brown"". Main character textures and models are good, though the facial animations occasionally look odd, and their details clash with the otherwise technically unremarkable world and enemies. That isn't to say a destroyed Dubai isn't something to stop and gawk at - it's a sight to behold no matter where you're from.Voice acting is superb, an essential part of character development. Sound effects are on point. The music is pretty banging when it kicks in.Gameplay, again, is your bog standard cover shooter. Hug that chest high wall like your life depends on it, because more than likely it does. Sandstorms are an occasional gameplay element, which ruin your accuracy and your mobility whilst allegedly doing the same to enemies. They still hit you pretty often. The tactical gameplay extends to ordering your squadmates to focus fire on a single target, which may or may not simply make them run into the open and get themselves incapacitated by the other 200 enemies.Past this point, dissecting the motifs, the game's design and characters, will be marked as a large block of spoilers, so you're free to skip it towards the conclusion.Before gameplay ever happens, Dubai is ravaged by sandstorms, and the United States moves in to organise an evacuation and rescue the survivors. The 33rd Batallion moves in. The initial evacuations turn into a disaster, so they're forced to hunker down and instate a draconian martial law on the remaining survivors, to ration their dwindling supplies. They act as the only law in an otherwise chaotic region. The CIA is tasked with wiping out the 33rd and any survivors, to ensure no hostilities break out between the United States and the Middle East.Months pass. After a lone transmission from the 33rd reaches the US, Delta Force is sent in to investigate, recon and call for support. Very shortly, hostilities engage with the local insurgents, who were likely afraid Delta Force was part of the CIA. They push forth to uncover the truth behind the hostilities and to investigate on their captured American comrades. In no time flat, twisted fate has them now shooting at American forces, the Damned 33rd. Delta Force continue pushing deeper into Dubai to find the truth about Col. Konrad's motives for the 33rd's actions, and to attempt a civilian evacuation. They go past the point of being able to safely leave the city. They're faced with lose-lose decisions. They begin commiting attrocities without intending to. The single most controversial moment in the whole game happens halfway through the campaign, the aftermath of which Delta Force's confidence is visibly shaken as they're ""turned into f-ing killers"". They thought they had no choice otherwise. They, shortly afterwards, unwittingly take part in the CIA's plan to kill off the remaining Dubai citizens by destroying the last remaining water supplies. They become the mockery and scourge of Dubai.Captain Martin Walker, the leader of Delta and the player character, continues putting the blame on Col. Konrad and intends to get revenge on him. The truth is, Delta has already caused more death and destruction than the 33rd under Konrad's leadership, and Walker tries coping with the crushing guilt of his actions by using the 33rd as a scapegoat. He hallucinates Konrad everywhere. The unfolding devastation mirrors his degrading mental state, manifesting through gameplay on more than one occasion. Walker's leadership is questioned by his squadmates, who revolt at his decisions and his plans despite having gone through the same ordeal as he has.The finale is the turning point, the ""Wham Episode"" where all of Walker's actions were meaningless, his pursuit for revenge: pointless. It is up to the player, now, to judge Walker and decide his fate.This is a shooter game that viciously deconstructs the ""America Saves the Day"" mentality; the moral choice system from other games; the heroic, altruistic, ""go the extra mile"" attitude; and the player's gleeful, oblivious enjoyment of the torment caused to (admittedly virtual) soldiers and civilians caught on the battlefield. You can even say the monotonous, uninspired, ""seen-it-a-million-times"" gameplay is done on purpose to detract from any satisfaction. It has a pretty potent anti-war message (despite the developers clarifying that this wasn't their intended statement), but it is especially designed, overall, to make the player question their decisions in other shooter games, why and how they derive enjoyment from inflicting pain and destruction. The player is instead punished as they continue playing the game, both in the form of greater damage done to Dubai, and as literal mockery on the loading screens and even as a subtle part of dialogue.There are plenty of advocates in favour of the game's meaning, theme and execution thereof.. and just as many who oppose it, based on its overly pretentious premise. Its linear story structure works as either replicating the protagonists' despair and lack of real alternatives, or as an act of severe railroading that you get punished for following through. There's also the hypocrisy of playing the exact kind of game that is being heavily deconstructed through the story. While the developers have anticipated the kinds of responses usually garnered from players, it is still odd that a game, which costs money, is asking the player to stop playing it.It is heavily divisive, but what it can be applauded for is having the balls to attempt delivering such a controversial message, when several other games have tried but failed.The story is short, around 5 hours max from start to finish on Normal difficulty. While it is flawed and extremely divisive, Spec Ops: The Line is nonetheless a unique experience and a fresh take on a tired genre. Its message and execution have sparked numerous discussions and essays that analyze its story, motifs, symbolism and so on. It is best you go in as ""blind"" as possible, though - it is a very plot heavy game. And if you do buy it - and I suggest you do, if only for its unique approach to the shooter genre - play only the campaign. You may replay it once or twice to see some previously unseen details, but you can't go back and experience it like it was the first time playing it any other time.Even now, after all you've done, you can still go home. Lucky you. "

												I just finished this game for the first time and i can say without the slightest doubt that i will carry some of the things i saw and did in this game with me forever. Now dont let that discourage you from playing this game, the controls and the gameplay are visceral and deliver a feeling of gritty, disheartening realism that the typical shooter could only hope to achieve. Let it be known this certainly is not a game for everyone, but that doesnt mean you shouldn't try it. So after this rambling i can assure this game is well done the controls are tight enough to not hold you back from continuing and the story is byfar the most gritty and well done i've ever had the pleasure of playing.An assured reccomendation and what is probably going to remain one of my favourite games of all time.

												It was nice to play a shooter game in a modern setting with a story line deeper than ""kill all the brown and Russian people"" / ""spreading muh freedoms"". Yes, there's a big ""shocking twist"" in the middle of the game but the fondest memory that I personally had was dying about a hundred times while getting used to the popamole combat + checkpoints system on the second highest difficulty with Deep Purple - Hush constantly playing in the background in the second chapter.War truly is hell.

												Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! This game was absolutely amazing. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I recommend it to everyone! I received this game through a Humble Bundle, and man, I am not disappointed whatsoever. The gameplay is on point, the story is on point, the characters are on point. You feel like you ARE the main character, Walker. And Walker is voice acted by Nolan North? Hell to the yes. The choices you have to make are brain teasing, rage inducing, and wowza!However, there is only one con, the game is extremely short, I beat it in exactly six hours. For me, that was only two sittings, but I still got very involved into the story. I felt as if I was actually there, suffering from PTSD. I picked all the choices based on what I would do in real life, and I'm not regretting anything. Amazing story! Amazing everything! Buy this immediately if you haven't already.			"

Spec Ops: The LineReleased in 2012, Spec Ops: The Line Follows an elite Delta Force team on a Recon mission to  a post-catastrophe Dubai, after a series of powerful dust storms. Pros:+ Fantastic, Shocking Story.+ Choices to be made in key points of the story.+ 4 Different endings.+ Sand affects the battles in interesting ways.+ Great Graphics. (still looks great)+ Great Art direction. (This, along with the graphics, makes for some awesome environments)+ Nice weapon selection.+ Competent gameplay. (but not very innovative)+ Runs great on my PC, zero performance issues.+ It's constantly on sale and gets very cheap. + Not too many collectiblesCons:- A bit shortThe game at first feel like a standard third person shooter, but as the story progresses, It shows War in a different way, focusing on the horrors of war. It has one of the best, darker stories I've ever seen. A very different look at war from the constant ""America hero, ♥♥♥♥ yeah!"" on games like CoD.I like to reinstall and beat it every once in a while, It's that good. Completely recommended.

												Spec-Ops: The Line is a squad-based third-person shooter, but really this is just a cover-up. The game is actually an experimental arthouse game that tries to challenge conventions of the modern game industry, narrative, and ask the player what they really want from games.Spec Ops: The Line is the 11th game in the Spec-Ops series, but you'd be forgiven for not knowing that, as the series wasn't particularly great and hadn't had a new entry in its series in over 10 years before this game came along. However, Spec-Ops: The Line is more of a stand-alone game, and you need no knowledge of the previous Spec-Ops games to enjoy it.You play as Captain Martin Walker, who comes into the town of Dubai under fictional settings that its been ravaged and left for dead by rampant sand storms and riots in the town. A US team, known as the 33rd, was sent there to help keep things under control. The last the city and the 33rd team were recorded doing was trying to form a caravan to help save the survivors of the city. However, all contact was lost, and the city was declared a no-mans land, with access to the city barred off by the UAE government.Our main character, Walker, comes in with a small team, with the only other members being Lieutenant Alphonse Adams and Staff Sergeant John Lugo. Walker has a personal stake in all of this... The leader of the 33rd, Colonel John Konrad, is a personal hero of his, someone who saved his life on the battlefield. This man changed Walker's life, and is the sort of man Walker inspires to be. So when a communication message from Lugo gets out, he takes on the mission very personally, and is determined to do whatever it takes to save him.Spec-Ops: The Line is a very beautiful game. Countless scenes and imagery are backed by fantastic artistic design, and one sometimes can't help but to just sit-back and appreciate the aesthetics of it all. The characters are well animated, the effects of things like sand and water are impressive, there are some gorgeous overlooks of the city at various points in the game, and visually stimulating environments that range from theaters to malls to aquariums to the natural desert itself.The soundtrack is also very stimulating. The game features a variety of licensed music, ranging from Hush by Deep Purple to Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix. The original soundtrack is also rather interesting, featuring rather ethereal sounds, industrial, and pseudo-rock to home in the tones of each scene. The voicing is handled fantastically, and fits each character rather perfectly.But there is something looming over Spec-Ops: The Line almost the entire time that may turn off a lot of people. The game isn't really all that fun to play. It's serviceable and not badly made, but something about it makes the gameplay never really a fun experience. And as odd as it may sound, I think this is what the developers were going for. There comes a tedium to the combat, a sort of unfeeling to it all. It can be a struggle at times, and there are some moments that are really cool from a visual stand-point and conceptually so, but it still somehow remains unfun.Also as someone who played the whole game on hard difficulty, I recommend you do not. I usually play games on the hardest difficulty available as I find it fun to be challenged, but in the case of Spec-Ops I'd argue it actually actively worked to try and make me enjoy the game less. I wasn't having fun with the harder challenges, it didn't feel satisfying to overcome difficult segments, and it caused me to repeat several segments over-and-over again, and not in a way that it was enjoyable.But I'd still say Spec-Ops is worth experiencing. While the game poses as a third-person shooter, and there is definitely third-person shooter gameplay here, that isn't at the same time really what the game is or is about. Talking about Spec-Ops is difficult, as I believe it is best to go into it without knowing almost anything at all. But at the same time, there is a tedium, a drudgery to pull through in the game.And that arguably is part of the game, and is part of the point of the game and its themes. Spec-Ops has a lot of thought put into it, and is a case where the narrative, atmosphere, and overall experience is much stronger than the gameplay.Here's an odd analogy; This game is essentially to Shooters what Silent Hill is to Survival-Horror or Braid is to platformers. The games are well-made, but gameplay isn't the focus. Other elements take the lead, and the games have rather strong emphasis on its other elements. The gameplay without these other elements is arguably rather lackluster, or kind of tedious. But with the other elements, the games rise from this to become a rather interesting experience in game form. Some may never see the enjoyment of a game that isn't fun to play from a gameplay perspective, but if you can, there is a lot to love in Spec-Ops: The Line.It's depressing, sometimes hard to swallow, and you may not honestly understand everything the first time you play it. However, it is likely to stick with you, and really delves into a sort of symbolic social message on shooters and war, and how the general public see's it. It's not very fun, but Spec-Ops is still an experience worth undertaking.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a much needed breath of fresh air for the ""modern shooter"" genre. The game play is 3rd person, coverage based shooting. Its good, not great....just good. The atmosphere is great in the sense that ammo is scarce and you have to constantly switch between your weapon and the weapons your enemies drop. This creates a fun conflict within the gamer, ""do I hold onto this gun I really like, with very little ammo? Or take the downgrade with more ammo?""Where this game truly excels though is in the arena of story telling. Story telling and character development being two things that seem to escape the vast majority of today's writers of games, TV and movies. The game is a roller coaster of conflict, internal and external. It follows 3 Delta Squad operators as they make decisions (most of which have potentially horrific backlash) most people would be too afraid to make. One of the game's central themes is a subject that we in America seem to shy away from. Shell-Shock, or as the modern ""news"" media has ordered you to call it ""post traumatic stress disorder,"" and the terrifying physical and psychological effects it can have on these young men that our ""leaders"" send half way around the world. You watch as the humanity of these young men is completely burned away as they become hardened killers, despite the desire to just leave and go home. One character for example, goes from a happy go lucky jokester,  to having a near breakdown from the consequences of his, and more importantly YOUR, actions. This may sound difficult for a game to pull off in a believable manner, and that's because it is. Most writers would have dropped the ball on this subject so hard the ball would have fallen right though the crust and mantle of the Earth. But Spec Ops handles this very smoothly and paces his evolution (or devolutions, depends on how you view it) in a way that it feels very organic and genuine. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a well told story about the horrors of war.			"

												READ FIRST: I finished this game originally on a console before but bought It again on Steam because I'm primarily a PC gamer. I finished this game twice to make sure I got the facts and the story straight.INTRODUCTION:Do you feel like a hero yet?, this is tag line that will haunt you all throughout the story of Spec Ops the Line.At first glance this game looks like your average American Action War Hero game much like most modern day military shooters but it's not, its something else.PROS:+ Great story and unexpected plot: -Most games glorifies war and conflict but this game oddly focuses (in a good way) on the horrors of it. It takes unexpected twist that makes you question all the decision's you've made through the game. Gameplay wise (see Cons) you can call it generic, the thing that carries this game however, is the story.+ Graphically pleasing: -Given that most games right now has stunning visuals, this is unique in it's own right, adding small details such as sweat, grime and atmosphere makes into a nice experience.+ Sound : -Very nice voice acting that draws you into the story.+ Healthy Game Time: -Not too long, not too short, it doesn’t overstay it's welcome but long enough to make the price tag reasonable.CONS:- Gameplay: -Aside from the added ""sand"" feature, it's a generic 3rd person cover based shooting game much like Gears of War.- AI (both allies and enemy): -Some parts of the game, your allies act like real Special Forces, but in some parts they act like a clueless kid playing a multiplayer match. The game artificially increases the challenge by enemy numbers and bullet damage, but does nothing to improve the enemy AI's survivability. Would have been nice if they properly used cover and flanking moves (like FEAR 1).Conclusion:GREAT GAME for someone looking for a good story and plot, Spec Ops The Line has that movie ""Apocalypse Now"" feel to it.NOT for people who are looking for a Gung Ho, Rambo, ""look at me I'm the best"" storyline. For that I can recommend something else.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												At first glance it looks like a generic shooter. It starts like a generic shooter. Then it transforms to something... Different. Unique. It kicks you in the balls and doesn't let you get up. The game reminds me Kane & Lynch: Dead Man. Both games are typical third person shooters, withself regenerating health, cover systems and dynamic camera. But their story makes them unique.What is this game about? Basicly it's a adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'. It starts as a story about 3 commando soldiers on a rescue mission in Dubai.Because of misunderstanding and coincidence it turns to something much worse. In my opinion it's a game about war crime, about sacrificing morality or humanity for accomplishing your goals.It shows how easy war can change into total massacre because of small factors.You should play SO:TL and interpret it for yourself.Graphically the game is really OK, mostly because of original location and beautiful map design. What's really important - the game is very detailed. As our characters get deeper and deeper into Dubai conflictthey are changing both physically and mentally. They're getting wounds, their equipment is getting damaged, they speak and act differently. They are even executing the enemies with more aggression and hate. Even the tips showing during the loading screens are becoming cynical. The game itself is criticising your actions, it oftens breaks the 4th wall.The shooting mechanics are good, same as the camera. I didn't have any problems with the technical aspects of the game. What makes the game even better is the soundtrack. It suits every single scene in the game, and makes me want to listen it even after the game. If you've watched 'Apocalypse Now' - you'll feel familliar.Try it. You will get suprised, how this seemingly generic shooter is going to shock you. It's brilliant. It will definetely put your morality on a test. Like no other shooter previously.			"

Dust and bodies lieQuestion rattles in my mindHow evil am I?Outstanding game.Highly recommend this cover shooter. As a shooter in itself, it is competent. You will enjoy the gun play, the hit boxes, the graphical impact. On higher difficulty, the game is challenging but not stupid and incompetent, like Call of Duty series is, at this point.But the meat of the game, the attraction, is not in the shooter itself but in the story it weaves. That story could have been told in any medium and any genre of game and it would still be phenomenal. Don't read about it if you still haven't, just get the game and follow through and enjoy.Once done, try not to overthink it, a lot of critics are all over it already, just feel for yourself the impact it makes.

												May look like your typical Military Shooter but the first 20 min tells you otherwise. Spec Ops: The Line ruthelessly shows you the horrors of war and forces you to make some very difficult decisions along the way. Spec Ops: The Line is a game where you question your humanity as the subject matter turns VERY dark. There's really only two word to describe Spec Ops: The Line: F*cked up.			"

												Games don't affect me.I mean, sometimes you're playing a game, you blow someone's head into a pile of gore, and you sit back and wonder what the hell you're doing. Then you shrug it off and do it a few hundred more times. You beat the game, you do something else, the shock forgotten.I've been there.So I wasn't expecting much from Spec Ops: The Line, a game I'd heard had a deep and moving story and would mess you up. I thought maybe there'd be a lame twist, a heavy-handed moral, and then a shock ending that would leave me nonplussed. Honestly, for the first half of the game, I thought I was right. I felt like everything was progressing naturally, that I would wind up disappointed. I even got sick of the game about halfway through and left for a while.I'm glad I finished it, though. Here's why.Spec Ops drops you into the sandy combat boots of Captain Walker, a man with a gun and a couple of companions. Seems about par for gaming. Two squadmates, one a heavy gunner with explosives and one a long-range specialist. Average.It prods you through a few levels, and I have to say that's one thing Spec Ops never disappointed me in: these levels are great. They're full of color and design variety, and I actually stopped and looked around admiring the view whenever the combat would let up. Which lets me segue into a quick point before I get back to the main one: Spec Ops: The Line is very by-the-numbers, as far as the actual combat mechanics go. Two guns, some grenades, the lightest of squad-command mechanics, a cover system, and waves and waves of enemies to shoot. It never progresses, save for dropping you into a couple on-rails segments, and it's the only real flaw I have with the game.That said, about halfway or so through, I was just about done. I'd shot some people in the head, shot some more people in the head, shot some people I wasn't sure I should be shooting in the head, walked through beautiful landscapes and disgusting squalor and I'd seen some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥I was about done. The game was dragging, and then it led me to a slightly-different segment. I won't go on about it, but I thought it was pretty boring and I guessed what was about to happen. I was right, but I wasn't prepared. It finally shocked me, and my character's expression mirrored my own. I tuned out everything else. I was thoroughly engrossed and a little bit repulsed. I took a break for a while, letting everything sink in, and I set off again on my trail of shooting people in the head.The game funneled me through wave after wave of enemies, punctuated by comments from other characters and general story beats. It was fun, I had the right emotions, I was in the groove. When I got to the final levels, major♥♥♥♥♥♥was going down. I was pumped. Bad things happened. I got to the end. The game threw me for a loop, and I was forced to reflect on a new reality.I faced the last of a few major moral choices.I made my choice.The credits rolled. A song played. I sat back in my chair, stunned.Had all that really just happened? Had a video game just done all that? Not all of it made sense. Not all of it had to. That was the point.Spec Ops: The Line had caused me to think, it had caused me to feel, it had caused me to reflect on my actions in a video game. Had that happened before? Surely. Of course it had. But Spec Ops did it in a unique way, and I want to congratulate it. The writing throughout was top-notch, set the mood, and progressed the story. The characters were fleshed out, deep, and believable.I also give a nod to the soundtrack, with various tracks all ready to pump you up, get you in the mood, and keep you heading forward.Do I recommend Spec Ops: The Line? Yes. It's full of gore, guns, explosions, and buff men. It has you shooting people in the desert, it's got on-rails sequences.Even with all that, it's still unique. It's still full of heart, or soul, or charisma.It's not without flaws, of course. It is, however, worth playing.9/10			"

												Spec Ops the Line At first Spec ops the line is a normal modern first person shooter like Call of Duty and or Battlefield, you play as Captain Martin Walker who has been sent into Dubai some months after a series of horrific sands storms have totalled the city. We hear that the military was involved in evacuating the city but it turned sour for reasons not clear at first. When you start this game it seems like any common garden shooter complete with wise creaking companions and an ‘America is so great’ vibe that constitutes most modern 3rd person FPS. However, over the course of the campaign that vibe melts away to show a truly disturbing story of the horrors of war, PTSD and how even the best of intensions can lead to the worst possible outcomes. I want to call it horror as it does have its fill of really heart wrenching, visually distressing sequences that would classify it as horror FPS. The game play is bog standard and nothing special, it is kind of clever in that respect as it allows the player to focus on the story aspects but it does not excuse it entirely as even games with the best of stories should have great game play to back it up (Dark souls, Undertale and Blood borne to name a few). I cannot really say much more about Spec ops the line. I wish I could, I really wish I could but I don’t want to spoil it for you. If you are prepared to experience a terrific story that is going to make you feel really depressed and shocked at what happens then please pick it up. This game is something special and must be supported.Just as a side note to anyone who picks this up. Watch the main menu.“Feel like a hero yet?” "

												Yager Development has created art. Spec Ops: The Line is a third-person shooter that takes so many unique directions that it is a wonder 2K approved it. The game takes place in Dubai after being destroyed by sandstorms (rather than war) and the city is substantially distinctive from other Middle Eastern locales frequented in military shooters. Dubai is full of giant skyscrapers with beautiful interiors and an insane amount of sand thanks to the sandstorms. The enemy is a welcome change because it is not the typical terrorist cell or communist army. The combat is generic but that is by design – it is meant to lure you into thinking you are playing an average war game. Whether or not that is a poor excuse, Spec Ops: The Line is still fun. The only problem I had was that the difference between weapons felt scarce; I didn’t feel obligated to pick up a new weapon because the starting weapon sufficed and ammo boxes seemed to be around every corner. Of course, what makes this game so notorious is the narrative. I do not want to spoil anything so just take my word for it: it is beyond fantastic. I was impressed with the characters, how they change over the course of the game and how that was reflected in gameplay. Executions become more brutal and the characters angrily yell when confirming a kill rather than the calm “enemy neutralized” you hear in the beginning hours of the game. As for performance it ran well on my PC and I do not recall any specific performance or graphical issues. I did not even bother with multiplayer and neither should you. Even the developers thought it was a “cancerous growth”. If you are looking for a fun military shooter to play with friends – this isn’t for you. Spec Ops: The Line is less of a game and more of an experience.I paid $6 for Spec Ops: The Line during a sale in June 2014.			"

Do You Feel Like a Hero Yet?Dubai was hit by a devastating sandstorm. The 33rd infantry battalion, on their way out of Afghanistan, was volunteered by their leader Colonel John Konrad, to assist the evacuation of the citizens. However, when the storm wall hit Dubai, evacuation became impossible. Months later, they attempted to convoy out of Dubai. However, the evacuation failed horribly, resulting the loss of “too many” soldiers and civilians, and there wasn’t any word about them ever since.Spec Ops: The Line is a third-person shooter set in the modern day post-catastrophe Dubai. It was developed by Yager Development and published by 2K Games in 2012. In-game, you will follow as Captain Martin Walker as he and his team of Delta Force operatives are sent on a reconnaissance mission to Dubai. Their objective was to locate any survivors and radio for evac. When researching about this game, I was surprised that this is the eight title of the Spec Ops series. This is apparently a reboot title, and the last Spec Ops title was released in 2002 for the Sony PlayStation. I bought this game from playfire.com as a promotion for the 34th Golden Joystick Awards in October 2016. It was bundled with two other games, Sid Meier’s Pirates! along with a random game. So essentially, I only paid $0.33 for Spec Ops: The Line.I didn’t know much about this game before playing it. In late October, I played the first few chapters and I thought it was just a generic and bland third-person shooter. However, in late November, I decided to give it another try, and boy I was wrong about the game.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is comparable to other third-person shooters, you can use covers, sprint, pickup items like any other third-person shooters. However, what makes Spec Ops: The Line gameplay stands out is that you can issue orders to your squad. Your squad members can be ordered to focus their fire on a targeted enemy, snipe far away enemies, and even throw flashbang or grenades at the enemy. The AI for your squad members are quite smart, so they won’t get in your way as they can move on their own as you progress, find covers by themselves, and you only need to issue those commands at certain situation. Some weapons have special abilities such as having a grenade launcher attachment, laser sights, scopes, and more that you can toggle depending on your needs. There are three types of grenades, frag grenades, sticky grenades and flashbangs. Sometimes you can eliminate your enemies by using the environment to take the fight at your advantage, such as shooting gas cans or even shooting glass walls to bury your enemies with sand.And speaking of enemies, there are several types of them that you will encounter as you progress. Aside from regular enemies with guns, there are the fast-moving melee specialists, and the heavy armored troopers. The enemy will always try to find a way to flank you, thus you need to be aware of the position of the enemies and stay mobile. Some covers can be destroyed so you must be wary of what you are using as cover. There are also collectibles that you could find throughout the game, and each collectible you find will tell some story elements of the game.The single-player consists of fifteen chapters in Spec Ops: The Line, with 4 different difficulty levels to choose from. It should take you up to 6 hours to finish the game. There’s also a multiplayer mode and a cooperative mode. The multiplayer is class-based, with all sorts of game modes. You can also level up your character and unlock new weapons that you can use in the multiplayer games. You can connect to both cooperative and multiplayer mode via Steamworks and LAN.POSITIVESThere are a lot of things I like about Spec Ops: The Line, one of them is the atmosphere. The city of Dubai looks beautiful with its ruins of tall skyscrapers, combine that with amazing graphics and you will end up with a game that looks breathtaking. The lighting, particle effects, and textures for a game of that time looks amazing. I would consider Spec Ops: The Line as a very optimized game, as I have never encountered any FPS drops and it could run quite nicely on a slower system. The music really fits the atmosphere of the game, and the voice acting is very genuine and believable.The developers put a lot of details into the game, such as when you land a sticky grenade on an enemy, he will immediately run for help to his nearest mate to remove it. Sometimes it ends up with blowing them into chunks together, or the mate would just run and abandon him. Ammunitions are very scarce, so you are forced to use your weapon effectively and switch weapons from time to time. I also like how the main menu changes as the game progress. The enemy AI is fantastic as they will always try to flank you. The level design is excellent in my opinion and the weapon’s special ability also adds more depth to the gameplay.What a lot of people praise about this game is the storyline, which I myself agree. It really escalated from being a cheesy cliché into an intense and unforgettable story. It’s really unlike any other military shooters which glorifies war, instead game focuses on the horrible things that happen in wars. It really makes you think about what is right and what is necessary. The story really impacts the player, and accompanied with a great character development makes Spec Ops: The Line’s story a masterpiece.NEGATIVESOne of the things that I don’t enjoy is the finicky controls. The cover system is quite unreliable sometimes and would often get you killed. Such as the time when an enemy throws a grenade at me, I sprint away, but I ended up latching on the cover behind me and died from the blast. It is also hard when using a sniper rifle or a scoped gun as the mouse acceleration is too fast. The combat gameplay alone is quite lackluster in my opinion.Some people will find the story to be too short, as it only takes 6 hours to complete the game. I tried to play the multiplayer via Steamworks, but there isn’t seem to be anyone playing it. However, all achievements can be obtained from the single-player campaign, so it’s possible to get all of them. There are some minor issues such as lack of Steam Trading Cards which I would prefer for a game like this. I also wish some special units, such as the melee specialist would appear more often as they only appear a few times in the game. SUMMARYTo wrap it up, Spec Ops: The Line is truly a fantastic game. The smart enemy AI and the great level design make up for the lackluster combat, and the finicky controls. The multiplayer is just there, so it’s primarily a single-player game. However, I can honestly say that the story and the visuals are the ones that make this game great for me, as it really hooked me to finish the game. The story was unlike any other war games I’ve ever played, it was very dark and grim and it truly captures the horrors of war. I highly recommend this game.			"

 Spec Ops: The Line This isn't the run of the mill shoot em' up. At first glance this game looks like the average shooter with no meaning what so ever but this is not the case. Spec Ops: The Line is a deep emotional ride through the mind of one man in dire situations. This games story kept me enthralled and entertained at all times. The story takes a few chapters to piece itself together but after a few painless chapters it comes together. Visuals - This game isnt the newest game on the block but there is no lack of beautiful vistas and cut scenes. The characters transition from the begining to end is all envolping in facial features and body language. Nothing short of awe is captured from start to finish in the vast vibrant yet desolate Dubai. I ran the game on ultra with absolutley no hicups.   Gameplay - The line, to me, leaves something to be desired in this department. While the shooting and such serves its purpose it feels somewhat hollow. Now don't get me wrong when it comes down to it there are some scenes where it is down right awesome but i think that comes more from the visuals and story and not so much the game mechanics itself. I found myself missing environmentals and just running through waves of hollowed ""baddies"" to progress the amazing story. If i had to compare the gameplay itself id say its not all to disimilar to Army Of Two (1). Overall this game is overlooked all too often and should be taken seriously for the heavy amazing story that ensues. I give this game a  4.5/5  "

												Spec Ops: The Line is one of the best third-person shooter I played, if you don't like the generic popular shooters out there, you will love this game.The storyline is absolutely great, as well the characters. It begins in a very ordinary way but as you going further it starts to blow your mind.The game design is awesome, beautiful sceneries, great buildings, lots of details and a nice use of the light and the ambient. The sound and voice acting is perfect. The music will give the unique atmosphere of the game and the voices of Walker and his teammates Adam and Lugo reflects the stress of the situations as you progress.The gameplay is pretty good, and the ability to command your team is very useful and nice to use. The cover system could be better, sometimes you will find it hard to do a quick escape especially when the enemies throw grenades in your way.There is a plenty variety of weapons to use and sometimes you can use the ambient to take out the enemies which is always nice.I wasn't expecting this game to be so good, it was a nice surprise and I totally recommend.

												Spec Ops: The Line isn't a perfect game. The multiplayer is essentially a miss, the gunplay is somewhat formulaic, and the controls have a bit of a snag, but it is a great return to the franchise.Were it not for some technical issues and console-related shortcomings, Spec Ops: The Line would be one of the best games for 2012. But, things being as they are, it remains merely a diamond in the rough, destined for wicked crazy status within the following years. Spec Ops: The Line proves that, with a steady vision and soul, a genre so clichéd like military shooters, can not only surprise us pleasantly, but totally overwhelm us. A solid third-person shooter that delivers intense action and a compelling setting, but relies too much on established mechanics, rather than delivering something new. The story however really stands out - a grim and challenging reflection on violence is something you won't find in any typical shooter. Fortunately it's also missing that dull patriotism you've come to expect from today's military action games.It truly deserves applause for the courage to confront us so harshly with our own character, even if our choices sometimes seem forced or useless. Spec Ops: The Line tries new and interesting ground on storytelling, but falls short on the action department. Still, it's worth playing through for the atmosphere and few different endings alone.

												This game. How should I start.You're Walker, a Delta Operator who's sent into Dubai, to find the missing Konrad, and to locate any survivors, then evac.Simple as that, right? Except it's not. At some point things start to go wrong...(I'm not gonna spoil the story)For gameplay, this game is just a typical 3rd person shooter, you get behind cover, aim, shoot, clear a path and move foward. There're not too many guns, attachments are fixed too, like, M4A1 carbine only comes with a detachable silencer.However, there's one thing that's done well: You won't carry lots of ammo, and you can't really recover all the ammo from enemy(as ammo is considered quite rare in Dubai), I like that.But there's something you gotta know: The gameplay isn't the point, the story is.You gotta make choices in this game, difficult choices. The farther you go, the harder the choices are.Also, you think you're hero? Think again.This game makes you think about different stuff, you'd still remember what happened after you finished the game, and think what you've done during the ""mission"".Do you feel like a hero yet?

												This game is a masterpiece. It's one of the best games I've ever played, and it's one of the rare games that I know I'll still be remembering in 10+ years. I've played it when it came out (2012) and I still shiver whenever I read about it or hear the soundtrack.A few things to consider just so you're not disappointed :1) You're buying this for the SP campaign. MP isn't great.2) The campaign is maybe 7 hours long. It's the perfect length for this kind of game.3) Since the game is ""short"", I HIGHLY recommend trying to beat the game in a short period of time. Ideally in 2-3 sessions, unless you're willing to clear it in a single sitting which I'd recommend if you can. The story is intense and can be quite confusing, so waiting weeks between 2 gaming sessions could have a negative impact on your appreciation.4) Don't read anything / watch anything about the story or pretty much anything about this game before playing (even some reviews). Spoilers would ruin it.5) Don't give up on it too early because the first hour or so is average at best.6) Should be obvious but anyway, make sure to play with sound on (music, sound effects, voice acting). It's not a game you want to play while the TV is on or while talking on Skype.7) Pay attention to the little details. Hints : Title screen, voice acting, flow of the game, etc. This is part of why it's a masterpiece in my opinion.8) If you're not great at shooters, don't hesitate to play at an easier difficulty. Seriously you're not playing this for the challenge / gameplay. Some parts near the end can be annoying, and there's no real point in playing this at a difficulty where you'll have to restart often. Just make sure you're comfortable for the ride and enjoy it.			"

												A third person shooter that defines not only for its superior military shooter experience, but also for its gripping story. The whole game is intense, unique and will certainly stand out from other third person shooters of the like. Graphics: 10/10You’ll be greeted with a sand-filled Dubai metropolis and a vast desert environment full of dangerous hazards. The lighting, shadows and the small details is what makes this game stand out in the graphics department. It really wants you to see the small details that would usually go unnoticed, nice touch. Storyline: 10/10It places the player in a situation where a choice must be made whether the player likes it or not. You have come to Dubai for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to locate survivors and radio for Evac. But instead you find this city in the middle of war and the sole purpose of the mission is lost.Sound: 10/10Gunshots, the sandstorms and voices sound very clear. There are almost no distortions in the sound that could be heard. Each and every weapon in the game sound different from one another. The character voices sound deep and clear, which is a positive aspect of this game.Gameplay: 7/10The third person shooter style gameplay is just like any other generic third person shooter, it’s nothing special I’ve seen before. But that’s not to say this is a bad game, of course it’s not. It plays out smooth with no significant frame drops from location to location. The controls, the movement speed and the weapon recoil are all very well implemented. Price: 6/10Coming in at a premium price of £19.99, it is on the expensive side when it comes to the ‘pound per hour’ basis. It’ll only take you around 5-8 hours to finish the game, so it only gets a measly 6 for me. You are better off waiting until this game goes on sale for it to be worth buying.  "

												The game is a repetitive shooter, with linear and boring gameplay. But that doesn't take away from this game being amazing. What makes the game amazing is its story. The massive twist ending as well is a huge pay off for the games boring gameplay. At first the story feels boring and badly written, but once you get a couple of hours in the game, the story goes deeper, especially into the characters. Once you reach the last act of the game, the game seems very confusing, but all is explained with its ending. It's a must have for the story, although if you want to play a game for some gameplay, you might want to skip this one.			"

												Many have dissected, analyzed, and downright devoured Spec Ops: The Line. Many theories have been concocted regarding the game's complex and incredibly disturbing narrative. But only one thing is certain: The Line is the most mature, intelligent, and introspective video game ever created. I would go as far as to call it the first post-modern video game ever made.It is, thus far, the only video game in existence that manages to ask so many questions of the player in such unbelievably subtle and imperceptible ways. It may be the first video game that truly is about something. And not only is it the only video game that truly made me question my perception of reality, it's also the only video game that made me truly question the ending I chose. But did I actually choose at all?Well, whatever Spec Ops: The Line is, it's well worth the price of admittance. The gameplay can be lackluster, at times (it's still very much playable and enjoyable, though), but the profound and compelling story more than makes up for any of its faults.			"

												In a terms of a military conflict...this game is Masterpiesce.Awesome graphics of Unreal Engine portrait a amazing view's of the city filled up with tonns of sand and dunes...crawled with deserters, rouge-soldiers and marauders.Dramatic plot with consequence of choice.This game can really stun people's mind with moral dillema's of what is ""Good"" and what is ""Right"".Gameplay sometimes remind me a Mass Effect 2 at some point.Graphics pretty good.Despite i am not a fan of Reality-type games this one is unique, reminds me some ideas from  ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979, Francis Ford Coppola's). And keep in mind that this game have MULTIPLAYER, but is's NOT WORKING anymore.Also there no co-op in campaign, but it could be really comes handy, cause when you play on ""Fubar"" difficulty 30% of time you will die because of your teammate wont react in time...Worth to play meter - ABSOLUTLEY!!!

												PROS:- Story and overall presentation of the game.- Voice acting.- Cover system (it does not make you invincible, some realism is appreciated.) CONS:- Not ideal console port along with somewhat clunky controls with mouse and keyboard.- Cover system (control wise, often unresponsive.)- Inconsistent and horrible checkpoints later part of the game.- FUBAR difficulty is frustrating not because of the way it is designed, but because of consolitis, random bugs, and allies' glitchy AI.- Tacked-on multiplayer.Final Remarks:Despite having more cons written, story alone makes Spec Ops: The Line interesting and fun compared to other typical shooters. Gameplay is by no means horrible either, just generic. This game is definitely worth a playthrough. . RECOMMENDED . "

												Honestly way better than I expected, it's not too often a game makes me feel like I'm a bad person. From the start it feels very generic which turned me off of it initially but once you delve more into the story it's pretty good. Gameplay wise it's a third person console port so there are the expected bugs with moving around and aiming but nothing that really got in my way aside from not being able to move my mouse much while scoped. Story wise it wasn't what I expected, I figured it'd be just a 3rd person call of duty game but there's a good story in there so don't count it out after the first 30 minutes of hearing your guy scream ""RELOADING"". The setting was another huge plus, I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic environments and I felt this was a damn good one especially with the sandstorms. Though as per usual this game is pretty short with me finishing it in around 6 hours so while I would strongly recommend it I would suggest you don't pay the full price for it.  7.5/10 I don't feel like a hero.

												I was skeptical starting this game, I didn't expect much from it. What I got was an overall impressive gave with a fairly awesome storyline to boot. *No spoilers here*.The combat is pretty intense and seems very fluid, the visuals are quite nice, and the soundtrack is great. I enjoyed nearly every moment of the game as I was playing, and though it was short, it was sweet. There are a few moments that seemed a bit rushed and choppy, but in the larger scale of things, they're minor issues. If you pay close attention while playing, there are subtle surprises throughout the entire game that simply made me want to sit back and appreciate the work that went into creating this game.

												There's probably nothing I can say about this game that hasn't been said already, but since I enjoyed (maybe not the right word) it so much, I'll say it anyway.Spoiler Free-Spec Ops: The Line is more of an experience than a game.  It's something that all gamers, particularly fans of the shooter genre, should pick up at least once.  If you haven't played already, quit reading reviews (it's better to go in blind) and pick it up, on sale if you need more persuasion.  The gameplay may not be great, and downright infuriating at times, but there's a reason for that, too.  Keep that in the back of your mind as you play.  Pay close attention to what's going on around you, how the people act, what they say.  Keep an open mind, and be ready for♥♥♥♥♥♥to go sideways.Spoilers-Wow.  Yager did a fantastic job of creating a game that challenges the norms of the genre, and speaks volumes for video games as an art form.  The gameplay may be frustrating, but it only serves to emphasize the fact that while everything tells you that you/Walker should stop playing/fighting, you continue to push on.  Losing your sanity, the difficulty ramps up, anger builds, the game openly professes its hate for you, and it's not even fun to play - but you keep going.  Why?  What does that say about you?  Is simply reaching the end worth what you'll have to do to get there?  The line between player and character is blurry.  You can justify your actions by saying that it's the only way to move forward, that the game is forcing you to do it, but you - and Walker - always had the choice to turn away, to leave Dubai, to put down the game.  But you keep going.  Notice how some of the transitions fade to black, while others fade to white?  Notice how often you begin a new segment of the game by falling, rappelling, descending?  Even though you were just underground, you're now above it just so you can descend another thousand feet into insanity?  ""Welcome to hell, Walker.""  My hat's off to you, Yager. "

												Wanna know a good argument for games being art? This is one of the pieces you should use.Spec Ops: The Line is like watching the Challenger  explode: It's horrible, people are dying, but you can't look away because you're too awe-stricken to move. Spec Ops has one of the rawest portrayals of war in videogames, and it knows it. Spec Ops is full of symbollism, anti-war sentiments, and morally ambiguous choices that you'll wrack your brain over. The game doesn't shy away from occasional fourth-wall breakage to make fun of modern war games like Call of Duty either, and I can appreciate a game that treats its audience with respect. Multiple endings and consequences for your actions make you want to play through multiple times, assuming you can handle the guilt.The game is also gorgeous; Dubai is full of scenic backdrops, hellish sandstorms, and Crumbling architecture. You'll even get a full HD picture of a gut-wrenching scene involving phosphorus.Spec Ops' only noteworthy flaws are, unfortunately, the gameplay. It actually works fine, and it won't glitch/crash on you. But the third-person cover and shoot mechanics are very simple and plebeian, and as a result the strict shooter sequences are nothing to write home about. Similarly, multiplayer is eh. Again, it works, but definitely not the game's selling point.Spec Ops is not an easy game to play. By the end of it, you WILL hate yourself. You'll rethink why you played it and what could have possibly changed anything, or if it was worth changing at all. You'll feel pain for the characters, and solace in their resolution. And a video game that makes you think like that, as far as I'm concerned, is art.Gentlemen; welcome to Dubai.  "

												One of the best games with a narrative bend to come out in quite some time, the game ends up sitting on a pedestal next to the Walking Dead in terms of sheer story brilliance in the way only a game could pull off.While gameplay wise it ends up just being a passable Gears of War-styled, cover based third person shooter, the story ratchets up big-time at the end of the first act, proving to be the main pull of the game.Ignore the multiplayer, enjoy the single player (raise the difficulty if you want a real challenge, naturally), and you might find yourself blown away, even if you think you've seen every modern shooter so far.

												Best way to put it into a TL;DR is by stating that this is like Rainbow Six type of gameplay mixed with a story that was the sole reason I played this game through and enjoyed it for it's uncensored gruesome nature. War isn't rosy, nor is it cozy. It's crazy. And this game displays exactly that very, very well. You can behead people with sniper rifle, pop their heads off with a shotgun and turn them into bloody giblets with explosives.But that's not the reason you play this game, no. The gameplay is very mediocre 6-7/10 as one would rate it. It's the story that keeps you wanting to play and find out what happens next more than anything. The characters are all well crafted into believable and realistic feeling experience as you play the game and advance within the story. The witty comments, yelling in combat and the terror is all well displayed and feels authentic. The soldiers you fight against yell orders loud and clear, just like you would in combat to relay the info. The game just feels right atmosphere wise. If you're looking for a game that displays how f*cked up a war can be when there's no clear answers, and how it can affect your morale and choice making, and how ruthless some things you must decide on can make you feel like a complete d*ck for doing so. This game extremely well relays the weight of your choices, if you f*ck up, you will feel and see what it will cause.A must buy to people who want to experience something different, and enjoy a really well made story.

												Spec Ops: The Line presents a really interesting idea, but fails to execute it in a believable way.I can't understand the praise this game gets. I appreciate what this game is trying to do by tackling the stress and horrors of war, a subject most games skim over, but it fails to tackle the subject in and engaging way and only supported by mediocre gameplay.To its merit, this game does have some good Call Of Duty action movie style set pieces, a great, but sparingly used soundtrack, a couple of really good characters, and good voice acting to go with them. The game is about 5 hours long, which is a little on the short side to me.However...The third person cover based game play works, but really has nothing that makes it particularly exciting or even interesting. The opponents AI is predictable and tends to only charge the player, which seems strange since they are meant to be a professional military. Many of the guns feel very similar to use, and the game is rather easy if you stick to cover (although I only played on medium difficulty). There is a lot of big action sequences in this game that while really cool, are not very realistic. I think that perhaps a different approach to gameplay could have helped convey the story better.I was recommended this game because of its story, but I found this to be its biggest let down. The story just isn't believable and player character is annoying.I'll try to avoid spoilers.Spec Ops is advertised as a game that will ""challenge players' morality by putting them in the middle of unspeakable situations,"" however this never really happens, because in these 'unspeakable situations' you have no choice at all. Failure to perform whatever horrible action will cause the mission to fail, and you must load a checkpoint. I think this idea would me much better executed if instead the player was forced to choose between two bad options, rather than being simply forced to do something or the mission fails.The player characters scripted decisions further detract from the believability of the story with him very quickly disregarding his original mission, and instead deciding to try and fix everything himself. His two companions realise that he is making bad decisions and comment on it, but for some reason never actually do anything about it and just follow along.However there are some pretty cool action movie bad guys in this game, however their placement is what is meant to be a realistic war just makes the story less believable.Perhaps I just don't see what everyone else does, but this game just didn't do it for me.Spec Ops: The Line isn't a bad game, it's just not anything special. If shooters are really your then, then you might want to pick this one up when it's on sale, but if you're looking for a deep and harrowing story then you had best look elsewhere.			"

												So Spec Ops: The Line was different.If you look for a game with a ton of enemies to demolish this may be your game, but you might get caught up in the story like I did. It's so well paced, well set and excellently unfolds itself. This game is on another level, although it contains a pretty brutal theme to it to deliver it's message. I'm not going to spoil anything but I'll finish off with sentence for this Spec Ops: The Line: ""The creator is superior to his creation, monsters are inferior to humans.""			"

												I started playing this game with fairly high expectations and I must say I was not dissapointed. Even though the game is fairly linear - with little decision making in terms of the events unfolding - it still instills a sense of freedom as to how you choose to go about it.The game is clearly trying to grapple with the moral choices during times of war and battle, survival and necessities and in many ways it succeeds quite well.The setting and graphics are both very nice, while the locations are well thought out and quite detailed. The story (while nothing to jump out of your clothes for) drives you forward quite well, more than anything because it succeeds in instilling the feeling that you have to move on, that there is no choice but to move on...There isnt extraordinary variety in the weapons and most dont feel much diferent between them, but the momentum of the game doesnt really allow you to think about it much. You mostly grab whatever weapon you have some ammo for.I played it at the hard settings, which in some situations challenged me, but was overall an enjoyable experience (I believe normal dificulty might be a bit too easy).Finally there are a few points in the game where your (moral) decisions affect [if only partially] how the game unfolds.All in all it is a very nice story driven third person shooter, full of intense moments of combat. Not sure if there is a lot of replayability, unless you are after all the achievements, but I can see myself going back and playing it all over again.			"

												We should play for the captain Martin Walker (sounds him, by the way, known Nolan Nors on Uncharted) in which submission there are two fighters: sniper and machine gunner. They can give the elementary teams (two): to throw blinding grenade and to kill the marked enemy. This ""tactical"" element, by the way, strongly facilitates passing - kill in Spec Ops: The Line quickly at any level of complexity, and to stick out once again under bullets - business rotten.The game mechanics of The Line is familiar to all who saw at least one shooter from the third party, let out for the last five years. These are the same hide-and-seek behind obstacles, firing from round the corner, dashes from shelter to shelter and recovery of health in a secluded place. Here game less all tries to be original, and it is good: the management scheme extremely simple and clear, malfunctions nothing and everything works as it is necessary.

												There's no glorification in war. A conflict of ethics and code of conduct. What's the importance between one's conscious and one's choice just to survive. Spec Ops: The Line define such philosophies. The game's narrative is one of the most memorable in video game history as modern first-person shooters are too mainstream and cliche. There are certain scenes in the game that might or will make you pause, reflect, or even quit the game just to remind yourself on what war is. However, Spec Ops: The Line is NOT an anti-war game. It just tell what war is like. Many people and gamers can compare this game to Apocalypse Now. Sure, that's comparable but the game can be interpret to many literatures and certain documentaries like Waltz of Bashir. The gameplay is decent and typical but I believe that the developers strongly focused a lot more on the story and its message rather than gameplay. Spec Ops: The Line is a memorable game, but its more of the ""one-time play"" game mainly because of its heavy subject matter. Would I recommend this game to others? Yes, but it is up to you if you can handle the game's content. Best purchase this game on a steep discount.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a third-person tactical shooter that does an excellent job of portraying the grim reality of war in a unique setting that seamlessly mixes desert and concrete jungle. One minute you are fighting through a sandstorm, the next you are hundreds of feet in the air, dangling from a zip line with a surreal backdrop of a dead city behind you. The visuals are simply breathtaking, and the desert is as much a character as the people in this superb, if disturbing, narrative. The gunplay is very enjoyable, but the experience is somewhat marred on the highest difficulty level because squad-mates are way too eager to charge without orders and get themselves killed, making it a chore to babysit them, and some areas much harder than they should be. The cover system itself is a bit cumbersome as well, and multiplayer is dead, but these are easy to overlook because the campaign is simply fantastic. Welcome to Dubai!			"

The amout of multiplayer is very little and it's hard to find a match. It also may be a regional match making system which only connects you to the player around and near your countryThe plots and story? Play it and find it out yourself, trust me, you won't regret buying this, on sale.			"

												A horrifling look into war like no other. The story intense the acting and voice overs great.The site Dubui is stunning with beatiful scences landscapes and colors. Starts out with  Captain Walker and his squad as they filter thru Dubui looking for survivers and try to find out what happened and and why are they there.What they do find is tragedy and horror that reminds us they are no winners in war.Even when following orders they are always losers and the innocent always suffer in the end. Decisions have to be made and not all good. You will be shocked and appaled with many of the death scences and yes this  really happens and it goes on all over the world. Take it for what you will most my screen shots where of the sites and and not the actual fighting for a reason .Some will find  many cutscenes offensive.			"

												This is a game that, the moment I completed it, I sat down to write a review. I was conflicted about the storyline and content, as it's a game that it's nearly possible to complete in good conscience. Spec Ops : The Line is a common 3rd person military shooter in a lot of ways, save one : Its narrative. Some will find this game to be overly preachy, but having completed the campaign I think I know what the developers were going for. Military games of the last few years have shown players a lot of things. New graphics, firearms, and storylines that encompass many historical geopolitical campaigns. Spec Ops intends to show players something they've never been forced to confront. Themselves. In many ways, it's incredibly difficult to put a rating on this game as it's mediocre gameplay is carried by the narrative and (more importantly) the narrative's intent. It's also difficult to avoid spoiling as this is a game you will only experience the first time once. (duh) But the first time will be a troubling journey. During this game you will do horrific things simply because the objectives say so. The developers prod at you by saying ""Just because the objectives dictate you should, doesn't mean you have to. You could simply turn the game off."" In this way, Spec Ops is more of a mirror than anything. It puts a storyline in place which makes you angry, frustrated, and saddened by what transpires. It then steps back and allows you your chance at revenge. Sure, you're railroaded from a gameplay standpoint but as the Colonel says near the middle of the story, ""This could have all been avoided if you just stopped."" He's right. I could have stopped at any point. Spec Ops features imagery that is horrifying; war crimes are committed and witnessed in plenty. Yet you keep playing simply to make it all justified, to somehow convince yourself that the ends will justify the means and that everything will come out ok. It's not your fault. You were forced. In the end Spec Ops : The Line was the first game I've ever completed that I didn't feel happy about finishing.  Not because the gameplay was bad, but simply because no one with a conscience can finish this game without feeling dirty. I should have stopped somewhere in the middle of the game, and said, ""Nope, this objective has gone too far. ♥♥♥♥ this game."" But I didn't. My impressions of this game are almost the same as though I were reviewing A Clockwork Orange or Inglorious Basterds. You're not supposed to feel comfortable while you watch. Spec Ops is a bit different though, as you're in control of the ""ultra violence"" that's taking place. Maybe it's because I grew up in a violent neighborhood, where actions were always justified by their ends that this game hit me so deeply, maybe I'm just soft. In any case, if you've been on the fence about Spec Ops I'd strongly recommend a purchase based solely on its interperative value as it stands apart simply by having something to say about combat and war. I've been scratching my head about the ending all evening. 9/10			"

												Graphics: 8Sound: 9Gameplay: 8Good Points-Good character graphics-The combat & action are really good. Dying is part of the game, even on normal but that gives it a thrilling experiencing where you really got to fight for your life.-Full of action.-An ending I did not expect at all.Bad Points-You can only take two weapons with you. I think having 3 weapons at least is a must.-Environments can have ugly graphics.-Game is short. Finished the main campagne in 4.5 hoursOverall, is this game worth playing?Yes it surely is. It is not the same as other war games. It's a game that leaves you thinking. I would surely recommend this game to every one who likes action games or who like a game that touches you.Is it worth buying right now?This is a though one... I would say yes cause it is such a good game but when I look to the price tagg (20€) then I also think about the fact that I finished the game in 4.5 hours... If you do not like multiplayer or co-op there is nothing much to do after you completed the game. And from what I hear and see MP and Co-Op are dead... You should have played this game but since it is such a short game I would wait untill the price drops. Do not get me wrong it is a very good game and many people will say that it is worth 20€. Let me say it this way: If the campaign would have taken at least 8-9 hours to complete it I would say Yes buy it right now! But it is not like that and thats a shame cause it is really a good game. Damn I really would like to say to hell with it, buy the game right now! But I can't.			"

												Spec Ops is a third-person shooter with a run-and-cover mechanic.While there is nothing new about this, I couldn't help but love this game, because this is so much more than your average TPS. It's also really, really well optimized.The gameplay is nicely done, and you handle it pretty fast, being immersed into the universe and the action really quickly. But what really makes it a unique game, is its story.In this game, you are not just an almighty stereotypical soldier, you are also just a man, with his weaknesses.The story features some choices; and while you're playing, I'd like you to think twice about everything that happens. Is everything justified? Can anything be justified at all?I won't spoil the story for you, but this game is much more than an action game. The scenario reminded me a bit of Shutter Island, and this is a good thing.TL;DR - If you want a game with a lot of action, this is for you. But if you also want an interesting and deep enough storyline, by all means, PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												Spec Ops the Line at first seems quite carelessly executed FPS, a match for last Medal of Honor. But it is only an envelope which brings you emotionally affluent, strong message. Message about soldiers, war exhaustion and very basic one - about role of destruction in our system of values.For a gameplay Yager offers you a railroad shooter with a bit of squad support. If you seek a glorious, challenging gunplay - look the other way, that's not about Spec Ops the Line. For some reason, the most of the action feels like you were shell-shocked from the start of the game. Shooting part not really engaging. Two big notes about AI: 1) your companions are not that bad, as you can expect, playing in games like Bureau: XCom Declassified or Battlefield3. They scoring kills, and it feels like in normal difficulty setting they can bend opposers almost without your support. If only they were not rushing forward before it's clear sometimes, I'd say they are a perfect team.2) Quite opposite, behavior of your enemies usually is quite weak from the point of battle effectiveness. Even in the hardest difficulty setting where they shoot very precisely, and you dying alot being both outnumbered and outgunned... Still they a prey, and you are the hunter. You mow them, in dozens and hundreds.Being quite a mundane FPS, Spec Ops the Line offers a rather spanning visual experience, though. Sights of Dubai, all those sand and weather features are gorgeous. Impression when you destroying something to let another portion of sand, symbolizing chaos, gets even more space over a once-a-great-city... Can't buy it with mastercard, obviously.And music! Music part is fabulous. Maybe the best part of whole game.Overall, an artwork, audio and visual feast, all of this combined - is what keeping your interest, where the rush for gunplay challenge leaving you.But again, all of that - gunplay, visuals and one of a kind soundtrack - still just a cover for story with guaranteed catharsis in the end. For that Spec Ops the Line is taking such inordinanar reviews, like ""take a PTSD in 6 hours. 10/10!"" That game Will Be Remembered.Story what starts like ""Only the dead have seen the end of war"", and goes with ""I destroy therefore I endure"". What we observe as happening with the protagonist, Erich Fromm called ""splendid isolation"". This philosopher was describing destructiveness as a defence mechanism to preserve a human integrity, which is offended by some unexpected trials. That mechanism is never working like you think it should. See the game for it.Overall mark 7.5/10 killed Americans			"

												Spec Ops The Line is a game I find it difficulty to accurately explain. On the surface, it's just another below average third person cover based shooter with nothing to set it apart from the hundreds of similar games on the market these days. Once you dig in a little, once you look at what is beneath you find a game that pushes the boundaries of video game narrative and tells you to look inward and feel a little ashamed.It would be hard to call Spec Ops The Line a fun game, because it isn't, the generic shooter mechanics grow old after about 2 hours. But it's not a game that's trying to entertain you. It's a game that wants you to feel bad, to get angry, to get sad. It's a game that talks to you, as a gamer, and just to the protagonist you play as.As you start off the game it is the classic scenario, something has gone terribly wrong in a middle eastern country and you are in command of a small special forces team that has to go in there and see what's happening. The specifics, Dubai has been encompassed by a gigantic sandstorm that pretty much ate the entire city and it's population, a US battalion disobeyed orders and went there trying to evacuate the civilians but haven't been heard from since.As you go through the opening motions the game fills you with the classic stereotypes, you and your team makes crude jokes as they walk past bodies of those that didn't make it out in time and quickly enough you run into a bunch of locals with guns and find yourself shooting your way downtown. With a great degree of subtlety however the game quickly changes as things get progressively darker and more grim without you being able to pinpoint exactly where things went off the rails.Spec Ops The Line is a game I would recommend that everyone plays, even if just to see how a video game narrative can potentially evolve. I doubt Spec Ops The Line will become that great of a success story. I even doubt it will have that much of an impact on how games are made. But it is still a very important game because it does something that you have never experienced before and that is rarity these days.			"

""Do you feel like a hero yet?""That's the line you will always have in your mind during the game. Just this line.""Spec Ops: The Line"" is the most brutal and shocking game I have played. It gets you to a point where you don't want to continue, but you continue, because you are a Soldier. A soldier who keeps fighting, no matter what.This game makes you think about war in a new way, because it approches the subject in a way I haven't seen in any shooter I played. It doesn't glorify it, there are no heros, no winners. Only people who are defeated and broken. Civilian? Soldier? In the end it doesn't matter, just another soul that died or survived.It has one of the best stories I have ever played, because it makes you think alot..For everybody who wants to play it. Keep your eyes open in the Epilogue. You can make a huge discovery.			"

												I would definitely pick this game up because it is a masterpiece and the best game I have ever played. It’s a small reminder that choices aren't always black and white. Sometimes you think you make the right call only to find out it was the worst case scenario. Spec Ops: The Line has very standard gameplay mostly a generic third person shooter but that’s not why you’re there, you’re there for the story and it is by far the greatest story in a game I’ve played. Even to this day scenes of the game are still so vivid in my head and it shows how real warfare is opposed to Call of Duty and Battlefield. In conclusion it’s the best shooter I’ve ever played even though it’s combat is box standard.10/10 Would get emotionally scarred again			"

												Read many reviews and i think i was expecting a bit much before starting the game. It was a bit slow from the beginning as I waited for the hyped morale choices and desert sandstorm environment to deliver. This game was not packed full of morale choices with quick action decisions. thier was a few. their was also a couple of sand storm scenes. Both of these have been way overblown. Almost gave up on this in the first hour as it seemed ,just another shooter with some age old gears of war cover mechanics. Kept playing and have to say it got much better as far as shooters go. the story was really good and although it seemed you and your two companions were all indestructable Rambo's. You were glad for it as the game made me like the  characters, and I didn't want them to die*not to say they do or don't, i wont give that away. There are some really good fights in some nice area's. the environment changed enough to keep it fresh enough without leaving the desert city atmosphere. I would say, to play it a difficulty level above your comfort zone as while i had to replay some parts many times to survive,many more semed to easy. If you fail to much it gives the option to lower difficulty in game. Overall - everything was good to great. I had fun playing it. However if your looking for anything more then a well done shooter with a nice story objective, you might be disappointed. Their is no heavy load of morale decisions that stay with you. They also could have done more with the sand storm idea. both were weak and easily forgotten.  Good Game			"

												It's hard to comment on this game without spoilers, but I'm trying my best to avoid them. Also note that I didn't try the multiplayer and I'm only going to comment on the single player campaign.The game presents a well-crafted story that starts out as a mission to scout the city of Dubai as it suffers from the destruction caused by a gigantic sand storm. Civilians are trapped inside mile high dunes of sands after the military lost contact to a former evacuation squad and they send Martin Walker and two companions to investigate after they received a distress signal. The deeper the squad dives into the city, the more gruesome events get. You witness atrocities done by American soldiers who lost track of their goal as the horrible story of the fallen Dubai unfolds with your discoveries and the game doesn't hesitate to shock you when it wants you to see what terrifying things people can do in a struggle for survival. (if you don't have a thick skin, you might want to plan to take breaks)If it weren't for the story, the game would be forgettable, and that is the biggest danger if you don't know it yet - those who don't know what to expect will easily lose interest. The shooting itself plays well enough to work - there's cover-based shooting with various real-life weapons, there are melee attacks and finishers, a small selection of squad commands, you can sometimes destroy terrain to take out clusters of foes with sand dunes. There's not much traditional gameplay evolution, except that the selection of weapons grows as some weapons only appear later in the game.If you ONLY come for the shooting, you will most likely be disappointed or even confused through the first couple of chapters. If you want to give this game a fair chance, keep on playing until the end of Chapter 8 at least. If you get there and still only come for the shooting, but want to give the game a chance nevertheless, start over again and pay close attention to the dialog and try to think about the twists that happen in the beginning of the game, which are admittedly a little hard to follow the first time around.A word about the length of the game: The play time is rather short (I beat the game in 6 hours on easiest difficulty.. there is a reason you don't want to turn up the difficulty in the late game, which I leave up to you to find out), but if you get into it, it probably won't let you go for a while, especially since many discussions on the internet send you away with spoiler warnings right away. Once you've played through the game and see the revelations, you will want to play it again to see things in a different light. If you find yourself in an obsession about the meaning of the game, a good reading after you finish it is ""Killing is Harmless"" by Brendan Keogh. It's an affordable eBook that expands on a lot of details that you will easily miss on a casual playthrough. It links a good amount of articles on the internet, some of which include stances by the developers and lead writer. My Steam profile says I've played this game for only 16 hours, but I spent well over 30 hours reading up and watching on YouTube on what others thought about it.Spec Ops: The Line deserves more attention for the sheer courage the developer showed for demonstrating such a cruelly honest truth through a video game, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone who likes unconventional games. It makes you think about the nature of good and evil and takes a harsh stance on recent topics like Western military interventionism and the cruelty of modern warfare. It made me think for long, and it pulled something off that is impossible to do with a book or a movie. I want more people to play this game, because it deserves to be talked about, but can't be talked about unless you've given it at least one complete playthrough.			"

												I normally avoid first person shooters, which sadly is what I thought Spec Ops was when I picked it up in a bundle off of the glowing praise it’s story has reviewed. In reality, it is a cover based third person shooter. Sadly I’m sure most people glazed right over this game amongst the veritable sea of cover based third person shooter garbage flooding the market. In many respects, it’s hard to blame them. The controls are average, squad AI is passable at best, the shooting isn’t weak, but at the same time doesn’t carry as much weight as you would expect. The difference with Spec Ops is that the narrative is absolutely fascinating. I can’t in good conscious point out any specifics of the plot because to spoil it would ruin the impact it would leave on anyone who hasn’t yet played it. What I can say is that at the end of the final cutscene I sat back and really thought about all of my choices and actions I took throughout the campaign. I can only think of a handful of games which have ever made such an impact on me.Spec Ops: The Line breaks the mold and is a must buy if nothing more than to see what modern military shooters have to offer us besides 10 year old multiplayer daycare.

												This is easily the best game I've ever played. You shouldn't go into this game for gameplay, it isn't anything new but it works perfectly fine with guns being relatively fun to use and enemies having good AI. At times you will find yourself dying a little too quick while some enemies feel like bullet sponges, but that's about right considering how little you wear while they are fully armoured. Now that we're done with the gameplay, the story is the real hook to buying this game. You will find yourself in a gripping story where you are put though many different situations to test your morality, most of which are no win scenarios and give no obvious good choices making you feel worse the more you play. The game is not black and white but rather the complete opposite with the game itself questioning you on whether or not you're really the hero as you fight your way through an entire army in order to find Konrad and end the nightmare he brought to Dubai when him and his soldiers were unable to evacuate this forgotten city. As the game progresses both you and the main protagonist will start to question what's really happening and your current mental state until you reach the ending which left me in such shock that I was left speechless and felt the need to replay the final mission numerous times to see all the endings. I personally felt dead inside after my first run. By the end of my experience I encountered so many twists and turns I didnt know what to expect next and after everything was over, I wanted to go back through the game and make different decisions from my first run to see how my teammates, myself and how everyone around me would react. Overall This was the ultimate video game narrative I've ever experienced and found it more than worth my time, this game took me about 8 hrs to complete due to some moments that took me a few too many tries, keeping it from being fun at all times, but for most people this shouldn't be much longer than 6 hrs though for most who play it on normal difficulty. I found that this game's length was excusable due to the fact that it was so immersive it felt at least twice as long. In the end this game has the best narrative in just about any game I have played so far including Telltale's Walking Dead games and it conveys a great message for the players, making this more than worth the cost.

My score: 8/10Playthrough time: 8.5 hours (not rushed, watched all cutscenes and including retrying some sections a few times) Did not try the multiplayer mode.Pros:+Excellent graphics (Unreal Engine).+A good selection of weapons at your disposal.+Nice gameplay, it's a cover based third person shooter that works really well+The story offers a different take to the military shooter type of game, dealing with the consequences of killing hundreds of people in combat.Cons:-The game might be too much for some, it's not all fun gunning down enemies, you have to deal with the consequences of your actions (in a more realistic manner than most games) as well.Performance notes:Runs very smooth (60 fps) with an R9 280X @1080P and max settings. The Xbox 360 controller works well (even though you don't get the same precision as with the keyboard/mouse) and this game is a good one for playing on the TV from the couch, but it's just as good in front of a desktop computer controlled with the keyboard/mouse.Main review:I was very positively surprised by this game.The story starts out in Dubai, where most of the population have been evacuated due to heavy sandstorms. Your team is sent on a recon mission, and when discovering dead American soldiers, you continue further in to the city to investigate and look for survivors.

The basic mechanics of the game are those found in most third person cover based shooters. Most of the time you're behind cover, returning fire at any enemies present. You also have grenades at your disposal, and you can issue simple commands to your squad members (target certain enemies, and in some situations order one of them to throw a flashbang).The game mechanics themselves are good enough to make the game worth it, but as the game unfolds, you discover that there is more to it than most other modern action games. You are faced with some difficult choices, and have to live with the consequences of your actions in the game.

The choices are few and far between, and don't really change the storyline, this is not a role playing game, it's more of a cinematic experience (the player is even credited as a ""special guest star"" in the credits) where you take control over the action. The level design is quite linear, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I don't want to reveal too much about the story, but when you in other games kill hundreds of enemy soldiers and don't think much of it, this game makes you think about what you're doing. You experience the trauma through the main protagonist, and chances are, you won't feel great about what you've done after playing through the game.

												Best story in shooters ever, it makes you care and feel really bad at times, not that much about a soldier but about human, storyline is very immersive and telling you anything about it would be pure crime, and with great story comes beautifull locations, visuals in general are just great same as music.

Posted: August 10, 2014
												There is one basic and important thing to know about Spec Ops: The Line, and that's that it is at the same time a deeply satisfying and a deeply frustrating experience. Gameplay-wise, it's a fairly competent shooter marred by some very poor design decisions- checkpoints often come before cutscenes and are too far apart, which, combined with the surprisingly unforgiving difficulty (even on Normal you can find yourself gunned down in seconds) can be teeth-grindingly annoying. The range of guns you can pick up is unremarkable and there are nice secondary functions to a lot of them; you can carry three kinds of grenades; the cover mechanic is just flawed enough to be irritating but functions tolerably for the most part.This is not a game about gameplay, however.Were it to be judged purely on its design and mechanics, Spec Ops: The Line would be pretty forgettable, but it has an ace in the hole: a story so out of the blue in its direction and message that it's a miracle a major publisher put this game out at all. What you think you're getting- particularly if you only play the demo- is another gung-ho gun-wielding slice of Americans saving the day by killing all the brown people. What you actually get is a slow, spiralling descent into madness that wears its Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now inspirations proudly and uses them to forge a modern-day commentary on the type of video game you thought you were going to play. Captain Walker is no godly Call of Duty avatar who can murder a thousand people and walk away- he falls apart mentally, visually and audibly as the game continues, his professionalism is stripped away and raw ego left exposed. ""Tango down"" becomes a more chilling, ""Kill is ♥♥♥♥ing confirmed"" as the game confronts you with issues of culpability and responsibility. It's incredibly unsettling.If you don't come away from Spec Ops: The Line with questions and doubts about shooters, I have serious concerns about whether you're dead inside. Do your best to ignore the sometimes-frustrating controls and systems and try and appreciate just how important this game is in the history of, and commentary on, shooters.			"

An Honest Illustration of War & the Scars It LeavesThe demo does this game no justice. Do -not- play it.""Being in the modern military is probably one of the hardest, most trying things a person can do and it's so great to see a game make more of that than a simple power fantasy."" - Extra CreditsIf you're looking for a mindless, nationalistic military shooter, you're not going to find it here. No other shooters have explored the weight that comes with pulling the trigger in war more than this game has. Although the mechanics are a part of the storytelling, the gameplay isn't as advanced as the current flurry of Call of Dutys, Battlefields, or Medal of Honors but the trade off is worth it. Those games don't even bother trying to touch on half of the things Spec Ops addressed; they actively avoid PTSD to opt for comic book heroics and focus on glorifying and romanticizing war. It's honest, visceral, and engaging in all its literal and metaphorical symbolism.If you decide to pick this up, and I strongly suggest that you do, experience it for the single-player story. The multiplayer was just an added bonus but don't judge the entire game by it if you decide to try that out first. It'll be one of the most eye-opening gaming experiences you'll ever have. The game trusts you to make your own decisions. Spec Ops: The Line is worth it full price if you think you'd enjoy a military shooter that gives more thought into its story and character development rather than mechanics. Yager really took a risk with this game and it's an experience I will always remember.10/10 - JUNEBUG'S FAVORITES			"

												CAUTION, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!To begin with, Spec Ops: The Line is not a typical action shooter. Spec Ops is a game that will indeed shock you in some parts of the campaign. The developers wanted to show us the other side of the war where everything that you think will be all right, goes wrong and you are the one blamed for that. The campaign takes place in destroyed by storm Dubai where we have the mission to rescue any survivors. The game shows us then a very good perspective of how a such a powerful city as Dubai can be destroyed in days by thirst, hunger and civil war. The campaign then also shows how rest of the world just do not care about other conflicts. The game takes then focus on team-work where you and two other soldiers are going through the city trying to survive. I also felt like the campaign was slowly turning you into a murderer, where you began as a friendly soldier and ended as a killer.                                                                                                                                                              The game itself is very good. The shooting mechanics are great, there is also some stealth gameplay. The game offers a wide list of weapons which is also great. The missions are ´´OK´´designed, so do not expect much. The game offers some decent graphics, but it´s still the gameplay that shows most potential. Spec Ops: The Line offers also a great addition where you have to find several ´´intelligence files´´ so it´s also a great thing for achievement hunters. Unfortunately I haven´t played the multiplayer yet, so I can´t review it. I personally liked the game. I bought it on Humble Bundle for several dollars and I can´t really say it was not worth it. The campaign after all was great experience in my opinion even though it shocked me in some chapters. The game itself was also good; the AI, weapons, Dubai perspective are definitely its best features.Overall I would like to say that the game was great and I truly recommend it to anyone to try it out. I give the game a solid 7/10			"

												""Military shooters don't often rank high on the narrative front, usually favoring gung-ho G.I. Joe antics and flag waving over character development. And, at first, Spec Ops: The Line falls right in line with that stereotype--you take control of Walker, a soldier sent into a sandstorm-ruined Dubai to find a missing Colonel. But as time goes on it becomes more and more obvious that there's something more devious afoot, and the shooter's story transforms from run-of-the-mill to one-of-a-kind.What unfolds is a damning criticism of shooters themselves, questioning everything that gamers have grown accustom to. Walker's journey sends him marching into the nucleus of the genre, playing with the storytelling in ways no other game has. By the end you might feel anger or sadness, but the important thing is that you'll feel something, and that's pretty rare in military shooters."" I strongly urge you to play this game. This has to be one of the greatest stories every written.			"

												Now this is a game that has impact on you. Throughout the chapters you come to feel what means to be human, to make mistakes and to learn about the weight of your actions. Three main characters (though only one is playable, but you get to like all of them), each one with their own personality and showing different reactions to the situations they come across and the things they have to do and choose to do. Yes, this game is a master at making you think if you ever had a choice, if you could have made the outcome different. You'll most likely get yourself wondering what you would have done or how you would have felt in their places.Storywise this game could hardly get any better. It's epic, it's moving, it's personal.Gameplay could see some improvements, movement sometimes is your worst foe, but it's not bad, many guns, squad commands, smooth aim, some strategy, some possibilities and the most useful grenades i've ever thrown (the enemies fully agree with this, believe me).It has a decent amount of replay value, if you want to see the different paths you can take, make different choices and see all the possible outcomes. You can also increase the game difficulty and replay it, things can get very challenging.So, in a nutshell, this game is a gem, completely worth playing, an amazing experience that still doesn't receive all the attention it deserves. I highly recommend this one.			"

												WARNING: A LOT OF FORESHADOWING HERE, BUT NO SPOILERSThe best works of art are created in a time where they are most needed, and found in the places no one would bother to look. In today's gaming industry, many are looking for the next great narrative to be found in a small indie game, or an expertly crafted RPG. Absolutely nobody was expecting a third-person military shooter to be the breakthrough they were desperately searching for, and that just adds to the utter brilliance of Spec Ops: The Line.As you may have heard, the game is very much intwined in the same themes as Joseph Conrad's incredible novel, ""Heart of Darkness"". You are a Special Forces captain sent in with your 3-man squad to the ruins of Dubai. The way the city is presented is unlike any other world design in recent memory, as you truly feel the suffering of the survivors, from the rotting, strung-up corpses to the creepiness of the multiple murals and graffiti you will stumble upon. Even with the bright aesthetics of sand and sun, make no mistake; Dubai is a wasteland with nothing left to offer.However, world design takes a backseat to narrative here, where the characters you encounter and the actions you take break down every preconception you might have had about military shooters. From the eerie antagonist to the journalist who could've very well been the brother of Dennis Hopper from Apocalypse Now, every character here feels needed. You will be forced to take actions that will genuinely shock you. By the third hour, I had committed what was by far, the most horrifying thing I have ever done in a video game. And make no mistake, none of this is purely for shock value, but truly necessary thematically, in order to build up to an unforgettable finale.By the end of the game, you will wonder why you bothered to play this game at all. But really, that's just it. In this game, you are not meant to be the hero. You are not supposed to have a happy ending, you are not meant to be the great patriot fighting for his country. It is the war epic that is needed after America's decade-long conflict in Afghanistan. It is what ""The Red Badge of Courage"" was to the American Civil War, what ""The Deer Hunter"" was to Vietnam. Even the game asks you towards the end, ""Do you remember why you came here?"" But that's just it. You may have forgotten why you played this game, but you'll be glad you did.			"

It takes a strong man to deny what's right in front of him...""In the beggining it seems like just another CoD style corridor action game. After few minutes when the story opens, it really grows on you and makes you curious. Then you don't care that much about the overplayed gameplay style that doesn't bring anything new to the table, because it's made like this just to let the story shine.The multiple endings are worth watching and all of them are very, very powerful. I will never forget that moment when we bombed the base with soldiers and also hiding civilians. When I saw to the bone burnt dead woman holding her child, and tried to protect it, I just hold my face with goosebumbs, saying to myself ""What have I done"" If a game can give you unforgettable emotional moments, you know you played something special, and this little known game (unluckily!) is something special.""Do you feel like a hero yet?...""If you want to unlock all achievements, prepare on very mentally challenging FUBAR experience. As I said, gameplay is very CoD and those few heroic moments are OK if playing on first 3 difficulties, but it's absolutely horrible on FUBAR, especially in solo parts when you are outmatched 1v10 and you have few bullets and low HP. Took me definitely more than 60-70 replays through whole campaign, so good luck with it.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line...Ladies and gentlemen... Welcome to Dubai.StoryStarting my review with commenting on how good of a story this game had (IMO).Dramatic twists of events. Taking choices you wouldn't want to. Going through a deep slow path of insanity by each chapter.I'm usually not amused by any type of story an army game has to offer and I must admit in my eyes most of them are more or less the same.However out of the bucket of clichés and reused material Spec Ops: The Line stands out.The fictional concept told here is so well blended that it kept my interest through the whole time from start to end.I even did 4 runs of the game itself in order to experience all 4 different endings.Can't say it is original, after the amount of movies and games that have been out so far, there's hardly anything new to be served in militaristic games. However it is the way the content is served that makes the difference in this type of games, this one right here gets the cookie for me.DirectionThe game is very very well directed. The way the story is balanced through action sessions, intense cutscenes, sweet environmental designs, and impressive musical options.All combined so smoothly with some of the very best voice acting I've seen for an action shooter.GraphicsNeatly scripted on Unreal Engine 3, the game has sweet physics and sandstorm and smoke dynamics. Of course there have been titles a lot more famous for their graphics for 2012.But for the experience offered, Spec Ops: The Line's graphics are just perfect and it's lacking major bugs or issues.GameplayVery easy and comfortable to handle. Ammo and amount of weapons is just about right.Destructible environment (just a few details here and there) add a good taste on the style of the shooter experience and of course not missing the ability to take cover and using commands to make your crew help you dynamically in various situations.Difficulty makes a difference from the easiest to the hardest mode and it gets more and more challenging, sometimes kinda too hard in the hardest difficulty level.MusicThe music used in the game is AMAZING.Not only the acoustic backrgound is very good, but you will also hear a brilliant collection of songs through the game, every single one very accurately put in each situation like a glove.SoundCool environmental and battle effects that seem about right at any moment of the game. No problems with blending music or voice acting.AverageConsidering that this game was implemented by a very small team and the studio itself is not even famous for having any other major titles around the market (Yager Development only have one other game implemented which is very old)It was freaking amazing. With a story that has a beginning, a peak, and an end. Well made, balanced, satisfying, with good action and even a well done multiplayer and co-op modes.Considering how shallow other a lot more famous games from bigger studios have ended up being, Spec Ops: The Line is by the full meaning of the phrase 'a job well done'.And for the asked price, this title is pure gold!Do get it. 100% recommended!

												Spec Ops: The Line is a good Third person shooter, its reminds me of Ghost Recon... But is it worth buying?  this is my opinion=Pros :+Great Story (the story will make you feel like you are a bad person)+The A.I companion, Adams and Lugo is really helpful+Multiple Endings +Great Background (Post-Apocalyptic Dubai)+Voice acting is good+many weapon to useCons :-Altough Great, the story is very-very short-Combat is boring after a while, you must take cover over and over again-Multiplayer/community is dead, so dont have high hopes for multiplayer battles-choice you make doesnt change the storyline after all(exept the ending choice)-i know the weapon is many, but you will just using the same gun you like alltheway till the ending (trust me)so my final verdict in this game is :   7.5/10!only buy this game when its on sale, if you buy the game at full price you will regret it because the game is so short..

												In a world where everyone's a hero when they launch a shooter, Spec Ops: The Line crushed that stereotype. Never had a game make me question my morality as much as Spec Ops: The line. This game surpassed the level of a game, bringing to me what I can only described as ""a very real experience"".The strong emotions of the graphics and voice acting emersed me into a setting where I ponder over every decision I made while playing as the protagonist. I can still vividly remember the very first time I was shown the repercussions after I made a ""mistake"". Without revealing spoilers, I can only say I regretted so hard I did not make a save before making that decision and it ""haunted"" me for the rest of the game, quite literally.Together with This War of Mine, I'm pretty sure Spec Ops: The Line can be arguably the next most realistic war game ever scripted. It introduces as a shooter, but jolts you back up and shake you vigorously, reminding you that every single round that connects with an ""enemy"", someone out there lost their loved one.I have been late in picking up Spec Ops: The Line, and I regret letting it grow dust in my collection and not playing it sooner. The experience of this game is as good as reading a great novel. Kudos to the screenwriters for writing such an outstanding story.Update: Voted for The “Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award 2016			"

												War is DIRTY, War is the worst NIGHTMARE. That is what Spec Ops wants to tell us. It really showes what is going in the US Army or in other armys as well. I was really thinking about humanity and about the problems that we have on this planet and I have to say that War is just stupid and it doesnt solve the problems between countrys. Now to the game: You´re the leader of the Spec Ops team "" Delta one "" which got the order too rescue forces and people in Dubai. Dubai is completly destroyed and it will be even more destroyed in the futher game. All I want is that it has a great storyline which is very rarely today. It was the best storyline in the past few years. It´s a must have !. Really its outstanding ^^. It should be on every wishlist and you know what go and pick it up at the next sale. Im sorry that I dont tell you that much about the story but you should experience on your own because Spec Ops the line is full of surprises.All in one a must have. 10/10			"

												Finished this game on a ""non steam"" version and here are my thoughts about the game and my rating.The game itself is very basic, running, shooting, crouching that's basiclly the game. But there is something attached to this game that I cant find on my radar and that makes the game very fun.The main story Is that Dubai the glorious city is under attack from some kind of terrorist group. And your mission is to defeat this group and find your people. As you go throught this game you will find out that the story isnt only that. The graphics In this game are good, nothing to complain about.My Rating and conclusionThe game is very good and fun! its easy to just startup and play. It's also not that long so you dont have to spend your whole life playing it ;) I recommend this game to people who enjoy shooters alot!I'll give it a 8 out of 10.-Benz			"

Spec Ops’ unexpected story is an army shooter that makes killing people mean something.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is something... more than a game. Obviously it is a game, because it features gameplay--specifically, gameplay where you and two squad mates are sent into a war-torn Dubai on a recon mission that turns into something so much more. Spec Ops has the most basic, mundane third person shooting that one can wish for: you can hide behind cover, you shoot humans with guns, your health recovers by waiting, and there is a ton of sand. But that's the point of Spec Ops. A mundane facade designed to undermine your expectations, because nothing can prepare you for what the game's story puts you through. There comes a point where you stop shooting the enemy and you question what you're even doing--you get so caught up in the gameplay that you don't even realize the decisions you're making, and furthermore, the decisions out of your control.Spec Ops: The Line is, essentially, a deconstruction of the modern military shooter genre. It grabs hold of the likes of Call of Duty, Battlefield, and other contemporaries and asks them: why?			"

												Without giving out too much of the plot, this is a modern military shooter that deconstructs modern military shooters. The things that you'll do in this game will haunt your dreams weeks after you finish, and you'll question the things you do in other games for nearly the rest of your life. This third-person shooter blows the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of crappy, big budget FPSs like Call of Duty and Medal of Honor. Spec Ops: The Line is a must-have, must-play, and is worth every penny. By the way, I suggest that you find someone willing to hug you and tell you that you're still a good person once you finish...You'll need it......Why haven't you bought this already, damn it?!UPDATE 12/31/14: I've been ruminating a bit more on this and gaming's place amongst other media, and I want to say something else: Gaming may not yet have its 'Citizen Kane', but it damn sure does have its 'Apocalypse Now'. Also, as I'm writing this, the Steam Winter Sale has this at $5.99 US, which is 80% off its normal price. Anyone else dragging their feet on this purchase has no financial excuse. Buy this game as soon as possible.			"

Spec Ops: The line, how not to be a good personEvery now and then a game comes along that takes everyone by storm, games that will in 10 to 15 years be called classics. Spec Ops: The line Is one of those games and I wish I decided to buy it earlier.At time of writing this I have put a fair few hours into Spec Ops and have completed it twice, when I first started playing it I simply rushed through each area at a time not really paying attention to anything. just the knowledge that I am the ""good guys"" and anyone who shot at me were the ""bad guys"" I saw an enemy, I shot them and then moved onto the next one and kept moving and had fun doing it I thought that I would finish and game and feel pretty happy about itHowever when I had finished Spec Ops I was silent. I thought about my actions and what they caused, how many people I had killed in a senseless fantasy to do ""what was right"" and why even after completing it I never felt happy I never felt that I was the hero of the story that I had become the savior of Dubai. A particular moment stood out to me during the playthough, a moment when I on impluse, shot into a crowd of unarmed, innocent people because I wanted revenge I wanted to do what was right and I was determined that I could do what was right. but that same drive to do what I percieved as right, lead to the deaths of so many others. I went into Spec Ops wanting to do good and thought that I could always choose the least evil option when I was given the chance and in the end It would all be fine. I was wrong and the game made me realise that I truly didnt know how hard it is to ""be a good person""Get this game on sale, use a friends copy but atleast play through the game once, get to understand what it is trying to tell you and learn that PTSD is not a damn joke.

												I just finished a lenghty Spec Ops achievement marathon. Played this game a lot in my freetime and now I finally can put it to rest. While I don't want to consider myself an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, I like to pay games I really enjoy a tribute by completing them 100%.Now, this introduction perfectly fits (more or less) into the message of the game. Are violent games really just games, you play and get an achievement for your 50th headshot? Is it okay to sit back and enjoy war, while you are the hero, kicking the♥♥♥♥♥of all the terrorist scum that threatens to destroy the world? I can't really compare Spec Ops: The Line to Battlefield, Call of Duty setting-wise or Gears of War and Mass Effect gameplay-wise, as I've never played them. But what I can say is, that, in my humble opinion, Spec Ops: The Line is a masterpiece. Not without its flaws, but a masterpiece nonetheless.Gameplaywise, you get the typical brown modern war 3rd person shooter thingy. What do you expect? You play a badass dude to murder tons of evil dudes. Simple as that. But storywise, you are encountered by some moral questions, you might not have asked you yet. And suddenly, all the dull gameplay makes sense in a more complex way.I don't want to spoil too much here, so I'll keep it short: If you are expecting a breakthrough in modern warfare gameplay and gunfights, this game is nothing for you. If you are interested in a good and gripping story, with one ore the other twist and an underlying message, you must play this game, even if you don't care about war shooters, like me. Highly recommended!			"

												Took me a long time to get around to playing this....9 hours of highly original, single-player, military action. The story is gripping, the script is tight, and the voice acting excellent. Technically, it looks good, sounds good, and plays well. The cover system seemed a bit unresponsive at times, but that didn't spoil the game. Due to the short length of campaign, I'd say definitely worth buying when 75% off.			"

												The game is an absolute gem that will make you think twice about your choices. It plays well, over the shoulder combat takes getting used to if you've not played with it too often, the dialogue is absolutely amazing and the cinematics are incredible. But most importantly, the story. The whole game revolves around it, unlike other titles, where it's just thrown in. Can not recommend this game enough to anyone who has not played it yet. There is just one piece of advice I have for you - do not read anything about this game's story. It will ruin it irreversably. Achievements do take 2-3 playthroughs, though :(			"

												I dont write a lot of legit reviews for any game but this game was amazing i have never enjoyed a 3ps game as much as i enjoyed this one everything about this game is great some stuff was kinda overused like turret scenes but i felt it fit pretty damn well with the story and what was going on the music fit in with the epic battles you are having and this isn't one of those shooters were you can just run in and surive and gun everyone down. Spec ops the line is at its peak when you get towards the middle of the story it builds up fast by then and you feel for both sides watching what happens leaves you happy but also uneasy you think twice about decsions you're forced to make in the gameI rate spec ops the line a Soild8.5/10 WITH a def buy if you have the money :)P.s Even the loading scenes make you think about what happens in this world and it makes you second guess why you're still doing this			"

												i owned this game more than 1 year without playing it, but now i regret that i did not played it earlier.the game is also having the message that we all can make a stupid decision, which we will regret later.in the first hour of gameplay this isnt much different compared with any other 08/15 3rd-person shooter.but with further progress in the story, the true strenght of the game will be revealed.the game is taking place in dubai, where heavy sandstorms isolated its whole population.the player is taking the role of cpt. martin walker accompanied by his squad members lugo and adams.this squad was sent to investigate the misterious vanishing of the 33rd Battalion who was sent earlier to start a rescue mission for the survivors of the catastrophe.the story is showing the ""dark side"" of war on a high psychological level.several choices will be given to the player, during the playthrough.at the end of the 5 hour long story, cpt. walker is getting confronted with ""the truth"", and what the hell happened there.the decisions the player made will come back to him in a very uncomfortable way.spec ops is the first game that made me feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, through its simple but awesome plot.i can highly recommend everyone finishing this game at least once.it is truly a masterpiece of a shooter  Criteria Rating   Gameplay 7/10   Story 10/10   Graphics 7/10   Atmosphere 9/10  "

												Modern Military Shooters (MMS) are some of the biggest budget games that are released every year, with ""extreme"" realism and crappy storyline that look copied from a children's book and tries to get under our skin, but epic fails and falls flat.WELL, Spec Ops: The Line skullf*cks the formula by giving one of the most epic single player experiences, making it one of the best games of 2012 for me and one of the best stories of all time in a game, despite the barebones competitive multiplayer and Co-Op missions...Graphics are really good, detail is nice, voice acting is stellar and so is face animation. Some of the controls, however seem to be directly ported from console as the key to vault over cover is the same as melee, and sprinting is the same as getting into cover (wait...what?!), however, after a bit of playing it, you will get used to it, but you may get some cheap-shot deaths from those awkward controls in the start...As for story, the game nails it. It happens in a corrupt war-damaged Dubai, where a squad of 3 soldiers battle to get civilians out of the mess that happened, however, you face many decisions, that fight your moral principals and can make you feel bad for the sh*t you've done throughout the game. Your choices, like an RPG, affect the ending and most of them are really tricky as you don't know which one to take, since all of them have heavy consequences. Spec Ops: The Line makes you use your morality and ethical code to the extreme. Something rare nowadays in the gaming industry...Multiplayer is just...there, it can provide fun moments but not many, since it feels tacked on, you can clearly see that all the effort was put in the SP Campaign. Co-Op can be fun with a friend but not much else as you only have 4 missions, but they are really hard to pull off so an extra hand can be a life-savior, too bad the Co-Op isn't for 4 players or 3 (like a squad, like from the campaign), it's only for 2 players, but i'm ok with it actually unlike, MW3 survival mode for example, as 4 players would make much more sense.Also, gameplay is well done, the gunplay is smooth but some guns come punch a bit harder...The cover system works well (one of the best and most fluid I've ever seen!), and other mechanics (execution for example) work nicely too, despite the confusing controls, but although the gameplay mechanics work, it isn't groundbreaking in any stretch of the imagination so the game may get repetitive after your first playthrough so the final difficulty unlocked after beating the game may never be experienced due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay.Spec Ops is one of those ""don't miss it"" games, and, despite it's *minimal* flaws, it deserves an 9.5/10While the game doesn't really surprise in the beggining, the situation gets better in the middle and end, so youtube gameplay may not be helpful to make up your mind. Also, only when you *are playing the game yourself* does the game appeal, not in gameplay videos, in my opinion. It's like 20 euros now on steam, much lower on sales (like 4,99 €) so, you can't miss it!			"

												Do you know this feeling when there are two voices in your head arguing over what is the right thing to do and it makes you extremely uncomfortable? It's called cognitive dissonance and Spec Ops: The Line makes you take a nosedive into a sea of that feeling. It shows war as what it is. Not as the glorified, heroic, romanticized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that we get stuffed with from games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, but as horror, pure, unfiltered horror. If you felt like the moral choices in games like Fallout punched you in the gut, what you'll have to do in Spec Ops will leave you feel like the game punched you in the face, wrenched open your jaw, reached down your throat and ripped out your guts.Spec Ops makes the player feel what the main character is going through, but not simply via making you identify with the character you play. Its gameplay, world design and everything makes you feel uncomfortable, nauseous and morally torn apart. It really is brilliantly crafted.I'll stop here to avoid possible spoilers or how you perceive the game while playing, but if you feel like dropping the game after playing for an hour because the combat feels generic and/or bad, please, please don't do that and press on, it's well worth it.There's one last thing I'll say, if you decide to play it: When you hear the line ""Because you wanted to be something you're not."", that's aimed at you, not the character you're playing.

Welcome to Dubai!What do you See?Is it a Salvation or an Devastation?What do you think?Is this the work of a Madman?Your choice and Actions reflects upon yourself.Question is, did you have a Choice?Pros:Great storyWell characterized characters, you are Captain Walker with your men Lugo and Adams.The Environment is Nicely made and works.Depending on what difficulty you can push yourself to real survive, tip make evert Bullet count.A realistic AI from the Enemies, if you choice to hid behind cover, they will try to outflank you. Making it different from the Normal wooden duck shooting of enemies behind cover.The lore/intel have an interesting background to it all.Cons:The NPC AI companions can be stupid sometimes but they eventually work.The Cover mechanics can be a bit clunky times to time.The Controles can be a bit weird, but in the end they work when you get used to them. (And you can always change them if you want)Summary:I Loved this game and it is really worth playing, maybe not for being the most Functionally, but for its Great Story.If you have thought of buying this game, I suggest you do. So try to grab it next Steam Sale when you can.And you will be in for an Experience.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line, is not really a fun and enjoyable game at its core, which is why it's so interesting, especially as just one (pretty short campaign with not very much multiplayer) shooter in a world where shooters are released en masse. Mechanically speaking, Spec Ops is a pretty standard third person shooter - two weapons at any one time , three throwables, and a selection of alternate weapon options with a comparatively smooth cover system. I did not really like the inability to aim and fire while sprinting, but that's a bit of a minor issue that I feel can be overlooked.The graphics are reasonably good, especially for a game released in 2012. The background and setting is particularly well done, well able to convey a sense of a city tearing itself apart, and also the issues that have arisen from a city cut off from the rest of the world. It is a pretty brutal Dubai that you find yourself in, and the game conveys the sense of horror that has descended on the city very well.The soundtrack is fantastic. Both it, and the storyline, short it may be, are probably the standout features of the game for me. Evoking imagery of Apocalypse Now, Spec Ops: The Line shows just how nightmarish and hellish war really is, apart from the glorified imagery that certain media has portrayed it as. Offering a look at the damage that can be done to a soldier's psyche from tours of duty, it also offers a look at the chain of command, something that is explored comparatively rarely. Offering questions regarding morality and cause and effect, while short, Spec Ops: The Line is well worth playing through.			"

A masterpiece in DubaiHere it starts. Finally I completed this game third time (2 times like not license version and one more time here) and I can say with full confidence -  it is the best shooter I've ever played. But let me tell you more closely why I think so.Graphic. In this game, you might find one of the best images in all shooters. Since the beginning you will be amazed by the fantastic scenery of the desert ... detailed characters, weapons, and equipment. Due to the game engine Unreal Engine 3 you'll subjugated by landscapes in this game .. it's just something incredible (for 2012).Gameplay. The gameplay is also at a very high level. I can say with full confidence that it is much better than in CoD or Battlefield (yes, I played all these games). Every movement, every jump clearly and realistically worked out. To stay alive you need as quickly as possible to cross from one shelter to another, 'cause here you can be killed by EVERY bullet. Here is a great combat system and a large selection of weapons. You can kill your enemy with machine guns, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, different types of grenades. You can kill with his bare hands (it looks fantastic, and not just waving a knife as in CoD)! Or even just to fill their enemies great bunch of sand, which almost break out the windows or rooftops.Story. Apparently, I have not enough words to describe it. For me - this is the best story that I have experienced in the game world. This story, the story of three brave friends deserves an Oscar! Welcome to Dubai, paradise on earth, which turned into hell! First, we have an intriguing start that somehow draws you and you want to know more... During the game events are fantastic, I will not spoiling, but the game has a heap of points that can cause you to fear and even tears. As for the end of the game ... I am quite sure that by the end of the game you will overfill different feelings... There are several different endings, and you have to make it for your own choice .. no matter how difficult it will be... This story impressed me to the core. And I really happy that I passed this way together with Delta team - Captain Walker, Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Lugo.I can talk for a long time about this game. Because for me it's really clever game that I'll always want to play. I want to say thanks studio Yager that they gave me this small miracle. I am so depressed that many players don't pay attention to this really fantastic game and continue to play CoD and Battlefield which  just turned into a boring conveyor.Thank you for reading my own point of view.Definitely 10/10 "

												I can hardly begin this review. I devoured this game in one sitting which does not happen often for me, so that is a start.If you like war games and shooters, you need to play this game. Not because the action is intense and brutal (which it is), but because the story is intense and brutal.	 Never in a game before had I felt the atrocities of war so acutely. This game made me not only realize how horrible we can be, but how EASILY we can slip into hell, especially on a battlefield. That type of statement pulled off in a game that was fun to play is in my mind a genre changer. God help other military shooters for what they will have to do to keep up with this. I have a few gripes about the game, they are not small, but they are demonstrably overshadowed by the storytelling.  The cover system sometimes is very inadequate, you step away from walls you did not mean to and get shot in the face. And sometimes you cover to walls you did not mean to and expose yourself in that way too. I feel they could have made the order system better as well as you have no control over where your team members go, just what targets they kill, and if you are lucky enough to get the prompt, who gets a flashbang before getting gunned down. The order system does have the benefit of being simple and therefore keeping you focused on the pace of the story, but this gets countered a bit in a few sections where your friendly AI gets killed by running ahead of you and into the open.   You do have to save them which puts you in terrible spots. I can only think of 2 spots this happened to me more than once, so it’s not that big of a deal. What is a bigger deal is that towards the end of the game the checkpoint saves get ludicrously far apart in my opinion. I would have to play one section over and over, just because the guy (a very heavy trooper) at the end of the section what giving me issues. In another section, the same sort of thing happened but I had next to no ammo when it put me at the checkpoint (I was not low on ammo when it saved)…that was a bit of a drag. ALL of that said, on a scale of one to ten the game would be in the high 9s no problem for how well done everything else was done. Buy this game, play this game…but by something happy for yourself too. You are going to need it after the war.  "

												A really amazing game with a story that goes more deep then you think. Has a few choices you can make during playing but as far as I know they wont matter much until you make the last choice in the end. Most of the combat is cover-based and on uncommon moments I have had trouble rushing into cover because sometimes the game wouldn't register what is/isn't cover. For the first 15 mins of the game you will pretty much be doing the exact same things for maybe 92% the entire game so it wont be much diversity to gameplay...but its still alot of fun <3 "

												Spec Ops: The Line. From all the praise, I was expecting something unique and different. I can't say I got any of that.Good things first. The setting. Sandstorm weathered Dubai is something truly unique, I can give it that. Skyscrapers buried in sand with the constant threat of storms where civilians and armed forces try to survive is absolutely fresh. The strong glaring sun and bloom, although most of the time very distracting, added to the hot weather feel.Voice acting was quite nice. Felt pretty good to listen to although some lines were really awkward but that's just the script.Sand worked quite nicely as a mechanic also, although it kinda died off the further I went on in the game.Well, the bad things. Let's start with the big praised and awarded morale. Did the game make me feel like a hero? No. Did the game make me feel bad? No. Why? I was wondering, why would it? I was stuck on rails. I went on how the game wanted me to go and suddenly what I did was wrong in the end. But I didn't have much of a choice. It was like reading a book. There was only one outcome. There were a couple choices to be made but I felt like they didn't make much difference. I picked one option and I was told, ""Well, that's how things go"". There are three different endings but I'll just say nothing you do between start and end matters. I couldn't feel bad for ""Wakuhs's"" (player character) choices because I couldn't affect his larger choices and I couldn't relate on him at all.Maybe I was supposed to feel sorry for the characters but the thing was that my squad was ""The Bro Delta Squad"" kind. I didn't like the fact that I was a superior and my squad could just act like brats because we were such bros. It made me feel annoyed and I wanted to personally end my squad mates. So whatever quarrel we had made me want to slide under the table in shame. The civilians were angry for a good reason but they felt like complete idiots. Our objective at one point was to issue an evacuation order but I felt like I might have missed something. Why haven't the civilians left? That makes them stupid, except the sandstorm keeps them there. So they can't really leave. So why are we trying to tell them to leave in the first place? That makes us stupid. If our solution was to round up some nice vehicles and then escort them but no. Our plan was just to tell them to leave. Tell a bunch of angry mindless civilians to march into their doom.Gameplay. Clunky, sticky, unresponsive at times. Aiming and shooting was plausible. Running and using cover, awful. Spec Ops: The Line falls under the category of games that handles most things with just one key. Running and taking cover happens from space. However, other things such as vaulting happened from shift. It just didn't feel natural. I felt like cover related actions should've been in one button and movement related in another. On top of it all, my character didn't feel like staying in cover sometimes. He would just pop his head out and refused to take cover. Firefights felt like a chore because the enemy threw grenades with pinpoint accuracy constantly. There were times when they threw grenades through my cover as well. So I couldn't stay in the cover for more than a second or two. I had to retreat away from the fight because I was pretty much as far as I could be from the enemies. Once I returned to the cover, another grenade was lobbed at me. Not really fun. A cover shooter that punishes you for using cover?tl;drPretty average cover TPS. Morality executed poorly. Clunky controls. Nice story, voice acting and visuals though. Not a super long game. If you enjoy a good story, get it. If you favor gameplay, don't get it.			"

Spec Ops: The line is a third-person shooter, with a strong storyline that's worth of Hollywood attention. However, that's not where the game really shines.You have to be a fan of action games to truly appreciate Spec Ops: The line, and if you played on FUBAR difficulty, you know what I mean. The developers made sure everyone could enjoy it, but once you play on the hardest difficulty, small details start to make even more sense.The aiming, the blind-fire, the cover locations, the level's details on positions and even diversity make this one of my favorite action games.Adams and Lugo team up with our main character to take Dubai to its righteous path, under heavy fire from the rebels, U.S troops and even private military. Although there is no online co-op, the campaign is pretty much intensive. But if that's not good enough, then killing heavies on the hardest difficulty will make you feel happy!The design team worked extensively to make sure this wouldn't be forgotten, and they nail'd it. Dubai under a crisis is perfect, with the sunsets far away on the horizon... The afternoon desert storms, the despair reflected in the abandoned luxury cars... A city in despair, and with a backstory to make you go wild.In Spec Ops: The line you make decisions that don't really matter, but they tried it, and that's halfway through. Speaking of things that could be better, we also have the stealth, that could have been away more improved, but still... Playing an extreme action game, would you go quiet? :)I really love this game, I love how tough it is, and how well it works under pressure! Of course we all hate when our teammates die because of the stupid AI, but they have a pace of movement, and I learn it while playing on FUBAR. Once I did, I start having so much fun.If is there any negative feelings, they are towards some areas, where playing on the hardest difficulty, become annoying. Two in particular; Last part on the Chapter 6 ""The Pit"", where the player needs to escape, and the entire thing is based on luck. No skill, no strategy, nothing. Just luck.The other is the famous last part in Chapter 10, where protecting the water truck can be awful due to the lack of checkpoints.I wish everyone could have the same excitement I had with this game, and either if you're playing for the story line, or for some extreme action I highly recommend that you try it.One of my favorite War Games!8/10			"

												Bottom line, I recommend this game.  If you like shooters, can stomach some very dark content, and want to play something a little bit different... this may be the game for you.I am reviewing this as a single player title.  I have no interest in the multiplayer content, and have not tried it to provide feedback on it.Before the good, I need to be clear on something many might view as bad.  I finished this game in one sitting last night of about six hours.  Some people hate short games, but this game is surprisingly deep, keeps you wanting to stay and play more, and I already am thinking about playing through again as its obvious there are different ending possibilities.  I view the shortness of this game as the one standout thing against it.Moving on though... there was a lot I liked.This game is about people who are in very dark situations, confronted by nothing but dark and challenging choices.  You are not either saving the damsel, or killing her dog.  I once read a review that seemed intriguing.  It said that once you realize whats going on you will be hooked and want to see the rest of the game through.  I got there.  I was hooked.  I had to see how it ends.The gameplay was good, and by the time I realized why -- I was actually surprised.  Too many games have cover systems that aren't necessary.  Enemies that could fire 1000 bullets and maybe hit your water canteen once.  Etc...   Spec Ops:  The Line is not such a cake walk.  The enemies can hit you accurately, and they will.  Your AI team mates will be a necessity, but they will also be vulnerable.  There are times where you will run out of ammo and even if you don't like this gun or that based on your own style... you will think its a god send to have a way to fight off the enemy, and play accordingly.  I found myself using cover at every possible avenue.  Grenades were not an afterthought.  It was FUN.I've played numerous shooters dating back to Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem.  I've played Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, and more.  I have to say this game really felt different and drew me in how many AAA games have.When everything was said and done, it was the story and presentation that blew my mind.  Mature modern story in a believable setting.Random number score system? 9/10.  I was that impressed.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line looks a lot like the typical modern third person action shooter on the outside. The gameplay is merely servicable, functional and mediocre.But it's the basic concept of this game that actually makes this really fantastic in some ways that couldn't be described without spoiling your experience. The game takes a look at the typical war setting and portrays it in such an emotional way. It's deliberately mundane and that's partially why it has a ton of depth and really makes you consider everything that occurs. It's a 100% feels trip. You just simply wont play a shooter that is as story rich as The Line.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a basic 3rd person shooter with a great and impacting story.The gameplay is pretty much your standard 3PP game. However it can be very challenging if you're not careful. You don't feel like the Terminator pushing through pumping bullets into meatbags. You have to have somewhat of a strategy as you move about the levels.The best thing about the game itself though, is the story. From the time your boots on the ground in Dubai to the heartstring pulling choices to the compelling end you will stay hooked. The scenery is also great in this game. While obviously not boasting some of the best graphics, it holds it's own against other games of the genre.I highly recommend this game, expecially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												If you enjoy third person shooters, you have reason enough to play this game. If you appreciate a story that tries and succeeds in being a truly unique experience, you will be in love with this game. The amazing voice acting from Nolan North puts you in the blood-soaked boots of Cpt. Martin Walker, and the story will have you questioning what makes a hero. Spec Ops doesn't use experience or skill unlocks to simulate progression in the game, but rather utilizes an ever increasing amount of violence and difficulty. The combat will keep pushing you, and also rewarding you, in a subtle way that doesn't make the player feel stupid like many other shooters have a tendency of doing. In my opinion, this game is one of a kind.So.What are you waiting for? Dubai needs to be saved.			"

												PLEASE TAKE TIME TO READ THIS REVIEWThis game was so epic in SO many ways I can't find words to describe it. First of all this game is a typical modern tactical shooter where you have your squad of 2 guys and command them to shoot stuff and♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUT MY GOD THIS GAME HAS THE BEST STORY I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN A GAME. This game's story and atmosphere was so good it made me  cringe and cry  at some point and I don't remember a game making me cringe nor cry. This game's story was such a masterpiece and such greatly done that you simply CAN'T only watch the walkthrough of it , you have to play it yourself. Moral choices that are placed make your experience change but you don't even notice it. In the end the story wraps up so good that you understand what you're goal has been the entire game. This game IS very heavy and dark , some choices you make lead up to very dark moments but that's what makes this game's story so good.''Fun is not a word in this game's vocabulary''-NerdCubed 2012Gameplay - 8.5/10Graphics - 9/10Story - 12/10Mechanics - 9.5/10Final Note:Get this game immediatelyFor a more better review than mine :

												The story and the things going on really are a very unique and interesting piece of writing, since it shows the things you usually don't get to or want to see about war, especially in games. The graphics, cutscenes and voice acting is also superb. Because of that I really recommend getting this game at some point.The game's main problem is its very generic gameplay - just a typical 3rd person shooter with a cover-system. The levels are very linear too.			"

												I'd recommend this because of how they presented a different take on the modern military theme. In spite of the gameplay that lacks a dash of innovation in gameplay and better pacing (moments where you end up just mindlessly shooting)-- I did enjoy it and my expectations were satisfied. It's selling point is really in the narrative. I don't play a lot of modern military shooters, but this one gets you going because you just want to know what's going on and why is it that regardless of the choices you make, you're still going to be a horrible person). How they integrated choice in the game is something that got me engaged. And on a not-so-random note, the levels aren't so bad, they're pretty well-made, especially those interiors!			"

												This game was a game i bought a while ago and never played it. I got a reccomendation to play it and decided to try it out. Needless to say this was a enjoyable experience. Where the game shines is in the story. The Characters are very linear but the plot of Americans killing fellow americans for a unknown reason makes you start to be curious. As the story progresses you soon feel a bit bad for killing certain people or being the cause of wrecking peoples lives. However this game has a great ending which i wont spoil. The combat is satisfying and i beat it in 5 and a half hours on hard difficulty. I could have beaten it in 5 hours but i died a couple of times due to looking over cover for a second to long. The game is decently good id give it a 7.5/10			"

												While this game might seem like a normal military fps, it isn't. This is another game made by 2K https://www.2k.com/games . It's interesting to note how many of the games are made by 2k when we asked the various gaming groups to nominate games with the best story. This particular one entitled 'Spec Ops: The line' is actually the 8th one in this particular series though it shares nothing in common with its former installments of the games with the same namesake.(Spoiler Alert)The story basically follows a soldiers personal journey through limbo. You take control of a captain Walker who is in charge of a 2 man delta squad. The three of them are on a rescue mission to find the 33rd battalion and their captain Konrad who is someone considered to be of noble rank since he saved your life in a previous battle.Dubai has become somewhat apocalyptic thanks to huge never ending sandstorms requiring that the whole city to be evacuated. The politicians and the elite downplayed the situation while at the same time evacuating it themselves in secret leaving countless thousands of refugees behind. The 33rd battalion coming home from a war in Afghanistan volunteered their services to help with the relief efforts.The United States government however ordered the 33rd to abandon the city and its refugees, but the 33rd led by Captain Konrad ignored the command and insisted upon their wishes of leading a caravan of 1,000 people out of the city. However the sandstorms grew worse and the caravan promised never arrived at the proposed time given. Future communication and travelling was severed and the 33rd was publicly disavowed for treason.After significant time a looped radio signal could be heard coming from the city again. It was a brief one from Captain Konrad. It basically stated that the attempted evacuation was a complete failure and the death toll was too many. The US military then decide to send a covert 3 man delta team in to locate any survivors and then radio for extraction.Problem is as you guide this 3 man crew into Dubai, things begin to seriously not add up. The refugees are trying to kill you, the 33rd battalion wants to kill you and so does the CIA operatives. As you begin to hallucinate voices and visions, you also begin to witness some atrocities that each splintering faction of the city has done to each other. The game unfortunately forces you to make some of those atrocities yourself in order to push on and find answers and hopefully in the vain attempt to nobly save someone. Somewhere at the end of the game you will be haunted by the dead faces of those that you have killed asking you why you committed such acts and for what purpose? Eventually you will realize that your character is suffering with severe effects of PTSD.There are 18 campaign chapters to play through with a somewhat highly decorated abstract version of Dubai buried in the sand. These chapters are spasmodically broken up with several morale choices placed throughout the game. The importance of these morale choices and the effects they will have on the game are purely there for illusion. None of your choices will really matter. No matter what you choose or how you go about things your character will be haunted by the people he has killed. There is no pleasant way out of this. The game literally forces you to make a decision which unknowingly at the time will kill thousands. It will then show you the consequence of that decision regardless of the fact that you had no choice about it and it will ask you why did you do it?Here's where the nobility of the story fails immensely and does not have the same power or punch to a story where your choice really does matter. Any morale judgments are quickly dismissed under a rigged gaming framework. While it does get you to think about things and it has moved and inspired countless people to think about the consequence of actions, I personally think it could have been delivered better to make more of an impact on gamer's than what it already has.Definitely worth a look...

-Quick Review-Spec Ops: The Line is a third person shooter who takes a warfare story telling aspect, and mixes in gritty realism, coupled with very solid cover-based-game play.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  How do you talk about the story in this game without giving away any great details? The story goes in a very unorthodox direction from most Shooter games I've played. Additionally there are choices that you make throughout the game, and it's not just ""go right or go left"" as the saying goes ""indecision is a choice"".In the words of William T. Sherman we hear the well known quote ""War is Hell"" To be quite honest not very many shooter games run with that concept, in Spec Ops: The Line, you will see far more gritty details of consequences of warfare... and the people effected.As a final note regarding the story length, I after playing through the game my first time I put in 5.5 hours. I generally play slower trying to find extra items and do restarts for achievements, so that should be longer then a standard player will take to get through the game.Game Play: Spec Ops: the line is a cover-based third person shooter, meaning while you're being shot at you will move from cover to cover, most of the mechanics are quite straight forward, but do take some getting used too, you can jump over cover, change cover quickly by looking or pressing a movement key in that direction THEN pressing Space, there is a fair bit of learning to be had.It should be noted that the controls will take some getting used too, I had already played a few third person shooters so those old controls were messing me up while I was trying to learn the new ones. Once you learn the controls the rest of the game is quite enjoyable to play through.Even if you're unfamiliar with cover-based-shooters the starting difficulty is friendly enough that you can get the hang of it while gunning down your foes. (I would still recommend getting used to hiding behind cover)Achievements: There are 50 Achievements in Spec Ops: The Line, after my first play through I had 33 of those achievements, there are four achievement category types: Find the lintel (collection), Get kills or special kills with weapons, Make this choice in the story, and standard story quests.Price Spec Ops: The Line is priced at $29.99, by this point most people should be used to games (especially shooters) being priced there, as I always say ""I recommend waiting for a sale"". Conclusion: Spec Ops: The line will appeal most to people who enjoy the two qualities of ""Third person shooter"", and ""story telling"". If you just want a shooter where you run in and pew pew pew, this isn't the right game for you. If you like playing games with meaningful stories, making hard ethical decisions while gaming or just looking for a change of pace this game will provide it.To quickly recap: Story - Outstanding story telling methods. Game Play - Controls might be a bit tricky at first, but the cover based combat is very good. Achievements - Pretty Standard, there are a few tricky looking achievements though. Price - Standard, wait for a sale. "

												This game was the biggest emotional ride ive ever taken in a videogame. The stereotypical gravely voiced protagonist made me actually care about him by actually questioning his actions. Most games dont show the emotions for all the people who are slaughtering (instert american enemy here). This game showed some of the true horrors of war and i love it for that. Be prepared to feel like you had just been punched in the face by the ending. I do wish it was longer than 7 hours tho.			"

												I bought this game, not really knowing what to expect. I had heard it was good and it was on sale so I though ""why not?"".Starting playing it and seemed like a typical FPS war game. The further I got into the game, the more it started to...eat away at me.The decisions that I made. I though that what I was doing was for good. To save people. The further I progressed, the more I started to doubt my decisions and my morals. Was I really saving people? Was I really doing this for good? Or was I doing it for myself?I completed the game and decided to have a 2nd play through to see if my actions and decisions would have a better impact. Now I completed the game twice and I feel an emptiness inside of me. A void which I have trouble dealing with. I lie awake at night thinking about what I had done. How can I save people when I cant save myself?The horror....the horror....			"

												I've played this on a console before and it is safe to say this is one of the best shooter of this generation.Spec Ops does not reinvent the wheel in any way with its mechanics or graphic engine nor brings up action sequences never seen before in the history of gaming and the gameplay is pretty much your usual shooter. The controls are good, the graphics too, but it does nothing different tech-wise from other action games, really. So how can I think so highly of such a ""generic"" game?Well, there the game's plot. It is a reimagination of Josephs Conrad's 1899 short novel ""Heart of Darkness"". Don't worry, I won't spoil anything. While the game kicks of as a standard ""military squad vs the world"" thing as the game progresses it gets darker and darker and what appeared to be just a commom history turns into a very deep critique of violence, human mental health and even the own game industry tendencies, some might say. Well, there's TONS of articles out there the discuss the importance of this game's plot, but you'll have to play first.TL;DR: the game ""disguises"" itself as a generic game (and in its mechanics, it really is) but there is so much subliminar stuff going on in this plot that turns Spec Ops in one bizarre phenomenon of the game industry. I dropped the game a few times because he was just ""OK"" but I'm glad one day I had the motivation to finish. It really is worth it if you're into good stories and some grim♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I really liked the singleplayer experience. Good story, and the voice acting was also spot on.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!This game will make you feel bad, really bad. Seriously. As you progress you will eventually (if you live into the game as i did) realize that you are the bad guy here. Especially at the part where those civilians killed off Lugo, i felt anger and wanted to end every single life of those ♥♥♥♥ers. You believe along the whole game that you are doing all this for the greater good.. but in the end, you were so focused on taking Konrad down that you completely derail from your original objective and that eventually lead you to your own downfall.Can't say the same for the multiplayer part, it feels like a degraded dull third person edition of Call of Duty with a touch of sandstorms. If you are in cover and a grenade lands in front of you.. you are ♥♥♥♥ed, no time to run away and i feel (my opinion) that the cover system is bugged. To be honest, it feels like it doesn't even belong here and was just added for the sake of ""we need people to come back to our game"" but fail miserably. I played a couple of hours just to get a hang of the multiplayer i got to rank 10 or so.. Absolutely garbage. Also, if you hope to find alot of multiplayer action, you will be disappointed. There's almost nobody playing it anymore and finding servers will take alot of time.But i will recommend the game anyway for the amazing singleplayer experience!			"

												I really liked the singleplayer experience. Good story, and the voice acting was also spot on.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!This game will make you feel bad, really bad. Seriously. As you progress you will eventually (if you live into the game as i did) realize that you are the bad guy here. Especially at the part where those civilians killed off Lugo, i felt anger and wanted to end every single life of those ♥♥♥♥ers. You believe along the whole game that you are doing all this for the greater good.. but in the end, you were so focused on taking Konrad down that you completely derail from your original objective and that eventually lead you to your own downfall.Can't say the same for the multiplayer part, it feels like a degraded dull third person edition of Call of Duty with a touch of sandstorms. If you are in cover and a grenade lands in front of you.. you are ♥♥♥♥ed, no time to run away and i feel (my opinion) that the cover system is bugged. To be honest, it feels like it doesn't even belong here and was just added for the sake of ""we need people to come back to our game"" but fail miserably. I played a couple of hours just to get a hang of the multiplayer i got to rank 10 or so.. Absolutely garbage. Also, if you hope to find alot of multiplayer action, you will be disappointed. There's almost nobody playing it anymore and finding servers will take alot of time.But i will recommend the game anyway for the amazing singleplayer experience!			"

												I appreciate Spec Ops: The Line for being one of those rare games that actually tries to make you actually think about and feel bad for killing people. It's a bit more heavy-handed than other games that also try to make you feel for those you are killing (for example, the original Deus Ex, and This War of Mine), but the heavy-handedness and extreme situations you are in where you do extreme things seems to be one of the main focuses of the game. The setting is interesting: Dubai after it has been ravaged and isolated by lethal freak sandstorms. The gameplay is that of a typical 3rd person cover-based shooter, but the dialogue and in-game choices make you think more about what you are doing, and the overall story and relatively mature treatment of killing compared to other military shooters definitely make the game worth playing if you are familiar with the genre.

												I've played this on a console before and it is safe to say this is one of the best shooter of this generation.Spec Ops does not reinvent the wheel in any way with its mechanics or graphic engine nor brings up action sequences never seen before in the history of gaming and the gameplay is pretty much your usual shooter. The controls are good, the graphics too, but it does nothing different tech-wise from other action games, really. So how can I think so highly of such a ""generic"" game?Well, there the game's plot. It is a reimagination of Josephs Conrad's 1899 short novel ""Heart of Darkness"". Don't worry, I won't spoil anything. While the game kicks of as a standard ""military squad vs the world"" thing as the game progresses it gets darker and darker and what appeared to be just a commom history turns into a very deep critique of violence, human mental health and even the own game industry tendencies, some might say. Well, there's TONS of articles out there the discuss the importance of this game's plot, but you'll have to play first.TL;DR: the game ""disguises"" itself as a generic game (and in its mechanics, it really is) but there is so much subliminar stuff going on in this plot that turns Spec Ops in one bizarre phenomenon of the game industry. I dropped the game a few times because he was just ""OK"" but I'm glad one day I had the motivation to finish. It really is worth it if you're into good stories and some grim♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a decent third person action shooter with an amazing single player campaign story! You play as captain walker, a delta squad leader who thinks that he is helping the survivors in dubai with his actions but not everything is as it seems... During several moments in the campaign, you are given moral choices and what you choose would affect the narrative of the story in a small extent. There are also plot twists in the story which might surprise you and would also entice you to play more to find out more of the story.The gunplay is pretty standard but decent. It is basically a cover based third person shooter with a good variety of guns. The game is also really challenging on a higher difficulty as you can die in around two shots and that would encourage you to make use of the cover system more if you do not want to die. The character models looks really dated at the time of this review, however the environment (e.g Buildings, shops, desert, etc ) looks really detailed and beautiful.The multiplayer and co-op of this game is basically dead at the point of this review as I could not find anyone in matchmaking. However, you can still play the co-op mode alone or with a friend. There are only 4 missions in the co-op mode and they are really short and is also not replayable as the same mission would play out the same way everytime.In conclusion, the single player campaign has a great story with a serviceable third person shooter gunplay mechanic. The multiplayer and co-op matchmaking are dead and not worth checking out. If I were to rate this game, I would give it a 6/10!			"

												Disguised as your standard third person shooter, this game is a thinly veiled critique of the military shooter genre. It also pulls no punches when it comes to the sheer horror of war and chemical weapons. This game will make you question what kind of person you, and the protagonist are. It will horrify and sicken you where appropriate... This may not be a 'fun' game the same as some, but it is a game definitely worthy of your attention and money.			"

												Underated game. Glad i picked this up. At first glance it looks like any other 'pew pew murica to the rescue' sort of shooter but it goes far beyond that. Gameplay seems pretty generic but the battles are quite fast paced and action packed. The environment is really cool. Fighting amongst a city swallowed by sand is defs one the games coolest features.Now for the games winning feature..the story.Words dont do it justice. The story sheds light on the side of warfare that is not often seen. It brings forward the harsh realities of warfare, how it changes people, that sometimes there are are no right choices. The game forces you to make choices that are definetely not easy to make and you will hate yourself for making them. Give this a playthrough if you see this on sale. It will seriously suprise you.

												This is a truthful, heartfelt and deeply grim perspective of war. As close as we gamers will ever get to the real feel of what it is like. The real depth and weight of our actions.For years we have been desensitized to violence. To be taught it's kill or be killed - and the more gratuitous the kill the better the gameplay is. We never truly feel the weight of the kills we so effortlessly dish out to anyone who dare stand opposite of us. We're just trying to get from point A to point B and kill as many as possible.Spec Ops: The Line changes the formula of traditional military shooters really making your decisions resonate with you. Making you thoroughly evaluate your moral scale and the horrific decisions you will have to face during war.Absolutely outstanding, it made me feel like a monster when I was fighting for my life.Highly, highly recommended.10/10			"

												A game that cannot be summarised in few words... I mean, sure it can but it just won't do it justice. When I started playing this game I expected I would have a fun action shooter taking pleasure in blasting one enemy after another, when I was around half of the game, instead of pleasure I felt uncertainty... I felt something was wrong. When I reached the end I was left moraly devastated. There is a small coop multiplayer (4 missions) and a Call of Duty inspired regular Multiplayer (create a class, perks, customization etc) but the greatest thing about this game is the story... and sometimes the landscape of Dubai devastated by sandstorm can be breathtaking and the setting alone is a strong argument to take this amazing trip to sandy HELL  }:->==			"

												Any attempt to describe this game is futile - to truly grasp what it has to say, you just have to experience it. It's almost more an interactive piece of artwork (not in the sense that it's aesthetically pleasing, but in the sense that it challenges your preconceptions and forces you to view something in a new light) than a game.   Overall, playing SO:TL is a rather unpleasant experience, but if you step across the line you'll be rewarded with a thought-provoking meta-commentary on the shooter genre, choice in games, and the act of gaming itself.

The story in this game kept me hooked and you could say it has corrolations to ""Apocolypse Now"" but it is an interesting story that keeps you riveted, good characters, believable situations and their reactions make this game a gem. In a game genre plauged by ""Super Soldier YOLONOSCOPE360BRO"" Its nice to see a soldier act like a human being upon seeing an attrocity. Its a great story based title that I Highly Recommend!			"

In gunfights it often happens your character doesn't do what you want him to do. For example, your character hides behind a wall. Then the enemy throws a nade at you and you are forced to run away. Stupidly there is a team mate next to you who went down just before. So instead of running off like a ♥♥♥♥♥ you help your team mate. At the end you both die. Situations like that happen very often. Hence you die often.I didn't try the multiplayer. Frankly I'm not interested in.			"

However, all this is tolerable.As for the story, I can't remember any other action game that carried such a strong anti-war message. The closest thing that comes to my mind is not even a game, but a movie ""Apocalypse Now"". The protagonist descends into his own world of madness. Through his eyes you will see the real side of the war: not the heroic propaganda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but despicable, unimaginable scenes you wish you'd never seen.Spec Ops: The Line does a 100% fine job of making you remember that while you live your comfy life, somewhere in the world there's war going on.

												I've had this game for a while now and have just got to playing it, and I have to ask myself: Why have I not played this sooner?Without spoiling anything, the story and plot are completely beautiful and heartwrenching, on the edge of your seat surprising, and will completely question your morales and those of the characters you interact and meet. I jumped in expecting another mindless shooter with loose story, but found myself in love with this game and its story.On the technical aspect, the gameplay is relatively simple and easy. Suicide difficulty is not incredibly challenging, but a large factor of combat is to utilise your Delta squad and hide behind cover. The game can be completed in under 7 hours, probably less, which seems perfect as the story isn't drawn on and combat seems fast enough behind cover that you aren't getting entirely bored. Graphically, I am also surprised at how beautiful this game can look. Your Delta squad continues to degrade and gain battle scars, blood, and torn clothing as the game progresses and otherwise looks like days of fighting in Dubai. The scenery and city looks amazing as well! I play with a GIGABYTE P35K-1 with nVidia GTX 765m and ran everything to the max and had no flops.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 6/10Graphics: 9/10Strength of Denial: 100/10			"

												What can be said about Spec Ops The Line? This is a tough one. I mean it is a ♥♥♥♥ing cool game, but the emotions it gives you can really be tough to deal with. Games with  Stories like this should be in every gamers library and every gamer and non gamer should experience a story like this.  We hold for granted what war is actually like. We go around blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and blasting the ♥♥♥♥ out of whatever moves without any ideas to the reality, the actual truth of war. I recognize first hand what war can do to somebody. I know the mind can become damaged with PTSD. My father is a Vietnam veteran and is  100% disabled with PTSD. He has been suffering all his life and will for the remainder of his lifetime. We don't understand the horrors and choices of war if we have never experienced them for ourselves. Well, this game brings out some of those feelings and choices that War can bring people to. What is right or what is wrong? Who is bad and who is good? What must we do to survive?  The game play is not the greatest cutting edge style.. You may get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at your NPCs or at the controls of your character, but the story and really nice visuals will overpower these flaws. Don't get me wrong the gameplay is fun. I truly love playing cover style shooters. They just seem more real to me because if you're in a fire fight the first thing you're going to do is jump behind whatever you can. The cover system does have its flaws, but nothing that ruins the fun.  If you want a game that is not your typical shooter a game that really gives you tough choices you should play this game..This game is the chronic♥♥♥♥♥♥

												Spec Ops: The Line is the hidden gem of 2012. FTL would be my ""hidden gem,"" but after the whole massive Kickstarter success thing, it was obvious FTL was going to be good in my point of view. Honestly, I used to play Call of Duty and Halo. There. I said it. However, after Black Ops 1, I quit the Call of Duty series and haven't played any of the games since MW3. Halo Reach was the Halo that I played the most, and was the only Halo game (Halo 3 and Wars were good though) that I loved and played often. However, above all of these games, Spec Ops: The Line has one of the best stories of all time. It isn't like Call of Duty how you're fighting as some American soldier running around solo armed to the teeth with weapons and murdering terrorists and in the end ""saving the world."" Not at all. Some people believe there are ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" but this game is solid evidence that war is just opinions being decided to the death, sometimes costing one's sanity, social health, emotional health, and physical health. Spec Ops: The Line proves war in no way is enjoyable, cool, or humorous in any kind of way. War is horrific, and this game is enough to prove that.GraphicsThe visuals are absolutely outstanding. The environments look beautiful, and the atmosphere is bright on the outside, but dark and horrific on the inside. The characters look amazing, and it's rare you can actually see the sweat of a character in the middle of combat. This game is able to do that. If I were to compare these visuals to The Last of Us, Spec Ops: The Line would win by a mile. These graphics are extremely realistic, but the only con to this is that the facial animations can look weird. For example, when Walker is talking to Lugo or Adams when it isn't a cutscene, it looks like he's gaping every time, like he's shocked at everything for some reason. During cutscenes though, Walker looks fine and doesn't gape like that when he speaks.GameplayThe gameplay is suprisingly the weak point to the game. Although this game is a shooter, Spec Ops is more for people who want a story based game, rather than a gameplay based one. The AI is suicidally bad and the difficulty spikes at times and the awful gunplay ruins it even more. My squadmates keep bumping into me and I die, one enemy shot 3 RPG rockets in a row without reloading for some reason (He had an RPG, I saw him with the weapon, I swear!) and the AI prefer running toward me like overconfident barbarians. However, the game understands the meaning of ""limited"" unlike other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough* *cough* and makes ammo a bit more difficult to get, so that's something few games did that aren't in the zombie survival genre. StoryThe story is the reason Spec Ops is highly praised. Like I said before, it proves that war is a terrible thing and (quoted from Fallout 3) ""never changes."" Lugo, Adams, and Walker's bond with each other was strong, like they were old friends, then all of a sudden, Lugo and Adams part away from Walker, realizing that he's gone insane, but Adams is still merely following orders, while Lugo wants to make a stand. You realize that Walker is in no way a hero, but calling him a villain is illogical. The plot twist around the midst of the game was amazing and blew my mind. I'm going to do another quote, but this time from one of my favorite songs: ""This ain't no place for no hero, this ain't no place for no- better man, this ain't no place for no hero, to call home."" -""Short Change Hero"" by The Heavy. It perfectly describes the story, mixed with the atmosphere, and how the characters develop over time in the destroyed and now insane city of Dubai. I assure you, this game has one of the finest stories in gaming. It seems like 2012 was the year for gaming, since games like this and The Walking Dead came out and wowed us with their storytelling. In the end, the story for this game is simply outstanding.AudioThe audio is also amazing for this game. The voice actors did an amazing job with their roles, and all showed personality. They  weren't androids and were kind of like the Mass Effect characters, in a way you grow attached to them because they feel like real, breathing humans. But you still gotta hate Walker. Then, hate yourself while you're at it for doing all the harsh decisions. Name me a few other games that truly make you want to hate yourself that much. The music is similar to those found in a zombie apocalypse game, like the recent ones State of Decay and The Last of Us. It's usually a guitar backed up by a few other instruments or the guitar playing solo. It sounds beautiful and fits in perfectly. The audio in this game is some of the finest in recent gaming.ReplayabilityIt's a bit more difficult to provide replayability to a game like this, unfortunately. However, you could go back and get all the endings. The multiplayer is pretty dead, so I haven't had any chance to try it yet. Either way, I suppose the replayability in this game is determinant. VerdictIn conclusion, Spec Ops: The Line proves war is terrifying and that it's not fun at all. However, the horrible gameplay holds it down significantly, along with a dead multiplayer and the jaw drops that happen when Walker talks while playing (Not in a cutscene) hold it back. Either way, Spec Ops: The Line is a must have for any story based game buyer.

Shooting out windows and burying enemies in sand)- Default controls were an odd choice, and felt counterintutive; I recommend changing them- Sprint function was poorly implement, and sometimes won't behave, leaving you out in the open trying to get a handle on your character's movementLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												+ environment/landscape+ action+ make decisions at some points in the story (even though they don't affect the story massively)+ music+ external co-op- WORST CONTROLS I'VE EVER HAD >they really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off in ""FUBAR""- many things remind you of other games (e.g. CoDMW)- bots just suck- just four maps on co-opAddition to the controls: There is only one key you can choose for the orders ""running, taking cover, jumping down, helping team mates"". In gunfights it often happens your character doesn't do what you want him to do. For example, your character hides behind a wall. Then the enemy throws a nade at you and you are forced to run away. Stupidly there is a team mate next to you who went down just before. So instead of running off like a ♥♥♥♥♥ you help your team mate. At the end you both die. Situations like that happen very often. Hence you die often.I didn't try the multiplayer. Frankly I'm not interested in.			"

												There's not much to tell about this shooter gameplaywise: an intense shoot'n'roll with dumb team AI. However, all this is tolerable.As for the story, I can't remember any other action game that carried such a strong anti-war message. The closest thing that comes to my mind is not even a game, but a movie ""Apocalypse Now"". The protagonist descends into his own world of madness. Through his eyes you will see the real side of the war: not the heroic propaganda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but despicable, unimaginable scenes you wish you'd never seen.Spec Ops: The Line does a 100% fine job of making you remember that while you live your comfy life, somewhere in the world there's war going on. And it's nothing but horror.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line it's a third person shooter released in 2012 by 2k Games. It looks really generic and for absolutely sure I can tell you that there's nothing generic about this game.Yeah the gameplay it's not something out of the box, but it's well crafted, a lot of weapon diversity, online cooperative and also a bunch of achievements to go for.But the point here it's the story, the details of it that makes this game so enjoyable. You're Cpt. Walker, accompained by Lt. Adams and Ssgt. Lugo, you three are sent as a three-man Delta Force team to carry out reconnaissance.You will really get into it and will question every decision that you and your fellas make. In fact your decisions impact the ending of the game. I won't spoil anything, but for sure it's not easy to be a hero.Spec Ops shows what many shooters can't achieve: a great story combined with a well crafted gameplay.Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai.			"

												“It takes a strong man to deny what's right in front of him.”Spec Ops: The Line is the prime example of how you should never judge a book by it’s cover. The first thought anyone had when they first saw this game is that is a bland simple modern military shooter.Spec Ops: The Line provided one of the most amazing story experiences I’ve ever had from a shooter, proving that not all of them have to be bland stories.This has to be one of the only games that have actually made me feel bad for doing what I’ve done. Things the game told me to do. I had to do these horrible things, murdering people to progress with the story, but was it the right thing? Was it better I not play in the first place?This feeling is resonated in the protagonist own character arch, did Walker have a choice to do what he did? Was it truly his fault? Who should pay for his crimes?The game-play is average, the shooting is fun and challenging at points, and you certainly won’t be bored. There is also an additional option to command your squad mates to shoot certain “enemies” and help heal other. It’s simple and it works. I feel as though the game is making a even further point with it's game-play. It’s fairly mundane, making the whole point of the story even more profound. You went through the whole game mindlessly killing people without a second thought.If you're looking for a good story and don't mind the typical shooter gameplay, pick it up.			"

Graphics are very beautiful in parts.AI squad controls are limited to kills only ( Pity ).I heard this game was quite crap from a lot of reports, but I got it anyway (lol, never trust reviews).Put off playing this for the longest of times.Pleasently suprised by how well things fit in this game.Find the enemy AI is good on the 2nd hardest level.Multiple ways of doing things ( even for an on the rail shooter).Moral Dilemas etc.In all, If you don't have this in your collection then you are missing out.:)			"

												I don't often go out of my way to review games. But this game? As a a gamer in the first person shooter era - and especially being an American - I feel this piece of art should be experienced unspoilt by everyone. No other game will make you feel so strongly connected to a storyline as this one will.Spec Ops the line has fairly average third person shooter mechanics. This sounds like a negative: it isn't. Why? Because Spec Ops: The Line is a commentary as much as it is a game. Since the story is what makes this game gold, I'll avoid saying too much, but the game does a good job of making the player aware of the struggles on all sides of war. On top of this, it continually references the destructive military culture of America, and questions the player whether they are truly okay with the way media treats war in general.It's all done in a way that simply poses a question : Do you feel like a hero yet?

												I've heard plenty of good things about Spec Ops: The Line, but it's one of those games that's been sitting in my library for years, and never actually played it until recently. Definitely should have started it sooner!Interesting characters, great voice acting, fitting music, wrapped up with a compelling story. Only gripe I have with the game would be the actual combat. Although it's not bad (plenty of fun mowing down enemies, or getting those headshots) it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Every other aspect of this game makes up for the medicore combat. Definitely one of the more memorable shooter game I've played.Pros:+ Compelling Story/Choices+ Good Graphics/Music+ Interesting CharactersCons:- Mediocre Combat- Clunky movement in close quarters (melee/jump over is the same key.)

												Well... this was certainly something. Spec Ops: The Line mechanics-like is a competent shooter, even if PC port is a bit crappy. Shooting mechanics would play better with a controller, but they work just fine with mouse and keyboard. What really distinguishes this game from other shooters is the story. Don't get me wrong, it's not a really great story with powerful characters. What this game does is... it shows the war. And it shows how morality gradually ceases to exist in a combat zone. It has some really powerful images, and is quite unforgiving showing them. It plays well, and I recommend it for everyone who still thinks that war is fun. Some images shown by this are almost too much to handle for an anverage consumer... but the game is worth playing. Okay, time to stop this blabbering and play some more stuff.			"

In terms of gameplay it's nothing special. This is your standard third person shooter with cover mechanics, but it's fluid and gets the job done. The story on the other hand, is something everybody should experience.Such a great game. Dubai as a setting was perfect.8/10★★★★			"

Gameplay is nothing unforgettable, sometimes even tedious, yet it actually helps you to understand some of the game's points in a weird way. To get what I'm saying you will need to play the game.

												Specs Ops the Line is so much more than just a tactical shooter: it's a wonderful experience.You will find yourself in emotional situations, taking imposible decisions, regreting them every step of the way. This game is so complex it feels like a Nolan's movie at times, it even messes with you in the loading screens. The graphics are very committed to the desert feel but still manages to take your breath away at times. The music is just amazing, ranging from Hard Rock to Motown and you may feel not all this songs are fitting to a shooting game, but they are to the emotional feeling of it, which is the game's strongest point.One of the only downsides is how the difficulty scalates, I was so mindblown by this game I decided to replay it in the FUBAR difficulty, which is the hardest possible, it gets you thinking outside the box most of the time, looking for different ways to achive your objective, picking your shots carefully, but sadly at times it's just ridiculously hard with unskippable instadeath scenes that you will replay DOZENS of times to get through by sheer luck, and it feels like the game is trying to be longer in a really cheap way.Other than that this game is a jewel that deserves to be appreciated.I am yet to try the coop mode, will update this review when I do.

												You know, I would have already recommended this game on the basis that it's a well-disguised pushback against the insane military worship present not only in video games like Call of Duty and Battlefield 3, but in American culture in general. But it's also a pushback against American imperialism, military intervention, our actions towards the Middle East, war itself, and also the player for going along with the game, no matter how insane it gets. It's a thoroughly horrifying game and I'm frankly surprised to see that it even got published at all. And the genius of it is it's like Call of Duty mixed with Gears of War, so any teenage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can just get sucked into it and then made completely horrified. Get it for the kids at Christmas!			"

												Este juego representa lo que es tener un viaje por la ciudad de Dubai invadida de tormentas de arena y un protagonista completamente enfermo. Un juego de pura calidad con una historia de locos pero...corto como siempre, aunque valdra la pena, y seguramente lo rejugaran, menos el Multiplayer que lo vi abandonado.8/10			"

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played.Why?The gameplay is pretty standard fare for the shooter genre, with some somewhat interesting squad dynamics thrown in. I've heard the multiplayer is terrible, if you can find anyone still playing it at all. So why is this game so amazing? The story in the campaign. It plays on your psyche, messes with your head, and makes you question why you even play games like this. It's a critique of the entire genre, one that desperately needed to be made. Why do we, as gamers, typically like to shoot things for fun? Is killing people in a video game truly harmless? If so, should we still enjoy it as much as we do?The story draws from some classics for inspiration (most notably Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad), but it takes what it needs and expands on the rest. It takes some classic conventions, and finds a way to use that to tell its own story, and tell a completely new and fresh message.""To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless.""			"

												The truth is, you're reading this review because you wanted to feel like something you're not... a Gamer.This game is not fun, but it is engaging. You'll feel bad. Unless you are an evil person. Cognative dissonance is alive and well with this game. Although the mechanics and graphics feel like something from 2008, the story, emersion (or lack thereof) swath the player into examining his or her choices in a manner that most modern games simply do not.I beat the game in about 5 or 6 hours. I got it on sale for 6 bux. I recommend picking this title up on sale most certainly, but I also recommend picking this title up for a ""modern warfare first person shooter"" title that is anything but a modern first person warfare shooter.

Para análise em português, leia mais abaixo.Spec Ops The Line - Review: Lost and DamnedDubai. An oasis of technology and lust in the middle of desert. Magnificent buildings in a developed city. But nature is always more ruthless than our ability to oppose. Destroyed by intense sandstorms, a city in ruins. The 33rd Battalion of the American army is sent to town for a rescue and extraction operation of the survivors. And then, they disappear from the map.You are Captain Martin Walker, leader of an elite team of Delta Force of the Army of the United States of America, leading his fellow Lieutenant Alphanso Adams, heavy gunner and Sergeant John Lugo, sniper. Sent to Dubai after a transmission captured after six months without contact, his mission is to locate, reunite and rescue possible survivors.Beautiful scenarios, even among ruins. The opulence of Dubai can be seen in the ruins and in few places that remained intact. Even the desert, displays an exotic beauty that brings a melancholy tone to the game.Spec Ops is not just a shooting game in third person. It is a psychological plot. Every dialogue, every action, every event in this journey shows you more than bullets flying. Dubai is alive. Dubai is at war. And war... war never changes. The horrors of war are not shown as simple digital polygons falling to the ground with AI off. You will really feel them. You will hesitate. You will have anger and and will be thrilled. And maybe you even cry. You'll be confused. Do not stop. Go straight. Reflect, try to understand. Do not come to this game to play. Come to this story to live it. And so, you will not regret it.Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai.  My Personal Score   Fun: 9/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Ambientation: 9/10   History: 10/10   Replayability: 6/10   Multiplayer: 1/10 --Spec Ops The Line - Análise: Perdidos e CondenadosDubai. Um oásis de tecnologia e luxuria em pleno deserto. Construções magníficas em uma cidade extremamente desenvolvida. Mas a natureza, é sempre mais impiedosa do que nossa capacidade de nos opor. Destruída por intensas tempestades de areia, uma cidade em ruínas. O 33º batalhão do exército americano é enviado a cidade para uma operação de resgate e extração dos sobreviventes. E então, eles desaparecem do mapa.Você é o Capitão Martin Walker, líder de uma equipe de elite da Força Delta do Exército dos Estados Unidos da América, liderando seus companheiros Tenente Alphanso Adams, artilheiro pesado e Sargento John Lugo, franco-atirador. Enviados a Dubai após uma transmissão ser captada depois de 6 meses sem contato, sua missão é localizar, reunir e resgatar possíveis sobreviventes.Belos cenários, mesmo entre ruínas. A opulência de Dubai se destaca em traços que podem ser percebidos nas ruínas e em poucos lugares sobreviventes. Mesmo o deserto, exibe uma exótica beleza que traz um tom melancólico ao jogo.Spec Ops não é apenas um jogo de tiro em terceira pessoa. É uma trama psicológica. Cada diálogo, cada ação, cada acontecimento nesta jornada te mostra mais do que balas voando. Dubai está viva. Dubai está em guerra. E a guerra... a guerra nunca muda. Os horrores da guerra não são mostrados como simples polígonos digitais caindo ao chão com IA desligada. Você realmente irá sentí-los. Você irá hesitar. Você terá raiva e se emocionará. E talvez, você até mesmo chore. Você ficará confuso. Não pare. Siga em frente. Reflita, procure compreender. Não venha a este jogo para jogar. Venha a esta história para vivê-la. E assim, você não irá se arrepender.Senhores, bem-vindos a Dubai.

												Well... this was certainly something. Spec Ops: The Line mechanics-like is a competent shooter, even if PC port is a bit crappy. Shooting mechanics would play better with a controller, but they work just fine with mouse and keyboard. What really distinguishes this game from other shooters is the story. Don't get me wrong, it's not a really great story with powerful characters. What this game does is... it shows the war. And it shows how morality gradually ceases to exist in a combat zone. It has some really powerful images, and is quite unforgiving showing them. It plays well, and I recommend it for everyone who still thinks that war is fun. Some images shown by this are almost too much to handle for an anverage consumer... but the game is worth playing. Okay, time to stop this blabbering and play some more stuff.			"

												Don't think I've ever played anything quite like this. Not your typical gung ho shooter in the slightest. The actual gameplay is solid but the story is where it really shines. It's actually pretty subversive and it's clear the writers put a lot of thought into it. I don't want to say too much about the plot as I'd hate to spoil it but it should be experienced by anyone that likes shooters.The setting deserves a mention too. It looked fantastic and was dripping in atmosphere.Sounds wrong to say I enjoyed it as some parts are pretty gut wrenching but it's easy to recommend. Just don't blast through it like you would any other shooter. Taking in the plot, dialogue and your surroundings really pays off. A contender for my game of the year which is a huge surprise as it hadn't been on my radar at all until I picked it up extremely cheap in the sale.			"

Please note that the game itself is not bad, but it seems way too hyped for what it is.I usually don't play war themed FPS, so maуbe because of it I haven't been able to see how is this game so much better than your usual war FPS.PROS:The story is nice, although I don't really see it as good as many people who think this is an excellent story. Seen way better stories elsewhere, but then again I'm not much into this genre.Graphics are pretty good.Levels are different and using sand to bury enemies is pretty cool.CONS:  There no way to be politically correct about this. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Enemies run towards you from cover while having ranged weapons. Allies run in front of you while you shoot, to find cover on the other side of the map. Finally, they find cover on the opposite side of the frigging ENEMY'S THIN COVER. They are like 15 cm apart from each other. It looks ridiculous. Controls can suck sometimes, or at least they did for me. Sprint was constantly delayed and for some reason my aim mode went on and off, even though I am holding RMB at all times. I was expecting a war themed game where you have to make difficult moral decisions. Those are few and far between and  they don't matter  "

Definitely should have started it sooner!Interesting characters, great voice acting, fitting music, wrapped up with a compelling story. Only gripe I have with the game would be the actual combat. Although it's not bad (plenty of fun mowing down enemies, or getting those headshots) it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Every other aspect of this game makes up for the medicore combat. Definitely one of the more memorable shooter game I've played.Pros:+ Compelling Story/Choices+ Good Graphics/Music+ Interesting CharactersCons:- Mediocre Combat- Clunky movement in close quarters (melee/jump over is the same key.)

												Not to be dramatic, but this is likely a historical game for the games industry.Never has a game made me actually feel the horrors of war, made me feel horrible, even physically sick after specific moments.What's impressive his how... seamless the combat is. Its nothing that really stands out, unless you cound nice responsive controls and good feedback special, because it almost is nowadays. But whats important is that it doesn't detract from the narrative, which makes it all the more impacting. I won't spoil anything, but the plot mainly focuses on PTSD, as well as commenting on the current trend of Modern War, essentially saying they're bad like we already knew. But the best part is that it presents itself like one of these Call of Duty like games, drawing you in with this illusion of turning your brain off for the fun.In short, amazing narrative, game of the decade, must buy.

												Spec Ops: The Line is a marvelous game. While the gameplay isn't revolutionary, the storytelling is the real gem here. Spec Ops does a great job revealing the fragile nature of humanity, and then smashes it like a cheap vodka bottle.After playing through several missions, you'll slowly realize how messed up reality is. While you spend alot of your time dodging bullets, and the ever changing enviroment, you'll find the enemy trying to out manuver you.Overall, I'd suggest playing this game. Even if you don't like the gameplay, the story is intriguing. If anything, it's an excellent game to see friend's reactions.			"

												Specs Ops the Line is so much more than just a tactical shooter: it's a wonderful experience.You will find yourself in emotional situations, taking imposible decisions, regreting them every step of the way. This game is so complex it feels like a Nolan's movie at times, it even messes with you in the loading screens. The graphics are very committed to the desert feel but still manages to take your breath away at times. The music is just amazing, ranging from Hard Rock to Motown and you may feel not all this songs are fitting to a shooting game, but they are to the emotional feeling of it, which is the game's strongest point.One of the only downsides is how the difficulty scalates, I was so mindblown by this game I decided to replay it in the FUBAR difficulty, which is the hardest possible, it gets you thinking outside the box most of the time, looking for different ways to achive your objective, picking your shots carefully, but sadly at times it's just ridiculously hard with unskippable instadeath scenes that you will replay DOZENS of times to get through by sheer luck, and it feels like the game is trying to be longer in a really cheap way.Other than that this game is a jewel that deserves to be appreciated.I am yet to try the coop mode, will update this review when I do.

												Prefer engaging storyline over gameplay? Then this is the game you are looking for.Can't stand a game if gameplay is too linear? You'll probably get bored real soon.Know what to expect from a game before playing it & you are gonna enjoy.Gameplay wise Spec Ops The Line doesn't offer much of a variation really & fails to distinguish itself from being too niche & generic like other typical war shooting games. Basically shoot everyone you see.But you hardly care about that as you already find yourself engrossed in the atrocious turn of events that's been occurring around you. The story & the protagonist, despite being a work of fiction, feels very much real & human-like & is an impeccable example of the viciousness of war which can drive even the strongest minds into the pitfall of despair.P.S.- Play it in the highest difficulty possible to really enjoy it!Welcome into the madness, Captain!

												An interesting take on a modern shooter game, with a well written story that is as far from the standard shooter game narrative as you can get.It makes the player think rather than run around with a gun celebrating violence and the myth of a clear line between the good and bad guys.The guys at Yager did a great job, and I would recommend this game for anyone who is interested in a deep thought provoking storyline.The multiplayer was an unneccessary addition that brings nothing to the games single player experience, but that should not stop you from getting it, this was always intended to be a single player game only.

												There's no right side in a war. This is what Spec Ops: The Line teaches you, without censures, making you do very hard moral choices and with the devastating plot twist at the very end. The gameplay is always incredibly adrenalinic and when the action stops you will be amazed by the views of a post apocalyptic-like Dubai. Graphics, sound track and weapons feeling are great. Something new in the FPS genre that every kind of player can enjoy.			"

Verdict:Buy now! Buy on saleSave your moneySummary:Spec Ops: The Line is your fairly run of the mill 3rd person shooter, with one exception - the story. Without giving away anything, the story is gritty and engaging and the game is worth playing for that alone. Some of the action parts will seem a little silly as you mow down countless enemies but generally the game is well paced and the story keeps you hooked and wanting more.The game itself is short (it will take you around 5 or so hours to complete if you don't rush) but in this case that's not a bad thing, as any longer would just drag it out and negate the impact of the story.That said, given the relatively short life span of the game, I recommend you pick it up on sale.Overall Score:7.5/10The Good:Fantastic story lineThe atmosphere is gritty and visceralCombat is done and well and enjoyable if you don't take it too seriouslyThe Bad:Apart from the story, there is nothing here to distinguish this from your average 3rd person shooterThe Ugly:The price (given the game is over 3 years old) - pick it up on sale "

												There were over five thousand people alive in this city, the day before you arrived. How many are alive today, I wonder? How many will be alive tomorrow? Story Captain Walker, sergeant Lugo and lieutenant Adams go to the destroyed city of Dubai to rescue any survivors that they are able to find. At least, that is what they think they are doing here. Upon arriving in Dubai the Damned 33d is in a war with the CIA over control of the destroyed city. Many civilians are still alive and breathing, but know no rescue is coming for them. Walker and his comrades walked straight into hell and need to get out, even if this means doing some of the most inhumane things. The story is the best aspect of the game, everybody who likes third person shooters should've experienced this story. Gameplay Spec Ops: The Line is a simple third person shooter, with fair third person shooting mechanics. You, Captain Walker, can take two weapons with you everywhere you go, but these weapons can go out of ammo fast so you'll have to pick up weapons from your dead enemies. sergeant Lugo and lieutenant Adams are some very helpful friends. You can order them to kill a specific enemy, which is very handy from time to time. Sergeant Lugo is able to make long ranged shots with his sniper rifle and lieutenant Adams is able to flash your enemies if they're standing in a small group. They gameplay may be a bit clunky, but fun for the duration of the game. Conclusion A solid third person shooter with an amazing storyline, every chapter has its own setting and never really gets boring. The game has multiple endings and choices to make, so a there is some replayability. Spec Ops: The Line is a game everyone should at least played once purely for it's amazing story. The gameplay does have some hiccups, but can be forgiven. 7.5/10  "

												Surprisingly good. Spec Ops: The Line is not just another shooter set in the modern day. It's very story-focused, putting you into the shoes of Captain Walker and his squadmates, and making you live through the harrowing events they had to face when deployed in war-torn Dubai. The game has a very cinematic feel to it. The scenes build up gradually to big climaxes, and the squadmates discussing what's going on and arguing with one another the entire time, making them seem like real people and not just mindless NPCs. In addition, the game presents you with some moral choices at times, making you think twice on your decisions and putting you in situations where neither choice can be considered good. Without giving away any spoilers, the game concludes on a mindblowing ending, or more precisely - endings, whilst leaving some ambiguity behind to let the players interpret the rest. I would highly suggest to play the game to the end and then to check the Youtube videos to see all the endings and their interpretations. Story aside, the gameplay is pretty fun as well. The combat is fun and for the most part consists of your typical third-person cover-based gunfights. There is some variety in the environments where you fight, ranging from desert outposts to insides of malls and other semi-broken buildings, as well as rooftops. This in turn presents some interesting challenges from time to time, such as defence sections and the like. It could get a bit repetitive, however, and some of the bigger gunfights do feel a bit messy at times. Additionally, the squadmates and the enemies wear similar-coloured uniforms, so it's very easy to mistake a fellow ally for an enemy during a heated combat. The crosshairs of some weapons turn red when on the enemy, but this isn't the case for all weapons, so it's easy to accidentally hurt your allies.Overall I've enjoyed my time with this game. Although the combat started to get repetitive and a bit frustrating towards the end, the story makes it well worth playing the game through from start to finish. Recommended.			"

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played.Why?The gameplay is pretty standard fare for the shooter genre, with some somewhat interesting squad dynamics thrown in. I've heard the multiplayer is terrible, if you can find anyone still playing it at all. So why is this game so amazing? The story in the campaign. It plays on your psyche, messes with your head, and makes you question why you even play games like this. It's a critique of the entire genre, one that desperately needed to be made. Why do we, as gamers, typically like to shoot things for fun? Is killing people in a video game truly harmless? If so, should we still enjoy it as much as we do?The story draws from some classics for inspiration (most notably Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad), but it takes what it needs and expands on the rest. It takes some classic conventions, and finds a way to use that to tell its own story, and tell a completely new and fresh message.""To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless.""			"

												The Dubai Game! Really, just for its setting it's worth being played. Spec Ops puts you in the shoes of a Delta Force squad leader who - along with two members of the same squad - must uncover the truth behind the disappearance of a famous colonel. Search is immediately started after receiving a radio signal and your squad eventually finds itself in the middle of a war.The game is a relatively difficult tactical 3rd person shooter - you control the leader but can give orders to the squad members.  You clear one room after the next - while the game is linear it offers a great story that tries to portray the dark side of a war, a war where it's almost impossible to make good choices. The game has stunning visuals and superb voice acting - all delivered from the best in the gaming industry. Replayability exists due to the different difficulties and also the different endings offered based on the choices to be made by the players.I never tried its multiplayer mode but did not plan to do so. Just for the single player experience this is a highly recommended game not just for those in favour of the genre but for those who like a good story.			"

												I just completed this and re-played the final chapters to get all the endings.Ok, I don't really like millitary shooters (Well if it's not a simulator like ArmA) but this game is just something else. You just gotta play this game, man. The story is GREAT, but the thing is that it only lasts 5-7 hours and it's $30.(Good thing that I got it in a Humble Bundle)This is just an awesome game that will blow your mind and will make you feel unconfortable with yourself. You'll feel bad. I almost vomited in a scene, but I kept playing. 3 or 4 hours later I finised the game in the same day, feeling awfull, and now i'm writing this ""review"". I just gotta say this is a great game, except for the generic (on purpose) gameplay and some gliches, bugs and bad design that will make you see what you have to do on youtube.(I'm talking to you, helicopter in the hallway)If you liked Fight Club you'll like this game.

												Spec Ops: The Line plays like a rebuttal to the jingoistic chest beating espoused by the CoD and MoH series in their later iterations. This is a story which puts war under the magnifying glass, and examines its horrific consequences, both on the individuals who fight those wars, and those caught in the crossfire. Essentially, it is gaming's Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now.The Gameplay is standard cover shooter fare, so it begins to feel a bit tired towards the final third of the game, but given the story content, I almost feel that this exhaustion with the game mechanics helps reinforce the themes of the game - which I will not comment on here, and instead say: Play this game, it is an amazing piece of work that is sadly vastly underappreciated.""Survivors: One too many.""

No. I'm not a Hollywood movie trailer.1) Buy the game (a moderately important step).2) Finish the game (tough it out if you really have to, ya sally).2a) If you're like me you'll either want to save before the end and experience all the endings or at least watch them on YouTube (you bought the game - play through them!)3) Form your own opinions (don't let the Internet think for you!).4) Go online and check out the wealth of information and opinions on this game.5) Sit back and take the time to truly enjoy what a fine piece of art (yea, I said it) this game is.This game literally does not care if you like it or hate it.

												Dude, Spec Ops: The Line, what a trip to hell... if you like stories, not the stereotypical stuff with the happy ending and♥♥♥♥♥♥ im talking about something to make you think, something to make YOU feel... anger, sorrow, guilt, madness, then you're in for a treat with this game.I should say that some games have evolved so much that they are also an expression of art, not only in the visual context but in the narrative side, putting you in the perspective of the protagonist, making your choises somehow important to the development of the plot, which is also fun as hell, these games are the artform from the present era.About graphics, i loved them, Dubai city is presented in such great detail, even the climate is represented accurate, always seems to prevail a horrid heat wave and the characters sweat and get injuried in a realistic way. About the cutscenes, the editing technique is very well done and the graphics are the same as the rest of the game keeping the action style, the main character suffers an insane transformation to get the end of the game, you can see him as a wild animal cornered trying to save his life by destroying his hunters, look at his eyes.About the sound, is all realistic about gunshots, blasts and enviromental, the voice acting is superb, i read they hired Desmond from assassins creed, in that game he kinda sucked but here he really delivers all his lines, the interaction with the characters is also really good, lets say something like at the begining he sounds like all technical and professional soldier, but later on he becomes sadistic and full of rage and you can hear him getting all psychotic, its insane.About playability, what, lots of guns, explosives, properly represented-- and is really friendly to master combat techniques, there is also some interaction degree, like firing heavy machine guns or issuing orders to squad members, also destroying certain parts in the map to let sand bury your enemies alive, all the good♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is in the command to your guys stuff that i found the weak point in this game, The AI is mostly lame as it gets, if you fail to cover them, your guys will run into certain death and that is more troubles for you. About the dificulty level, easy is for dumb ♥♥♥♥s, on the other side, FUBAR dificulty will get your♥♥♥♥♥on the grill, hard as nails, it is a big challenge.Last words.. man i loved this adventure, but it left me with a weird feeling in my soul (?), something other war games failed to portray, lets say call of fruty, where enemies fall just like shapes under your relentless gunfire, this game will make you think over your choices, war is not fun, i really dont know when we desensitized so much about killing other humans, i know ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, its just a game but think about it, you're getting used to the idea of unloading your mag upon other humans without feeling anything, thats not right. We need more games to think about it, we need to THINK more.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a hard game to define. Going into it, I expected a regular old FPS or other type of military shooter game. What I got, however, was one of the most compelling stories I've ever seen in a video game. This review will be spoiler free. The story of SO:TL was one were you are always a step behind. You're  lost, confused, angry, scared, frustrated, and a million more descriptions that couldnt be fit here. You experience all of these emotions. These real, visceral feelings are elicited by this game, and it does it spectacularly. Some of the controls are awefully clunky and can be a pain, but if you look past a shoddy control scheme, and the mediocre console port, You are thrown into one of the best story driven games I've ever played. If your a fan of story games, or Third person shooters, or just games in general, I can't recommend this enough9.25/10			"

About the cutscenes, the editing technique is very well done and the graphics are the same as the rest of the game keeping the action style, the main character suffers an insane transformation to get the end of the game, you can see him as a wild animal cornered trying to save his life by destroying his hunters, look at his eyes.About the sound, is all realistic about gunshots, blasts and enviromental, the voice acting is superb, i read they hired Desmond from assassins creed, in that game he kinda sucked but here he really delivers all his lines, the interaction with the characters is also really good, lets say something like at the begining he sounds like all technical and professional soldier, but later on he becomes sadistic and full of rage and you can hear him getting all psychotic, its insane.About playability, what, lots of guns, explosives, properly represented-- and is really friendly to master combat techniques, there is also some interaction degree, like firing heavy machine guns or issuing orders to squad members, also destroying certain parts in the map to let sand bury your enemies alive, all the good♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is in the command to your guys stuff that i found the weak point in this game, The AI is mostly lame as it gets, if you fail to cover them, your guys will run into certain death and that is more troubles for you. About the dificulty level, easy is for dumb ♥♥♥♥s, on the other side, FUBAR dificulty will get your♥♥♥♥♥on the grill, hard as nails, it is a big challenge.Last words.. man i loved this adventure, but it left me with a weird feeling in my soul (?), something other war games failed to portray, lets say call of fruty, where enemies fall just like shapes under your relentless gunfire, this game will make you think over your choices, war is not fun, i really dont know when we desensitized so much about killing other humans, i know ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, its just a game but think about it, you're getting used to the idea of unloading your mag upon other humans without feeling anything, thats not right. We need more games to think about it, we need to THINK more.			"

												A really good game with OK gameplay as in you go from cover to cover and you shoot the bad guys and throw grenades and stuff, however the ability to give your squad members commands such as attack, stun and heal the other squad mate is KINDA unique.The real cream of the crop here is the story. It is pretty short though, you can complete it in about 5 - 7 hours on the normal difficulty. After replaying this game about 5 times to get every single achievement even the one for completing the game on FUBAR (which was brutal and almost made me commit a war crime on my computer) I can safely say that I understand the story of the game (at least that's what I say to look cool). I won't be revealing details about the story for people like Vikezor who don't want anything to be spoiled for them even though they may never even play this game in their lives, but what I WILL say is that it isn't your typical military shooter story about taking out a terrorist leader threatening to blow up Pluto or something. The story is pretty unique and left me questioning ''What happens next?''. The story makes you think about war and the attrocities people commit under speciffic circumstances. It also has multiple endings about 4 I think and a few descisions you have to make during the story. The soundtrack to this game is also amazing, it fits the story pretty well and makes me wanna replay it to be able to battle enemies while listening to some rocking tunes. Without going into the hostile spoiler lands I can't really say much more so I will cross the border into them for a few seconds to say this:SPOLERS YO KIDS SPOILERS RIGHT HERE The game left me wondering what happens to Walker after he leaves Dubai in that one ending where you shoot at Konrad in the mirror and don't kill the US soldiers that arrive to extract you. Questions like ''What's he gonna do now? Will the things he's seen and done haunt him forever? And did he even have any family to return to?'' popped into mind while watching Marty boy leave Dubai.	END OF THE SPOILERS KIDSIn general I personally think this game is amazing because of the story. However the developers have revealed that they won't be making a sequel or another game in the Spec Ops series for a while because as amazing as the game is it didn't make them a lot of money, not as much as they hoped for at least.Final score: 578/603P.S. Bailey shut the heck up.			"

												By far my favorite action game of all time. It tells a fascinating and engrossing tale, which I'm not going to spoil, and really makes you think. Everyone should play it. Apocalypse Now was the movie version of Heart of Darkness, and this, I think, is its adaptation to a video game. On part with This War of Mine in terms of making you question your own morality. I love it.			"

												A surprisingly good story makes this TPS a must beat, not must play. I can't praise this game highly enough. I rarely write reviews, but felt this game absolutely deserves it. My only con for this game is the story although good isn't very long. I could've kept going a lot longer with how much I was enjoying it.			"

												Dark, gritty, violent and an mature story are the first things that come to my mind when thinking of this game. This game is not your average shooter that glorifies war/battles in any way, as other games often do. This game shows you the dark and even horrendous side and will make you question your own actions in the game more than once . This game is not for the weak hearted, but a ""must have"" to everyone that is looking for an different/new experience in game-play. I can only recommend this masterpiece.			"

												The truth is, you're reading this review because you wanted to feel like something you're not... a Gamer.This game is not fun, but it is engaging. You'll feel bad. Unless you are an evil person. Cognative dissonance is alive and well with this game. Although the mechanics and graphics feel like something from 2008, the story, emersion (or lack thereof) swath the player into examining his or her choices in a manner that most modern games simply do not.I beat the game in about 5 or 6 hours. I got it on sale for 6 bux. I recommend picking this title up on sale most certainly, but I also recommend picking this title up for a ""modern warfare first person shooter"" title that is anything but a modern first person warfare shooter.

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played.Why?The gameplay is pretty standard fare for the shooter genre, with some somewhat interesting squad dynamics thrown in. I've heard the multiplayer is terrible, if you can find anyone still playing it at all. So why is this game so amazing? The story in the campaign. It plays on your psyche, messes with your head, and makes you question why you even play games like this. It's a critique of the entire genre, one that desperately needed to be made. Why do we, as gamers, typically like to shoot things for fun? Is killing people in a video game truly harmless? If so, should we still enjoy it as much as we do?The story draws from some classics for inspiration (most notably Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad), but it takes what it needs and expands on the rest. It takes some classic conventions, and finds a way to use that to tell its own story, and tell a completely new and fresh message.""To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless.""			"

												After having played through this game, I can only recommend it if you take it at face value. In terms of gameplay, this is just another shooter. Nothing special there.The story however is worth a trip if you can get the game cheap. It takes the traditional ""Hero of War"" story and flips it on its head, forcing the player to make increasingly more difficult decisions as they go down the path of violence and chaos. If you're looking for gamechanging mechanics, you're in the wrong place. But if you're looking to become a hero, well, turn back now.			"

												Surprisingly good. Spec Ops: The Line is not just another shooter set in the modern day. It's very story-focused, putting you into the shoes of Captain Walker and his squadmates, and making you live through the harrowing events they had to face when deployed in war-torn Dubai. The game has a very cinematic feel to it. The scenes build up gradually to big climaxes, and the squadmates discussing what's going on and arguing with one another the entire time, making them seem like real people and not just mindless NPCs. In addition, the game presents you with some moral choices at times, making you think twice on your decisions and putting you in situations where neither choice can be considered good. Without giving away any spoilers, the game concludes on a mindblowing ending, or more precisely - endings, whilst leaving some ambiguity behind to let the players interpret the rest. I would highly suggest to play the game to the end and then to check the Youtube videos to see all the endings and their interpretations. Story aside, the gameplay is pretty fun as well. The combat is fun and for the most part consists of your typical third-person cover-based gunfights. There is some variety in the environments where you fight, ranging from desert outposts to insides of malls and other semi-broken buildings, as well as rooftops. This in turn presents some interesting challenges from time to time, such as defence sections and the like. It could get a bit repetitive, however, and some of the bigger gunfights do feel a bit messy at times. Additionally, the squadmates and the enemies wear similar-coloured uniforms, so it's very easy to mistake a fellow ally for an enemy during a heated combat. The crosshairs of some weapons turn red when on the enemy, but this isn't the case for all weapons, so it's easy to accidentally hurt your allies.Overall I've enjoyed my time with this game. Although the combat started to get repetitive and a bit frustrating towards the end, the story makes it well worth playing the game through from start to finish. Recommended.			"

Para análise em português, leia mais abaixo.Spec Ops The Line - Review: Lost and DamnedDubai. An oasis of technology and lust in the middle of desert. Magnificent buildings in a developed city. But nature is always more ruthless than our ability to oppose. Destroyed by intense sandstorms, a city in ruins. The 33rd Battalion of the American army is sent to town for a rescue and extraction operation of the survivors. And then, they disappear from the map.You are Captain Martin Walker, leader of an elite team of Delta Force of the Army of the United States of America, leading his fellow Lieutenant Alphanso Adams, heavy gunner and Sergeant John Lugo, sniper. Sent to Dubai after a transmission captured after six months without contact, his mission is to locate, reunite and rescue possible survivors.Beautiful scenarios, even among ruins. The opulence of Dubai can be seen in the ruins and in few places that remained intact. Even the desert, displays an exotic beauty that brings a melancholy tone to the game.Spec Ops is not just a shooting game in third person. It is a psychological plot. Every dialogue, every action, every event in this journey shows you more than bullets flying. Dubai is alive. Dubai is at war. And war... war never changes. The horrors of war are not shown as simple digital polygons falling to the ground with AI off. You will really feel them. You will hesitate. You will have anger and and will be thrilled. And maybe you even cry. You'll be confused. Do not stop. Go straight. Reflect, try to understand. Do not come to this game to play. Come to this story to live it. And so, you will not regret it.Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai.  My Personal Score   Fun: 9/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Ambientation: 9/10   History: 10/10   Replayability: 6/10   Multiplayer: 1/10 --Spec Ops The Line - Análise: Perdidos e CondenadosDubai. Um oásis de tecnologia e luxuria em pleno deserto. Construções magníficas em uma cidade extremamente desenvolvida. Mas a natureza, é sempre mais impiedosa do que nossa capacidade de nos opor. Destruída por intensas tempestades de areia, uma cidade em ruínas. O 33º batalhão do exército americano é enviado a cidade para uma operação de resgate e extração dos sobreviventes. E então, eles desaparecem do mapa.Você é o Capitão Martin Walker, líder de uma equipe de elite da Força Delta do Exército dos Estados Unidos da América, liderando seus companheiros Tenente Alphanso Adams, artilheiro pesado e Sargento John Lugo, franco-atirador. Enviados a Dubai após uma transmissão ser captada depois de 6 meses sem contato, sua missão é localizar, reunir e resgatar possíveis sobreviventes.Belos cenários, mesmo entre ruínas. A opulência de Dubai se destaca em traços que podem ser percebidos nas ruínas e em poucos lugares sobreviventes. Mesmo o deserto, exibe uma exótica beleza que traz um tom melancólico ao jogo.Spec Ops não é apenas um jogo de tiro em terceira pessoa. É uma trama psicológica. Cada diálogo, cada ação, cada acontecimento nesta jornada te mostra mais do que balas voando. Dubai está viva. Dubai está em guerra. E a guerra... a guerra nunca muda. Os horrores da guerra não são mostrados como simples polígonos digitais caindo ao chão com IA desligada. Você realmente irá sentí-los. Você irá hesitar. Você terá raiva e se emocionará. E talvez, você até mesmo chore. Você ficará confuso. Não pare. Siga em frente. Reflita, procure compreender. Não venha a este jogo para jogar. Venha a esta história para vivê-la. E assim, você não irá se arrepender.Senhores, bem-vindos a Dubai.

You must discover what's going on here, in Dubai, find 33 Battalion, and ...._________________________Typical plot for 80 % games in this genre... Now we'll fight against arabic rebels and save US soldiers.  Right? No. And yeah, in first missions that's actually the things we'll doing. I had no desire to continue play this, but i continued. And i say fairly, all that impress me is the sand Dubai... God, it's really amazing. It's something surreal...Well... Then plot changes. I won't tell something about plot, because of spoilers. But i will tell that be a hero - a great responsibility. YOU'LL FIGHT U.S. SOLDIERS!. REALLY, AND NOBODY WILL BLAME YOU! HOW ANYONE MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS GAME FOR THAT?!And now you must play this, to know, why US Spec Ops kill US Marines. Hallucinations and shocking moments are here. "

												Game reminds me a LOT of Binary Domain; another third-person shooter (wall humping and military lingo included) with average gameplay and a fantastic plot. I'm not gonna dwell too long on the game mechanics. It's typical stuff with nothing impressive or worth mentioning. This is one of those games that's more about everything BESIDES the gameplay, which says more about the writing than anything negative about the gameplay. I will only complain about one thing: the game has mechanics that are severely underused. Specifically, silencers, which would let you sneak around getting kills if the game dedicated more to that aspect.Anyway, the plot is fantastic, and its SPECTACULAR how it handles good and evil. Ultimately, the paradigm (big word alert) is meaningless here; everyone has their motives and reasons for doing what they do. The game weaves a complex narrative that ultimately pins you as neither a 'good guy' nor a 'bad guy'; you are merely someone doing what he believes is right. Emphasis on ''believes'' because all supposedly moral actions in this game are subject to questioning. I love the title for that alone. I love when villains are given motives and reasons for their actions other than ''I am bad raawr come get me in my evil evil castle''. They took it a step further by making the protagonist's morality ambiguous as well, and you get to shape some of it along the way. There are some segments where you have to make choices, and the writing makes it so that each option in these segments is a valid choice. Moral choices in games tend to boil down to ''kill grandma; don't kill grandma'', so there's never really any critical thinking involved; developers take note, this game does it right.I could go on and on about how the pacing is done very well and how I love the narrative. But I'll end on a few unrelated notes:-For a console game this♥♥♥♥♥♥looks great. This dude's bald head is so...so bald. -The menu changes as you play the title, which is a cool touch. It's little things like that that give a title some flavor.-The game is loosely based on an old novel from the 19th century. So, like Binary Domain, it isn't exactly original.-You might not get sound in pre-rendered cut-scenes. It's a bug having to do with NVIDIA cards or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anyway, the fix is insanely simple and there's a thread on the forums about it. Or you could watch pre-rendered stuff on youtube.The game's pretty short and straight-forward. I love strong narratives so I can't recommend this enough. And while you're at it, pick up Binary Domain as well.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is possibly the most riveting, most intriguing, most powerful shooter I have ever played. Whilst the gameplay mechanics are pretty traditional and bring little to the table, the story is fantastic. The Line is a linear game through and through but does a very good job of making the player feel responsible for the actions they carry out. Part of this is due to the illusions of choice that occasionally pop up through the game, allowing you to feel as though your decisions will make a difference. Multiple endings add a bit of spice to it as well. Without a doubt, Specs Ops: The Line is the best third-person shooter I've ever played that had me on the edge of my seat and constantly thinking about it when I wasn't playing it.

Spec Ops: The Line is a dark and horrifying examination of the evil that lurks within the human heart and the true cruelty that mankind is capable of when they believe that their actions are justfiied by ""heroism."" It's also an incredible deconstruction of the modern military shooter genre (eat your heart out, Call of Duty) that examines how truly ♥♥♥♥ed up games like that are by showing the reality of what would happen if people actually acted the way those games did. Written by an actual soldier, this game displays the true horror of war and the consequences of PTSD in ways no other game can.

												If not for a well constructed and deep story, this game would be just another cliché TPS.The gameplay is the standard of a TPS based on Unreal Engine, you control a squad with 2 more members, characters who make constant part of the plot and are not just there to shoot. There is a good variety of weapons, although the enemies are repetitive. Despite not having fantastic graphics, the artwork is very well done, with beautiful and detailed scenarios. We can also highlight the sounds, well made and with an exciting soundtrack!The plot is amazing, can involve you and make you reflect on the events in the game, on the effects of a war. There are moral choices to be made that although not changing the final, have a psychological aspect involved. The ending is unexpected and impactful.The low point for me were the controls, tricky to get used, it is also a very short game, but I think they did well not to extend it too much because it could become tiresome and repetitive. AI also is not the best, but either way, I recommend!8/10			"

												I had a friend pick this game from my backlog and boy am I glad that he chose this. The game has a really impressive story, about how war and pressure can drive a man insane. Although the gameplay is not its strongest point (believe me its not bad) I still found myself wanting to 100% it (Which I did). The game has some wonderful moments but some levels might frustrate players cause of the insane difficulty. I played some co-op with nonos and it was pretty fun. As a conclusion, Everybody who has this game in thier backlog list should start playing it.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a prime example of ho-hum gameplay, but a powerful and engaging story. This game will make you feel like a monster at the end. You'll see the destruction you caused, the violence you inflicted on people, and the deterioration of your soldier's mind. The gameplay in Spec Ops is really nothing special. It's a Gears of War-type shooter. You're in third person, you shoot enemies, you hide behind cover, you make things go boom, so and so forth. Playing a demo of this game will not do you justice. Sampling a portion of this full course will either make you crave more and throw it away. If it needs to be experienced, it needs to be experienced in it's entirety. Through out the 14 chapters, the gameplay stayed mainly consistent, with turret sections and tons of cover shooting. It's simple, and can get repetitive very quickly. There's nothing special about this gameplay. Some scripted sequences are definitely pretty cool, but other than that, you're going to be shooting and hiding behind cover for most of the time.Spec Ops is all about story, though. You might think that story has no impact on a generic military shooter like this, but you would be wrong. The story in this game is incredible; it's like a good book you can't put down. It's very well written, and in the end, you'll transform into a hurly, burly tough man into a hollow shell of a human being. I highly recommend playing this game. First time I played this, I felt that it was just a simple third person shooter with nothing to offer. After friends told me about it further, I tried it again and realized it was about the story. I was super impressed with this game. If you do choose to play it, make sure you don't look up any info of the story on the internet, it will give stuff away. You'll want to experience it for yourself.			"

												To quote Extra Credits,This game ""helps to articulate why a game can be engaging without necessarily being fun.""As I played I was mostly unimpressed with the story because I felt it was all too linear and I had little control over how I progressed the story.  Ironically, this is how the developers wanted me to feel. :/It is a rare game that will make you think about what you're doing instead of just encouraging you to blindly follow the stream of objectives that are spoonfed to you.

												I found the game pretty boring. Clean up the area, maybe pick up a new weapon, repeat. Linear as hell. You can't plan your assault, just appear in a new location and the enemies show up around you. Like shooting grounds with different decorations. Stealth mode is laughable, you may kill an enemy or two before everyone spots you and the action starts.One of the reasons to buy the game was allegedly good story-line. Well, I found it being stupid, like ""we did very bad things but we didn't have a choice, or, wait, maybe we did, which makes us very bad people"". This is repeated over and over. I don't feel sorry for the main drama-queen character although the game really wants me to.The abundant corpses and burning people are desperately trying to add up to the drama, but they look pathetic and excessive.What I did like are some interiors. They look good, but lack details like things you can interact with.The game is not all bad, I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5. But since I can only choose between Yes/No, the choice is no, I don't recommend it.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is awesome and amazingly underrated. It looks great (that setting! that landscapes! every room is different! that graffiti! characters become dirtier and dirtier as plot advances!), has awesome music (astonishing selection of vocal tracks, including Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, Mogwai and Bjork, and instrumental depressing post-rock ambience) and terrific story (it wil make you feel the feels, man, I guarantee it). The only complaint is monotonous gameplay  and a couple badly designed parts (mostly it's because of lack of checkpoints) which were too difficult (at least for me) AND MADE ME ♥♥♥♥ING RAGE MY♥♥♥♥♥OFF ARRRRRRGGGGHHH (almost threw my gamepad against the wall; btw — I do not recommend playing this on gamepad, use keyboard & mouse, it's  much better); still the game has better gameplay than Call Of Duty or single-player Battlefield campaign  (lol, haters gonna hate).Everything else is totally cool, final plot twist and overall plot awesomeness is comparable to that of Bioshock Infinite.Also very enjoyable collectibles, every one of which has some plot exposition (again kind of like Bioshock Infinite with its collectable voxophone records).Very nicely done. Good job, devs.9/10, one of my favourite story-driven games of all time.			"

												Spec Ops The Line is by no means a perfect game, the gameplay is basic, it's a third person cover shooter set in the desert. The mulitplayer while a nice bonus is an odd inclusion considering the tone and content of the story. Even though the gameplay is standard and basic the story is where this game truly shines. This game achieves through its single player campaign what games like Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield and countless other war games have tried to do. It puts you in the middle of a harsh war scenario where you have to think on your feet and make moral decisions. If you're going to play one game about war I highly suggest this one.			"

												不是我想装逼是因为这个中文打字两个字以上就看不见了，全是省略号(三个点)，还是要改进一个othe game just have the single mode ,and you can spend only 6 hours to finish the game,sp if you want to play it longer or play multipalyer mode ,ignore it.the environment is simple, desert or hotel,and the graphic quality is low,so if you want to play the high quality graphic game, ignore it.the music is composed in the last century,rock and jazz.Although it is suitable for the war,but the game just have these 5?4 music, that seems boringthe shooting is just soso. 3rd person,and the enemy has the armor ,sniper,or ordinary soldier,don't expect more air support,drive tank or vehicle.it is'nt MOH or COD,it just 8 g. you can control the team,give the orders,but not like ghost recon,you can just let them shoot,heal each other,take down the especial enemy.BUT!, if you are dedicated on the story ,that can cover all the disadvantagementThe game is not like the COD mordernwarfare series, or MOH. showing how brave the soldier how justice they are how brave they areNO  praise you can see  in the game. It is he game full of irony.It reveals the evil into the key role,it tease the soldier who believe how good they are, how  dark the  justice ,brivilliant,government or  their country.The being hero's value they hold is weak when they are meetinge the real worldGive 15/10 to the story,I advise you buy it when it is on sale.It will fit for the player who were dedicated on the game's story. Hero want to save the World,or save the people.But the motivation  is a kind of showing off and full of selfish,espacialy when he has power ,it is easily being a disaster,that is the game want to show us.

												Spec Ops: The Line is a game about morality and introspection. An action/adventure title which grips you with just above average game-play mechanics. Along side that, there is profound situational scenarios that forces an analytical and emotional side from you, with every decision. It may seem like you start as, just, another soldier given, just, another mission. Although, as you act in what seems to be an orderly manner, you begin to question the authenticity, or integrity of such orders. You begin to question because of the veracious nature of these orders. It becomes difficult and even, regretful, when you persist to just 'follow orders.' It is a game which for the most part of the story, is confusing. Your distaste by all the violence you do as this character, I don't want to give any spoilers but there are some really deep philosophical questions that the game provokes from you, after these unfortunate situations. All that thought, accumulates into a severe confusion and doubt about where this is all going. Why so much pain? So much death?...Well, the ending holds a powerful question, the question is what will you do?In regards to the game-play mechanics, they're inherently superficial and refined. This allows for the player to not completely focus on just the action, but the scenery, the sounds, the presentation of a doomed Dubai. There were many breathtaking scenes, in which I have numerous images for.There is only one reason one should purchase this game, it is if you are looking for a intellectually provocative game. Take head tho, there is alot of filler action. Seemingly useless scenes of violence. Furthermore, I would like to add, that discussing such an issue, as this game does, with such a small script, was impressive. I hope the studio is working on the next of the series, maybe one that jumps further deep into the monstrous acts of war, and the repercussions of those wars. "

												All I had to do was stop.Yet I didn't.Those two sentences reverberated around in my mind after my first playthrough of this game. This game that brought me to tears, while the No Russian mission from Call of Duty failed to even make me blink. There was no hesitation in that instance, as soon as those elevator doors opened and I saw what we were to do I did not flinch. I came into Spec Ops: The Line figuring it would be the same. I had read some reviews about how harrowing it was, and how deeply it delved into the horrors of war. I figured it would be like No Russian, but expanded over an entire game instead of one mission, just another cheap attempt to make the player feel some sadness or regret for their choices. Dear God how wrong I was. The beginning of the game had me believing it would be three badass American Dudes blasting holes in terrorists, justifying my initial views. I figured the whole 'war is hell' message would come because you accidentally kill a few civilians in a token attempt to get you to feel something. I had hated how the player could choose not to open fire in No Russian or even skip the mission in MW2. The ability to skip or not take part in the carnage destroys the purpose of it in the first place. Spec Ops, thankfully, does not give the player  a playable choice. Many critics of The Line say ""There's always a choice"", yet they fail to see one thing:There is.The game does not force you to beat it. You always have the choice to quit the game before you have to do something terrible. Where does it say, ""You MUST beat this game""? Nowhere, and the plithy critics who state ""The game forced me to do it!"" have learned nothing from this game. They are no different than Captain Walker blaming Konrad or soldiers of the 33rd for his actions. Walker was  forced  by Konrad to do terrible things, or he could not complete his self appointed mission. Deflecting your actions onto someone (Or in this case something) else does not change the fact that you clicked the mouse. You kept going forward. Yet unlike Captain Walker, YOU do have a choice to stop. I had the choice, yet I never took it. I was drawn into the all too common mindset that 'This game was created for me to beat it', and it wasn't until the end when I realised the wretched hell I had drag myself into. I had no hesistation when I put the gun to Walker's head and pulled the trigger. After that final mouse click I sat back in my chair, stared at the scene of two men, so abhorred of their own actions that they felt their only redemption was their own deaths. I had never related so well to video game characters in my whole life.And I cried. Immediately after, I started a new playthrough, got not even half through the first mission, where the first decision you didn't know you could take but was always there was, and quit the game. That was the ending that was always meant to be. And at that time, I did feel like a hero. I stopped the noble but flawed intentions of the protagonist. That is the only way I can play the game anymore. Remember, you always have a choice, even though it may be unfulfilling. Because beyond the opening level of the game there lies only one thing:Damnation "

If you like shooters, and like them on a third-person view, this game is for you, as it is full of action, it will make you think twice before taking any decision, and will keep you from moving anywhere else until you reach the end of the game.This game became one of my all-time favorite games within my first playthrough, and I'm sure it will have the same effect for every third-person shooter enthusiast out there!For a full review with images and so on, feel free to check it out here: http://johnheatz.com/2013/06/09/spec-ops-the-line-review/ "

												I had an absolute blast going through the game. Really great storyline, seamless progression till the end, and it even has decision points which affected the overall sense of reason. Great for re-playability sorta, since it can be a bit on the short side if you are good with aiming (fights are quick as you headshot everyone).Well done voice acting, which existed almost every step of the way as you and your squad (and foes) chatted about. Graphics are fantastic with the atmosphere created. The blowing dust and other visual features. are amazing.All wrapped together they really hit the nail with an RPG quite well.I cant say much for multiplayer, because I didn't bother. I don't care for solo adventure/action games that 'throw on' a multiplayer part for nothing but to make the game seem longer. It doesn't need it, and if you buy it purely for it, you will be disappointed. Its a campaign, treat it as such in your decision.			"

Underrated Masterpiece(This review is only for the single player part of the game)I only bought this game because it is available on Linux and I heard it is kind of good. ""Kind of good"" is an understatement. I was really amazed by this game, it's one of the most profound games I've ever played. It can be seen as an ""Anti Call of Duty"", because the setting of the game could also be as well the setting of the next Call of Duty edition. But the story develops in a direction where Call of Duty (most likely) never will go: no glory, just madness. Even though the game starts in quite a standard way (not only in terms of story and setting, but also in terms of gameplay), the direction changes quite fast.Speaking of gameplay: it is a solid cover shooter. The cover mechanics work quite well (most of the time), the shooting part is good and the AI of the enemies is really good. They are more than just cannon fodder and put some real pressure on the player. The gameplay itself might be standard nowadays, but the implementation is top-notch. The overall game experience is what you would expect from a AAA title, which is a big surprise, considering the topics covered by the game's story.I have a few points of critique, but those points rather fit to modern shooters in general:It is rather short (it took me ~13h to finish the game on the hardest difficulty, and I'm not really experienced in playing cover shooters and thus was dying a lot)The levels are very linear (but you can also see this as a metaphor for the freedom of choice you have or haven't in the game)This game is one of the most underrated games in recent history. Apart from the story it fulfills all the criteria of a successful AAA title. It is really a pity, since this is the only AAA game (I know) that is brave enough not only to be mature, but also to raise unpleasant questions to the players and it didn't get the appreciation that it deserves. Seems like in future this will be only done by indie games.Anyway, I was very surprised (in a positive way) by this game and I can recommend to everybody to see, what can be done with the medium computer games.

												Spec Ops for me was a harrowing experience. You do not play this game for the purposes of 'fun', you play it to experience what amounts to a character study of the main characters slow trip into madness. The combat is not 'fun'; it can be repetitive, frustrating, and depressing. There is no satisfaction gained by killing waves of enemies. The story is brutal and depressing (catching a theme?). It creates false choices, a sense of distance from your 'character', a general feeling of detachment from your actions and a nagging sense of hopelessness. So why on earth would you want to play a game that actively tries to prevent you from gathering any amount of enjoyment from it? Because this game is a work of art and a compelling experience. It was conceived as the Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now of video games and it uses every tool available inside the medium to create the mood achieved in those works. To put it bluntly, nothing about this game will make you feel accomplished and in the rare points that you do, it takes that away from you, through both gameplay, cinematics, and even the loading screens. Late in the game when you die the loading screens will mock you telling you things like ""Do you even know why you are here"" and ""He would have most likely suffered from PTSD, dying made him the lucky one"". This game is not for everyone, especially those who just want to turn off or want to only have 'fun'. This game is for those of us who want to see video games tackle major topics maturely (in this case; war crimes) and do so with respect. If you are sketchy, I would wait until the price drops. With only a 7 hour campaign and almost laughable multiplayer, this game is not going to give you 50 hours of game play. Over all I am very glad I now own this game and really encourage all of you to play it in some way.			"

Product received for free
 Could have been great, but fell short Overall this game had a lot of potential and it really delivered in some aspects. The graphics and the feel of the guns when shot are still great even after a number of years. Warning slight rant incoming But that's it really, if I'm being honest.The combat is great at the start, until you reach sections of the game where enemies spawn in waves after waves and you gun them down with no problem. The game actually gives you a lot of ammo when you're low, so it wasn't as punishing as I initially thought. The melee units are a joke and even the special troops near the end of the game are easily taken out. The only trouble would be the heavy units, but even they're done in with a shotgun to the face a couple of times. All in all not a very difficult combat system, and in a vacuum, would be actually fun to play once in awhile.Until you mix that with the A.I.Now, the A.I of the enemies is actually pretty good for a game from 2012. They flank, they wait for you to pop out to shoot, they cover each other and pin you down when other enemies move up. Nah the enemy A.I is commendable. The only problem is your teammates. The dumb soldiers do the worst possible imaginable thing almost every time. Attempting to melee enemies in full armour and an LMG is a common one. Running towards grenades is also pretty much the norm for these great american troopers. Time and time again I would have to restart simply because the 2 dumb bumpkins the game calls soldiers would rather hug each other and cry when a grenade lands at their feet then move to the adjacent cover about 2 metres away. It would have been acceptable if it had happened once or twice, but the exact same scenario happened at least 5-6 times in a row.The biggest issue I have with the game is finally here. Something so easily changed and tweaked almost had me wanting to throw my pc out the window with Dark Souls levels of rage.The controls and autolock.So many times the leader of Delta team (i.e you) would get gunned down because he couldn't lean on a pillar to literally save his life. Alternatively, would get his legs blown off by a grenade because he  covered himself in glue and smeared himself all over the walls . The janky♥♥♥♥♥controls was the main thing making this frustrating to play and the game would have gone so smoothly. The biggest qualm I have with the game.Had the fairly common audio bug where some or all sound in some cutscenes would not exist, e.g no sound at all in a cutscene, or no dialogue audio in another cutscene. Tried fixing it a few times throughout the game, but gave up around the same time I gave up on the game.The story was rather eh. You get dropped off with no idea on what you're doing and the game just throws some expo and leaves you to figure it out. Granted, its not a whole bunch of names and expo dumps but it still leaves you with a sense of ""uhhh...?"" for half the game, and the next half you're not paying attention because you really don't care by that point.  Spoiler up ahead   The whole napalming of civvies didn't really affect me, because after a certain point you really don't give a flying♥♥♥♥♥♥ By the time Lugo died, I just gunned down the surrounding civilians because I really couldn't have cared less by that point. And at the end, I just shot whats-his-face immediately, and gave up my gun to the soldiers because I just wanted to pump this review out and go to bed. Overall okaish game with decent combat, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I and such broken♥♥♥♥♥controls it would make Sean Murray (circa No Man's Sky launch day) blush.  No hate, I just needed an example  . I can definitely see why the game's story would be a major appeal for some, just not for me. Sad really, was excited for the game and had high hopes after hearing from friends and other reviews.tl;dr just get it on sale with low expectations, won't be too disappointed like that.			"

												It's hard to recommend this game. It's hard to enjoy it and even harder to like it. Why the thumbs up then? Because it's bad for all the right reasons. Let me elaborate:MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!The game starts as a typical military shooter but as you go about shooting ""bad guys"" things get F.U.B.A.R. real fast. Your character is forced to commit a series of war atrocities, each worse than the last one. The gameplay in between is dull and repetitive but this is a very conscious design decision on the developer's part. While you get bored your mind wanders and you can't help but think about what your character has done. As you try to rationalize his actions you go through some of the same psychological changes that shape his mind during the game. These changes are further pointed out by the exceptionally good voice acting.This game leads you on at first, reinforcing your childish, video-game/action-movie inspired expectations. And then it shows you what killing hundreds of people in a single day actually does to a person's mind. It gets in your head and hammers the point home by breaking the fourth wall and messing with you, goading you to simply stop playing. You're not supposed to have fun while playing this and the game itself is perfectly aware of that. If you do decide to play it to the bitter end it will simply leave you feeling drained and dirty.Spec Ops fails as a game on purpose to prove a point and teach you a lesson. I can't help but respect that.			"

												Brought this on sale, and I still wouldn't recommend it. It tries to be meaningful and thought provoking but through execution fails terribly.-First off its sold to you as a game that will ""challenge your morality"". Nope, you aren't even presented with the ability to make choices, so how can it challenge my choices and moraility. The reason I bring this up is because from the comments and that line I thought this game had deep meaningful decisions, but it doesnt.Infact, without giving away spoilers, the whole game is based around an action that I desperately tried to avoid, but the game wouldnt let me progress until I did it, which in turn made the whole guilt trip ridden descent into maddness storyline redundant.-Also the gameplay itself is terrible, its basically a third person shooter with awkward controls where you fight off waves of enemies.-On top of all this the game is only 5-6 hours long, and I usually take my time while playing games...Basically don't buy unless you like third person shooters, with shallow attempts at thought provoking stories. Sounds harsh but its true.			"

												This is a poor squad based 3rd-person cover-shooter that has some interesting story ideas about the nature of war. It isn't subtle about it and there is little that draws you into feeling any real remorse or even shock for your behaviour in this theatre of war. The cover mechanics are clunky and at times infuriatingly broken as you'll find yourself under heavy fire and unable to duck behind cover for no particular reason and needlessly dying over and over again (my play-through was on hard...and as with most shooters that equates to nearly all enemies focusing their god like aim solely on you...and your team-mates suffering a lobotomy). The action itself isn't the worst but certainly isn't anything special either. If you've played a cover shooter you've played this game. And as with most cover-shooters repetition is the name of the game and boredom will soon settle in as there is little variation in the enemy types and the weapons you can pick up. Throw in a couple of bog-standard on-rails duck-shoots and this all seems very familiar and uninteresting.  As the story unfolds you'll be made (forced) to question your actions on the battlefield, the trouble is as you aren't really given much of an option, your actions aren't ever really in question, as it is the actions of the non-descript-mercenary-meathead type you are aiming the crosshairs for. I didn't really care and just wanted to carry on shooting more repetitive bad guys. War is very bad and sometimes rather unethical actions are unfortunately called for. I'm pretty sure most people would have worked that one out without it being rather crassly explained in some poorly acted CGI.   So, a cover-shooter where the cover mechanic is pretty terrible and the shooting is nothing but bog-standard fare. But at least it tried (and failed) to pose some morality questions. But ultimately this is not worth your time.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a great game, probably one of the best 3rd person shooters I've played. On the surface it appears to be a generic shooter but if you take the time it is a lot more. The story pays homage to the novel Heart Of Darkness, and draws inspiration from Apocalypse Now, which are both exceptional pieces. Unfortunately it does a lot to turn away the casual player, it has lacklustre game play and a very unfortunate title, that was likely a thought by some producer. However once you look past that it really is a hidden gem amongst terrible tripple A titles. Stay for the immersive stories about the glories of war and ignore the short comings of the gameplay. I would reccomend playing this game on a medium difficulty as I played on the ""Suicide"" setting and it was frustrating in all the wrong ways.Also the game was very short, I finished on Suicide at 3 hours and 55 minutes. In saying that I got about 50x the enjoyment out of it then any shooter I've played in a long time. Highly Recommend.			"

												A spectacular game, the scenery is amazing, the story is captivating and the gameplay is perfect.This isn't the only game I've played where you're aren't the good guy, but what makes this game unique is its the first one that doesn't even try to justify it, if anything it rubs in that horrible truth. The story line is fantastic, and is filled with choices that basically boil down to, ""Do you really want to do it the hard way just to spare some civilian lives?""The gameplay on, normal difficulty, was perfect for me. Easy enough for you to mow down enemies if you play right, and hard enough to where it messes you up the second you get cocky. The ai and levels are designed to force you to change weapons 2-3 times a level keeping the experience fresh and fun. The AI is pretty smart as well, they have scripted flanks and occasionally you get to hear them talk about their personal lives, reminding you that these are people you are killing.Like most FPS these days the game is littered with collectables that have their own mini story to tell. Usually I collect them for the sake of collecting them, but these were so good I'd find my self searching dark corners of the level just for a little more story.OVERALL, it was a great game, I only picked it up because I heard it was a bit unique and it was on sale for like $3. I got lucky, but if I had got it at full price I'd still be very happy. My only complaint, the take cover and sprint button are the same key, it can be as annoying as Assassins Creed's run and climb button from time to time. 9/10 When bullets are flying, sometimes your character might decide that instead of diving out of the way, he wants to die a rhino.

IMO-Gameplay :i personally think you can't speed run this game bcz its really need tactic and really depends on your patience. even on normal difficulty this game is really something. just stay at cover. try standing for like 3 seconds, youre dead.-Sounds & Graphics :good enough for me. but the scenery on this game looks really awesome can't deny that. even dead bodies are looks great to me :v(-) Cons :is kinda hard to control when youre trying to run from cover to cover. so i think the control is kinda messed up somehow.

												""It takes a strong man to deny what´s right in front of him. And if the truth is undeniable, you create your own"" It´s a game that tells a story about a journey into the darkness. A story about a man that looks like a hero, sounds like a hero and wants to be a hero, but ends up a villain or, maybe, a victim. No matter how you see, look or interpret this story and journey of these man, I definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in millitary shooters and wants a fresh take in a shooter genre in terms of storytelling, because in terms of gameplay, it´s nothing new, but still provides satisfying gunplay and frantic combat, with engaging visual style.

												I would describe the core gameplay as a competent shooter. Nothing too unique. I have become tired by repetitious shooters over the last few years when I just have so many other options in regard to games I can play. What makes this game recommendable is everything else about it. Most obviously the story - its great, and it actually feels pretty important. Its similar to Apocalypse Now but in modern Dubai rather than 70's Vietnam. The story, once it gets rolling, asks you to question how you as a player of a shooter video game can convince yourself that it can ever be right to take the life of another human being - and the lengths we go to make rationalizations for killing. The game is an exercise in cognitive dissonance; you're forced to question the act of killing and come to terms with the consequences of taking another person's life, but at the same time you're supposed to kill hundreds of people. People who thrash about near-death on the ground, coughing up blood, frantically asking for help with what little breath they have left. The story is thoughtful, the voice acting is great, the sound design and implementation of soundtrack are both great, and the game looks great. The core gameplay itself, though, is still pretty average for third-person cover shooters.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a Third Person Shooter that's focused around story rather than gameplay.This game has a pretty unique blip on my radar, and for good reasons. Simply, all I can say is the story alone is worth purchasing this game. The basic premise is about three Delta operators: Adams, Lugo, and Walker. They were sent out on a mission to rescue any survivors found in the desolated sand-wasteland of Dubai. You play as Walker, leading your squad to carry it out.Now this doesn't sound like a complex plot, it sounds incredibly simple, even. But the whole undertone of the story is what it's all about. Without giving away too much, Walker has the good intentions of saving all the civillians he can, and eliminating all evil that walk around them. However, it gets very psychological and personal, as Walker, and you, realize that the choices you thought were justified and well, turns out to be the exact opposite of what they are. It mentally breaks Walker down, trying to lead with his mind intact, trying to figure out good from evil, what he's doing right and wrong. The choices you make, sometimes there's never a good choice, it could be a lesser of two evils, but that's not saying much. War is hell, and sometimes, your best isn't enough. This is what the entire game is focused on: this, and the deeper meaning. It's truly an engrossing story that will leave you wanting more. I promise you won't regret it.The gameplay is less spectacular, it's your standard cover-and-shoot type. It's pretty textbook if you wanna look at it that way, as there isn't much to do besides... Well, cover and shoot, but there is a good amount of different weapons to use. One thing I do like though is that battles take place in lots of locations, the desolate presentation of Dubai is very immersive and nice to look at, so you can be doing close quarters battle in a broken building, fighting on a large battlefield, or snipe from across buildings. The varying locations do mix up gameplay a little bit, but it's still rather basic. It does work however, and it is still fun, just nothing really pops out.The game isn't too long, it could take you about 4-5 hours to finish the campaign. However if you wanna play the story again but with different choices, you can probably clock in another 3 if you skip cutscenes.Multiplayer is there, but this game has a very low population, I doubt you'll find anyone, so I can't give off my impression there.There is a Co-Op mode where you can play the campaign with a friend, who plays as either Lugo or Adams. That's very fun and it works pretty well. If you got someone to play with and wanna enjoy the story together, that brings up something fun to do as well.Overall, Spec Ops is an amazing game with a deep, enriching plot that is sure to leave a lasting impression on you, that's what it's all about, even if the gameplay is pretty textbook stuff, and the short length. However, you won't regret buying this, I recommend it.			"

												""Do you feel like a hero yet?'This game, when it was marketed i thought it was just another GUNG-HO MURRICA SAVES THE DAY game, and maybe just the developers were trying to Convey that to not spoil the story. and i'm abit glad they did.Spec op: The Line, is a very dark and grim game Dealing with the horrors of war, inhumane acts of warfare and What it feels like to Suffer from PTSD.It starts out a Generic, gears of war style 3rd person shooter, cover, shoot whatever, But then there was a very distinct point when it Turned into almost a psychological Horror game. and even the Loading screen tips start to break the 4th wall and Insult you for your actions.this game will make you feel bad, there's no good decisions in spec ops the line Just bad and worse.you'll be presented multiple times with decisions that mean pain and suffering for others, and if you think you can be a hero and try to do both  the developers thought of this, and the Exact opposite will happen, that being the worse part i spoke of earlier.this game feels very mature, and i don't just mean that in a violence way, i mean like thinking about stuff like this that happens  to people in war and how living with PTSD would be, in general i don't think any other games tell a story quite like this.I'v heard people rag on this game alot for it's gunplay, i just think it was a vessel to Tell the story, it's not broke, it's not amazing, it's just there to function to the next point of the story. it's also quite hard on even normal.the story here is why you should be playing this, seeing the slow degrade of your squad as you keep marching on.even there voices and attitudes go from Super tactical military commands to Gravely and almost maniacal  as things just keep getting worse.some small negative things i will say about this game, the cover system sucks, it's not gears of war Glue yourself to cover with a toggle you have to hold it the whole time when moving, it gotten me killed many times trying to move in cover, just to have walker stand up and have his brains painted on the wall behind him by a sniper.i'd have also appreciated abit more.. shall we say, exploration into Something losing there mind, without spoiling much.improved stealth would be better, it's got that hive mind kinda AI, where if one sees a single pixel of your sticking out, everyone suddenly knows your location.But overall I'd recommend you play this game if you want a really good story, and to feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥after.

												Impressive! Spec Ops The Line is technically quite typical 3rd person action game loaded with minor tactical options and essential covering abilities. The HUGE plus comes from story which is based in the novel ""Heart of Darkness"" written by Joseph Conrad: same story adapted to movie ""Apocalypse Now"". The story makes an emotional apeal by creating rough image of war and how people lust its glory even if it would blow away their sanity.			"

												This game will be remembered as a masterpiece by many, and yet many more won't even know about it. That's because you won't easily sell a game if you can't quite tell with catchy, flashy, ad-friendly words why it is on damn point.All I can say without doing atrocious spoiler is that you're not going to have a mind-blowing experience with his shooting and its gameplay in general. The setting is amazing and the gunplay is really not bad, but, yeah, nothing really new. A bunch of scenes makes a clever use of the sandstorms and the decayed Dubai to add some depth and gain spectacularity. All in all a decent TPS shooter, a bit repetitive but short enough (6-7 hours taking it easy) to have some fun shooting bad g... shooting guys.But trust every one of the guys on there, we have our reasons to say there's more to this game than what meets the eye.

												""Aw jeez... where's all this violence coming from? Is it the video games? I bet it's the video games.""I'm just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don't like lengthy reviewsMajor aspects:Gameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)Story line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale's “The Walking Dead” Immersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.Graphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.Minor aspects:Realism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realisticSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times. Voice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.Player involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more. Overall:I don't really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:9.75/10Though, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:10/10General review:When I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the ""campaign"" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren't really any incredibly “tear jerking” moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.The game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.The atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won't go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game. Overall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.			"

												Where to start with this game? Brilliance in the form of a storyline. I was not expecting this game to be all that great. I gathered from most reviews of it that it wasn't, but I still did purchase it. I can very gladly say that I was happily proven wrong. The storyline is so very well structured, with actions, even small ones, having a massive affect of the gameplay. I finished this game feeling terrible. Not many games have done that to me. The morals in Spec Ops: The Line are also represented on a very small scale, such as deciding whether or not to excecute a dying enemy for ammuntion. The gameplay element of The Line isn't the greatest: average is probably a good way to put it. Particular guns, like the snipers and heavier weapons, are completely overpowered in comparison to the others. It does cover based shooting fairly well, though it is a bit buggy in places. Overall, this game is a true emotionally-inducing adventure. It is an absolutely brilliant buy at $20-$30, and well worth it.Score: 7.5/10			"

												Spec Ops: The Line, set in the desert city of Dubai, is an Unreal Engine-based military 3rd person shooter that surely doesn't revolutionize its genre, but certainly stands out because of its mature, intense and moral-conflicting story and its great voice acting and writing.The game doesn't focus on the usual glorifying AMERICA, F* YEAH crap where you blow up stuff and ride into the sunset. It shows you the dark side of war and confronts you with moral choices that will get people killed, no matter how you decide - and you will see the results of your choices, laying dead in front of you.The playtime for the campaign is around 7 hours. The game also features a multiplayer which, unfortunately, is pretty much dead. Additionally, there is a co-op mode that lets you team up with a buddy and fight your way through 4 unique missions.Spec Ops: The Line isn't a game with a happy ending and it certainly won't make you feel comfortable, but that's what makes this game so special and rare.

The decisions you have to make will most likely haunt you and must be made quickly. Also, there are at least three insanely different endings and I doubt you will see any of them coming. The only question to ask yourself is: ""Do You Feel Like a Hero Yet?""			"

												Well, what shall i say about this game?Its one of the more surprising games i played. In the positive way!If you never heard about this game, like me, you start the game, ready to compare it with the big fishes in the genre.And at first it seems like you its loosing. The Videoquality isn't the best, the story is like ""oh, another shooter in the middle east with some american heroes"".But then the game gets interesting. While you play, you get the opportunity to choose between to options from time to time. But these options are pretty tough. Like, really tough. If you manage to immerse yourself in the setting and the story as i did, you will feel unable to choose sometimes.You literally have to decide wether should saomebody live or die. If you don't, either the game will decide for you, or you simply can't advance.You get a feeling for war and all its cruelties, often with very grafic material, wich is, when immersed, hard to play through. The game is forcing you to think about the things that happen. Because of the games unexpected brilliance: 10/10Definitaly recommend playing it.			"

												I played this game while I was with a family member in the hospital. I was around the cancer ward, and when late at night we were there, I would play this game. I would escape the grittyness of the hospital for the grittyness of this paradoxical shoot-em-up deconstruction. Sorta how I coped a bit. I found myself escaping in the storyplot (don't buy this for the multiplayer, everyone including the developers dislike it mainly) and engage in the fatal(i s t i c ?)-choices you will find yourself in. It is loaded with pretty fragrant social commentary and is a deconstruction of the modern shootem'up. While other games strive to encourage you to kill people, in this game, when you shoot someone they may be writhing in pain for a long period that seems like twenty seconds. Cause you shot them. "

												This game is good in story and some of the game play. But it lacks in some points that is very crucial to these types of games. The FOV is far too small making it inpossible to see if you're being flanked or not. Also some of the moves are very dumb like if you move towards a truck while running he will just automatically take cover behind it. Also the main normal difficulty should be way too hard for many players.			"

												When a city of millions sinks into the sand before descending into anarchy and chaos who should the powers that be call to restore order? If you this game up that would be you.This is a vastly under-rated third person shooter. The gameplay is rock solid and fun with action and excitement oozing from every place that oozes such things. The gun play is engrossing and offers everything you could want from a shooter. The guns themselves have a good feeling about them and really do kill the fudge out of everything standing in your way. That being said play on the harder difficulties unless you want to mow down everyone in your way without breaking a sweat.The storyline is very unusual for a title such as this; it’s actually good for a change. Spoiling nothing for you but you will want to find out the truth and face all the horrors along the way. The writing team behind this is seasoned and it honestly shows. No faults there at all.What really drew me in though was the world itself, a real decaying beauty in everything. It really does feel like a city torn apart and rebuilt in a mad man’s image. The set pieces are stunning and the vistas throughout the game will leave you wanting moreI whole heartedly recommend this game to everyone. With a plot like this and the mechanics to back it up it is well worth your time and money.Have fun ^_^			"

												This is the kind of game that gets you interested right from the start, confused but satisfied while playing and then reflecting on everything you encountered after you finish.I played this game from start to finish in one play through which resulted in an unexpected all nighter. This game is a thrill to play and is even better when it is on sale. Although this game is pretty short lived, every single minute is brilliantly executed through the cutscenes, combat and just looking at the scenary.One important note how ever: absolutely no one plays the online mode which is a real shame because I had a look at a few maps and they had really good potential.I would love to give this game a 10/10 but unfortunately the amount of gameplay and lack of online contributers brings it down to an 8.5/10.

												Spec Ops: The Line is a solid 3rd person shooter that focuses on the horrors of war. It's kind of like ""Apocalypse Now!"" with Dubai as the setting but that comparison is giving it a little too much credit.  It's more like an ultraviolent summer blockbuster war movie. The story and dialogue come off hamfisted and silly at times. The voice acting is decent for the most part and the sound design is good. I would've liked the guns to be louder and bullet snaps would be great for immersion. The shooting mechanics are satisfying and the intensity of the combat is what kept me coming back to 100% this game. It's no ""Red Orchestra"" immersion wise, but I think it illustrates the horrors of war well in some ways. Enemies collapse and some suffer while clutching wounds or crawl away. They cough and whimper as blood pools around them. One thing they never do is surrender, which is an annoying trope of modern shooters. At least there are unarmed civilians on some levels, which goes against convention. The game also forces you into some bad situations with civilians which is a great way to show the ugliness of war.The game looks fantastic, even years later and it's surreal to see Dubai turned into a wartorn blood soaked ruin. Every firefight is fun and challenging if played on the harder difficulty levels. It would've been nice to have stealth be more viable. It's also a little funny that a 3 man squad kills off thousands of enemies. I know it's supposed to be somewhat of a satire on the modern military shooter but I would've rather had ""Rainbow Six"" style squad selection/commands and losses than 2 invulnerable baby sitters. I hope more games try to execute a ""military shooter gone horror"" vibe. I really like that the game is a train wreck of bad events and it tries to make you feel responsible and bad for it, kind of like the Kane & Lynch series. It was just a little too hamfisted, on rails and ""gamey"" for that feeling to hit me, but I enjoyed the horrific descent into madness nonetheless. If you are looking for a solid 3rd person shooter with an intense atmosphere, definitely grab this game.  7/10			"

It's an incredible take on the ""Heart of Darkness"" or ""Apocolypse Now"" style story and does a great job of making the player question what he/she is doing over the course of the game. You can beat it in a day if you hunker down on it, and it's a great experience that everyone should enjoy.			"

However nothing could make me forget that image. The image of the suffering that I caused. the Image of what I, the player, Had done.

The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain. The sort of pain that's only suffering. This game offers you both of them. If you are wise enough to understand what war really is, then this game will be a 11/10 torture that hurts your soul for real.

												When I first heard of this game I ignored it out of principle...why? Simple. Because war shooters tend to suck. Not saying they all do, but in my eyes its sub-genre that has more generic shooters than others sub-genres. Each year new Call of Duty with minimalistic changes, yet another failed attempt to reboot Medal of Honor series...its a mess.From my friends I heard great things about this game so I decided to pick it up and oh boy was I surprised. Fitting soundtrack, easy to use yet engaging squad command system and one thing I have been lacking lately...engaging game-play. If I were to go into graphics, which I really don't like to do because when looking at games graphics are on last place for me, BUT if I would, I would say they are beautiful.Now you might think ""fine, good shooter so what?"". I will tell you ""so what"". This game it does something games don't tend to do so much. It tries to attack your emotions. Mind you, I most often play all sorts of games as an maniac, trying to steal everything, shoot everything, then loot the thing I shot, and then shoot it again. But this game actually made me think. And not in a good way, in an depressing way. It made me actually care about events of the game. It made me fear the monstrosities that are happening.I am playing the game on second hardest difficulty out of four (fourth is available only after you finish the game on second hardest one), so logically I was sneaking around to not get shot in my beautiful coconut. And how I was sneaking I heard 2 soldiers talking (to not glorify the game too much, I didn't hear much dialogue between NPCs in this game). They were talking about how its actually beautiful in Dubai, when they have little peace from all the war that is going on, and how the melody of the wind remind one of the soldiers of his home. Of course then I threw an grenade and they were flying with their beautiful wind...but it got me thinking again. I had to kill them, I couldn't continue without it. And I guess that is main beauty of the game it makes you think.tl;dr : Buy it, play it, finish it, and if you want proceed to weep after that.			"

												""Aw jeez... where's all this violence coming from? Is it the video games? I bet it's the video games.""I'm just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don't like lengthy reviewsMajor aspects:Gameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)Story line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale's “The Walking Dead” Immersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.Graphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.Minor aspects:Realism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realisticSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times. Voice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.Player involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more. Overall:I don't really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:9.75/10Though, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:10/10General review:When I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the ""campaign"" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren't really any incredibly “tear jerking” moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.The game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.The atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won't go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game. Overall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line, set in the desert city of Dubai, is an Unreal Engine-based military 3rd person shooter that surely doesn't revolutionize its genre, but certainly stands out because of its mature, intense and moral-conflicting story and its great voice acting and writing.The game doesn't focus on the usual glorifying AMERICA, F* YEAH crap where you blow up stuff and ride into the sunset. It shows you the dark side of war and confronts you with moral choices that will get people killed, no matter how you decide - and you will see the results of your choices, laying dead in front of you.The playtime for the campaign is around 7 hours. The game also features a multiplayer which, unfortunately, is pretty much dead. Additionally, there is a co-op mode that lets you team up with a buddy and fight your way through 4 unique missions.Spec Ops: The Line isn't a game with a happy ending and it certainly won't make you feel comfortable, but that's what makes this game so special and rare.

												""Do you feel like a hero yet?'This game, when it was marketed i thought it was just another GUNG-HO MURRICA SAVES THE DAY game, and maybe just the developers were trying to Convey that to not spoil the story. and i'm abit glad they did.Spec op: The Line, is a very dark and grim game Dealing with the horrors of war, inhumane acts of warfare and What it feels like to Suffer from PTSD.It starts out a Generic, gears of war style 3rd person shooter, cover, shoot whatever, But then there was a very distinct point when it Turned into almost a psychological Horror game. and even the Loading screen tips start to break the 4th wall and Insult you for your actions.this game will make you feel bad, there's no good decisions in spec ops the line Just bad and worse.you'll be presented multiple times with decisions that mean pain and suffering for others, and if you think you can be a hero and try to do both  the developers thought of this, and the Exact opposite will happen, that being the worse part i spoke of earlier.this game feels very mature, and i don't just mean that in a violence way, i mean like thinking about stuff like this that happens  to people in war and how living with PTSD would be, in general i don't think any other games tell a story quite like this.I'v heard people rag on this game alot for it's gunplay, i just think it was a vessel to Tell the story, it's not broke, it's not amazing, it's just there to function to the next point of the story. it's also quite hard on even normal.the story here is why you should be playing this, seeing the slow degrade of your squad as you keep marching on.even there voices and attitudes go from Super tactical military commands to Gravely and almost maniacal  as things just keep getting worse.some small negative things i will say about this game, the cover system sucks, it's not gears of war Glue yourself to cover with a toggle you have to hold it the whole time when moving, it gotten me killed many times trying to move in cover, just to have walker stand up and have his brains painted on the wall behind him by a sniper.i'd have also appreciated abit more.. shall we say, exploration into Something losing there mind, without spoiling much.improved stealth would be better, it's got that hive mind kinda AI, where if one sees a single pixel of your sticking out, everyone suddenly knows your location.But overall I'd recommend you play this game if you want a really good story, and to feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥after.

												Spec Ops: The Line is a Third Person Shooter that's focused around story rather than gameplay.This game has a pretty unique blip on my radar, and for good reasons. Simply, all I can say is the story alone is worth purchasing this game. The basic premise is about three Delta operators: Adams, Lugo, and Walker. They were sent out on a mission to rescue any survivors found in the desolated sand-wasteland of Dubai. You play as Walker, leading your squad to carry it out.Now this doesn't sound like a complex plot, it sounds incredibly simple, even. But the whole undertone of the story is what it's all about. Without giving away too much, Walker has the good intentions of saving all the civillians he can, and eliminating all evil that walk around them. However, it gets very psychological and personal, as Walker, and you, realize that the choices you thought were justified and well, turns out to be the exact opposite of what they are. It mentally breaks Walker down, trying to lead with his mind intact, trying to figure out good from evil, what he's doing right and wrong. The choices you make, sometimes there's never a good choice, it could be a lesser of two evils, but that's not saying much. War is hell, and sometimes, your best isn't enough. This is what the entire game is focused on: this, and the deeper meaning. It's truly an engrossing story that will leave you wanting more. I promise you won't regret it.The gameplay is less spectacular, it's your standard cover-and-shoot type. It's pretty textbook if you wanna look at it that way, as there isn't much to do besides... Well, cover and shoot, but there is a good amount of different weapons to use. One thing I do like though is that battles take place in lots of locations, the desolate presentation of Dubai is very immersive and nice to look at, so you can be doing close quarters battle in a broken building, fighting on a large battlefield, or snipe from across buildings. The varying locations do mix up gameplay a little bit, but it's still rather basic. It does work however, and it is still fun, just nothing really pops out.The game isn't too long, it could take you about 4-5 hours to finish the campaign. However if you wanna play the story again but with different choices, you can probably clock in another 3 if you skip cutscenes.Multiplayer is there, but this game has a very low population, I doubt you'll find anyone, so I can't give off my impression there.There is a Co-Op mode where you can play the campaign with a friend, who plays as either Lugo or Adams. That's very fun and it works pretty well. If you got someone to play with and wanna enjoy the story together, that brings up something fun to do as well.Overall, Spec Ops is an amazing game with a deep, enriching plot that is sure to leave a lasting impression on you, that's what it's all about, even if the gameplay is pretty textbook stuff, and the short length. However, you won't regret buying this, I recommend it.			"

												I'd class myself as a bit of a pessimist about raving reviews that give 10/10 saying things like ' the most electrifying game since x' etc these days, as there are very few honest reviews around as they've either been paid for by the developers, or it's people kissing major♥♥♥♥♥so they can be looked upon favourably by developers in the future.I picked this up last year on sale for around £4.00 as I was looking for something a bit different to your COD's and Battlefield's in terms of a singleplayer story driven FPS and actually, was quite surprised at the level of detail and immersiveness it offers.You play the leader of a small squad tasked with trying to find a general believed to still be alive somewhere in a ravaged Dubai. Pretty soon♥♥♥♥♥♥(mixed with an unfeasibly large amount of sand) hits the fan, and being such a badass your character is increasingly more determined to find out wth is going on.As the story progresses you are faced with some plot changing ultimatums which will have an impact later on, the more you get to these stages of the game the more you are drawn into this world and the story itself.If you can set the detail level and textures to max on your PC, then i strongly advise to do so. So many times i'd completely forget about the objective and just stop and look around in awe at the strange mix of a half destroyed metropolis, really quite impressive considering it was released a few years back.Difficulty is actually quite challenging and can be brutal in some places, it's a fairly short game but dying so many time got a bit more longetivity out of it. Both your squad AI and enemy AI are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in places but it can be forgiven for the times that your tactics work like clockwork, hit and miss.Even i'm getting bored of this review now, so all I will say is that if you're into challenging immersive games, with ultimatums, well written story and a bit more level of tactical awareness needed than a bog standard FPS, then pick this up in the sale and you'll be glad you did.Oh yeah, and don't buy it if you're easily grossed out or offended - aka: a massive crybaby "

												TL;DR: Great Game! Buy it!First game that SUCCEEDS in criticizing the own genre. While most ego-shooter try to distract from their lack of depths by multiplying the amount of action and explosion you encounter, Spec Ops manages to eliminate your excitement to blow up buildings and countless waves of generic and faceless enemys.I had to stop playing several times, because I felt disgusted by what I ""achieved"" on my journey to complete the campaign, furthermore it became very clear that at the end of said campaign I would not feel any closure just incomprehension. In most shooters you get excited when you get a certain gun or you get a double kill, but if you really delve into this game the killing stops to be something exciting.			"

												A game you will love or hate, absolutely. As a military shooter, it's a generic but functional game with a useless tacked-on multiplayer mode that the developers have openly disowned. As a story-based singleplayer experience, it's notable for taking what starts as the most generic story imaginable and turning it into a meta-narrative that questions the the nature of video games while the protagonist questions his own heroism. While not perfect in its storytelling, it tries something that flies in the face of current trends and is essentially a giant middle-finger to Call of Duty and its imitators. Either you'll be on board with the idea and enjoy its ambiguous storyline, or you'll find it a pretentious attempt at an art game built on the back of a mediocre shooter. If you're curious, it's worth the time and money simply because it exists.			"

												So I bought this at Christmas. After reading several reviews on the game and the ethica/moral choices that it forced you into, I was more than intrigued. It seemed like this game was more a thinking man's game and I felt I'd best look into it. It was likely to engage me more than the normal run-of-the-mill action shooter (God knows I've played enough of them) and when it started, I could hear Jimi Hendrix' 'Star-spangled Banner' and I knew I was hooked. The combination of the player reviews and this start-up/intro, plus the first intense ten minutes of play was enough to win me over.

The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain. The sort of pain that's only suffering. This game offers you both of them. If you are wise enough to understand what war really is, then this game will be a 11/10 torture that hurts your soul for real. But if you just want to kill some dudes for your country(!) this game will give you useless pain. Don't even bother to play this game to be that guy. This game is not for you.			"

												When I first heard of this game I ignored it out of principle...why? Simple. Because war shooters tend to suck. Not saying they all do, but in my eyes its sub-genre that has more generic shooters than others sub-genres. Each year new Call of Duty with minimalistic changes, yet another failed attempt to reboot Medal of Honor series...its a mess.From my friends I heard great things about this game so I decided to pick it up and oh boy was I surprised. Fitting soundtrack, easy to use yet engaging squad command system and one thing I have been lacking lately...engaging game-play. If I were to go into graphics, which I really don't like to do because when looking at games graphics are on last place for me, BUT if I would, I would say they are beautiful.Now you might think ""fine, good shooter so what?"". I will tell you ""so what"". This game it does something games don't tend to do so much. It tries to attack your emotions. Mind you, I most often play all sorts of games as an maniac, trying to steal everything, shoot everything, then loot the thing I shot, and then shoot it again. But this game actually made me think. And not in a good way, in an depressing way. It made me actually care about events of the game. It made me fear the monstrosities that are happening.I am playing the game on second hardest difficulty out of four (fourth is available only after you finish the game on second hardest one), so logically I was sneaking around to not get shot in my beautiful coconut. And how I was sneaking I heard 2 soldiers talking (to not glorify the game too much, I didn't hear much dialogue between NPCs in this game). They were talking about how its actually beautiful in Dubai, when they have little peace from all the war that is going on, and how the melody of the wind remind one of the soldiers of his home. Of course then I threw an grenade and they were flying with their beautiful wind...but it got me thinking again. I had to kill them, I couldn't continue without it. And I guess that is main beauty of the game it makes you think.tl;dr : Buy it, play it, finish it, and if you want proceed to weep after that.			"

												I wasn't intended to be a hero, just wanted to bring my men back home, then I noticed that everything went wrong and it's all my decision. Never try to be a hero, make your own decision and take the consequence is what this game taught me. This is not just another shooter game I played, this is the reflection of real life.			"

												I don't review games often but this one really smacks you in the face. When you watch a movie and you're still thinking about it days later, you know you've seen something special. I am having that same feeling with this game.I am not a big shooter player so I won't comment in detail on the gameplay mechanics or the difficulty, I found them both great, but the story and the artwork was incredible. I found myself rationalising the protagonist's choices as if they were my own. Even as events started to spiral out of control, I found myself trying to think about what I would do if it were my boots in the sand. I couldn't ever question Walker's decisions because they were always based on a truth he had compiled from an incomplete understanding of the situation, which was something I shared with him. It's a three dimensional look at war, imaged in breathtaking scenes and with commendable voice-acting. Oftentimes, war is not as we traditionally define it. Decisions are not always based on what is good or bad, heroic or cowardly. They are often driven by interpretation of orders and gut-feel. And when dreadful things happen, do we really fully appreciate the toll on those that felt they had to pull the trigger, squinting though the fog of war? This is a visceral and engaging experience which I highly recommend to gamers looking for something a bit different.			"

												I would describe the core gameplay as a competent shooter. Nothing too unique. I have become tired by repetitious shooters over the last few years when I just have so many other options in regard to games I can play. What makes this game recommendable is everything else about it. Most obviously the story - its great, and it actually feels pretty important. Its similar to Apocalypse Now but in modern Dubai rather than 70's Vietnam. The story, once it gets rolling, asks you to question how you as a player of a shooter video game can convince yourself that it can ever be right to take the life of another human being - and the lengths we go to make rationalizations for killing. The game is an exercise in cognitive dissonance; you're forced to question the act of killing and come to terms with the consequences of taking another person's life, but at the same time you're supposed to kill hundreds of people. People who thrash about near-death on the ground, coughing up blood, frantically asking for help with what little breath they have left. The story is thoughtful, the voice acting is great, the sound design and implementation of soundtrack are both great, and the game looks great. The core gameplay itself, though, is still pretty average for third-person cover shooters.			"

												This game has one of the greatest stories of all time, some of the best gameplay (especially if you like tactical shooters), and it looks wonderful despite being four years old. The only downside is the game is only a few hours long, I beat it in about 8, and it has little replay value unless you just want to go on a harder difficulty or choose other options that will give you a different flashback in the end.

												This was a surprisingly engaging game. It looks generic, but Nolan North's voice acting is a nice touch and the story is a change from other military shooters. It's not original by any means, but the characters are interesting enough to play this one until the end. It takes about 8 hours to complete, and the game is well optimized so high frame rates can be achieved if V-Sync is turned off. The graphics are amazing, as well as the audio. The gameplay is a standard third person cover game, but it works perfectly so that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ammo is scarce at times, so you'll find yourself picking up enemy weapons a lot in order to have a functional weapon. I'd recommend buying this game, it's not a Call of Duty ripoff - but instead more character focused... a story based around the effects of war and the hard choices that are made. What is right and what is wrong?			"

												If you play games just for fun then this game isn't for you. On the other hand if you enjoy a good story and game experience you will have a great time with Spec Ops: The Line but, BEWARE, THIS GAME IS ALOT GRIM! I beated this game in about 5 hours, more or less, and I have to say that I did get bored sometimes with the gameplay. It is in it's own a pretty basic run n' cover  third person shooter with squad commands, there's plenty of these out there. But where the game really shines is in the story. This game, despite it's short length, was easily one of the best 5 hours I spent playing a video game. I have to thank Yager Development for making one of the best, most engaging, stories in recent years along with probably amongst the best character development and character design I've ever seen in a video game.

Product received for free
												It's a worthwhile product. Long story short, play it on easy difficulty and just for the story. The gameplay is used cleverly sometimes in unconventional ways.Not a masterpiece, some narrative twists are done for better drama effect even in Max Payne from 2001 by action game standards. Nothing more and nothing less than a good war drama set up in juxtaposition against ""conventional"" patriotic action ones. An allure towards the nihilistic unfortunately, as it only questions and doubts without introducing anything new.It's a recycling of previous notable works as ""Apocalypse Now"".The problem of the game is that the gameplay messes with the ""no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" approach to traumatized human feelings. The attempt to sarcasm Saving Private Ryan and other action war products of American culture is in conflict with the serious message on the topic of war. Breaking the 4'th wall is far too often used with questionable end result or in any cohesive message delivered.It's awesome to have Spec Ops attempt a new approach. I'm optimistically looking to the future of this message progress further. As a media, video games need more of this. However without trying to use inappropriate tools to convey those messages through achievements, hero puns. I wasn't searching for action in the first place. Did not think it was amusing or well placed.It would also be interesting to hear arguments pro war too. Or how consistent the message was in general, without deconstructions in post modernist style. Again, a lot of weak points in the general anti war message with wide generalisation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Recommended for familiarisation.

												A wonderfully, terrible third person shooter that you can finish in a weekend. Spec Ops: The Line will draw you in with its generic box art and derivative gameplay, and then flip you on your head and stomp on your gut because you're a terrible person. The game opens in medias res with (all together now) a helicopter chase scene wherein you mow down other helicopters with an infinite ammo minigun, until one of them crashes into you. flash back to the beginning where our protangonists are on a mission to find out what happened in Dubai after a record sandstorm hit. You fight some local insurgents, explore some interesting sand infested buildings, and slowly learn about a CIA operation and a rogue American Infantry unit. After about an hour of run-of-the-mill shooter story, things start to get a little strange. First you start killing other American soldiers in self-defense. Then you're trying to figure out if you can trust the CIA agents or not. pretty soon you're raining down white phosphorus on an entire platoon of your fellow soldiers and innocent civilians!Wait what?Yeah, it only gets better from there, and the best part is the story ramps up so smoothly and the gameplay is integrated into that story so well. The loading screens start off with helpful hints about gameplay then slowly shift to unnerving messages directed at the player in real life. The animations of the characters even change over time! The early game will see Cpt. Walker punch or rifle butt a downed enemy to finish him off, but later on he starts getting more viscious by shooting them in the face while they beg for mercy. Even the mission objectives are integrated into this mad scheme. They start off like any other game: go here, defend this, eliminate that. But then they change: obey, murder, and so on.Often in games we see a sort of cognitive dissonance between what the game is telling us about a character and what the character actually does in the game when we're controlling them (see the Tomb Raider reboot). Spec Ops is both a great example of how to not have that problem AND is the greatest display of cognitive dissonance AT THE SAME TIME!I could go on, but the Extra Credits team has already articulated my thoughts better than I can. I do have a few closing thoughts though. First and foremost, yes the gameplay isn't very good. You run. Your gun. You take cover. Enemies spawn in obvious spots. It's all very early 2000s shooter. However, that's all done on purpose to highlight and critique those very same generic shooters. Second, this is strictly a single player game. There is no multiplayer, nor should there have ever been (although maybe they also tacked it on just to show a point). Finally, and most importantly, I'd like you all to remember: you choose to play this game. You choose to do all those horrible things. Really, the only way to win this game is to stop playing it. But even then, you'd still be losing.			"

												I played about 8 hours of it in total and to be honest I found it rather monotonous, kinda felt like I could only play a an hour or two at a time. There are some interesting parts of course, for example like the heli minigun part which I enjoyed, but overall its the same move/shoot/move slog of a game. Also the cut scenes only play at 30FPS and look rather grainy/noisy , no matter which graphic settings you choose and I find that a little bit oldskool (being kind). Also the default button layout is rather like weird to say the least, whoever put that in must have had at least 8 very bendy fingers on each hand!Overall I'd only recommend this game if you get it on a sale when you're bored of all the current shooters and you fancy something different.

												A vailiant effort, but flawed and shows the limits of video games and how they can never be considered art.Specs Ops: The Line has received much praise in weaving a horrific tale of an op gone wrong and the horrors of war. The game expertly puts you in the shoes of the main character as he teeters on the edge of sanity as his PTSD nightmare slowly consumes him. But in the end, the game's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.The game not only encourages, but actively pushes you towards making crazy ""gamer"" decisions that leads to the story spiraling out of control. Executing a downed enemy is a common video game mechanic that players have come to expect. Executing a downed enemy also gives you ammo for both weapons. However, should you choose to simply double-tap them with your gun, you will not spiral into madness at the same rate as a normal playthrough. Although there are many hidden third options to most of your choices, the game doesn't let you make any key decisions that sidestep everything.Spec Ops: The Line does a great job of telling one story but fails to give you the other option of not succumbing to monstrosity. The gameplay is very tiresome and rather boring. Some would say that this is in part of the game trying to parody the meaninglessness of your generic modern First-Person-Shooters, but was this honestly the best way of going about this? Couldn't we have some fun going down this hellish slide?I only wish that there were more choices that we could make that would better simulate PTSD/anxiety/paranoia. Why was there no choice to interact with the civillian NPCs in a way that would test our distrust of the local populace? Why was there no option to deal with groups that were obviously armed and cutious, yet not overtly hostile?Overall, Spec Ops: The Line is a good game to experience but not necessarily to play. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy storytelling experiences.			"

												An amazing game to complete the trifecta of artforms, Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now and now this, Spec Ops: The Line. While the only things holding this game back is the functionality of the controls which can be somewhat frustrating at times and of course the length, being about 4-7 hrs depending on how fast you play. What it lacks there it makes it up in some unique mechanics like sand avalanche kills and some really cool enviroments to play in such as a canyon of sand dunes jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper. The gem that is this game however relies solely on one thing however, it's story. Consider the elements of Heart of Darkness and apply them to what war really is, an experience that will leave a man scarred and battered, not only physically but mentally.Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai. 9/10			"

Hit detection never betrays you and you rarely feel cheated.- Difficult...I mean...enemies can actually pose some form of challenge. They WILL flank you and they WILL toss grenades World at War style but you are usually given a decent enough warning that if you die, it was probably your own fault.- Close encounters/executions are brutal and the game teaches you this rather quickly in a way that doesn't break the immersion.- It's actually fun to play. *OPINION WARNING* I genuinely enjoyed playing through it more than once and will be doing it again in the future.- Both keyboard+mouse and controllers feel good and neither is necessarily preferable to the other.Story:- It's a ♥♥♥♥ing bloodbath of a war/rebellion-torn Dubai ravaged by mass sandstorms...survive.- Okay, there is an initial objective but I don't like spoilers, let's just say there are genuinely concerning questions posed by the twists of a generally taboo topic...think about it...what if the Americans weren't ALWAYS the good guys? Mind-♥♥♥♥ing-explosion, right?!Visuals (last because it's a ♥♥♥♥ing video game, shut up and play the damn thing):- On a high-end machine, it's absolutely stunning the amount of detail placed into the game.- Even on a lower-end pc, the game looks solid and if you don't want your pc game looking slightly worse than on xbox, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it on xbox.

The story itself was amazing and satirized the image of war that other games provide, and does its best to make the player feel like absolute crap, but not to an extent of giving up.In terms of gameplay, some parts were downright impossible for me on the hard difficulty, but other than that the game functioned pretty well, and I experienced no majour effects of it's somewhat mediocre gameplay.I would definitely suggest this game to anyone who wants to experience an impressive and deep story, but not to someone who is merely looking for a good TPS game to just burn time.

												Ever wanted a game which Murica ♥♥♥♥ yeah! is not the winner?Get Spec ops: The Line.Ever wanted a game which showed you the effects of war on yourself and others?Get Spec ops: The Line.Ever wanted a game which not only got you immersed in the game world, but also got you attached to the characters?Get Spec ops: The Line.This should not be classed as a game, but more an interactive work of art. It tells a story of a squad of American soldiers fighting their way through Dubai to try and free the citizens from the evil John Konrad. The game portrays the effects that PTSD has on soldiers and how a simple rescue mission can turn into a mass graveyard.This game is not ""FUN"" it is a serious story-based game which would be best played over a weekend as it can be beaten in roughly 8-9 hours. Final thoughts:This game is amazing and you should buy it once on sale because it is a short story, but great none the less. Also do not read anything about it until you finish it because the game will be ruined as there are too many spoilers.Also the game mechanics are awful, so play it on normal difficulty because the gameplay isn't fantastic and you can easily get killed out of the blue by things.

												Brilliant game. The anti-shooter in regards to not only providing exciting (and often challenging as hell, especially on FUBAR difficulty) gameplay but an intelligent and horrific story as well. An excellent plot with important moral decisions and cutscenes. You will want to find all the memos and tape recordings (similar to the Bioshock series) throughout the game to fully understand the background of the story.			"

												A narrative masterpiece! The game knows who to play with my emotions. I bought it to see what the buzz was about and boy does it deliver! Presentation is well done, I just wish the gameplay was better (it's not bad, it's still enough to keep you engaged). Luckily, the story makes up for that (even if it is quite short). I admire the decisions the developers made, from the decisions I have to make to the breaking of the 4th wall.I highly recommend this game to those looking for a great engaging story! If you're still skeptical about it, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												I played about 8 hours of it in total and to be honest I found it rather monotonous, kinda felt like I could only play a an hour or two at a time. There are some interesting parts of course, for example like the heli minigun part which I enjoyed, but overall its the same move/shoot/move slog of a game. Also the cut scenes only play at 30FPS and look rather grainy/noisy , no matter which graphic settings you choose and I find that a little bit oldskool (being kind). Also the default button layout is rather like weird to say the least, whoever put that in must have had at least 8 very bendy fingers on each hand!Overall I'd only recommend this game if you get it on a sale when you're bored of all the current shooters and you fancy something different.

												If you look at this game and think ""Oh look another generic cover-based shooter"" then you are very wrong. This game manages to build up as the game goes along and tells one of the best stories i have ever seen in a game. It shows the true horrors of war. This ""Delta Team"" don't want to be murdering all these people. The gameplay is supposed to be generic. It shows how boring modern shooters are. If you stick with this game it becomes an engrossing, fantastic game. Don't be fooled into thinking this is another generic shooter, just because of the first few chapters. I truly think this game is amazing and is horribly underrated. Anyone who wants a one of the best stories in gaming should buy this game.			"

												At first glance, Spec Ops: The Line might seem to be another Call of Duty clone, but actually it is so much more than that. Quite honestly, I'm not really into military shooters, but I enjoy playing this game. An amazing story sets the pace with many unexpected twists and turns. This game shows perfectly all the brutality of war. The plot is constantly keeping you guessing and the ending is very mind blowing. Yes, some of it could be a little quirky, but it is still one of the best stories I've ever encountered. Also, the game has excellent character progression.However, the 3rd-person shooter gameplay is pretty unimpressive: the cover system is temperamental, the aiming sucks, the weapons are boring, and stealth is rarely possible. It ends up being repetitive as do most cover-and-fire games. So, to be honest, the gameplay is nothing special and could be considered  quite bad, but I guess that is not what this game is made for.The graphics are quite good, the soundtracks are also amazing and only bring more depth to the game. On top of that, the noise and effects are genuinely special, sounding real and effective. Furthermore, the voice acting is top-tier and sounds very real.Overall, if you go into playing Spec Ops: The Line with the mindset that it is a run of the military shooter you will be disappointing, but if you play it looking for a game that's story is both gripping and thought provoking, try this out. Trust me, this shooter is an outstanding piece of art when it comes to terms of story and picture. Give this game a shot, it might change your perception of the whole genre more than its technically superior counterparts ever could.			"

												Whoooaaaaaaa, dude! What a game! I beat it 3 times and I still feel like doing it again. A mindblowing experience. I still don’t fully understand the story, but I’m not supposed to. Out of the 4 different endings, the one I liked the most was the one that gives you the Too Late The Hero and The Road To Glory achievements. It fits well with the level of craziness going on in this game. I’m really proud of myself for getting the Sierra Hotel achievement while on Suicide Mission difficulty and beating the game on FUBAR difficulty. By my third playthrough, I had gotten pretty good at getting headshots, so while it wasn’t a walk on the beach, it wasn't that hard. Enemies don’t respawn forever, so you just have to take it slow and deal with one at a time. The attack order was bugged for me in certain resolutions though, which was really annoying since I had to lower the resolution to 800x600 for it to work properly.			"

												""Aw jeez... where's all this violence coming from? Is it the video games? I bet it's the video games.""I'm just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don't like lengthy reviewsMajor aspects:Gameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)Story line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale's “The Walking Dead” Immersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.Graphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.Minor aspects:Realism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realisticSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times. Voice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.Player involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more. Overall:I don't really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:9.75/10Though, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:10/10General review:When I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the ""campaign"" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren't really any incredibly “tear jerking” moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.The game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.The atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won't go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game. Overall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a solid 3rd person shooter that focuses on the horrors of war. It's kind of like ""Apocalypse Now!"" with Dubai as the setting but that comparison is giving it a little too much credit.  It's more like an ultraviolent summer blockbuster war movie. The story and dialogue come off hamfisted and silly at times. The voice acting is decent for the most part and the sound design is good. I would've liked the guns to be louder and bullet snaps would be great for immersion. The shooting mechanics are satisfying and the intensity of the combat is what kept me coming back to 100% this game. It's no ""Red Orchestra"" immersion wise, but I think it illustrates the horrors of war well in some ways. Enemies collapse and some suffer while clutching wounds or crawl away. They cough and whimper as blood pools around them. One thing they never do is surrender, which is an annoying trope of modern shooters. At least there are unarmed civilians on some levels, which goes against convention. The game also forces you into some bad situations with civilians which is a great way to show the ugliness of war.The game looks fantastic, even years later and it's surreal to see Dubai turned into a wartorn blood soaked ruin. Every firefight is fun and challenging if played on the harder difficulty levels. It would've been nice to have stealth be more viable. It's also a little funny that a 3 man squad kills off thousands of enemies. I know it's supposed to be somewhat of a satire on the modern military shooter but I would've rather had ""Rainbow Six"" style squad selection/commands and losses than 2 invulnerable baby sitters. I hope more games try to execute a ""military shooter gone horror"" vibe. I really like that the game is a train wreck of bad events and it tries to make you feel responsible and bad for it, kind of like the Kane & Lynch series. It was just a little too hamfisted, on rails and ""gamey"" for that feeling to hit me, but I enjoyed the horrific descent into madness nonetheless. If you are looking for a solid 3rd person shooter with an intense atmosphere, definitely grab this game.  7/10			"

												This is the kind of game that gets you interested right from the start, confused but satisfied while playing and then reflecting on everything you encountered after you finish.I played this game from start to finish in one play through which resulted in an unexpected all nighter. This game is a thrill to play and is even better when it is on sale. Although this game is pretty short lived, every single minute is brilliantly executed through the cutscenes, combat and just looking at the scenary.One important note how ever: absolutely no one plays the online mode which is a real shame because I had a look at a few maps and they had really good potential.I would love to give this game a 10/10 but unfortunately the amount of gameplay and lack of online contributers brings it down to an 8.5/10.

												Spec Ops: The Line, set in the desert city of Dubai, is an Unreal Engine-based military 3rd person shooter that surely doesn't revolutionize its genre, but certainly stands out because of its mature, intense and moral-conflicting story and its great voice acting and writing.The game doesn't focus on the usual glorifying AMERICA, F* YEAH crap where you blow up stuff and ride into the sunset. It shows you the dark side of war and confronts you with moral choices that will get people killed, no matter how you decide - and you will see the results of your choices, laying dead in front of you.The playtime for the campaign is around 7 hours. The game also features a multiplayer which, unfortunately, is pretty much dead. Additionally, there is a co-op mode that lets you team up with a buddy and fight your way through 4 unique missions.Spec Ops: The Line isn't a game with a happy ending and it certainly won't make you feel comfortable, but that's what makes this game so special and rare.

												Where to start with this game? Brilliance in the form of a storyline. I was not expecting this game to be all that great. I gathered from most reviews of it that it wasn't, but I still did purchase it. I can very gladly say that I was happily proven wrong. The storyline is so very well structured, with actions, even small ones, having a massive affect of the gameplay. I finished this game feeling terrible. Not many games have done that to me. The morals in Spec Ops: The Line are also represented on a very small scale, such as deciding whether or not to excecute a dying enemy for ammuntion. The gameplay element of The Line isn't the greatest: average is probably a good way to put it. Particular guns, like the snipers and heavier weapons, are completely overpowered in comparison to the others. It does cover based shooting fairly well, though it is a bit buggy in places. Overall, this game is a true emotionally-inducing adventure. It is an absolutely brilliant buy at $20-$30, and well worth it.Score: 7.5/10			"

												TL;DR: Great Game! Buy it!First game that SUCCEEDS in criticizing the own genre. While most ego-shooter try to distract from their lack of depths by multiplying the amount of action and explosion you encounter, Spec Ops manages to eliminate your excitement to blow up buildings and countless waves of generic and faceless enemys.I had to stop playing several times, because I felt disgusted by what I ""achieved"" on my journey to complete the campaign, furthermore it became very clear that at the end of said campaign I would not feel any closure just incomprehension. In most shooters you get excited when you get a certain gun or you get a double kill, but if you really delve into this game the killing stops to be something exciting.			"

												This is very likely my personal favorite game. While I may be a little biased, this is a very emotionally stirring game about war and will certainaly leave you with a true feeling. The best part is you dont know if that feeling is going to be good, bad or simply replusive. You certainly can't say that about a majority of games out there.

												You should seriously play this game if you like shooters whatsoever (or even don't like, as in a way it's an expertly written criticism of the culture that shooters propogate). It's an incredible take on the ""Heart of Darkness"" or ""Apocolypse Now"" style story and does a great job of making the player question what he/she is doing over the course of the game. You can beat it in a day if you hunker down on it, and it's a great experience that everyone should enjoy.			"

												A game with a great story and decent gameplay.  Frustrating at times, but still worth it, especialy on sale.  The ending was great, and the after-credits scene was pretty crazy.  I chose the 'bad' option at the end (you'll understand once you play it) and then started repeatedly asking myself what the eff I was doing, ending with me repeatedly stating to myself out loud that what I did was really effed up.  Like twenty times.The point is this: if you want a shooter with a good story, get this game.  That damned auto-run was the bane of my existence though.Spoiler:  The 'bad' option I was talking about was the fact that I chose to shoot the soldiers instead of dropping my gun.  And yes, before you ask, I am a terrible person. "

												it has been said many times before but ill say it again..this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. probably the best storyline i have ever experienced in a shooter.pro:-nice graphics-cool soundtrack (also includes some 60s/70s music)-great story (seems like the devs watched apocalypse now and other anti war movies and thought: hey can we make something like this into a game?)-challenging difficulty (at least on the ""hardest"" difficulty. i didnt play the game on the one you have to unlock though)-not 2 pricey-radioman (robert ♥♥♥♥ing darden)cons:-not a very long game (took me about 8 1/2 hours to beat. and i died a lot!)-while i personally enjoyed the combat a lot of people think its kinda mundane. (its just not something special but i think its fine for what it is.)-might not have a lot of replayability (though there are choices to be made and multiple endings but overall the game is fairly linear)spec ops really DOES make you think of the horrors of war. some scenes will make your stomach turn and your soul die! by the time you reach the ending you will feel kinda sad. but youll  still be happy about having experienced this little gem. sad this game flopped. id take this over CoD and other generic jingoism crap ANY DAY.i can highly recommend this game. you should definitely play it if you have no problem with its short lenght and not-so-special combat mechanics.DONT be fooled by the crap trailers. they deliberately give a false impression.things are not as they seem in this game.if you happen to buy this game : welcome to dubai!thx for reading "

												This is a weird f#cking game. Feels like the Anti-COD of Doody, and I must say I f#cking love it. However it does have issues that you should know, and that’s where I’ll start:First and foremost, the gameplay. It’s a third person shooter and sticking to cover is a must, however sh#t doesn’t always work as it’s meant to work. At times you try to stick to one cover and end up sticking to another. At times you try to do something simple, and end up doing something else entirely, and probably end up dying stupidly. There are also a few bugs on it, although not game-breaking at all.The only other problem the game has is the multiplayer, and this one must be explained as it’s actually quite interesting: The devs didn’t actually wanted to add it, the publishers however though that a military shooter HAD TO HAVE IT and asked the devs for it. When they refused, the publishers hired ANOTHER TEAM OF DEVELOPERS to make the multiplayer, even against the wish of the original devs. And what happened? The multiplayers sucks balls at sucking balls. The coop is decent if you have a  friend to go through it and have a laugh or two, but I wouldn’t really recommend playing this game’s multiplayer AT ALL. The devs didn’t want it there to begin with, so ignore it as if it didn’t exist. If anything, just insult the publishers for trying to force this game to follow the sh#tty standards of this sh#tty gaming generation.Ignoring that though, what do we have left? Hell, that’s what we have. The game takes a rather serious look at how war actually is, rather than the classic “HELLO, YOU’RE MERRICAN WHICH MEANS YOU’RE A GOOD GUY AND PRACTICALLY INVINCIBLE, NOW GO OUT THERE AND SHOOT DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM TO ANYTHING THAT MOVES” kind of games. It’s a heavy story-driven game, and you gotta get deeply involved into it to like it, but seriously, 9 times out of 10 you’ll like it every time.The music is also something I liked about this game quite a lot. Not only the licensed music that plays and quite seriously fits in, but the original themes made for the game, especially as it goes on and on.The characters themselves are also worth mention. All the important characters of the game are seriously well written and truly feel real, even if some characters on the story don’t develop too much. The writing is also spot-on with the story and the meaning behind it, and might even make you feel bad once you actually do SEE what they meant.Is it a good game? It is. And it’s quite the experience. However, it’s more like a movie than an actual game, and you should seriously play it for it’s story rather than the gameplay. On a sale, this is quite the steal. Do you feel like a hero yet? TL;DR Edition: It’s a big “F#CK YOU” to games such as CoD, which show that war is all fun and shooting chickens in the head. Really, seriously good story and average gameplay, the multiplayer should be ignored entirely as the devs didn’t even want it and the publishers forced it there. A good purchase on a sale.			"

With a breathtaking narrative, fantastic visuals and top notch OST you will feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥ But you'll be happy you played this gem. The only downside of Spec Ops The Line is the gameplay. Not that it's bad, it's actually very solid. But it's unoriginal and feels like a chore when there is so much more going on. The rest of the game breaks new ground, the gameplay is just bland. In the end, I think the problem was really what the Publisher wanted to sell as opposed to what the developer wanted to create. If we look at all the promotional material and even the forced multiplayer, the generic (yet popular in other games) that's the conclusion I get to.In any case, the story is fantastic and you should give this a shot.

												This is hands-down one of the most emotionally engaging and impactful games I have ever played. What starts out as your run-of-the-mill third-person military shooter, quickly turns into a psychological and unique story unseen in modern gaming. The developers did an incredible job of truly making you feel the weight and consequences of the decisions you've made in not just this game, but every game you've played previously.I personally do not enjoy shooters; this is precisely why I loved this game so much. It is not only addictive and engaging, but it's a smart and expertly crafted critique of the very genre it represents. Nolan North's performance is extremely impressive, even given his pedigree. I cannot recommend this game highly enough - if you want to experience something unique and memorable, you need to play this game. I finished it in one sitting it was so addicting.			"

												Excelent story telling and gameplay. Everything is spot on, save for a couple large issues.1.) Cover is everywhere and reliable almost all the time. I say almost, sometimes you'll take cover against the wrong side of a wall and you'll end up dead because of it. Sometimes the cover doesn't work at all. Some things that look like they should be cover aren't, which can get you killed very easily. But as I said, it's very uncommon for this to occur.2.) The Checkpoint placement is absolutely H O R R E N D O U S, forcing you to redo large battles over and over, considering the game is relatively difficulty. This is a major problem, especially near the end of the game when you lose a squad mate (not permanantly) and are forced to take on droves of enemies on your own. Many battles seem to occur in waves, it would have been nice to overcome one wave of enemies, then get a save, then continue. It has caused me on multiple occasions to quit the game because I just don't have the mental capacity to deal with this kind of rage. This is coming from someone with hundreds of hours clocked in Dark Souls. I know that there's nothing worse than getting far in a tough situation, only to die and have to redo the entire fight. At least in Dark Souls it  makes sense though. Other than that I only have praise for the game The story is powerful, I like the clashing characters (I don't /like/ their clashing, I just find it realistic and a great way to cause tension), the gunplay is top notch. The enemy chatter when not engaged is realistic and immersive, reminds me of the guys in Battlefield Bad Company 2 who talk about the movie ""Predator"" before you have to kill them. It makes you think that these are real humans, it makes you think about your actions and everything you do. Which is, in the end, the entire point of the game.			"

												There is a scene where two guys are smoking on balcony or something, talking about their lives, the sunset, their experiences, their dreams, their family, their friends. They are not very important characters, just another of the seemingly endless supply of bad guys the game throws at you. After I heard their conversation I stopped a moment before my team and I shot them. They would no longer share their stories, they probably did not expect that peaceful sunset setting over those desolate ruins of a debauched city to be the last thing they saw. That is when I realized. I was not killing ""bad guys"", I was killing people. People who had as much to look towards to as I did, and has lived as fully, and I killed them. That is the feeling you should get when taking a life, not a casual dismissal as another number in the kill count, it seems game developers forget to add this most important element to shooters and action games. Shoot first ask questions later seems to be the purveying rule when addressing this genre. So far this is the only game that has made me feel the morality of such a rule. When I killed those two, I realized there was no right or wrong, just difference of opinions that could never be solved and has escalated beyond any form of civil discussion. This was meant to be a short review, with some dry humour, but this is what this game does to you. It makes you feel and regret and question until you've reached a conclusion that satisfies your morals. I still have to find it in me to find the moral compass required to pick up this game again. To steel myself against the immorality of killing and become numb to the feeling of taking a life. I have to draw the line somewhere.The gameplay and graphics are pretty nice too10/10TL;DR This game makes you feel bad for killing others.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is an awesome game that challenges ones moral convictions. There are tough choices to be made as Walker slowly descends into madness. Its an incredible story set in a realistic post-apocalyptic Dubai complete with blinding sandstorms and scattered debris. The controls should be better, but they aren't that bad. There a a few sections that are a little tough that tighter controls would have been nice, but overall its an awesome game. 9/10 will play again			"

												This is a first person shooterand you can skip the videos and ingore the story.But this game is about the story.The shooting mechanism is good, the cover system is very good, the weapons are fun to shoot with. The game would be a good shooter on its own.But the game shines when it comes to the story. Sometimes you have to make choices. I do not know the differences between the choices or if there are totally different stories depending on the choices. But I do know that I really was sad when my choices turned the events in certain ways.This is not a funny game. It is a sad game for adults.I liked the story, the graphics, the sound, the handling of the character, the weapons, nearly all of it.I disliked that certain situations are so much harder than the rest of the game.If you like shooters where you have to use cover to be able to survive, if you like a good story then you should like this game too.It is not very long, it took me 6 hours on normal difficulty. But this game is really good.I think it is only for persons > 20 years interesting, but I might be wrong there. Don't know.Get it, play it and live with your choices.			"

												If you're looking for a game whose plot makes Camus and Kafka seem positively *uplifiting*, well, here you go.  It's both well-written and utterly depressing.  This is *not* a generic feel-good heroic rah-rah shooter.  In a way, it could even be termed ""survival horror"" in the purest form... the horrors that emerge from within the human mind and form, rather than mere zombies or mutants.Mechanically, it's fairly prosaic -- third-person, cover-based, regenerating health, a variety of modern weapons, a couple of companions generally.   The checkpoint system is somewhat obnoxious but checkpoints are fairly common, and if you repeatedly fail the game will start providing you with extra ammunition and even suggest lowering the difficulty (which you can do at the cost of restarting your current checkpoint).It is not a terribly long game, so don't be expecting a 40-hour run. There are some technical quirks like encrypted INI files (google around for decryption / encryption utilities) with settings that the menus don't let you change otherwise (notably, depth of field, radial blur... and mouse acceleration!).  It's a minor inconvenience since tools do exist, but just be aware.The recommendation cannot be generic, as this game is *definitely* not for everyone.			"

It puts the player into the soldier's boots and has you make decisions for the city of Dubai. These choices that are made are not so cut and dry as the other war games. In Spec Ops, your selections consist of picking grey or gray in a world of black and white; therefore, by the end of the game you will be questioning your own motives and thoughts. As a result, your mind begins to play games against you.The combat is well done for being a cover system. This story is mind blowingly good. The AI is smart for the most part on both sides of the fight. Overall, the environment is beautiful; at the same time Dubai is alive and dead as you enter the skyscrapers and walk the streets of this bloodstained, sand filled warzone.			"

												I started this game up with little expectations as it like just just a cheap TPS with decent graphics and a surprisingly acclaimed story by a well known gaming writer. Figured the story would be o.k enough to justify the price, so I bought it during a sale.To put it bluntly, yes, gameplay wise it is as GENERIC of a TPS or any shooter for that matter. Guns have little to no punch, enemy AI is basic but otherwise predictable and unchallenging, and weapon variety is decent but limiting with the 2 weapon loadout system... but, BUT... the story...Let me just say the STORY for this game is the REAL SELLING POINT, far above the gameplay. You play Captain Walker accompanied by his boyband of I swear must be Ice Cube and Matt Damon impersinators. They at first seem uninteresting with that classic ""HOO RAAAWWW"" mentality games like Call of Duty suffer from. As the story progresses they get broken down, beaten up, shot, stabbed, burned, and tortured until only a husk of a human being survives.The stuff these guys go to is the stuff of knightmares and it culminates to shocking revelations, and mental barriers being broken one by one. As each character commits atrocious acts of violence they lose whatever humanity stuck with them at the beggining, degrading into savage killing machines who literally cause the city to burn by the end of it. I dont wish to spoil too much, but it is a serious trip.I repeat DO NOT buy this game if you are looking for a satisfying TPS like Vanquish, Gear of War. Space Marine, Uncharted, Last of Us, etc. Instead BUY THIS GAME if you want a jaw dropping and heart wrenching story that characterises the horrors of War in a very Apocolypse Now esque manner with brutality, savagery, and sheer gut wrenching violence NO MILITARY SHOOTER HAS EVER DONE outside of some obscure Vietnam games. 11/10... would feel like a terrible person again.

												There is a scene where two guys are smoking on balcony or something, talking about their lives, the sunset, their experiences, their dreams, their family, their friends. They are not very important characters, just another of the seemingly endless supply of bad guys the game throws at you. After I heard their conversation I stopped a moment before my team and I shot them. They would no longer share their stories, they probably did not expect that peaceful sunset setting over those desolate ruins of a debauched city to be the last thing they saw. That is when I realized. I was not killing ""bad guys"", I was killing people. People who had as much to look towards to as I did, and has lived as fully, and I killed them. That is the feeling you should get when taking a life, not a casual dismissal as another number in the kill count, it seems game developers forget to add this most important element to shooters and action games. Shoot first ask questions later seems to be the purveying rule when addressing this genre. So far this is the only game that has made me feel the morality of such a rule. When I killed those two, I realized there was no right or wrong, just difference of opinions that could never be solved and has escalated beyond any form of civil discussion. This was meant to be a short review, with some dry humour, but this is what this game does to you. It makes you feel and regret and question until you've reached a conclusion that satisfies your morals. I still have to find it in me to find the moral compass required to pick up this game again. To steel myself against the immorality of killing and become numb to the feeling of taking a life. I have to draw the line somewhere.The gameplay and graphics are pretty nice too10/10TL;DR This game makes you feel bad for killing others.			"

												Excelent story telling and gameplay. Everything is spot on, save for a couple large issues.1.) Cover is everywhere and reliable almost all the time. I say almost, sometimes you'll take cover against the wrong side of a wall and you'll end up dead because of it. Sometimes the cover doesn't work at all. Some things that look like they should be cover aren't, which can get you killed very easily. But as I said, it's very uncommon for this to occur.2.) The Checkpoint placement is absolutely H O R R E N D O U S, forcing you to redo large battles over and over, considering the game is relatively difficulty. This is a major problem, especially near the end of the game when you lose a squad mate (not permanantly) and are forced to take on droves of enemies on your own. Many battles seem to occur in waves, it would have been nice to overcome one wave of enemies, then get a save, then continue. It has caused me on multiple occasions to quit the game because I just don't have the mental capacity to deal with this kind of rage. This is coming from someone with hundreds of hours clocked in Dark Souls. I know that there's nothing worse than getting far in a tough situation, only to die and have to redo the entire fight. At least in Dark Souls it  makes sense though. Other than that I only have praise for the game The story is powerful, I like the clashing characters (I don't /like/ their clashing, I just find it realistic and a great way to cause tension), the gunplay is top notch. The enemy chatter when not engaged is realistic and immersive, reminds me of the guys in Battlefield Bad Company 2 who talk about the movie ""Predator"" before you have to kill them. It makes you think that these are real humans, it makes you think about your actions and everything you do. Which is, in the end, the entire point of the game.			"

												This was a surprisingly engaging game. It looks generic, but Nolan North's voice acting is a nice touch and the story is a change from other military shooters. It's not original by any means, but the characters are interesting enough to play this one until the end. It takes about 8 hours to complete, and the game is well optimized so high frame rates can be achieved if V-Sync is turned off. The graphics are amazing, as well as the audio. The gameplay is a standard third person cover game, but it works perfectly so that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ammo is scarce at times, so you'll find yourself picking up enemy weapons a lot in order to have a functional weapon. I'd recommend buying this game, it's not a Call of Duty ripoff - but instead more character focused... a story based around the effects of war and the hard choices that are made. What is right and what is wrong?			"

No doubt you got this game because of its reputation but dont fear,its worth every penny.First of all,dont spoil yourself,even the slightest detail might ruin your game experince,just buy the game and play it.In short the story is well...its the best story in modern gaming in my opinion since it gives the player nothing but the honest truth,in slight variations anyway,il just leave it at that.As far as the game mechanics go its pretty solid.Ive heard alot about GoW similarities but frankly that is bs,this game has its own take on the shooting mechanics and is diffrent enough for it to have its own brand of it.The hitbox is good,the weapon feel is pretty solid, the only downside might be the lack of diffrent weaponry,although it has a somewhat varied one.-Would you recommend it?I would, 100%.

												If you play games just for fun then this game isn't for you. On the other hand if you enjoy a good story and game experience you will have a great time with Spec Ops: The Line but, BEWARE, THIS GAME IS ALOT GRIM! I beated this game in about 5 hours, more or less, and I have to say that I did get bored sometimes with the gameplay. It is in it's own a pretty basic run n' cover  third person shooter with squad commands, there's plenty of these out there. But where the game really shines is in the story. This game, despite it's short length, was easily one of the best 5 hours I spent playing a video game. I have to thank Yager Development for making one of the best, most engaging, stories in recent years along with probably amongst the best character development and character design I've ever seen in a video game.

												It's a worthwhile product. Long story short, play it on easy difficulty and just for the story. The gameplay is used cleverly sometimes in unconventional ways.Not a masterpiece, some narrative twists are done for better drama effect even in Max Payne from 2001 by action game standards. Nothing more and nothing less than a good war drama set up in juxtaposition against ""conventional"" patriotic action ones. An allure towards the nihilistic unfortunately, as it only questions and doubts without introducing anything new.It's a recycling of previous notable works as ""Apocalypse Now"".The problem of the game is that the gameplay messes with the ""no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" approach to traumatized human feelings. The attempt to sarcasm Saving Private Ryan and other action war products of American culture is in conflict with the serious message on the topic of war. Breaking the 4'th wall is far too often used with questionable end result or in any cohesive message delivered.It's awesome to have Spec Ops attempt a new approach. I'm optimistically looking to the future of this message progress further. As a media, video games need more of this. However without trying to use inappropriate tools to convey those messages through achievements, hero puns. I wasn't searching for action in the first place. Did not think it was amusing or well placed.It would also be interesting to hear arguments pro war too. Or how consistent the message was in general, without deconstructions in post modernist style. Again, a lot of weak points in the general anti war message with wide generalisation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Recommended for familiarisation.

												A wonderfully, terrible third person shooter that you can finish in a weekend. Spec Ops: The Line will draw you in with its generic box art and derivative gameplay, and then flip you on your head and stomp on your gut because you're a terrible person. The game opens in medias res with (all together now) a helicopter chase scene wherein you mow down other helicopters with an infinite ammo minigun, until one of them crashes into you. flash back to the beginning where our protangonists are on a mission to find out what happened in Dubai after a record sandstorm hit. You fight some local insurgents, explore some interesting sand infested buildings, and slowly learn about a CIA operation and a rogue American Infantry unit. After about an hour of run-of-the-mill shooter story, things start to get a little strange. First you start killing other American soldiers in self-defense. Then you're trying to figure out if you can trust the CIA agents or not. pretty soon you're raining down white phosphorus on an entire platoon of your fellow soldiers and innocent civilians!Wait what?Yeah, it only gets better from there, and the best part is the story ramps up so smoothly and the gameplay is integrated into that story so well. The loading screens start off with helpful hints about gameplay then slowly shift to unnerving messages directed at the player in real life. The animations of the characters even change over time! The early game will see Cpt. Walker punch or rifle butt a downed enemy to finish him off, but later on he starts getting more viscious by shooting them in the face while they beg for mercy. Even the mission objectives are integrated into this mad scheme. They start off like any other game: go here, defend this, eliminate that. But then they change: obey, murder, and so on.Often in games we see a sort of cognitive dissonance between what the game is telling us about a character and what the character actually does in the game when we're controlling them (see the Tomb Raider reboot). Spec Ops is both a great example of how to not have that problem AND is the greatest display of cognitive dissonance AT THE SAME TIME!I could go on, but the Extra Credits team has already articulated my thoughts better than I can. I do have a few closing thoughts though. First and foremost, yes the gameplay isn't very good. You run. Your gun. You take cover. Enemies spawn in obvious spots. It's all very early 2000s shooter. However, that's all done on purpose to highlight and critique those very same generic shooters. Second, this is strictly a single player game. There is no multiplayer, nor should there have ever been (although maybe they also tacked it on just to show a point). Finally, and most importantly, I'd like you all to remember: you choose to play this game. You choose to do all those horrible things. Really, the only way to win this game is to stop playing it. But even then, you'd still be losing.			"

												Ignore my hours, I mostly played this game because my internet was down. This game had an amazing story. A super amazing story. It really does ask the question ""Where do you draw the line?"" There are not many points where you can choose what to do, but this is good, because every single point where you CAN decide what to do is a serious event, and I found myself pausing multiple times to think things through. The only negative thing I had about this game were the controls, I did die a few times because of my character doing something I didn't want him to do.

												Spec Ops is an interesting game. It's a Third-Person Shooter with a story that is designed to make you think about your decisions. My problem with the game is that the major decisions are out of your control. You have no say what-so-ever in the outcomes of them. The few decisions that you are given are minor and ultimately have no effect on which of the 4 endings of the game you will receive. The endings are based on which of the 4 options you choose at the very end of the game. I have a hard time feeling bad for a decision that the game chose. The ""obvious"" answer to some who say you do have a choice is to just not play the game. That is a poor answer to me. You would not experience the rest of the story or the game unless you watched it on YouTube, or had someone tell you what happens. The actual combat in the game is typical TPS or FPS run-and-gun. I would recommend playing on Easy if you do decide to play the game. You do not lose or gain anything other than achievements by picking this option. I would play the game for the story and not the gameplay.All in all, it is an interesting game, but I would never say that I had fun playing it. Get it if you are just absolutely interesting in playing. I would recommend waiting for it to be on sale for $5 or around that area, for the 5-6.5 hours that it lasts.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a seemingly average game at first glance -- linear third person shooter with a selection of current-gen guns that features a near-invincible protagonist killing everything that moves. What's driving the difference between the metacritic score and the rave reviews is that this game has a really entertaining storyline -- it's an homage to Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now. The antagonist is even named Conrad. It tries to shine perspective on the choices that you make as a soldier to survive, but if you just want to gun everyone down like I do, the game is still rewarding for that.The graphics are alright, although the sepia tone gets tiring after a while.

												This is hands-down one of the most emotionally engaging and impactful games I have ever played. What starts out as your run-of-the-mill third-person military shooter, quickly turns into a psychological and unique story unseen in modern gaming. The developers did an incredible job of truly making you feel the weight and consequences of the decisions you've made in not just this game, but every game you've played previously.I personally do not enjoy shooters; this is precisely why I loved this game so much. It is not only addictive and engaging, but it's a smart and expertly crafted critique of the very genre it represents. Nolan North's performance is extremely impressive, even given his pedigree. I cannot recommend this game highly enough - if you want to experience something unique and memorable, you need to play this game. I finished it in one sitting it was so addicting.			"

Spec Ops: The Line explores the horrors of war through its harrowing, psychologically jarring narrative while blending in elements of science-fiction with its dystopian vision of a sandstorm-ravaged Dubai (the setting itself being the real star of the game). The cover-based third-person shooter mechanics, while essentially lifted from Gears Of War, are tightly crafted and well executed enough for the action to fluidly draw you in over an engrossing 10+ hour campaign.

												This game is indeed different. The story is very well done, and makes the game something special. The graphics and sound are OK. The action is good, with sufficient variety of weapons and situations. The one thing I disliked about this game were the somewhat broken mechanics. The cover is clunky, yet quite necessary to this game, and the same keys are used for wildly different actions, such as one key for vaulting and melee, and another for sprinting and cover. So sometimes you will sprint when you want to cover, and sometimes you will melee when you want to vault. It would be a 9/10 without this pretty glaring fault, so I'm giving it a solid 7.5/10.			"

												It's a relatively short game. You can finish it pretty quickly. It's a beautiful game. The graphics are excellent, especially the environmental effects. It's got some good squad-support mechanics, a bit of RTS mixed in when it comes to combat.Where it really stands out is the story. This is no CoD shoot-em-up against the russian/korean/middle eastern/chinese terrorists who pose a threat to MURRICA and the good guys have to go blast 'em with MUH FREEDOMS until they're all dead and a soaring bald eagle screams overhead just before the credits.No, this game takes a much more realistic approach with a small squad in unfamiliar territory as you watch the effects of combat and decision-making on their mental state and relationships.Of course, it's a game, so it is a dramatization. But it's an excellent game. Your choices have an effect. It wasn't made so you could choke on McDonald's while singing the Star-Spangled Banner. It was made to show that on the inside, there is no glory in war.			"

												This was a surprisingly engaging game. It looks generic, but Nolan North's voice acting is a nice touch and the story is a change from other military shooters. It's not original by any means, but the characters are interesting enough to play this one until the end. It takes about 8 hours to complete, and the game is well optimized so high frame rates can be achieved if V-Sync is turned off. The graphics are amazing, as well as the audio. The gameplay is a standard third person cover game, but it works perfectly so that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ammo is scarce at times, so you'll find yourself picking up enemy weapons a lot in order to have a functional weapon. I'd recommend buying this game, it's not a Call of Duty ripoff - but instead more character focused... a story based around the effects of war and the hard choices that are made. What is right and what is wrong?			"

												It takes a strong man to deny what's infront of him.This game is fantastic, the best third person shooter and has best cover mechanics I played other than Uncharted series (which coincidentally has the same voice actor for main character). I recommend you buy this game if you enjoy a good story and cover based mechanics.			"

												Very few games have made me feel like Spec Ops: The Line has. To me, it seems like an abundant number of shooters are growing increasingly generic. Producing gore for gore’s sake, and scarcely ever using mature or violent content to actually make you feel for a character. Spec Ops: The Line is the embodiment of evidence that not all games adhere to this philosophy. Sadly, the game is also highly overlooked. Many people have, despite its obvious superiority to popular shooters, never been aware of its existence. The story is well written and quite riveting. Spec Ops: The Line places you in inconceivable situations, and imposes morbidity regardless of choices you make. For example, if you were given an option to save either a close friend or a hundred innocent people, you will feel equally awful no matter what you choose. While this might refrain from appearing unprecedented, Spec Ops: The Line does so in a believable setting with well-built characters, conveying emotional and vivid events. I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics. The yellow sands contrast well with the blue and purple hues used throughout. Many scenes are beautiful, the conjunction of ruined city and serene sand paints a stunning landscape. Spec Ops: The Line’s port (the game originally debuted on the Xbox 360) is adequate, most elements perform perfectly, however there are a few things that were not implemented well. Apart from minor issues, the game looks and plays fine on the PC.Unfortunately, Spec Ops: The Line does not innovate further. The gameplay mechanics are similar to an average third-person shooter. Acoustics are acceptable, but far from memorable. I felt that even slight enhancements on these elements would significantly improve upon the overall experience. Nevertheless, it is still enjoyable to play. Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is seeking a shooter with a fantastic story. To me, a good story is always imperative - this one supersedes many others of the genre. Spec Ops: The Line is usually on sale during special events. That being said, I think it is completely worth it at full price, especially considering the quality that rivals many full-priced games.			"

												If you're looking for a game whose plot makes Camus and Kafka seem positively *uplifiting*, well, here you go.  It's both well-written and utterly depressing.  This is *not* a generic feel-good heroic rah-rah shooter.  In a way, it could even be termed ""survival horror"" in the purest form... the horrors that emerge from within the human mind and form, rather than mere zombies or mutants.Mechanically, it's fairly prosaic -- third-person, cover-based, regenerating health, a variety of modern weapons, a couple of companions generally.   The checkpoint system is somewhat obnoxious but checkpoints are fairly common, and if you repeatedly fail the game will start providing you with extra ammunition and even suggest lowering the difficulty (which you can do at the cost of restarting your current checkpoint).It is not a terribly long game, so don't be expecting a 40-hour run. There are some technical quirks like encrypted INI files (google around for decryption / encryption utilities) with settings that the menus don't let you change otherwise (notably, depth of field, radial blur... and mouse acceleration!).  It's a minor inconvenience since tools do exist, but just be aware.The recommendation cannot be generic, as this game is *definitely* not for everyone.			"

Perfect for people who want to know what it feels like to try your best and end up looking like a d1ck thanks to a manipulative mofo.

(guys who have played will know what i'm talking about) I thought i was the good guy. what happened?

												It's a relatively short game. You can finish it pretty quickly. It's a beautiful game. The graphics are excellent, especially the environmental effects. It's got some good squad-support mechanics, a bit of RTS mixed in when it comes to combat.Where it really stands out is the story. This is no CoD shoot-em-up against the russian/korean/middle eastern/chinese terrorists who pose a threat to MURRICA and the good guys have to go blast 'em with MUH FREEDOMS until they're all dead and a soaring bald eagle screams overhead just before the credits.No, this game takes a much more realistic approach with a small squad in unfamiliar territory as you watch the effects of combat and decision-making on their mental state and relationships.Of course, it's a game, so it is a dramatization. But it's an excellent game. Your choices have an effect. It wasn't made so you could choke on McDonald's while singing the Star-Spangled Banner. It was made to show that on the inside, there is no glory in war.			"

												A wonderfully, terrible third person shooter that you can finish in a weekend. Spec Ops: The Line will draw you in with its generic box art and derivative gameplay, and then flip you on your head and stomp on your gut because you're a terrible person. The game opens in medias res with (all together now) a helicopter chase scene wherein you mow down other helicopters with an infinite ammo minigun, until one of them crashes into you. flash back to the beginning where our protangonists are on a mission to find out what happened in Dubai after a record sandstorm hit. You fight some local insurgents, explore some interesting sand infested buildings, and slowly learn about a CIA operation and a rogue American Infantry unit. After about an hour of run-of-the-mill shooter story, things start to get a little strange. First you start killing other American soldiers in self-defense. Then you're trying to figure out if you can trust the CIA agents or not. pretty soon you're raining down white phosphorus on an entire platoon of your fellow soldiers and innocent civilians!Wait what?Yeah, it only gets better from there, and the best part is the story ramps up so smoothly and the gameplay is integrated into that story so well. The loading screens start off with helpful hints about gameplay then slowly shift to unnerving messages directed at the player in real life. The animations of the characters even change over time! The early game will see Cpt. Walker punch or rifle butt a downed enemy to finish him off, but later on he starts getting more viscious by shooting them in the face while they beg for mercy. Even the mission objectives are integrated into this mad scheme. They start off like any other game: go here, defend this, eliminate that. But then they change: obey, murder, and so on.Often in games we see a sort of cognitive dissonance between what the game is telling us about a character and what the character actually does in the game when we're controlling them (see the Tomb Raider reboot). Spec Ops is both a great example of how to not have that problem AND is the greatest display of cognitive dissonance AT THE SAME TIME!I could go on, but the Extra Credits team has already articulated my thoughts better than I can. I do have a few closing thoughts though. First and foremost, yes the gameplay isn't very good. You run. Your gun. You take cover. Enemies spawn in obvious spots. It's all very early 2000s shooter. However, that's all done on purpose to highlight and critique those very same generic shooters. Second, this is strictly a single player game. There is no multiplayer, nor should there have ever been (although maybe they also tacked it on just to show a point). Finally, and most importantly, I'd like you all to remember: you choose to play this game. You choose to do all those horrible things. Really, the only way to win this game is to stop playing it. But even then, you'd still be losing.			"

												Spec Ops is not your usual 3rd person shooter using the standard cover system, it has the same sort of gameplay you would find in the Uncharted series but overcomes that with an amazing story that has you making morale decisions. I highly recommend this game for the story and gameplay which is very fun. The graphics and environments are beautiful with top notch sound and voice acting. The games takes about 6 hours to complete and you will want to play the game twice to see how the story elements unfold by your decisions. I enjoyed the game so much I beat it 3 times up to the highest difficulty (FUBAR) and got all 50 achievements!			"

												This is one of those games where it's best to play it without knowing ANYTHING at all about it. Unfortunately that means you can't/shouldn't show or tell why it's a great game in screenshots, videos, or reviews. I bought this game blind, not even knowing it was a third-person shooter and not a FPS. Just heard a bunch of people saying ""you gotta play this, it's not the generic brown military bro-shooter you think it is."" Otherwise I would've ignored it entirely as I'd been doing.I'll say this: the game looks beautiful, it's well-acted, and the gameplay is solid albeit rather conventional cover-based action. It's also pretty darned short. It took me 9 hours instead of 6 on Normal because of repeated dumb screw-ups brought on by the fact that the controls for exiting cover are a little screwy. If you move perpendicular to the cover's orientation...you leave it. But if you can get this for < $20--which you can since it tanked on account that one can't convey why it's unique--it's a must.

												2-sentence review : I came to that game from the hype about the difficult moral choices, but there was none (the marketing guys probably never played any RPG in their life). However, I got a solid TPS with a lot of action and an incredible scenery, packaged in an intriguing but ultimately disappointing story-telling.Pros :- Amazing & original scenery : Dubai lost in a desert storm- Even better, the scenery is well exploited and brings a lot in the gameplay- Solid TPS gameplay ; nothing out of the ordinary, but all the basis are there and well implemented- Good story-telling, but...Cons :- ... But the story doesn't make much sense (yup, I've read all the explanations and they still don't explain correctly a lot of things ; I guess it's just hard to fit what the authors wanted to do with the mechanisms of a shooter game)- Worst, the story setting isn't explained clearly, which made me know less than the protagonists and let me wondering what's the heck was going on during almost all the game- The story setting is actually some kind of Science-Fiction stuff ; it's not bad in itself, but it would have required some clear explanation (in very short : Dubai has been taken in a several months long desert storm and people are going to die soon)- We have to find some intelligence during the game that explains a bit more what happened in Dubai ; some of this stuff is hidden, which means I missed some and it made the story even more muddy... :-/- It is in no way tactical (not a con for me, but it's advertised otherwise, so better be clear on that)Bonus Note :Major Spoiler : I'm going to explain why the moral concept completely failed for me.There's no choice that matters, and worst, no choice I felt implicated into.Story-wise, the point of no return is when our character kills by mistake civilians. However, I had spotted these civilians and consciously did my best to avoid killing them by firing the mortar on the opposite side of where they were standing. The game still killed them all by making that particular mortar explosion much much bigger than the previous ones. Bummer... :-/I also almost never shot 1st, died several times for that, and thus it completely voids the idea we're the bad guys... "

Story is well written and you are not just killing wave of enemies. I won't go into positive side much as I agree with others.However if u r using K/M u will have difficulties as game is designed for console. It does not say which key is for what. For example; I could not switch between grenades nor listen the intels I collected. The game says use ""B"" on controller but no idea what to use on keyboard. And for all others u have to try one by one (to throw nade, revive, take cover etc...)one thing I liked is when u have a decision to make the game does not tell u to choose. You simple react (i.e. to shoot a guy or let him go). This is so cool and unique and make your choices more natural.result, great game great story great ending, bad k/m support.played it on hard difficulty and I advice all to do so.Strongly recomended			"

												This game right here is freaking sick !!! amazing graphics, amazing story.The cover mechanic is ok, kinda like GEARS of WAR without the ridiculous health. i really wish their were more commands for your teammates apart from kill or heal, they get right in the line of fire and get down easy on higher difficulties. The enemy AI can be dumb sometimes, but make great use of cover use real military commands, swear alot and offer a good challenge on higher difficulties. the game's level are well designed i was expecting sand dunes all over the place, with a couple buildings or two, but instead got a semi-destructible environments such as shooting glass to drop sand on enemies, turrets mowing down certain covers.They did a fantastic job on the interiors; the glass, the carpet, plants, piano etc... everything had detail and time put into it. I like the background music alot, there is nothing like a shoot-out with classic rock in the background, it gets you pumped up(recommend putting the music on 10, sfx and voices on 7 amplifies does moments to a whole new level). The choices in this game are minor, but satisfying in a weird and evil way each worse than the other; like capping a guy with a magnum to prevent him the harsher death of being roasted alive might make you cringe, feel guilty and even put your controller away for a while ( or mouse, i like controllers better although admitting mouse & keyboard offers greater accuracy). I made every evil choice in this game and enjoyed it and in the end died like boss(felt like a true Sith lord), dying in the end  is optional this is not a Bioware game after all. Forget about that metascore of 76, this game is a 8.5/10 in my book and thats just because the storyline is kinda short and i never could find someone to play with on multiplayer, there are no multiplayer achievements so i did not worry about that. In the end none of these matters, it's just a vessel for a great story. No amount of buggy controls(extremely minor in this game), glitches (seems like i randomly could not take\switch cover )should keep you away from such a great storyline.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is one of the only games I would ever recommend putting on the lowest difficulty on the first playthrough.This is not a game you play for the amazing gameplay, although it's nothing worse than generic. I liked it. Different strokes for different folks.Were it to be judged purely on its design and mechanics, Spec Ops: The Line would be pretty forgettable, but it has an ace in the hole. And it's a bigg'un: a story so out of the blue in its direction and message that it's a miracle, a major publisher put this game out at all. What you think you're getting- particularly if you only play the demo- is another gung-ho gun-wielding slice of Americans saving the day by killing all the brown people. What you actually get is a slow, spiralling descent into madness of one man, that wears its Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now inspirations proudly and uses them to forge a modern-day commentary on the type of video game you thought you were going to play. Captain Walker is no tiantic Call of Duty avatar who can murder a thousand people and walk away- he falls apart mentally, visually and audibly as the game continues, his professionalism is stripped away and raw ego left exposed. ""Tango down"" becomes a more chilling, ""Kill is ♥♥♥♥ing confirmed"" as the game confronts you with issues of culpability and responsibility. It's incredibly unsettling and so out of the ordinary for the modern gamer that to most people, this might be thrown aside in disgust.This is no Gears Of War/Army Of Two clone. This is the story of one man who loses himself to the brutality of war.To the open minded and for someone who wants a great story mixed with an unsettling message, this is a MUST OWN. "

												This was actually a very surpising game. I really did not think I would have liked it as much as I did since I am not a huge fan of modern military shooters. The main reason why I tried it was because I kept hearing great things about the way the narrative was handled and I was not let down. It does not glorify war or the military and it actually felt like the developers put a lot of time into developing the story. In this game, story came first, and the multiplayer aspect came second, and that is something that is a bit rare in shooters nowadays. So without further ado,  here's my review. Gameplay  The game is a third person shooter and has all the stuff that is considered standard in third person shooters nowadays: cover system, grenade projectory, blind shooting, etc. In terms of shooting, the game really brings nothing new to the table. It is all pretty standard shooting and the enemies provide a decent enough challenge. The player does have a squad that they can order around, but it pretty much boils down to the player telling them to just focus on a specific target or throw the occasional flashbang. A fun little mechanic, but nothing that is very innovative for the genre.At times the controls can be a bit clunky and I have died a few times because my character got stuck in cover, but it doesn't detract that much from the main game. Since the shooting is a bit standard and the controls are a bit clunky, the multiplayer really is not that great, so if that's what you're looking for, don't get this game. In terms of gameplay, it really isn't anything revolutionary. Story This is where the game really shines, and people who have played the game would probably tend to agree with me. It actually does a great job at providing a mystery for the player to figure out and the reveal is very well done.  The main idea of it is that sometimes it is not always clear what decision is the right one, especially in times of war. It shows a much different ""war"" than we are used to seeing in video games. One where not all the player's actions are not necessarilly the right or wrong choice. They are choices where, at the time, you thought for sure they were the right decision. (Or you thought for sure they were the wrong decision, if you're a bit sadistic.) The characters are actually pretty well developed too. I'll be honest, when I first started the game, I thought the characters were going to be the typical military charracter that we find in lots of media. You know the trope I am talking about, the ""I aint got time to bleed"" guys. I was pleasantly surprised to see that while the characters were tough, it wasn't their defining trait. The interactions they have after some of the situations they get into are quite believable and the player's squadmates have pretty distinct characteristics. When they disagree with the player, they let it be known. I like how the developers handled this in particular because in the beginning of the game when they disagree with the player, they just give you a certain look or something subtle. As the game progresses and the squad starts to see more and more horrible things, that subtle look of contempt turns into more obvious displays of their dissatisfaction. The strongest part of the story have to be both the main character (the player) and the villain. The trauma that a soldier experiences in times of war is depicted very well in the mental state of the main character. The way they depict how the main character starts to question the morality of his actions and why he is even fighting is just something that you don't typically see in games that are centered around the military. And that's really all I can safely say without completely spoiling anything.  TL;DR  Pros  - Great story- Great character development- Interesting environment- Some genuinely great music thanks to Radioman Cons - Standard gameplay for a shooter- Controls are a bit clunky- multiplayer is not the greatest.Overall, I believe this game is worth buying for the story alone.

I know, I require a lot: don't be that fokcing linear and repetitive, don't make me just move from point A to point B with the only one action of killing people, make something that sucks me into your game, if not with actions but at least with some intriguing narrative WHEN VOICE ACTORS DON'T JUST READ FROM THE PAPER MONOTONOUSLY BUT, HELLO?

												- duration of game (without deads about 5-6 hours)- Multiplayer (gameplays looks awesome, but I couldn´t find any server, nobody plays it...)- Keyboard setting (for example melee and jumping over cover is the same button)+/- your 2 partners (sometimes very good helpers /Lugo can easy take out snipers/ but sometimes wrong AI, they can dead outside, you can´t help them etc.)+/- Very easy achievements (Good for noobs, bad for hadcore players)+ Story (you can decide in few parts of game what to do)+ Weapons+ Graphic (Apocalyptic Dubai.. ..Man... AWESOME!)+ Dubbing and whole sound in game+ COOP with 1 friendThis awesome 3th person game is set in apocalyptic Dubai where you take a role like Captain of team 3 guys and you have to find out what happened. That´s all about story, cause I don´t want show anything, but I can say that it´s great with shocking moments and some decide parts. Gameplay is on good level with lots of weapons (assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, machine guns...) and covering, running, camping system is like in Ghost Recon Phantoms. I didn´t find many negatives in this game, maybe the 1 big is sometimes your partners. They can be easy downed on open place without cover, so it´s difficult to help them, but this is a real problem only o hard difficulties. All in all: 90% "

												Wow!  What an amazing, story-driven, combat game.  It was like watching a serious and brutally viscious war-gone-bad movie on acid.  The character voice-acting, imho, is the finest yet in all of gaming.  The music is top notch.  The weapons are real military weapons, and there's many.  The visuals are excellent.  The many diverse combat sequences are wild, intense, and sometimes challenging.  Some combat scenes and cutscenes are downright crazy, shocking, and memorable.  I think this is one of the best games ever made, and it's bound to be a classic.  I highly recommend it, but only if you can stomach brutal war images.			"

												Expecting a standard military TPS with some hamfisted morality message, I was instead treated to one of the greatest psychedelic war stories in recent memory.  The most I can say without spoiling anything is that Spec Ops: The Line calls to mind the 2nd half of Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, or the burning oil refinery scene in Jarhead.  It is a very well thought-out and self-aware commentary on the insanity of combat, culminating in an immensely satisfying and mindscrewing gauntlet.Mechanically the game is solid, although snapping in and out of cover is occasionally more awkward than it should be.  Ammunition is scarce even on the default difficulty, and nearly every encounter is designed in such a way that the tools for victory are always available if you have the right strategy.  I never felt like I was dying for any reason other than my own lack of skill.  Checkpoints are infrequent, so the sense of tension and reward when you clear a particularly difficult segment is tangible.  Compared to most other recent shooters this was a huge breath of fresh air.  Spec Ops respects your intelligence enough to assume you can figure out a way to shoot everybody in the room if you just put some thought into it.I bought and played this game on a whim (and because of a particular scene which you may have seen on Youtube involving incendiary weaponry).  If you've seen the same scene and felt the game was ruined/spoiled as a result, I assure you it's not.  That particular incident garnered a lot of publicity but only occurs about halfway into the game, with much more potent and interesting twists ahead of it.I still don't feel like a hero yet.			"

												At first sight when you never play this game to the very end; small levels with quite linear gameplay so a normal rail shooter by today’s standards, worth a look if you like the shooter genre (as you can tell I am not a fan of the genre)When you finish the game: The story just changed everything and makes you think the game is epic because of very unexpected changes.I really enjoyed this game because I hate your typical mainstream hero shooter game with 0 relation to the real horror of warfare. This game emerged me so much I played it from start to end in 1 day a rare thing for me. Your 2 AI companions are surprisingly smart, rarely had to save them from a stupid action + I can order them to focus on my target and I experienced 0 bugs. I only talk about single player but there seem to be a few co-op missions and multiplayer for which I (and most players) did not care.Graphically it was great, the choices and rare use of environment are appreciated but don't mean or change much. The story is the big plus for this game and was well executed. There are no good guys in this game only realistic humans. Wish there were more shooters like this but with more meaningful choices and bigger levels.At the discount I bought it, definitely recommend it. I never recommend shooters at full price they don’t last long enough and offer little replay ability in this case maybe once for a special difficulty, some collectables and the different endings.

												Spec Ops: The Line is a 2012 third-person shooter video game developed by Yager Development and published by 2K Games. It was released on 26 June 2012 in North America and 29 June 2012 internationally for Microsoft Windows, and the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles.n Spec Ops: The Line, the player controls Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a reconnaissance mission, where they find dead American soldiers. Upon the finding, Walker declares that the team's mission has changed, and that they will search Dubai for survivorsSpec Ops: does so many good things right, but falls short from a masterpiece. While the game is a brilliant set-piece of PTSD and the true horrors of war, it falls short as a game in whole. While the story, soundtrack, voice acting, visuals and overall quality is amazing, it's gameplay is just so generic and boring. Nothing new will be seen here, unfourtunately. The game is a third-person cover shooter game, with no originality. The cover system and gunplay are mediocre at best, and this is a real drawback from it being an amazing experience in all sectors. But, I really don't want to get too much into such details, it's just something you've played in a hundred other games, let's focus on what's so amazing about this underrated game.The story. It may sounds like something trivial, because people have high standards these days, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, amazing this amazing that, you get my point. This game is narative driven game, and that's it. Multiplayer is shallow and unstatisfying, but this isn't the point of Spec Ops. It's a game that sets one goal, and one goal only. To trully showcase the Horror of war. War is a gruesome experience that really scars the human mind, and while me and you won't probably fight in one, this game has a trully shocking way of showing us just how brutal things can get between the gunfire. It will surely have a last impact on you, it did on me at least. The game starts pretty standard, a turret section that's pretty bland and boring, nothing too over the top here. But once the game kick off, things start to get heated. We start in the shoes of Cpt. Martin Walker, voiced by Nolan North. The game starts off with you and your squad mates being sent to the new destroyed Dubai, to investigate and search for survivor, call for reinforcements and get back home. Those are your only orders, nothing more. But things get out of hand once Walker gives to order to  open fire on the enemy. This thing will become more relevant down the line, since this game has set out to question one simple thing, Who is the enemy?. And it will teach you that thing, once you complete it.Being developed on the Unreal 3 Engine, the games shines mostly. Dubai is a super showcase of glowing sand, vibrant interiors and a feel of depth and complexity. But it's all just a shell to hide all of the horros that lay ahead of your journey to destruction. The game will soon present to you the brutal, and extremely graphic violence of when things get ouf of hand when people mentally breakdown and can't tell the difference between good or evil. It's amazing, especially since this game breaks once and for all the trope that all enemy's in video games must be shot down immediatly without question, and because they are different or russian/middle eastern. It's superb, to be honest. In the end, since I could talk about this game for hours and hours, even though it's a short, but it's an intense ride, and filled with guilt. Never, ever I have felt such guild after playing a videogame. Like, really. Videogames that make you feel guilty? How is that? One might ask. Well, it's quite easy. This game does not reward you for shooting everyone in a 100km radius at the speed of Clint Eastwood, it will break you down as fast as the protagonists. It's amazing how well the story is crafter, considering at the end of the day, it makes you feel human, it makes you question so many things. Superb. Honestly, superb. In case you don't want to hear all of my rumbling, I will list the things that I enjoyed and disliked about this game and give it a rating.The goodAmazing storySuperb storyBreathtaking visualsRetroactive enviromentUnique settingIncredible soundtrack/voice actingMoral and emotionally heavyThe badGeneric gameplayMediocre gunplayShort lenghtCookie cutter multiplayerNo replay valueThe cover mechanics are a bit awkwardI give this game a 8/10 rating, thanks to so many good elements in it, falling short, unfortunately to such a generic gameplay. Amazing overall nonetheless, I highly recommend this game to everyone. "

												8,5/10Spec Ops The Line is an underrated game. If it was advertised like AAA titles it'd be one of best games of 2012.The story is good, giving choices and hcallanging (if played on highest difficulty). Some of moments that occur in the game are morally questionable. In real life they are considered war crime's. The game shows brutality of the war in small manner and complete lack of emotions from the oppressors.I recommend this game to everyone looking to have a great time in the game that is not casual! It can be completed within 7 hours.+ Interesting story with multiple choices at every occasion.+ Not boring with decent combat. Cover system reminds of Gears of War series.+Shows stuff that those pseudo-war games aka CoD and BF will never show.+ Not casual, it is easy to die.+ Low system requirements.+ Replayability value  (different choices throughout the game)+ Co-op+ Nice graphic quality...- ... textures could use higher resolution- too sensitive mouse controls, you need to set it to 1 ongame options at 2000DPi mouse to be playable- Linear story with choices. Yes, those choices are insignificant sometimes they are wrong.Neutral:Game lasts 6-7 hours.Out of all these advantages and disadvantages I recommend this game. Normally it costs 20€, it's good price but if you're saving money get it while on sale for 5€ ;) Regardless of which option you choose, it will be money well spent.			"

												A brutal storyline that shows how dark and sadistic human nature can be if that separates survival from death, or just greed and comfort from sharing. Paired up with a relatively short but compared to today's standards completely normal playtime and the well known generic TPS gameplay, it's a masterpiece where you won't even notice that the gameplay feels like the 1000th same TPS, because the atmosphere and the narrative is what gets you hooked on Spec Ops: The Line until you finish it. With all it's horrors and misleading delusions, it could be among the best fictional war movies with a perspective that slowly blurs reality with losing your mind to all the terror happening around you, with you, with your loved ones up to and beyond a point where you can't make a difference of what really happens and what is a delusion, and who is responsibile for all the death and suffering shown in shockingly real instead of overdramatizing and coloring it like the rest 99% of games do. It really is a masterpiece of psychological themed games. It makes YOU, the real person do horrific things and question your own morality, MAKES you want to find a twisted way to justify your decisions and depending on your choices, it possibly makes you feel like a monster.Other games tried it too but it was either too black and white or overly dramatized, almost cartoon-ish to keep the player reminded about this is fiction, and always gave a reason not to worry or feel like you are doing good in some way, even if that requires doing bad things.You'll question yourself here eventually, where were the line you shouldn't have crossed, and how long ago.And this is unprecedented in the gaming history.Throw in all this to the postapocaliptic feeling of Dubai being swallowed by the desert, with the people there being isolated from the world and are starving to survive any way neccessary.And the greatest thing is, that this isn't a selfish way of the developers to make their sick gore fantasy (partially) come to reality, everything you see is part of a greater puzzle, and once you see the whole picture it just blows your mind and leaves you in shock for minutes.TL,DR: It's pure genius worth mentioning (and being recommended) among the top games, even looking back more than two decades in the genre.

												ONLY SINGLEPLAYER REVIEW:I just finished the singleplayer. I already knew the story, the plot. But even with that knowledge, i wasn't prepared for this. This is masterpiece. The game market is flooded with modern military shooters, there are casuals like CoD, and Battlefield, or mechanicaly realistic like ARMA. But this. This shows what real war is. What PTSD feels like. The game is a third person cover based shooter, with all the right elements. there are around 10 weapons, some might say it's too few, but they are perfectly enough, since all of them feels differently and each has different firing mode. Using the covers feels smooth and natural. Shooting aswell. When you kill with a headshot, or get a multikill the game slows down a bit, you didn't just killed. You killed with brutality. Only thing i didn't like is the cluncy controls. Feels like i'm playing with controller settings on a keyboard. For example: Space - Use cover/Sprint/Drop down (from ledges).  R - Reload/Pick up weapon. This is PC. We have enough buttons, on our keyboards to use. It is annoying, that i want to run along a wall, and my character uses it as cover, or i want to pick up a gun, but i reload instead. Some positivity in the end: You have choices at certain points of the story, and i love that it wasn't: PRESS X TO DO THIS, PRESS Y TO DO THAT. The game not always tells you that you have a choice. But deep inside you know.			"

												Where should I start...This game is one beautiful surprise, you get in, thinking it's gonne one of these ""shooters"" where you do X thing to finish the game and then you get blown away. This game is a reflexion on war itself and on what war can do to the human race. What are we ready to do to survive....to accomplish our orders? The graphics in this game are astonishing and even though the weapons are quite limited, this will be the least of your worries when you will be stuck on your screen, trying to find out what's going on in this masterpiece. Finally, don't be afraid to shed a tear....it will only show yourself that you are still human and that this game accomplished it's objective perfectly.10/10 would erase my mind and play it again with the same feels.

												Spec Ops: The Line.To start of with I throught this game was just one of those games were everyone would ignore it, and it would just quietly past by in the corner. But no this game is a hidden gem, here is why.Spec Ops The Line is a 3rd person shooter, with a cover system. But Unlike the rest, this one is more story driven, this makes a massive difference to the way this game plays.Graphics, this game looked stunning when it first came out, and it still does now. The Devs really put alot of attension to detial and passion into this game..The charators look good and they animate very well, voice sync is pretty much perfect to lip movement etc. The guns you can tell what they are, but remember this is a 3rd person shooter.Finally the envirment, just wow, however word of warning which comes with a spoiler alert...This game turns...Dark and sinister quite quickly, now I did warn you that this one is different.Sounds, the weapons sound belivable, but when playing I m spending most of my time not getting shot than I am admiring the sound of the weapons. Explosions have a bassy smooth boom to them, the envirment itself when not in a fire fight is quite quiet all you can hear is the wind howling around the buildings and things moving about in the wind.Music is quite unnoticable during quiet stages of the game, just your standard low intensity tranquil music, till later in the game were the music turns, darker... the firefights the music does pick up but its over showed by the firefight itself.Last, voice acting. These are fantasic I mean they would be, this is a story driven 3 rd person shooter. You can even hear the mood in the voices they are that well done.Story, without giving away too much, this game is based in a storm ridden dubia, you are leader of 3 Spec ops trying to find survers and the ""dammed 31St""..But what you acturly find is..a place full of chaos, and civial war. This is all I m wanting to give away.Gameplay, as I said this game is a 3rd person shooter. To that point it plays like any other, it does have a cover system and the controls are tight mostly( althrough they are simifyed for consles) so one button does 3 different things basicly..This can cause issues but I get that.As for its gun play it is very tight, and when one knows how the game works and how to move and get the cover system to work with you, than you are in for a great time. I almost forgot to mention about the basic squad commands, but your AI ( and the enamy ai) is pretty good they can take care of themselves and take down thier foes.Now as I mentioned this game takes a turn, and turns very dark..What I mean is this you get some very odd choices, even through the gameplay is liner its not do this this this..It lets you chose. But in general the devs want you to see the choas and the darkness here, and its that which gives this game a personalilty.ConclustionSpec Ops the line is a great 3 rd person, and it has a great story to back it up, and the way it delivers that story, with great voice acting..Its a great expierance and a joy to see it.This 3rd person is going to be very hard to beat and has alot going for it I feel.8 out of 10			"

												There is so much to say about this game, but I'll make it simple.This is one of the most though-provoking modern military shooter in quite awhile. It may seem (and it is presented) like a run of the mill generic shooter, but you will quickly be surprised by the depth in the plot. At some point, it left me with shivers, and made me question my actions. This is a rare thing that you can find in games and this is a proof that gaming is a culture.All in all, this game is a must play.			"

												First of all, let me say that I would love to give spoilers during this review but I will not, I will leave a clean version and then black out the spoiled version (which will basically contain the whole story line)CLEAN VERSION: This game, fights like Gears of War if you've ever played that game, graphics, sounds, everything is a solid and I did not see any bugs during my play through. The storyline is what makes this game a true and EXCELLENT game despite its flawed and boring combat system, the story will keep you on your edge for about a good 3-6 hours, constantly while playing you keep delving yourself into the story until you know you have to beat this game; this game has a lot of twists in it that it will have you leaning to your monitor and when you finally see the end of the game you will gasp with awe and be in shock (which I rarely get shocked or am in awe as I am a very mellow person)SPOILED VERSION: You, Adams and Lugo are all 3 Delta Operatives that are sent into Dubai to find Komrad (a general) and over time you realize Dubai is a utter♥♥♥♥♥♥storm, you try to find everything out and keep pushing you and your men forward. You accidentally kill civilians with a mortar, but you keep going on and at the end of the game, you realize everything you did, all your actions to ""help"" the people of Dubai, you realize your guy that you're playing as is MENTALLY ILL which is a SICK TWIST but a great twist and you realize as your guy starts to flash back everything that he talked to corpses, made up scenarios as his troops stood by questioning him but followed his orders.You would buy this game for the story rather than the gameplay. Simply amazing.			"

												Short, but satisfying game. Even after 4 years, the graphics look nice and the engine works well (no bugs encountered). What made me love this game is the soundtrack, playstyle (getting headshots 24/7), and the story, although the last one is a love-hate relationship, as it shows the somewhat real army life - gorey and brutal, rather than running around killing people (though you have that too, from time to time). Also, the cinematics are pretty amazing, especially towards the end of the game - destroying buildings whilst flying a helicopter - what more could you want? You're allowed to make multiple choices throughout the game, which affect your sanity. The only drawbacks for me are the 30 fps/720p cutscenes, and the length of the game (6 to 12 hours), but that can be justified by the quality of the game, and the multiple choice scenarios. Overall, it's a great and original TPS, definitely deserving more recognition. If you haven't played it, make sure you get it on a sale, it can go for dirt cheap, and it's definitely worth playing.

												Certainly the best modern military shooter I have ever played ! Fluid gameplay, tactical and makes you stop and think for the best way to engage your problems or your enemies, instead of just running around and shooting, squad based strategy so you don't have to worry about godlike npc's who never die because you fail your mission if your squad breaks and the storyline makes the game a whole lot to play for. Makes you think why do wars exist, who kills and who gets blamed, what war does to a mind of a soldier who faces death everyday and lives to tell the story, what are the costs of following your orders and how far can you go to achieve your goal, or a madman's goal, how insane can you become and what's real and what's your imagination, how far can you go and who can you protect. Spec ops: The line, title says it all, sometimes there is a line that must be crossed for the greater good, question is, is it really the greater good? Or is it just a vision of a madman?			"

												I just finished Spec Ops: The Line and I felt compelled to write a review.  I thought it was a descent shooter.  It was challenging  with an engaging environment.  It is set in a ravaged Dubai and you can see the opulence it once held combined with the savagery of the sand desert.   A good verity of weapons.  An interesting story if yet sometimes hard to follow.  There is nothing new here that you will not find in other games but it is all done well.  The graphics are descent.  The challenge is adjustable.  There is a coop mode and a multiplayer, but you better bring a friend because these areas are lacking in participants.  Overall a good game.  I give it 8 out of 10.			"

												Mature single player game with fantastic smooth graphics and unique shooter gameplay. We need more shooters like this and less of the same old formula other companies are churning out. For a shooter with a story, albeit a dark one, look no further than Spec Ops:The Line.Update: Still agree with my above comments, after these past 4 years.			"

												PROS:- The Story... While I didn't get that wave of ""le feels"" the simplistic reviews professed, this game was definitely heavy and deep. The story is brilliantly crafted and the characters are well voice-acted, ultimately resulting in a plot that does not make you question so much ""morality"" as some players have said, but breaking the fourth wall and questioning the validity of ""choice"", particularly in games.- Excellent shooting, guns feel weighty and effective. Ammo reserves are small forcing you to be tactically prudent and careful. - Graphics are artistically beautiful. On the technical side, they are aging a bit, but I got my 60 FPS.- Levels, albeit very linear, are designed very well. Absolutely beautiful with some destructable objects, some of which can be used to harm foes.CONS:- Arrays of unfriendly and abysmal checkpoints. This game was made in 2012 and there are still checkpoints before cutscenes and scripted events, making you sit through them until the ""skip"" option pops up about ten seconds later.- Multiplayer is a throwaway. This didn't bother me, but it might some. The devs did not intend on implementing multiplayer until the publisher forced them to, so don't let it rub off on your overall opinion.- Don't like turret sections? Too bad! About a dozen of these son'-guns in this game. - Some story elements seem shoe-horned, such as the unavoidable war crimes you commit perhaps intended to make the player feel remorseful.- Squad commanding is a rather two-dimensional feature. You didn't miss out on a lot, but it would have been nice to see something with a little more Republic Commando/Rainbow Six-esque depth.- Probably the biggest complaint of all is that this was obviously a console port. The mouse smoothing and acceleration can only be disabled by decrypting the .ini. Some buttons are annoyingly bound to a myriad of actions. Sprinting, taking cover, and reviving your buddies is all bound to the same button and you can't change that, trying to perform one action and performing another has gotten me killed dozens of times. OVERALL:Had it not been for the story, it's just another modern military FPS with all the guns you recognize in a pretty environment. With the story, it's fairly impactful, sort of a reflection on games in general. The six hours it took me to complete justifies the $6 it was purchased at, but definitely not the normal $30.			"

												]You are here, because you want to feel something, you are not... A hero!Can a game put a blame on player for his actions? Can it mock the whole industry of so called ""Military Realistic Shooters""? Can a game present main protagonist as not a player but his\her personality and deconstruct everything we knew about shooters so far?Spec Ops: The Line proves that it can be done! First of all, if you looking for fun in this game -- FORGET IT! There is no fun, this game has zero fun, and it feels right. that how this game should be; with both main hero and player, game gives both cognitive dissonanse and WTF feeling... Game puts blame on player, but also educates him. It hard to talk about this game without spilers, and I do not wish to spoil this expiriense for you.Know this, game communicates with player. And main hero represent not what you would expect. It build to deconstruct genre and gamers belives. Or maybe just the other way around, in embrasses player and his\her principles and gives a tool to stand a ground supporting second personality?Let's just say, that imagine if you would go into a strip club or bar, expecting to have fun! But the moment you enter, something starts to feel wrong, but at the saame time right -- like this is how it is supposed to be. You sit throug routine, when suddenly before closing, something rewealing strikes. And afterwards you expereinsing something that you never experienced before, of rarely. And you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥ you want to kill yourself... For what? For doing everything without mistakes. You made zero mistakes, and you was wrong! But was you? Maybe you just missed your actual goal, and acidently droped into a club\bar, ye never meant to be? How to interpretate this experience you got? The only way is to come back and do this again. But it is hard... And not really that rewarding for the second time. And you can't just explain this feeling, you can only interpritate it with your own belives. And game gives you tools to do so! Think about it, like you want, choose the fate of main protaganist and yourself.But at the end, playing Spec Ops: The Line is like diving into a void, that sucks all good, leaving only darkness, pain and misery.

												ONLY SINGLEPLAYER REVIEW:I just finished the singleplayer. I already knew the story, the plot. But even with that knowledge, i wasn't prepared for this. This is masterpiece. The game market is flooded with modern military shooters, there are casuals like CoD, and Battlefield, or mechanicaly realistic like ARMA. But this. This shows what real war is. What PTSD feels like. The game is a third person cover based shooter, with all the right elements. there are around 10 weapons, some might say it's too few, but they are perfectly enough, since all of them feels differently and each has different firing mode. Using the covers feels smooth and natural. Shooting aswell. When you kill with a headshot, or get a multikill the game slows down a bit, you didn't just killed. You killed with brutality. Only thing i didn't like is the cluncy controls. Feels like i'm playing with controller settings on a keyboard. For example: Space - Use cover/Sprint/Drop down (from ledges).  R - Reload/Pick up weapon. This is PC. We have enough buttons, on our keyboards to use. It is annoying, that i want to run along a wall, and my character uses it as cover, or i want to pick up a gun, but i reload instead. Some positivity in the end: You have choices at certain points of the story, and i love that it wasn't: PRESS X TO DO THIS, PRESS Y TO DO THAT. The game not always tells you that you have a choice. But deep inside you know.			"

The graphics on the game are nice and in my opinion fit the game well, there is times where you can see the odd things bugging out or not loading properly but that does happen in games so that doesn't really bother me. The story telling is amazing and multiple times I've found myself shouting holy♥♥♥♥♥♥or what the ♥♥♥♥ in to the events that just happened, There are points where you feel like you have no choice but to make a specific decision, then you realise it may not have been right, it opens a side to shooters where it isn't just oh you're doing whats right yay guns guns guns pew pew america, Honestly this game is worth the price if you can pick it up for not too much, I would heavily reccomend this game and advise playing it if you would like a different perspective to a shooter rather than you're doing what's forced on you while you slaughter A.I			"

												First thing I want to say before writing this review is that if you dislike strong political statements or anything that breaks the 4th wall you should not play this game. Spec Ops: The Line is set in Dubai after the Country was destroyed by sandstorms. You are a 3 man Delta force unit sent in to find out what happened to a US army 33rd Battalion. Sooner rather than later you find dead American soldiers scattered around and are attacked by an unknown enemy foce that will be revealed later into the game. After the first encounter with the enemy insurgents you are met with a radio broadcast that signals you to US soldiers who have been captured by the enemy. You don't get there in time however and two of the soldiers are executed. One soldier remains who is slowly bleeding out and tells you about the 33rd battalion. Your unit moves into the city and it's all gone to hell.The story of this game is absolutely magnificent and the way that the developers played it out made it even better. The length of the story was perfect and if they played it out anymore than they did it probably would have been boring and would have seemed to be dragged out. It's short, with about 6 hours play time but it has some replayability with the achievements and the unlockable difficulty.There are multiple things to destroy in this game that makes sand smash everything which can be quite hilarious. There are also choices that the player needs to make which can effect what happens with the story and the direction the game is going in. There are also multiple endings which I will leave you to find out. When facing these decisions the player will go through and question themselves when choosing which one to do. There are also a lot of dead bodies in this game, a lot. There are also a lot of burning bodies and burned bodies.Graphics on this game are great, the scenery is very nice and even though most of it is sand and destroyed buildings it still looks great. Even though I played on medium settings it still looked good so if you have it on High with AA turned to the highest it would look amazing.Overall this game is a 9/10 and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes third person shooters which are different and want a bit of variety.

After the first encounter with the enemy insurgents you are met with a radio broadcast that signals you to US soldiers who have been captured by the enemy. You don't get there in time however and two of the soldiers are executed. One soldier remains who is slowly bleeding out and tells you about the 33rd battalion. Your unit moves into the city and it's all gone to hell.The story of this game is absolutely magnificent and the way that the developers played it out made it even better. The length of the story was perfect and if they played it out anymore than they did it probably would have been boring and would have seemed to be dragged out. It's short, with about 6 hours play time but it has some replayability with the achievements and the unlockable difficulty.There are multiple things to destroy in this game that makes sand smash everything which can be quite hilarious. There are also choices that the player needs to make which can effect what happens with the story and the direction the game is going in. There are also multiple endings which I will leave you to find out. When facing these decisions the player will go through and question themselves when choosing which one to do. There are also a lot of dead bodies in this game, a lot. There are also a lot of burning bodies and burned bodies.Graphics on this game are great, the scenery is very nice and even though most of it is sand and destroyed buildings it still looks great. Even though I played on medium settings it still looked good so if you have it on High with AA turned to the highest it would look amazing.Overall this game is a 9/10 and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes third person shooters which are different and want a bit of variety.

												A nearly flawless third person shooter.Let's get the story out of the way. You play as Captain Walker who, along with the other two guys, is sent to the destroyed city of Dubai in order to investigate a distress signal by the missing Colonel Konrad. Pretty soon you discover that the city is not empty and is filled with some civilians as well as the AWOL U.S. 33rd Army battalion which was supposed to evacuate the city after being deployed in Kabul. You then quickly proceed to battling and killing your country-men. Neat. I'm surprised this German developer didn't get any heat from critics yet for giving you the ability to kill U.S. army men. Along the way, you unravel the mystery as to what exactly is happening.The scenery is quite breathtaking. The Unreal 3.0 engine makes character models and distant vistas look crisp. The desert is so well made that it reminded me of the Uncharted 3 desert. You also get to leave foot prints in the sand. There are no texture pop ins and every texture is pre-rendered. However, the amount of video options is limited. The engine provides no DX10,11 or anti-aliasing for that matter.The game itself plays like a solid A/B action flick. There are some grand action set pieces, there is plenty of dialogue, there are opportunities to sneak up on enemy and there are some grave choices to be made and alter game in the process.One of the most essential components of the game is the A.I. and boy is it good, both friendly and A.I. The enemy soldiers will communicate with each other, they will give out orders, they will attempt to flank you and sometimes attack you from both sides at the same time, they WILL run away and jump away from your grenades, they will retreat, raise alarms, call for back ups, they will also throw grenades pretty accurately and they will do suppressing fire as well. However, some handpicked A.I. will just stand there without taking cover, just waiting to be shot. The reason is that if they are standing on the glass or next to a mountain of sand behind glass, they can be killed with the force of the surrounding environment.This game forces you to think when dealing with the enemy. They aren't supermen and they aren't pushovers either.As for the friendly A.I., well just about the only way that you can order your teammates around is by telling them to attack this guy or that guy or flash bang them. However, once you do give the order, your team mates will do their best to take out the indicated guy either with regular rifles, sniper fire or grenades. At times, I saw my team mates stand their own ground pretty effectively. This feature is unparalleled with many shooters, wherein even IF you are a part of the team, you are the one getting shot at most and you are the one having to kill every foe. (COD ahem)You also get to collect intel and figure out what happened to the populace and Dubai in general after the biggest sand storms decimated the city.Something about the gameplay feels right, I can't quite put my finger on it. You can only carry two weapons and a handful of grenades. The ammo is always scarce so the game forces you to not waste ammo. I also like how any assault rifle magazine will be out of ammo after just a few bursts - it's all pretty realistic. There is no evasion button and there is no prone button. The constant sand storm atmosphere creates a hostile and extreme environment and the sound of sand storms is quite deafening. Also, what's awesome is that once your frag grenade explodes, it also creates a collateral sand fog which stuns the surviving enemies which can be plucked one by one.As far as the weapons are concerned, well, every other weapon has a secondary feature. The M-16 or whatever has a silencer, so does the pistol, the AK-47 has a three bullet burst feature, the sniper rifle has a 8x, 16x zoom feature, etc.The thing that quite often DOES mess up the gameplay is the sprinting, that's right. When you go forward press ""space"" for sprinting (default) and then let go of ""space"", Walker will just keep sprinting for an indefinite amount of time. And if you want to stop immediately, you have to press ""S"", to back up. So I decided to switch to the good old ""shift"" for sprinting instead. It sorta helped but the running still feels consolish, especially when you try to make sharp turns and attempt to take cover while being shot at. What sucks again though is that the crappy consolized controls made ""shift"" stand for both sprinting AND melee. It's like, seriously devs? You could not allocate a separate action key for melee for us, PC gamers? we do have a keyboard, you know.Oh about that, when you are running toward cover and getting shot at, your character will automatically slide towards cover for about 2-3 meters, which is pretty neat because the game does not force you to press the cover button again. That's what they should have done in Operation Raccoon City instead of just adding automatic cover that doesn't work half the time.I've also noticed that the devs put a lot of effort into level design which look as if they were taken from real locations. The flamboyant hotel rooms, the flashy lobbies, the elegant living quarters, the vanity statutes, the artifacts displaying wealth of the city now gone - all bring an engaging dystopian feeling. At times, there are also numerous ways of advancing and flanking your enemies.The wobbly cross-hair is quite neat. The only time your aim is remotely steady is when you come out of cover, however if you sprint and then attempt to shoot, your aim will be all over the place. Thus, every other kill feels like a small accomplishment. If there only was no regenerative health. The good thing is that your team mates cannot revive you when you get shot up. However, you can pick them up and they can pick each other up.I should also add that voice acting in the game is quite exceptional.As for the multiplayer, well, it delivers on many levels. The crappy sprinting is still there, so it's best to not run at all. You get to customize your character as you progress. You get to choose 15 perks as you progress. These range between being invisible on the minimap while sprinting, increasing your protection against explosives, reducing the cross-hair wobble, increasing your weapon damage, increasing your mini-map (radar) range, etc. As for the weapons, there are 5 SMGs, 9 Assault rifles, 4 shotguns, 4 sniper rifles, 6 handguns, 2 machine guns and RPG. The levels are pretty balanced too. Some levels feature active destruction and temporary sand storms that reduce your speed, visibility and accuracy. Sometimes these storms cause collapse of nearby structures so you better stay clear.However, if you are playing a 30 minute match and then all of a sudden ""lose connection to server"" all your progress is going to reset. Now this sucks big time because after playing for some time, I ""lost connection to server"" and reverted back to level 1. Now this is a certainly good feature to discourage rage quitters and quitters in generals but it sucks big time when you lose your experience points and perks.All in all, this is a pretty solid M-rated (there is torture, mutilated bodes, up-close violence and executions) third person shooter with some new gameplay elements and addictive multiplayer that will keep your interested. Here are the minuses:1. Limited video options.2. No Co-Op campaign. (This could have easily been a 2-3 player co-op game).3. Medium-length campaign. 15 medium-length chapters.4. The pistol cross-hair sucks. And you can't turn it off.5. No way to turn off indicators when in cover. (Indicators that tell you if you can swap cover; it's cluttering the screen)6. Crappy consolish sprinting.7. Limited destruction.8. Bad grenade explosion animation.9. Having to press ""space"" for springing, taking cover and reviving team mates.			"

												A great experience in gameplay of the beaten up and auto-repeated genre of the third person shooter. I found some moments that were not so unique, but overall 2K and all those involved did a great job in bringing an original approach -- unlike so many other developer's. 3.8 out of 5 stars and given the deals you can find on this title that's just over a year old is a big plus in the bang for your buck category. I'd quickly recommend this game to any friend questining whether it was worth it or not. Happy hunting!Oh, and although Steam may not recognize any time spent playing this game. I have spent time playing, Spec Ops: The Line, for many hours through gamefly digital before they ""moved"" many of their titles to Steam.			"

												Spec Ops : The Line is TPS set in the ruins of Dubai. It attempts to bring a fresh blood to the TPS games using the sand theme and with choices that reflect the harsh reality of war. Pros-Graphics and optimization -Good scenery and atmosphere-Interesting story-Voice acting-It has some replay value to it-ChoicesCons-Biggest problem for me was the gameplay. Controls get in your way a lot of times and aiming feels weird for some reason.-AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥. For both sides that is. -Some parts of story are really cliche. Well, it's a war TPS so this shouldn't be news for you. -At times I felt like the game tried reaaaally hard to make me feel like a terrible person.Finally, this is a solid overall shooter but don't expect anything perfect, it has it's flaws. If you like TPS games you should give it a shot as it offers some quality time with it's story.74/100			"

												Finally I get to play this controversial game (because I want to read the book ""killing is harmless"" solely written on this game).It is a short game, I finished it (at least the majority of the narrative) in 5 hours. But the gameplay, to be honest, is mediocre if not horrible. Plus Multiplayer is dead. Graphics, let's say, mediocre again because it is really not impressive. The whole weight of the game goes to the narrative. It is really a anti-FPS shooter game. I even doubt if they actually made the other aspects of the game deliberately awful so as the player can focus on the ""shock"" of the narrative. Thus it is most fun to play this game with the expectation that this is just another shooter like GoW etc. The choices (and how impotent they are) the player are asked to make reminded me of Mass Effect series particularly 3 and its ending. The psychological manipulation and guilt-driven portrayal of war all aims at making the player uncomfortable (possibly contemplating). The hero is the villain. It is not the usual ""there is no clear cut between hero and villain"" rehtorics, but the entire dichotomy is destroyed. There is no justice in a war and it does not matter which side you choose. When the soldier is bodily on the battlefield, the gore and brutality does permanent damage to him. It affects the protagonist to its core while the he strives to maintain his legitimacy through construction of himself as the hero regardless of what he had done to many lives. Now I am going to read that whole book, if I ever got the time.			"

												This could be just another war shooter, among so many others, but don't be fooled by its look. While in other war franchises where you take place as a cold-blooded soldier, used to face death in all its ways, this game makes you actually feel what is like to be fighting a war, not only physically, but also mentally.The main character, as the game progresses, becomes more and more injured, and his mind, at a moment, starts to twist and be filled with guilt, which causes him to have hallucinations that will affect the behavior of you and your team, from professional soldiers, to out-of-control psychotics, thus affecting gameplay.As of the mechanics, it follows the classic formula for third person shooters: precision aiming, cover system, etc. Being squad based, it gives lots of emphasis on colaboration within your team, and to survive you must work together with your  teammates. Ammo is very scarce, as you are often required to scavenge weapons from fallen enemies. Enemies comes in varied forms, from light soldiers to heavy-armored juggernauts.With a good plot, and a good concept for a war game, give it a try, as you won't find such a realistic approach in another game.It's worth every penny.

												One of those rare third person shooter game with great visuals, great narration, great voice actors and incredibly well written story.Spec Ops The Line never attempts to be great at gameplay. In fact, it tries to be as simple, as streamlined and straightforward as possible. What you need aside of shooting enemies (well , this is third person shooter game after all), is to make a good cover of yourself using environment as a shield. The game literally forces you to hide all the time, and only come out to make a progress. When in battle, AIs force you to hide like 95% of the time and they do a great job at it. There's no upgrades, skill trees, side quests, open world or anything your regular gamers want from today's games. Learning curve is minimal at worst, at best it is no curve at all.This simplicity, however, what makes the game good. It really fits with the game's linearity and storyline that challenges your moral/ethic code.You control Walker, one protagonist, and go on a simple rescue and evacuate mission. During the process, there's many background stories that develop into more complicated moral-driven situations. Throughout the game, I was forced to make some decisions I would not have made in real life - where I have the options, where I have the luxury to do many things I want.. during peace. In a war, all is different. The atmosphere made in game is just perfect depicting that condition - you feel yourself in Walker's shoes - see and think in his perspective. Very rarely does a game try to do that.That said, the game also has stunning visuals where I have no complaints at all. You see a detailed landscape of post-apocalyptic Dubai, along with the occasional sandstorms. Graphic optimization is also great, I've got no problem running this maxed on my laptop rig that's mediocre at best. Audio wise, it's more than enough to accompany the visuals. When fighting, it feels realistic. The sound of guns, explosions, environment sounds are well made make you feel the tense and heat of the battle. Furthermore, with decent voice actors, it makes game's narration just perfect - each characters' dialogues are performed with heart.Game's pretty short, 7 hours should net you almost everything. Nevertheless, as a whole, Spec Ops The Line is a great experience that all gamers should feel themselves. A game that starts great with great end.			"

												They say ""The scenario is innovating, intense"", ""You will approach war psychologic choice""Well by some part, ok. But, it's a mirage.The game still a corridor TPS over scripted with boring cinématic every 5minutes. Oh and the scenario still sucking, not because is original, no, just because you didn't have real choice.spoiler : You don't want to mortar this area full of people who're looking civilian : YOU CAN'T ! You have to make this mistake like you have to - Follow the CIA agent directive- Mount on this truck full of water, etc...- make this F%^*$ing escape in Helicopter with this useless scroll shooting./spoilerBUT BUT BUT, in fact all those problems aren't annoying in regard of the Best feature in the world : The incredible ergonomy of command !!!I never play a game with a stupidous, frustrating, boring gameplay as this one... (or maybe Alan Wake).It's a t.o.t.a.l crap. With one botton you have 2 or 3 différent action possible depending of the context (THANKS PADDLE CONTROLS !!! \O/ YEAH ! Go F§*£+ yourself !!!).Result : you run when you want to cover, you cover when you want to run or depending IF the map grant you the autorisation.... You shoot over cover like the cover want not as you decide (Upper, corner, etc...)When you have a sensibiliy for the gatling gun on the ground (helicopter), Be sure the sensibility would totally change when you start flying (x3 more heavier).... When you want to quit a cover, you have to... well it depends... sometimes by going back, sometimes by aiming and obviously, when you quit your cover, you avatar stand up... in the middle of lign of fire... not crouching... with the most static stanse you ever see....It's just Incrediblely Slang and i'm sure THAT's the only war demancia you will really approach in this game.Save your money, save your mind.

												Spec Ops: The LineBought game because of positive reviews on Steam. Was not impressed, and I am a military buff for games and documentaries and thought provoking material. Truly am surprised how so many people are 'mind blown' by the storyline that does not give you any power to truly choose. Most likely people who've thought little of war and its horrors, and the philosophy of human nature, might find this 'mind blowing.'Short review first. Scroll down for random rants.Story: Concept was somewhat daring, dark and unique. More importantly, a topic not explored which is why I give it a lot respect for. But ultimately the medium used brings it down, as well as poor pacing of monumental decisions that are made in the game as well as the execution of the story as a whole. Tip: There's a reason this game was not very popular.Gameplay: Good assortment of weapons. Cover system was sometimes clunky. Basic aim for the head gameplay. Enemies types were literally a handful. Boring and reptitive overall.Graphics/Enviornment: Some of the cutscenes were downright terrible looking for some strange reason. Some cutscenes looked good. The textures were bland as expected of a B-Budget game.Verdict: Ultimately, the game did provoke thoughts of actions and consequences. But the game itself did not do the story justice. And the story felt very unreal because of it. The pacing of the story and its content was slow, and slammed all the end. The end was decent. But all throughout the game they make it seem like 'you had a choice' but I really did not feel like I did. The repetitveness made me just want to finish it. Overall I was disappointed after reading the reviews, and if I had another chance I would skip this game. I only paid 5 bucks, but also had to invest 6 hours that did not have a worthwhile end at all.Random Rants: A strange game.Tries to portray a morally wrought story. That is supposed to evoke realism and grey warfare.The moral choice outcomes were somewhat thought provoking thankfully since thats what all the other reviews on here praised and reccomended the game. Though on one big choice you did not know the outcome after you had done it, so it was not really 'fair.' You thought you had picked something, but a different outcome than anticipated came out. Which is good and bad since it makes things not linear, but also means your decision was based on bad information. So I did question what choices would I take had I been a delta operator in this strange unrealistc storyline.Some of the Bad Rants:Then it puts you in an unrealistc settings(the sky scrapers are all abnormally huge and the city is half buried in sand. The local populace is apparently huge in numbers, all males, and armed to the teeth out of nowhere.) unrealistc combat (takes 3-5 body bullets to kill, or 2 bullets to the head) and apparently the main characters have indestructible bodies. (Sliding down sky scrapers, smashing their spines on rocks and metal beams, mid flight catching themselves with bungee cords, walking away without a scratch,  ziplining from sky scrapers.) Makes you feel like youre watching a hollywood action movie. Not a video game trying to evoke the horrors of war and the reality of war.Some of the Good Rants:The dialogue between characters after making moral decisions was realistic and thought provoking.Without spoilers, the enemies you fight leave a bitter taste in your mouth as you find out who they are. Not used to something like that in US games.The combat feels fluid and clunky at the same time. The slo mo effects when getting headshots feel nice. You spend most time just headshotting everyone.The US would never sent 3 delta operators to 'rescue' a battalion. They dont operate in 3 man units. Second they never had radio contact with base. Which would never happen.			"

												Spec Ops the line is a cover based third person shooter about a group of soldiers that are sent to rescue someone in the decaying ruins of Dubai, a city drowning in Sand. But much like the sand destroys the city, the mission itself slowly decays into madness as your character and his two subordinates try to do what's right. Character progression is well done as the unit slowly comes to face the horror of their own actions.The game itself is quite nice, the environments are exactly how I would imagine a weathered down Dubai to look like and the game gives you plenty of quiet moments ot appreciate your surroundings. Gunfights feel a lot more realistic too: Cover is your best friend and fights are won through tactical thinking. Enemies will try to pin you as their partners move around the flank.Only downside is that the checkpoints are kind of far in between which gets really noticeable on Suicidal Difficulty. Overall a solid gameplay experience with more depth than any of the recent AAA shooters could hope to display.			"

												Wearing the trappings of a modern military shooter, a genre that has become the industry's main enemy of creativity and thoughtful exploration of important thoughts on the hero fantasy and graphic violence, Spec Ops: The Line works its deep cover with such intensity and unflinching honesty that it demands the attention of any gamer who takes games as an art form seriously. I almost passed this one by due to its superficial premise and appearance, but I am very glad I did not.Following in the footsteps and perfecting the ugly tenor of games like Kane & Lynch and Far Cry 2, this brutal exploration of PTSD, gaming's indulgence in violence, and the cost of war pulls no punches in challenging the player to confront what--if any--redemptive or meaningful value there is in parading through a foreign landscape as a hero of war. Forced to make ugly decisions that will demand you square with the game on an emotional level and shouted down for every mistake you will inevitably make, this is the slap in the face an industry drenched in blood and rewarded violence needs. Marking a new era in mature gaming, Spec Ops: The Line is a challenge to us to return from our thoughtless murder and enter into a new era of self-aware, meaningful interactive experiences.			"

												I recomend this game to everyone I can in meat space, it's an amazing work that I simply cannot play. All evidence points to it being a masterpeice hidden in the grunge of a bog standard third person shooter. I put it down, my ending came early, I just couldn't do it, between gragled moans of pain and soldiers bleeding out on the ground, the game waiting for you to put them out of their misery, I couldn't provide. Just writing about it makes my skin crawl. All in all 9/10, would squirm again in a different game, not this one though, nope.			"

												One of the best games I ever played. Not very outstanding gameplay but still much fun at high difficulty. The Story is mind-melting and goes under your skin, [spoileri]though there should have been more diversity about your choices and how they really matter. Even though I understand  the devs message behind making them having often the same outcome.[/spoileri] Overall a splendid gem in story-telling. Its sad that YAEGER wont do games like that anymore, since it was at first a commercial failure, which in my opinion was not the game's fault but 2k games greed (hence the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer that wasnt even meant to be implemented in the game), and a bad marketing strategy. It would have been more popular if they wouldnt have it agressively marketed a an obvious anti war shooter, but just made it a little more subtle. "

												I hated this game and at the same time I loved it. It forced me into making cruel choices which I did not want to make. It shows that war is awful and has horrible consequences. This game took me on an oddesey that was damned from the start and the deterioration of the mind of a leader in hell. If you are a good person and want to portait that in the video games you play? That is not going to happen here, no matter how hard you try. Yes, the mechanics can be buggy and annoying but that wasn't the point of the game. The point of the game was the story and the Apocalyspe Now mood it has. And the story shined well enough for me to ignore the mechanics. The graphics were very good and I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you are squeamish you shouldn't play this game. Not because of gore but because of a specific ♥♥♥♥ed up event.Pick this game up.10/10			"

												Don't let the cover art fool you this game is not trying to be Call of Duty. Spec Ops has an engaging story that is well paced and leaves you thinking long after you finish the game. Spec Ops covers a lot of themes that a lot of other games wouldn’t dare cover such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Spec ops provides interesting commentary on the genre of the first person shooter as well as the player.---

												The good/OK -rate game that has potential but can't use all of it. The idea in story is good, there are included some good points/things while trying to make some difference to all of kind generic fps-shooters, but some sections was weird and bothered the storyline. The biggest problem was the gameplay. You just repeat same thing over and over (run for cover, shoot ten thousand enemies, do that again...), many sections was annoyingly scripted, invisible fences limits your latitude quite a little making game more rail shooter. Still not a worse game, and i would recommend to try it at least... "

												When I picked up this game, I thought I was buying another faceless brown-and-bloom military shooter on the cheap... you know, Call of Duty/Modern Warfare knock-off with a ruined Dubai gimmick.What I got was so much more. I wish I had purchased it at full price, because the developers deserve much more money than I gave them. This game was fantastic for the story alone. I can't give more detail without spoiling it, but with only a few games have I ever felt this affected or deeply moved by the gameplay. There's a lot of shooting and some of it is repetitive, but it's vastly over-shadowed by the narrative and it's damned beautiful the whole way through. If you haven't played it, I really recommend picking this game up immediately... it's SO much better than it lets on and one of the only games I've ever played that manages to prove its point through every facet of the gameplay.In fact, one of my favorite moments I've ever had in a game happened during one of The Line's loading screens... that's a tall feat, considering. It's that good.			"

												I haven't reviewed this game, thats odd. Well,  better late than none at all..A TECHNICAL NOTE:This game was designed for WinXP, and therefore you need to set the combatibility options accordingly. Detailed explanation can be found at PCGamingWiki.com. There is also a bug regarding previously saved games, this causes the game to crash. The fix for this is also found at the wiki.SECONDARY NOTE:Since i'm aching all over, i'm just copying the review i made for this game on Greenman Gaming. (Lazyness FTW)__________________________________________________________________Valtheknight | Feb. 6, 2014 | Review of Spec Ops: The LineOh dear... Well i can for starters say that i'm at an disadvantage since i last played the game through about a year ago and i completely forgot that i bought it from Greenman. Also since there is a ""credit""-gain from review so.. Might as well.Before i start, i really should mention that i really cant remember everything about this game. Because of the one year gap. So most of the stuff i say will be mostly about my personal experiences and should be taken with 'nth amount of salt. (Since i'm a little bit biased..)Well the first thing that needed to be done with the game, was to actually get it to run. Since it had some startup-problems with it, this caused some grey hairs at first, but a quick venture into the promised land of PC-GAMING WIKI. Helped to resolve that problem quickly. Unfortunately, since the game uses encrypted options files. Tweaking other aspects of it will prove difficult, if you wish to, for example, change the FOV.(I don't remember if the game was updated to include an FOV slider later on.. Again i last played it at the start of 2013.)Well i think that's the mandatory technical jabber out of the way, onto the game itself.The story is in itself deceptively straight-forward, it starts of with a group of soldiers, (Delta-Force if memory serves correctly.) On a mission to investigate what happened in Dubai after it was supposed to have been evacuated, before some heavy-duty sandstorms started wrecking up the place.And that is pretty much the easiest explanation of how the story starts, i really can't write about it that much since i feel i would be doing it no favors. Instead, i will only say that the story only gets more darker and stranger the further it goes. With some actual character-development and i don't mean the ""put-points-to-sht-to get-the-biggest-deathcck"" -way, but in the storytelling sense. Some of the stuff you see and hear the team say and do really start to show later down the line.That's enough spoilers for the story part, next!The gameplay is pretty standart 3rd-person cover-based shooting and that is pretty much the thing that kind of kills the novelty-value almost instantly, because people will automatically make references to any other Military shooter almost instantly. I on the other hand right now started thinking about the Normandy landing scene on Medal of Honor:Allied Assault, nicked almost to the T from Saving private Ryan... Oops Digressing statement.Later down the line, the game has a turret section, and another, and another yet again.. That kills the feel a bit, since you wonder ""Why did it give me another turret section? Can't i just run around and shoot them in the head instead?"" Actually, at one point you can, but it makes it a bit harder. But don't get me wrong, the helicopter segment at the start of the game (and the redo of it later) was well executed. I cannot really say the same from the rest though.Anyway, the biggest sin, i feel from the game-designs part is the linearity. It shows from the start and it carries through to the end. The strangest thing though... I noticed on my last playthrough that i had missed options in the story. All because the game told me to do this, instead of that and now i need to download it again to see the other parts i missed. Since i feel, ""if i missed that one so obvious, what others i missed ?""CONCLUSION:Even with its story, The Line seems (to untrained eye atleast) a generic 3rd-person shooter. Even the changes the characters go through during the story, kind of brush by with a big red sign over their head saying ""FEEL SH_T"". And some of the stuff does have some shock value, but it loses even that rather quickly. All and all, the story (if flawed, yes flawed. Shoot me if you disagree.) is the only thing that is interesting about this game. Is it enough to carry it? No. Is it enough to make it stand out from the rest? Yes. Is it actually worth playing? Maybe.__________________________________________________________________I gave the game 80/100 on Greenman, and at second thought, it might have been a bit too generous. I should have given it a score middling 60-75, since it had all the classic modern era shooter problems. But as it stands, it is still worth the money.			"

Honestly neither of those are remotely true, and this is coming from a skeptic originally. By far one of the grittiest shooters I've ever played. The name is generic, but that's where it ends. It's an incredible game, a must play imo. 8/10			"

												Spec Ops: The Line does for games what Heart of Darkness did for books and Apocalypse Now did for films. I do not write a lot of reviews, but this one deserves it for being a great game, showing war from a unique view in modern gaming.This is a game that really shines on it's story and narrative. It pulls no punches and unflinchingly shows you every aspect of war that most other games brush over. This game provokes emotional responses that other games try to avoid and involves the player with the decisions faced in conflict situations, and sometimes those choices are not good, or have no good answer at all, but you are still forced to make the hard decision.It starts off drawing you in as another 3rd person cover shooter, but changes as the game progresses so that you are less interested in the action and more interested in the story, which is masterfully done. It reveals just enough as you are going through so when you get to the end, you remember all those hints that were tugging at the corners of your mind, and catch yourself saying, 'I knew it!' On a replay, there are a lot of those subtle hints that you see that you miss on the first play, and it has been very well written that way. (Think Sixth Sense for this). The twist at the end is pretty clever and makes this game stand out from a lot, but it is not completely unexpected.The action set pieces are done well in the desert city environment and this comes into play in the game a lot, though it can feel a little bit forced sometimes. The whole 'My Squad vs the World' gets a bit tiring towards the end, as you take on just about every living person in the city with a gun. As I said above though, the importance of the action at that point should have faded away.Positives:  The narrative is the best in the business.  Involves the player.  The environment is cleverly realised and used in game well.  The achievements are fun to chase down.Negatives:  Short campaign.  Simple control system that is clunky.  Difficulty does not scale up as the game progresses.  Very linear story, given the emphasis on choice.  Pointless Multiplayer aspect.Conclusion:A well crafted and engaging piece of work. Worth the effort you put into it as you walk away from it with more than just the simple amusement. If you want just a piece of gung-ho action, avoid it, but if you want more from games, dont hesitate, buy it, and enjoy.			"

Spec Ops: The LIne is a game dedicated to the players of modern warfare 1st person/3rd person cover action shooter. And after finishing it I was left feeling miserable, weary and sick of myself. Not because of oh-god-I can't-believe-I-wasted-timing playing-this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ But in the same way after you read a depressing novel like say Heart of Darkness.I cannot give any memorable scenes because this is one of those games that can easily spoil if I mentioned them Let's just say that The Line never railroads you into the events. It knows players. Knows us enough that it can hand you the gun and the choice. And believe me you will make the regretful choice. 10/10			"

												Finally, a different take on the military shooter genre. I do not consider it revolutionary or groundbreaking, but it was nice with an actual plotline for a change. I wish it had been perhaps a little bit more gradual because it felt like I was leaning in both directions until the very end when ""truth"" finally struck me. However, this might also be the result of that I was not playing the game from start to finish in one streak, but spread out over a long course of time.In any case, a game worth playing for sure, and hopefully it will leave you with a sense of not accomplishment, but realization, that there are no victors in war. If that was not already abundantly clear ;)			"

												Ignored it upon release as I'd wrongly assumed it was another one-sided AMERRCUHHH, KILL THE TERRORISTS, BE A HERO game (the first 30 or so minutes kind of are, to lull you into a false sense of confidence and righteousness) but it quickly turns out to be anything but - throughout, and increasingly so, you'll be questioning whether you're doing more harm than good, and that's putting it lightly. Surprisingly deep and clever. Several references to Heart Of Darkness which it seems to be based on.Lots can be said about how well it manages it (I ended up writing an essay on the game for uni), but without spoiling anything, you'll feel like a monster by the end. In one small example, there's a part where you're fighting enemies in a shopping mall, with civilians hiding inside. I'd been fighting for roughly 10-15 minutes and hadn't seen a single civilian. An enemy ran down a hallway, and I chased him, ready to shoot back, when a civilian dives out from a gap and ran for cover. Before I had time to think, I shot them, and felt SO bad. It was clear that it was a mistake the game was counting on me to make, and I fell for it.Downsides: criticises military shooty games while being one (whether that works for or against it is up for debate), fairly unimaginative Gears Of War style cover/shooting mechanics.Overall: I really recommend anyone gives it a go, if they're into any shooter games, or are just looking for something different within the genre (hard to find, as anyone'll know). BUY IIIIIIT!(oh, and avoid multiplayer. the devs didn't want it in the game but the publisher got another studio to quickly hash it together, which completely misses/ignores the point of the story.)

												This is basically PTSD: The Game.As a game, it's pretty standard.  You get into cover.  You shoot guys with guns.  Run to the waypoint to continue getting into cover and shooting guys with guns.  It feels fairly clunky to actually get into cover.  I felt like I had to hit the space bar a specific way to actually get into cover.  There are a handful of weapons in different categories like rifles, shotguns, small arms, snipers and heavy weapons.  Everything feels fairly generic with a few exceptions like shooting a part of the environment to dump sand on your foes and that's about it.  You can give orders to your team, but some orders only pop up at specific times and I could never seem to be able to use the attack order.  I was able to beat the campaign on the hardest availible starting difficulty in under 7 hours.  Again, as a game, it's pretty generic.As an experience, it's a completely different beast.  Never in my life have I played a military shooter that was this shocking.  If you thought the nuke scene and ""no russian"" from Call of Duty were hardcore, then you haven't seen anything yet.  It's really something you have to see for yourself and I wouldn't dare spoil it.  If I had to compare the story to anything, it feels a lot like the movie ""Apocalypse Now"" and if you've seen that movie then you should be aware of the levels of shock you are getting into...but even the story here goes above and beyond that.   Again, as an experience, it's quite unique.If you can get it cheap, do not pass it up even if you don't like cover shooters.  This is one game you need to see to the end...			"

												There are few times in your life when you will have the chance to experience something as outstanding as Spec Ops: The Line.The setting is the city of Dubai, a few months after it has been hit by a devastating sandstorm and an evacuation operation has apparently failed. The focus is on three US Army soldiers sent to find out if there are any survivors and getting caught right in the middle of a conflict between the 33rd Infantry Battalion and local CIA operatives. The story shows the atrocities that the protagonists have to commit during their mission and the descent of the main character into madness, as he realizes that there are no redeeming choices in his reality and he can't cope with his own actions. The plot contains parallels from various horrifying situations of real-world war zones, particularly the use of white phosphorus mortar bombs on civilian populations in Iraq and Gaza. At its core, Spec Ops: The Line explores the concepts of PTSD, cognitive dissonance, escapism and the idea that the main character is not the player's avatar but instead, the player is the main character's super-ego.The story is amazing and it is delivered superbly by all aspects of the game. The cutscenes, the direction, the characters' models, the tone and content of the voice acting (not only during scripted sequences, but even in the way the main character addresses his companions during battles), the animations (most notably the executions of dying enemies), the level design and even the loading screen text snippets - everything in the game shifts and transforms in order to serve the story and highlight the increasingly obvious psychosis of the main character, his increasingly violent tendencies, his inescapable and growing guilt, his detachment from sanity (and reality) and his companions' gradual loss of respect, trust and faith in him, as one of the premises of the game is revealed and confirmed (""Ιt takes a strong man to deny what's right in front of him.""). The game embraces literally everything at its disposal and raises every expectation regarding what we should accept as character development from modern works of art.The graphics are decent, including realistic and detailed shaders, rich well-crafted animations, just the right amount of post-processing and destructible environments. It is one of the best uses of the Unreal Engine that I've seen to date. When you are inside the extravagant but deserted buildings of Dubai, the art style is often reminiscent of that of the original BioShock.In the sound department, the game performs excellent - the voice acting is simply outstanding, while the soundtrack consists of a post-rock soundscape that blends perfectly with the environments and the psychological state of the characters, coupled with a plethora of known pieces from various artists, ranging from Deep Purple and Jimi Hendrix to Björk and Giuseppe Verdi.The gameplay is that of a typical third-person cover-based shooter, with the right balance between cool (to keep you interested), surreal (to underline that something isn't quite right) and repetitive (to make you feel even more desensitized before it hits you). The levels often seem open but the level design is actually quite linear. The game's idea of tactics revolves mostly (though not exclusively) around finding a good cover, adapting by changing your position, drawing enemies out of their covers and some micromanaging with weapons, bullets and grenades. At no point do you get to choose where you are going to fight your enemies and stealth tactics, wherever applicable, don't make a lot of difference compared to just charging in. You can, however, drown your enemies using tons of sand that's trapped on glass roofs and other places.Where the gameplay shines is in choices: instead of presenting choices with a bland menu that's disconnected from the rest of the game, Spec Ops: The Line embraces them tightly and features them exclusively as part of the gameplay. In many occasions, the game organically recognizes the intent behind your actions without having previously made the choice (or all of your options) explicit. This not only helps maintain the cinematic feel of the game, but also forces you to ponder your choices as real actions with real consequences (rather than items in a menu) and, most importantly, it makes you question your previous actions and constantly reevaluate situations retrospectively, highlighting another premise of the game, the idea that apparently you had choices all along (""There's always a choice!""), but you kept going (""None of this would've happened if you'd just stopped.""). There are four endings for you to discover and they are all well-made and perfect epilogues to what your actions say about the protagonist (and you) by the end.Some final things:-The campaign is 6-12 hours long depending on your pace, not particularly difficult once you get used to the gameplay.-After you finish the campaign, a variable portion of the game's events are left open to interpretation. Almost all possible interpretations have at least some plot holes or unconvincing details. For me, they are forgivable but your mileage may vary.-There is a multiplayer mode that I simply won't consider in this review, because this game is essentially its campaign mode and the very existence of a multiplayer mode defeats the point that the story is trying to make.-Some people have said that there are bugs (particularly sound-related ones, which can be overcome, as they say), but I can't comment on those because for me it worked flawlessly.And that's it. This is an extraordinary game and every developer should take notes, because Spec Ops: The Line demonstrates what games should aim to be.			"

												SPEC OPS: THE LINE is more or less a critique of the tropes and mechanics that have come to define military third person shooters over the last several years, particularly the narratives those games tend to adopt. It doesn’t do anything incredibly unusual with those tropes, but that’s part of the point.Attempting to adapt Joseph Conrad’s HEART OF DARKNESS, SPEC OPS’s main selling point is its story which succeeds in pointing out how absurd the narratives of many military shooters are. It takes every situation in which the player has been forced to kill massive numbers of people and retells it in the form of a very un-heroic tale. The player follows a trio of Delta Force operators sent to find out what happened in Dubai months after a massive sandstorm isolated the city from the outside world with a platoon of U.S. soldiers and a lot of civilians trapped inside. As they discover a multi-sided conflict, things very quickly spin out of control as the Deltas try to decide who the bad guys are.You ever get the feeling some military shooters have storylines that are just reaching for an excuse for the player to shoot everything they see? You ever realize how rarely some of these games display things that aren’t hostile, and how they use leaps of logic in their storylines to make as many people hostile as possible? That kind of happens in SPEC OPS but with a neat critical twist that manifests more and more as the main characters become increasingly agitated with the situation and their own actions.Most of the time SPEC OPS delivers its themes through cut scenes and in-game dialogue, leaving the interactive aspect of it being a video game to the absurdity of the shooting itself, managing to mess with it in interesting ways as the campaign drags on.As a shooter, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a third person shooter as vanilla as SPEC OPS. It’s almost impressive really. You get behind cover, shoot guys with military guns, order two other guys to concentrate on targets, heal them with morphine shots -- absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. It’s like Yaeger Development was trying to make the most mechanically normal third person shooter ever just to critique the whole genre.This is true even visually. The player character looks as featureless as every other head-shaven military dude in video games and is voiced by Nolan North. Basically the whole game is brown. If you ask me I even think SPEC OPS’s utilization of Unreal Engine 3 plays into the theme. Tech-wise it looks a lot like UE3 games from 2006 or 2007 with relatively basic use of lighting and shadow and little post-processing to speak of.I’m not even sure if Yaeger intended for SPEC OPS to be fun. Later in the game there were definitely moments where I felt uneasy about continuing to play, where in other military shooters I’d just laugh at the absurdity. SPEC OPS drives this feeling in interesting ways. As he becomes increasingly haunted by his actions in the story, the protagonist’s voice clips turn noticeably angrier and darker during normal gameplay, and the mission objectives displayed on-screen slowly become influenced by that rage, driving home the brutality of what the player is really doing.Just like most military shooters these days, SPEC OPS only takes a few hours to complete, but the storyline actually feels worth revisiting and re-examining. It even leaves quite a bit open to player interpretation. It’s certainly deeper and more thoughtful than most action game stories.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line might look like a really uninspired cover shooter: the gameplay is efficient but absolutely classical and there is not a single good surprise to find there. But, thanks to an unusual (in gaming) depiction of war, the game transcends itself to become some kind of anti-war messenger which definitely leaves a mark on the player.			"

The Definitive Military ShooterGem of a game. This is not your day-to-day stereotypic military 3rd Person shooter - the story is the key element of this game. It so brilliantly mixes up with the plot that you can't leave without finishing your first playthrough. The graphics are quite okay for a UE3 engine - the gameplay and the gun mechanics are just superb. MP is dead, sadly. A.I is quite unforgiving even at normal levels, so be sure to stand behind your cover everytime. Just buy this for it's fantastic SP.P.S. This review is coming a lot late from me; i know, but the game deserved another recommendation! "

												Uma das grandes surpresas dos últimos anos, Spec Ops: The Line é um jogo que usa as convenções de jogos de tiro militares em 3ª pessoa para ""enganar"" o jogador, passar por ""genérico"" e de repente, puxar o tapete e pegar o jogador de surpresa com decisões fortes, uma narrativa psicológica e uma crítica direta aos outros jogos de tiro militares modernos. É um jogo *sobre* guerra, não *de guerra*; é o Apocalypse Now dos videogames, e não um filme do Michael Bay como Call of Duty. Já virou um clássico cult, e todo mundo que gosta de games precisa experimentá-lo, mesmo que não goste de jogos de tiro.			"

												I went into this game expecting an entertaining third person cover based shooter. What I received instead was a story centered game focusing on the difficult and ethical dilemmas faced in extreme wartime as well as the effects they have on relationships and one's sanity. The story alone makes the game worth playing but add in the gameplay which is excellently done third person shooter style, the game morphs into a surprising addition to my favorite games. Story: 8/10 - Interesting and surprisingly emotional storyline following three special ops soldiers attempted rescue of hostages in Dubai.Gameplay: 6/10 - The gameplay is excellently done in the way that it is a deeply addictive third person sprint to cover shooter. My one problem is that it does get fairly repetitive and while playing on the more difficult modes does add to the challenge and enjoyability it does not lessen the repetitive feel of the gameplay.

												I highly enjoyed this game. It has the best story I have encountered in its medium and it addresses the player and not just the in game character. It is dark, wastes little time (~6 hours on suicide difficulty), and delivers harsh consequences for choices that the character makes in the story. A large amount of enemies are killed but it is not a bro-tastic shooting game. These characters have hardships which are legitimate instead of being cheesy and tacked on.Its gameplay is standard over-the-shoulder cover-based affair, but I enjoyed the challenging combat (I only have played on the hardest difficulties available and cannot speak for the easier settings). While the ally AI is sluggish and lacks judgement, the enemy AI flanks and suppresses and is effective at sending you to the death screen.This is a painfully obvious console port, though.The controls are not terribly intuitive. Sprinting, melee bashing, diving into cover, and vaulting over cover actions are tied to two different buttons. Sometimes one action is performed when the other was desired due to how they are tied together. It will take time to get used to their cover system, especially on keyboard. It does its job but is a bit clunky.There are limited graphical settings in the menu, most noticably the complete lack of AA. If you want to remove those jaggies, do so through other means. The game otherwise looks pretty good considering that not much graphically seems to have changed from its transition from console to PC. The settings are especially nice to look at.I enjoy this game even while reminds me that I am a virtual murderer. A third runthrough is in my future.  "

												The perfect third-person shooter. Not necessarily for the gameplay or the graphics (although these are very good) but for the flawless story that highlights everything that is wrong with modern military shooters, making you stop and think about all the things you've ever done in computer games in the name of entertainment, then turn inwardly and question whether it was all worth it, and what it has turned you into (yes it's harmless entertainment, but then why does that entertain you hmmm?). Everyone and their dog has positively reviewed this game, and for once it's not overeager praise heaped onto a speeding bandwagon, it's a fantastic peice of storytelling, basically the Citizen Kane of videogames, and genuinely fun shooter, which as you'll find out is a massive ♥♥♥♥ing problem you mass murdering psychopath! In a generation or two, people will look back and ask their parents ""What was it like to live in a time when a self-proclaimed hero-nation's military goose-stepped around the word thinking they were putting wrongs to right, when all they were doing was ignorantly applying violence to an already ♥♥♥♥ed-up situation, which actually needed some clear thinking and civil discourse to address their issues?"" to which you'll reply ""That's a pretty verbose sentence for a 9 year old!"".

It may seem like a ""U.S.A. saves the day yet again!"" kind of game but it's actually not. It's kind of a thought-provoking game instead. The decisions and actions you take will have repercussions on you and your squadmates psychology throughout the game. A lot of ""dem feels"" moments as the story progresses. Visuals are also very nice in this game despite being a 2012 shooter, Dubai looks great despite being not very immaculate due to the sandstorm. The gameplay is fine though, just a third person shooter with very simple mechanics to comprehend.I really recommend this game for its storyline though. It just blew my mind, really. It makes you want to seek for answers and even more answers... What the hell is going on in Dubai? 9/10			"

												""It's about doing what's right.""""We didn't have a choice.""These are two lines of dialogue that will stick with you the entirety of the time you play this game. They stuck around for me, definitely.This game is an irony. Everything pushes it to be that. The Line explores the story of Agent Walker and his squadmates, Adams and Lugo, as they go deep into Dubai under the pretense of reconaissance. Suffice to say, it all devolves and goes downwards from there. Far downwards.I commemerate Yager's courage to create a game like this. The game conveys a message by putting everything right there in front of you. You question it. And it all comes out to a satisfying conclusion and reasoning as to why it's all there. There is no subtlety needed in war, after all, is there?I'll just leave it at that. Come into this game braced for violent, depraved imagery and you will come out with a new mindset on things.As for the shooting itself, it's formulaic and simple. It felt oddly fitting for the game; there's nothing extravagant other than headshots and grenades slowing down the game to accentuate the action.Executions, means of finishing off downed enemies so that they don't get back up, serve an interesting purpose; exhibiting the Agent Walker's newfound animalistic nature. They become increasingly violent as you progress through the game, and in no due time you will find Walker shoving the barrel of a shotgun down the mouths of his opposition and firing.The sound assets are exceptional, notably the background tracks. Only on occassion do rock or vocal tracks accentuate action. Most of the time you'll be fighting in ambience, making a somber mood. The music fits when it needs to.My only complaint with the game is the squadmates; the AI can be a bit wonky and orders fail to go through when they should, and you can only give said orders during certain times. The cover and by extension running system can end up getting you killed, as well.I didn't bother with multiplayer, so this review may be a bit biased, but you'll be looking at this game for the single-player alone, anyways. Give it a go. This game will resonate with you for a long time as it did for me.			"

												Where to start... I guess I could begin by saying wow.  This game was a roller coaster from start to finish to distingush between what is right and wrong is literally impossible as every choice you make influences your squad and your future decisions.  No matter what you do you will feel like a monster even if its the only logical choice.  Now on to the gameplay:  The controls take a bit of getting used to but are fairly smooth there are times where controls get a bit messy especially when you accidentally vault over cover rather than melee an enemy.  These were fairly annoying at times but nowhere near game breaking.  The cover system is fairly well done with smooth transitions in most cases.  Aiming can be a bit difficult but all you need is a gun you are comfortable with and its easy enough to hit targets.  TLDR:  It's worth the the time to play it and will make you question every decison you make.			"

												The demo does not serve this game justice. Once you dive deep into the game's tone and story, you realize how different this really is from your typical 3rd Person Shooter. Few games have made my jaw drop with choices I was forced to make. This game is truly memorable for its way of delivering a unique experience that provides the player with non-stop action and story from start to finish.			"

												Relatively mediocre gameplay mixed with grueling psychological attacks on the player.Spec Ops: The Line is less about the gameplay, and more about the existensial question: Why? More specifically, why does our soldier act the way he does?If you want to good shooter, turn away. If you want to feel like a terrible person, this is the game for you.The campaign is very short, and gunplay very bland, but that's not what you'll be playing this game for, nor will you really care about it. Just play the game, you terrible person.			"

Smart writing saves average shooterSpec Ops: The line is a bit of an odd beast. It starts as a very average 3rd person cover shooter. You get to hear the usual gung-ho callouts, and slaughter the usual terrorists. Then, somewhere an hour in or so, the story starts to pick up speed. And what a story it is. Unlike the vast majority of shooters this isn't a story about heros slaughtering evil goons to save the world. This is a story about actions and their consequences, about atrocities commited in the name of a greater good. This is not a game for 18 year old kids who still think war is a fun adventure. Or maybe it is. Maybe it will make them stop and think for a few moments. Maybe it will make them read heart of darkness.For the adults, if you can look past the average game mecanics, it's well worth playing.			"

												This game has its faults, but I'm glad I stuck with it till the end. Anyway, one of the strongest games I've played this year. I kept hearing it was dark, but it goes way darker than I had prepared for. It disturbed me enough that I've lost some sleep over it the last few nights.The way they handle illusion of choice is pretty interesting. Early on in the game you're given a choice which leads to 2 legitimately different outcomes in gameplay (battle vs. stealth) and how your squad reacts (failing to save civilians vs. failing to save CIA operative). So later in the game when you're under time pressure and forced to make bad choices, you wonder in the back of your head what the other options were (even if there were none).			"

												Right off the bat, I'm gonna say 6/10. This game, while it has an amazing story, was what a cover-based third person shooter was not supposed to be. The story about the three American soldiers sent in to find out what's going on in Dubai was just fantastic, but the gameplay just doesn't do the story justice. If they made a movie about just the story mode of this game, with little to no gameplay involved, it'd be a pretty good movie; probably an 8/10. It's only benefit is that the game is so short, that the story can at least be acknowledged. At less than 5 hours long, the gameplay for the game starts off like any other cover-based shooter, but eventually turns to be ridiculous as even in normal mode, you're spending 3 clips of ammo for a heavy machine gun into the head of an enemy foot-soldier. Why? Because helmets protect them from headshots, and the enemies ALSO know how to use cover. They also use some gimmicks here and there to keep you interested, but it's not enough to get past the horrible gameplay they made. I'm still recommending it, but only due to the story. Just watch it in a video, or play easy mode. You don't want to be playing this any longer than you have to.			"

												Well, I finished this game almost at once, so we can kinda say it sucked me in. Let's start with a little summary of the game.Spec Ops: The Line is a rather linear TPS with a couple of places you can make your own decision between♥♥♥♥♥♥ and even bigger♥♥♥♥♥♥ And you'll feel♥♥♥♥♥♥in the end. The story:Delta Force sent to Dubai for a recon mission that quickly turns into a rescue mission, then into a ""shoot everything that moves"" mission. It gets confusing at times, but the end (which I won't spoil you) helps. It's...not what you'd expect. You start out as your standard US Soldier shooter with the grizzled veterans shouting commands, shooting baddies, being badass, but that quickly turns around. You are just a piece of the chess game of the forces behind the scenes. To give credit to the game, the story of Dubai getting hit by sandstorms, and getting Fallout'd is rather cool. And the visuals match, but bit later about that.Through the game I felt I was playing a TV series. Heck, it'd make a bloody good mini-series - about 6 episodes or so. The characters are good, and while not overdetailed, they do their job. And when I finished it, I felt like after a good TV show or movie. It left satisfied, but somehow empty. The conversions are awesome. I had a few laughs, but the interactions between the characters never went over the top, and kept me interested throughout the story. Nobody felt flat or uninteresting, so that's a pretty good thing too.Overall, 8/10. I had little to no expectations, but left with something I won't forget soon.Gameplay:It's a rather standard TPS with a decent selection of firearms. You get Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Pistols, SMGs, LMGs, and so forth. Most of them has a secondary mode, which is to say switch the sniper rifle's zoom (from 8x to 16x), or put a sound suppressor to the M4A1. It's fun, and while the diversity forces you to either be a really accurate shooter, or switch your weapons frequently. Ammo boxes scattered around the maps help you. The cover system while sometimes tad awkward, is good. Made me think of Mass Effect. In every section you can find pieces of intels - a great way for knowing the backstory a bit better, and adds to the overall feel to the game. You'll be more disturbed after you find them fo' sure. Sometimes they are at obvious places, but you gotta look for the to find all.The game is rather linear, but with a game like this, it's not much of a problem. I wouldn't list this as a pro, but neither as a con. It's just linear and that's it. 7/10 - you'll remember the game for the story, as the gameplay is, while rather flowing, brings nothing new.The visuals:Like in my Sleeping Dogs review (which you probably haven't read, but I like to mention my other written stuffs), I have to state I don't have the full specifics to play the game on High graphics. I went with medium, and it ran with about 30 fps. For me, it's solid, and the game, while not gorgeous, it looked good. The Sandstorm'd Dubai (which is almost Darude, but let's stay away from memes for a second) looks good. It's pretty detailed, and I never got bored of the environment. It wasn't exactly the same as far as I recall, and fighting on the top of a skyscraper is a nice change after eating sand on ground level. It matched the game, so I'm fine with it as is.Overall a 8/10.Sounds:Okay, this is awesome. The mad DJ with the hits of the 80s that he plays seemingly random, the ambient music, and the OST for the game is AWESOME. Fitting, believable, and you'll feel that it gives a lot to the game. You'll eventually search for the OST on Youtube, and save it to listen later. It's really good. Kudos to the composer.10/10Overall I'd give this game a 8.5 out of 10, totally worth playing, and totally worth your money. Be aware of the graphic images of gore, death, and the feeling of emptiness and guilt after you've finished the game, regardless of your choices.			"

												This game is pretty intense. I told my friend who served 2 tours in Iraq and Afganistan to not play this game, because he had some serious issues after coming back, and this game, to someone who has never seen war, treated the subject VERY differently from any other game involving the subject.It's very visceral and gritty, while still maintaining it's game feel. The mechanics are similar to a lot of other games, take cover, shoot, aim down the sights, blindfire, secondary weapons or attachments. Some parts are a bit challenging on normal, but if you slow down and take cover, and use your team to designate targets, it makes things easier.I would recommend this game to anyone who hasn't been in a tour of duty involving heavy combat.

												Cover based third person shooter set in a sand-covered Dubai, the gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing very different.  The beginning is a tad slow, but that's alright.  The thing that makes Spec Ops: The Line so incredible is the story.  A story that focuses on the horrors of war and violence.  You'll be forced to do horrible things, and make horrible choices. If you're looking for a multiplayer game, you probably won't want this.  If you're looking for a game with a fantastic story, this is it.  When it's all over, and the sand settles, all you'll be able to think is ""Dear God...what have I done?"".Highly recommended.			"

												This game is one of my favorites. You start off on a rescue mission to Dubai which has been hit with years of record breaking sandstorms. However, things escalate quickly. As you enter the city things aren't as they seem, and you might have just stumbled upon a warzone. This game one of the darkest and most emotionally investing I've ever played, this is a must buy by any standards and I reccomend it highly. 9.5/10			"

												One of the best games I've played, the story it's so interesting that you will want to play it more than one time, not like the classic war games, like CoD, this game tells that that every choice is bad or worse, doesn't make you wish go to war like other warfare games			"

												The first thing to get out of the way is that this game is not fun, nor was it meant to be fun.  That said, I feel that it is an incredibly important game that everyone should play.  Like in all modern shooters, you get turned into a mass murderer, but this time it is openly acknowledged and you will feel terrible about it.  One of the best examples that comes to mind is a part where you are forced to kill 2 men right after listening to them have a talk about actual things that make you have feels.  That's right, THIS GAME WILL HIT YOU RIGHT IN THE FEELS.  Another great aspect of the game is the lack of black-and-white morality.  Pretty much the entire game is spent questioning who is in the right, and the answer pretty consistently ends up being nobody.  It seems like everybody is trying to do the right thing, but they're doing horrible things in the process.  I must say that one of my favorite things about this game was the way that they portrayed the mental deterioration of your character and your squadmates. You can see these people that used to be great friends start to fall apart and get in fights with each other over what's right.  Anyways, I suppose I should also discuss the gameplay.  It's not very good.  Everything about the game is pretty generic if not sub-par.  It's a cover-based 3rd person shooter, but the cover system sucks and the shooting is nothing special.  One of my biggest complaints is actually that sprinting and taking cover are bound to the same button, so sometimes I would sprint past cover into the open, and other times I would want to sprint and accidentally get attached to cover.  You also have 2 squad mates that you can ""command"" but that basically involves telling them to shoot at a specific person until the target is dead.  The game is driven very hard by the story/themes, and I'd say it safely gets away with it, especially since the game is only about 5 hours long.  Buy it.			"

												Simply amazing.A MUST PLAY for anyone who loves storytelling in games. This one is on par with the greats like Bioshock and Portal.WARNING:THIS IS NOT A CALL OF DUTY CLONE LIKE THE TRAILERS AND BOX ART WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE, IT IS BASICALLY THE MOST ANTI-CALL OF DUTY TRIPLE A SHOOTER GAME EVER MADE.THIS GAME ISN'T ""FUN"" IT'S ENGAGING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE A TRADITIONAL GOOD TIME PLAYING IT!The best way to explain what this game is to start at it's creation.Spec Ops was a shooter series that nobody cared about in the late 90s/early 2000s.2K (the publisher) wanted Yager (the developers) to make a new Spec Ops game. It could be about ANYTHING so long as it was about the US military.What they made was a decent into madness that will make you rethink everything you knew about the Modern Military genre.Many games are ""adult"" because they have violence and sexual themes, though children still play and enjoy them. This game is adult because it's got mature themes and will make you think.I can't spoil ANYTHING because it's best to go in completely fresh but it's amazingly dark and you will feel awful after beating it, but in a good way.Gameplay's standard MMS fare but played from a third person perspective, similarly to Gears of War. The shooting feels good and they keep adding new, varied weapons to keep things at least somewhat varied. The cover mechanics are pretty clunky and awkward and It all gets kinda boring.But it's not about that, it's about the story.Play this if you want something that questions the MMS genre.Play this if you want to play something that makes you feel awful and think.DON'T play this if you want a pro-USA shooter where you kill the terrorists and stop World War 3.I wholeheartedly reccomend this.

												In the end I would probably recommend this game. Not because it would be particularly delightful to play. Actually, at times, the cover shooting mechanics are totally infuriating, the hordes of enemies you encounter become dull very fast and your squad seems very, very useless.It is quite obvious that this game is played for its story. I'm pretty sure it is quite well known at this point that this game is about war crimes, sanity, reality and morality. Most of the time the choices are forced on you, which might feel like cheating, but I think the narrative wouldn't work as it does if the player really had a freedom of choice. It is pretty damn obvious that clear majority of human kind would not commit war crimes or other atrocities, as normal reality permits our minds to stay intact. If the player really would get to make a clear-headed decision whether or not kill civilians or be an all-around bad guy, the choice would be robbed of its meanings. Either the player does the sensible thing (from normality's perspective) or roleplays a total psychopath, doing bad things only because they are evil, not because there is actually some ""logical"" reasoning behind the choice. Engaging in small digression, I actually think many choices in RPG-games are bereft of true meaning in this way: it just is pretty difficult to assume a role and stay consistent when you are sitting behind a screen.The game attemps to shed some light on war crimes, PTSD and whatnot. It could be taken as giving jabs to violent entertainment in general, problematizing mindless violence that often serves as the greatest form of interaction games usually provide, especially in the genre of war-themed FPS games. I still would've wanted to see a game that takes a stronger stance on this. Even though the game puts you in an uncomfortable situation, massacring civilians and whatnot, the interaction it provides still revolves totally around killing endless hordes of faceless bad guys. Even though this could be taken as a part of the games morals, I believe a more sturdier anti-war sentiment could've been conveyed if developers would've attempted to mold the action scenes more elegantly. Possibly it wasn't the job for this game, but I certainly believe it is an important task for some game.Story is pretty good, mechanics are a bit poopy, what else. The game looks good, but it contains surprisingly little pre-arranged scenic views and sights for the player to stumble upon. A war-wrecked Dubai could very well have room for vistas like this, but some technical limitations have probably prohibited them. The optional collection quests are well integrated into the story and gives you a real reason to hunt for them. The length of 5-7 hours on normal difficulty is compact and I enjoyed it. The story did not need any dragging on and the game itself wasn't so good that I would've wanted to play it any longer.			"

												Seemed to be some random TPS at first. But it definitely wasn't. It has an already seen but very solid and smooth gameplay, which is compiled with a realistic vision of gunfights. This results in an oppressing and hardened action, that comes with a pretty high level of difficulty for a modern game. Bots are quite hardcore and can surprise pretty often.  Visually, it is more about the wonderful artistic design and level design of the ruines of Dubai, then about AAA graphics. Same for the audio, good stuff. But the real originality of this game is it's story : In the beginning, it starts like the usual US special forces thingy. But it quickly becomes some disturbing cluster♥♥♥♥ (in the good way) of human crazyness. It puts the caracters and the player in the middle of the inner fight between the soldier and the man, when everything like order, brotherhood and moral codes go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Largely inspired by ""Apocalypse Now "" in my opinion, it is a hard and cold journey  into the subjects of  soldiers' depression and  war sickness. Something rarely seen in a game until now. Really worth going for it, specially since you can get it for really cheap lately.			"

It is hard enough to make you think about your next move but there aren't parts that are just annoying to get passed. So, all-in-all its a fair, well balanced, fast-paced shooter if you are looking for those in a 3rd Person shooter.			"

Well you really don't, at least gameplay wise, but the point of this game is to deliver a story and it God damn delivers it with flying colours.It took me 3 tries to finally finish it. It was repetitive, buggy, often boring, irrational, filled with typical war hero cliché moments. As it turned out, everything had a reason and the game masterfully appeared shallow on purpose. All you have to do is accept the way it is and enjoy the view. Literally, the graphics is quite a joy to the eye and very refreshing with its desert-post-apocalyptic environment.Would you please pay attention, because clues about the actual story are all around you.

												8/10Brilliant storyline. 10/10 for that. Immersive, shocking. Several moments that really highlighted the horrors of war, especially knowing that it ws you that pulled the trigger. This game will make you hate yourself.Gameplay, however, holds back this otherwise amazing experience.1. As a tactical shooter, cover plays a very important role. The cover mechanics in this game, however, are laughable. Often, the only way to get from cover to cover is to stand up and fully revealing yourself to the enemy. The game enters and exits cover in very counterintuitive ways, which, again, often means you will be stainging up in full view of the enemy.This shouldn't be a problem. Cover mechanics are nothing new. Mass Effect, Deus EX: HR, etc all have done infinitely better.2. The squad commands are limited to ""kill this guy"". Not even ""hold back"", which means your two vulnerable squadmates will sometimes rush, then require medical attention deep into enemy lines. Other than that, the game is amazing.			"

												Wow, now here's a suprise.  What starts off as a bland Gears of War style third person shooter, turns into a gripping war drama that looks at the horrors of war and what is right and wrong. Throughout most the game the shooting is functional albiet not that special but it's the story that really carries the experience and makes you want to keep playing. Spec Ops does what other modern shooters wish they could do, it makes you care, care about the choices you have to make along the way and about the characters that are involved. Spec Ops: The Line is a dark and gloomy ride that provides a refreshing experience from modern military shooters and whilst at first it seems just a shallow, this is done intentionally to lull you into a false frame of mind to make the experience all that more suprising. So if you see it on sale and you're up for a different kind of shooter that emphasis atmosphere and story then give it a try!			"

												It's a shame that Yager have publicly stated that there won't be a Spec Ops sequel as there is enough evidence in this game to hint at rich promises.In Spec Ops: The Line you are Captain Walker in charge of an elite Delta squad consisting of Staff Sergeant Lugo, the sniper, and Liutenant Adams, the heavy gunner. The premise is simple, your mission is to enter Dubai, confirm the statuses of Colonel John Konrad; who with his squad, the Damned 33rd, attempted to lead a rescue effort for the storm ravaged city of Dubai, and any remaining survivors of the storm, then radio for extraction. What follows however is anything but simple as you find yourself led deeper into the heart of the city, coming directly into contact with the conflict between the 33rd, the civilians and the CIA.In an ever shifting narrative where the lines between good and evil are constantly evolving yet becoming increasingly blurred , it is without a doubt that the story is the work of breathtaking brilliance. The game does not shy away from showing the ravages of war and how it can take its toll on individuals. Playing through the game, there are evocative and poignant moments which causes one to pause, think and consider. Even the collectibles in the game demand to be sought after as they genuinely add further to the story, providing additional layers to the narrative and helping to provide some enlightening backstories to some of the characters in the game.Unsurprisingly there are certain parts in the game where you are given a decision to make, whether it be to save a few civilians here or rescue a potentially valuable informat there. Whilst this adds a bit of variety proceedings, it is disappointing to see that the consequences of these decisions have little bearing in the grander scheme of the story so there is little in the way of replayability. Furthermore the gamplay itself is rather subpar. There is little to excite the player with the now standard 'on-the-rails' vehicle section making its way into the game to inspire a change of pace. The shooting itself can prove clunky at times and your team are largely annonymous in a gunfight. However the subpar gameplay is never too intrusive as to ruin the experience. Indeed it may be appropriate for it complements the story. It feels restrained, modest and bare. This way, the gameplay perfectly chimes with the wider subdued tone of the game where the horrors of war unfold. As such your focus remains firmly on the narrative.Visually speaking, Yager have achieved that sun-kissed perished paradise look that suggests a ruined landscape shorn of its riches. A neat metaphor for Captain Walker's mission. There are memorably evocative passages in the game which arouse a number of emotions in the player. The behaviour of the waves of sand as they bury enemies underneath is also believable. Yet the sand really comes into its own element in online multiplayer where the shifting terrain can alter and shift the balance of matches, offering greater tactical depth and encouraging careful planning.Overall Spec Ops: The Line is a welcome addition to the bloated shooting genre. It stands out on its own with its daring original story, distinctive setting and complex characters. Whilst it does not offer the brash, over-the-top, adrenaline filled fun of other shooters, enjoyment can still be had from this slow-burning, emotionally affecting, multi-faceted adventure.			"

A great third person shooter with a griping storyline (No spoilers!)There are many shooters on the market, the quip that the genre is overdone is thrown about constantly. Thankfully, Spec Ops: The Line has enough to set it apart and make it worth your attention.I didn't know exactly what to expect going into this game, but I had heard that it featured complicated morale choices and focused on the somber side of war. I bought it for a bargain on Steam Sale on the hunch that I might enjoy it for its storyline. To summarize my experience - this game is pretty much fantastic. You can tell a lot of attention was put into the story, and while the quality of the writing suffers at times, the overall cohesiveness of what they were trying to accomplish is successful.The story focuses on personal consequences in the face of total war. Your playable character's (and therefore your own) personal morality will be called into question at several points in the story. The utter and complete carnage of war may or may not grey the line between right and wrong - all depending on how you as the player choose to see it. There will be times when you can walk away and times when you cannot. Sometimes, circumstances may force your hand and you will be forced with a real Hobson's choice. It isn't necessarily a bad thing as after all, in war, sometimes things can come down to the choices of bad or worse.The gunplay is consistent and enjoyable with cover based shooting being the emphasis. Enemy AI is far from perfect, but is aggressive enough to pull off successful flanking and effective suppressive fire (against you and your teammates). Your two squad mates provide effective help throughout the campaign without being superhuman (AKA: immortal) or too dependent on you (incompetent).All in all, Spec Ops: The Line is a title well worth your consideration. Fans of third person shooters will enjoy the fast placed and fun gunplay. Teammate AI makes the experience all the more enjoyable with firefights often a real delight as suppressive fire rings out and precision shots drop exposed enemies. The storyline is what this game is really all about, the depravity of war. I assure you, you haven't played a shooter like this one before.8/10TL;DR- Acceptable visuals (2012 console-port title, forced FXAA recommended)- Fantastic voice acting by Nolan North (Cpt. Martin Walker)- Consistent and fun third person shooter- Good cover based system - works well with suppressive fire, grenades, sniping, et cetera- Gripping storyline focusing on the horrors of war, the often untold human cost at its core- Steam achievments- Tacked on multiplayer			"

												If you want a game that will make you question your values and morals then this is the game for you... To date this is the only game that has left me speechless at the end, it just left me pondering the conclusion of it all and the atrocities that war forces. This is as much a political statement as it is a game and it's one that you'd do well to at least try to pay attention to.			"

												A powerful story that combines an incredibly faithful retelling of Heart of Darkness (or Apocalypse Now for you movie folk) with an almost vindictive deconstruction of the modern military shooter and it's ""idealistic hero soldier"" facade. This is not a game you play for it's mechanics; it's a very basic shooter, but that's also intentional. The story is the real winner here.			"

												Do You Feel Like the Hero Yet?     What are your expectations when you start a military shooter? What are you willing to do just because the game tells you to? Do you think killing countless people will somehow lead to a happy ending? Why are you still playing? Do you think this is fun? Spec Ops: The Line forces you to think about these questions.      Let me begin by saying this is NOT a normal military shooter. Spec Ops is easily one of the darkest games I have played in years. It causes you to think about what you’ve done rather than just letting you mindlessly complete objectives. No, not a military shooter, but the opposite. This is a game about the horrors of military shooters.      Spec Ops is unique. It’s not about “fun” how we usually think of it. The story is where this game shines. Sure, you shoot things and hide behind cover just like every other third person shooter out there, but that’s not the point. The point is to make you think. The point is to make you question “Why am I still here?” While falling short in several areas, the narrative is what keeps you playing. You need to play this game.*Please note, this is only a review for the single player portion of the game. Multiplayer will only be mentioned once, right now.*GAMEPLAY     Spec Ops may not have the most polished gameplay, but it works well enough. The camera perspective is third person over the shoulder, which works well for this type of game. You feel more connected to the protagonist rather than him just being an empty vessel for you to possess. The gunplay is edgy, and the shooting mechanics are solid. The level design keeps things tense while providing for interesting ways to finish each area. The environments can frequently be used to your advantage, which is a wonderful addition to the gameplay.      Sand is your best friend and your worst enemy. If sand has blown against a window, shoot the window to drop it all on your enemies. However, sandstorms show up from time to time and make combat very difficult. Having the environment be a part of the gameplay is genius, especially considering how vicious the AI is. If left alone, they will murder you. Be prepared for some annoying sections where the pesky guy with a shotgun repeatedly flanks you.     The area where Spec Ops falls short is the controls. Having melee be the same button as vaulting over cover is annoying. There were several times when enemies were flanking me, so I went to hop over cover, but I just ended up punching it instead. That’s frustrating. However, the rest of the controls are mostly what you expect from shooters nowadays. It’s definitely not the worst control scheme I’ve ever seen, but it’s also not incredible.VISUALS     Spec Ops: The Line is a pretty game. From the moment I started the game, I could tell I was in for some eye candy. I wasn’t disappointed. Beautiful scenery, excellent detail, and horrifying deaths, this game has it all. However, the character models could have used some work. If you showed me a lineup of characters and told me to pick the protagonist from this game, I wouldn’t be able to do it. His personality makes up for his bland appearance, though. Nolan North’s performance as the protagonist is excellent, just like everything else he’s ever done.      Spec Ops’ aesthetics are fantastic. Set in Dubai, you wouldn’t think there’s much to see besides buildings and sand. You’re right! Yet somehow, they manage to keep it interesting. From giant billboards to war torn villages, it manages to keep your attention. One part that really stood out to me was when you reach the top of a skyscraper, you look out over all of Dubai. Off in the distance, you can see your ultimate goal, and you realize just how far you still have to go. This is great. It shows you how far you’ve made it, yet it also shows how beautiful the landscape really is.      Expect to be shocked by how brutal this game is. They will show you things you wish you hadn’t seen. Without spoiling anything, there’s a scene in the middle that is painful to see. They show you that your actions have consequences. Without these visuals, it wouldn’t have had the impact that it did. SOUND     Nolan North. Does anything else need said? It probably does, so I’ll continue. All of the sound is very believable. The gunshots have punch, and the sandstorms are terrifying. The banter between characters helps the world feel real. Your two friends will always let you know when someone is trying to flank you, and they’ll tell you when they kill a target you’ve told them to kill. This sort of feedback is excellent, and I want to see more games incorporate it on this sort of level. Also, the soundtrack is appropriate and well implemented. Overall, excellent sound.STORY     Now for the good stuff. The narrative is the greatest in any game since Bioshock. Seriously. I won’t spoil anything, but it needs to be played more than once to fully grasp just how deep it actually is. This is the most well-paced shooter I have played in years. Some shooters leave me worn out after a few hours of playtime, but Spec Ops always gives you a breather after you get through a tough section. Partly the writing and partly the level design, but it’s worth noting. If I say any more, I’m afraid I’ll spoil something, so I’ll close with this: play this game.CONTENT     Player discretion is advised. Be prepared for some very shocking visuals. You will see things you wish you hadn’t. It’s not pointless, though. It is essential to the narrative. Occasional language, including the “F” word. Not nearly as much language as GTA or Saint’s Row, but about as much as The Walking Dead. Don’t let your children play this game. The visuals are disturbing, even for adults.THE VERDICT     I highly recommend this game. Probably wait for a sale on Steam since the campaign is only six hours long. However, you will probably want to play it through more than once. Be prepared to be shocked, but also prepare to be amazed. This isn’t the game we wanted, but this is the game we needed. “Fun” is not in its vocabulary. Spec Ops: The Line sheds some light on the gaming industry itself, and it proves that a military shooter can truly be original. SCORINGGameplay: 7.5Visuals: 8.5Sound: 8.5Story: 9.5Overall*: 8.5(Scale of 1-10. 1 being terrible, 10 being perfection.)*(Not an average. This is the score I give to the overall product, not an average of certain aspects. This score is my recommendation for whether it should be played.)			"

												A title that will make you think about the nature of gaming itself, if you allow it. It is a slow burning type of game, one which questions quietly, slowly... through cliches, repetition and excellent timing.Spec ops: the line is a first person shooter game that has little to do with its past pedigree. Mechanically is a fast paced game. The slow burn comes in the way the story unravels and the choices the protagonist makes.A must play.			"

												Violence, bloodshed, and cruelty are unfortunate, likely indelible parts of our reality. As widespread as they are, it’s only natural they’re reflected in expressive media. Guns, for example, are always a hot topic, and a good fit for video games: point, shoot, be visually and technically rewarded. First and third-person shooting can provide such a compelling feedback loop for players that hundreds of these games are developed, and millions of copies are sold. Series like Call of Duty and Gears of War set the pace for the modern shooter. In a medium, in a society, so acclimated to this kind of violence, it is, in turn, only natural that opposing commentary arises. See Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now, and Spec Ops: The Line.A third-person shooter set in the near future or an alternate present, Spec Ops: The Line puts players in the shoes of Captain Martin Walker, an American soldier sent to Dubai with two companions to evacuate survivors from the city, long in ruins from hellish sandstorms. Upon arrival, the group picks up a distress signal from Walker’s old commander, Colonel John Konrad, apparently holed up in the city with his battalion, the 33rd. Walker decides to search him out, only to be met with extreme opposition from crazed members of the 33rd itself. Over the course of the game, Walker and his fellow soldiers cross paths with the CIA, cross swords with the 33rd, and make decisions that will change the lives of thousands.From minute one, the influence of Conrad and Coppola is clearer than a summer sky. Konrad (like, come on) may as well be named Kurtz; Walker, Marlow or Willard. The trek through Dubai is as hellish as the Conrad’s Congo or Coppola’s Vietnam. It is certainly a fitting setting for a modern retelling. Dubai is a rich man’s paradise built on the backs of thousands in a position no better than slavery. It’s in close proximity to areas heavily occupied by US armed forces for the last two or three decades; it’d believably be a point of interest and interference for our troops if such disastrous storms ever did strike. While The Line does hit these points, the classic story beats, and more, it’s held back by a lack of subtlety and a few key, sloppy moments. Narrative choices are peppered throughout, typically deciding between the life or death of nameless characters - only the final choice matters counts towards your ending, as far as I can tell. Those choices are further undercut by narrative choices you have no say in. This is summed up in an early chapter: you have a choice to save an informant or some civilians. One of your squadmates pushes for the informant and the mission, while the other wants to protect innocent lives - I went with the civilians. Hardly ten minutes later, your path is blocked with considerable forces, but there just happens to be white phosphorus mortars nearby. Now, strangely, your squadmates’ roles swap - the one who argued for the civilians now argues for completing the mission by any means necessary, while the other now vouches for finding another way. “There’s always a choice,” he says. Apparently not, because you’re promptly forced to melt a couple hundred people to continue towards your goal. This is made all the more baffling when, in later chapters, load screens directly chastise the player for killing without caring. I do appreciate that The Line asks these questions and poses them to players, many of which may be expecting just another action-packed military shooter. I’m just sure there’s a way to do so with more finesse and, ultimately, impact.Gameplay is serviceable, though drab. The closest comparison is probably Gears of War, owing to the focus on cover, roadie run, visible grenade arcs, and other nuances. Level and encounter design is, again, just serviceable. There are in-game challenges that offer a bit of engagement - get a hundred headshots, kill twenty rappelling enemies. I suspect this feature is a self-aware genre jab, juxtaposing arcade-like objectives with horrific and widespread death, but it ended up as the only thing maintaining my interest in each firefight. That’s the thing about this game: much like Apocalypse Now, it can feel like just another example of what it’s trying to criticize. It can come off as a cheap Gears clone made to sell units, and there isn’t always enough evidence present to say otherwise.I’ve been hard on it, but I do have a lot of respect for Spec Ops: The Line. Amidst the ocean of Duty, Battle, and Honor, this game stands out as a genuine effort to make these audiences, and this industry, to consider genre standards we may be too comfortable with. It’s worth attention, despite its missteps. Apparently, development was repeatedly delayed, some of it owing to story changes; with more time and a unified vision, Yager Development could’ve made something truly great. For now, we have a solid attempt at a Heart of Darkness for the modern age that deserves recognition for confronting complacency to violence.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line. What a game. I could quite possibly write a whole paper on the philosophical and ethical side of this game but I'm going to keep it rather short. GET THIS GAME. It's a brilliant middle finger to all of the jingoistic, gung-ho 'MERICA shooters that have been flooding the market. However, while the story is great the gameplay is merely okay and there are some occasional glitches (only ran into about 4 or 5 noticable ones throughout the game, other than that this is a fantastic port), but most of this is forgivable due to the short length of it's campaign (around 5-6 hours). It does have some issues but the big picture is what's most important here, it may get rather repetitive or frustrating at times, but stick with it and you'll get one of the finest experiences in all of gaming.Bottom line (heheheh...line), though: GET THIS GAME			"

												The mehcanics are a bit wonky on KB+MS. The game does the terrible mistake of binding the key to take cover with the key to sprint.  And the sprint is like a gears of war sprint where you have little control over the direction and can't stop soon. But this game really shines on the second playthrough at a higher difficulty for two reasons: you're better adapted to the keys and mechanics and the the vague story is clear when you know the ending. You can get killed very easily at higher difficulties which forces you to be really slow-paced and tactical and that is when the game is really engaging and brilliant.			"

												This game is incredibly underrated, and it actually annoys me a little that it hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. It starts off like a typical action/war-game would. You are on a mission and you have a task or a goal to achieve. Once you progress through  the game, you will encounter some tough desicions and some seriously tough outcomes. This game has an incredibly deep story which totally blew me away, because I seriously didn't expect it. I haven't played the game for a long time, but I finished the storyline, and it made a huge impression on me.I will not spoil the game's story, but it has a crazy turning point and some serious mind♥♥♥♥s beyond measure, that I never expected when I bought the game. If you decide to play through the story, make sure that you listen carefully to the dialogs and pay attention to the details. Seriously, it's worth it. This has been one of my best gaming-experiences in a long time. The game is very emotional, especially towards the end. It represents war in a realistic way, and shows the outcome and damages it causes. It's not just a typical action game where you kill  the bad-guys and save the day. It's so much more than that. It makes you really reflect over your choises and it's outcomes. The game has four possible endings, and you have the option to chose towards the end. You pick the one you want, and the one that you feel  is the correct one. Because as i said earlier, this game includes a massive mind♥♥♥♥ as you progress, and people would have different opinions on what they feel is the proper ending.One of the things I'm not a great fan of, is some of the awkward controls. They are not bad, but it is not something I'm used to in a game within the genre. But you can of course mess around with key-bindings till you find something that works alright for you. The graphics are good and the voice-acting as great.The game is also fairly cheap. But even if the game was more expensive, it would still be worth every cent. Very deep and very emotional game. The game is not perfect, but it is truly a great gaming-experience.Rating: 7,9/10			"

Worth it.I'm not 100% sure how I got this game but I found it scroling through my library and thought, ""What the hell...why not?""Everything started off ""dude-bro""-esk until I noticed subtle nuances...it slowly grew into something more.By the end of it I was ♥♥♥♥ing dumbfounded and amazed.I can't say anything else without spoiling it, just play it.

												Let me tell you a story guys.There was once a nice good looking middle aged lady called Call of Duty, she was a what you`d call a cougar. One day she visited a reception and met a charming young man named Bulletstorm. They caught each another`s eye and one thing led to another. One day Call of Duty calls up Bulletstorm and tells him that she is pregnant. They talk about it and all and decide they want to keep it. 9 months later the baby was born in a hospital. It was delivered by a nice doctor named Borderlands and assisted by the nurse... i think her name was Rage or Fallout or smth of that sort... it was decided that the baby would be called Spec Ops. But an unthought thing happened... once Spec Ops was given to Bulletstorm to hold it he started freaking out. You cant blame him he was just a young fella with the rest of his teenage days still ahead of him and big decisions to be made. He ran out of the hospital in panic fearing the responsibilities and the tied down life. He was never to be seen again.Call of Duty had been single handedly raising Spec Ops for awhile when another series of events followed. She met a foreigner visiting her place. She was still in her prime and some may call her a MILF even. The guy`s name was Gears of War. He was of a ripe age and of nice facial features and body built. They started talking often and found out a lot of interesting things about each other. Gears of War was a nice and reliable man... a perfect husband... a perfect father... and soon enough he became one. Spec Ops became a brighter kid ever since. They often went out to the parks, played baseball or soccer together, would go to the beach and splash water and run around... a perfect little family it was. Spec Ops would still have minor features of his biologica father Bulletstorm and have a few internal scars too but he was strong enough to look past them. Soon came his own time to shine... he was a bright student with an unorthodox mind. He loved watching movies by Steven Kubrik or Christopher Nolan, especially the Machinist and Fight Club. Eventually he had graduated college and went to a good medical school to become a doctor. As a matter of fate he happened to know the doctor that was delivering him - Borderlands and earn a scholarship in that name. What you see in this game that you might be about to purchase is that kid - Spec Ops standing on the stage and receiving his Masters Degree with Honors from the principal of the elitist university awaiting the outside world to embrace him with open arms.I wish a very happy ending to his story and the events till its` end.

												I haven't reviewed this game, thats odd. Well,  better late than none at all..A TECHNICAL NOTE:This game was designed for WinXP, and therefore you need to set the combatibility options accordingly. Detailed explanation can be found at PCGamingWiki.com. There is also a bug regarding previously saved games, this causes the game to crash. The fix for this is also found at the wiki.SECONDARY NOTE:Since i'm aching all over, i'm just copying the review i made for this game on Greenman Gaming. (Lazyness FTW)__________________________________________________________________Valtheknight | Feb. 6, 2014 | Review of Spec Ops: The LineOh dear... Well i can for starters say that i'm at an disadvantage since i last played the game through about a year ago and i completely forgot that i bought it from Greenman. Also since there is a ""credit""-gain from review so.. Might as well.Before i start, i really should mention that i really cant remember everything about this game. Because of the one year gap. So most of the stuff i say will be mostly about my personal experiences and should be taken with 'nth amount of salt. (Since i'm a little bit biased..)Well the first thing that needed to be done with the game, was to actually get it to run. Since it had some startup-problems with it, this caused some grey hairs at first, but a quick venture into the promised land of PC-GAMING WIKI. Helped to resolve that problem quickly. Unfortunately, since the game uses encrypted options files. Tweaking other aspects of it will prove difficult, if you wish to, for example, change the FOV.(I don't remember if the game was updated to include an FOV slider later on.. Again i last played it at the start of 2013.)Well i think that's the mandatory technical jabber out of the way, onto the game itself.The story is in itself deceptively straight-forward, it starts of with a group of soldiers, (Delta-Force if memory serves correctly.) On a mission to investigate what happened in Dubai after it was supposed to have been evacuated, before some heavy-duty sandstorms started wrecking up the place.And that is pretty much the easiest explanation of how the story starts, i really can't write about it that much since i feel i would be doing it no favors. Instead, i will only say that the story only gets more darker and stranger the further it goes. With some actual character-development and i don't mean the ""put-points-to-sht-to get-the-biggest-deathcck"" -way, but in the storytelling sense. Some of the stuff you see and hear the team say and do really start to show later down the line.That's enough spoilers for the story part, next!The gameplay is pretty standart 3rd-person cover-based shooting and that is pretty much the thing that kind of kills the novelty-value almost instantly, because people will automatically make references to any other Military shooter almost instantly. I on the other hand right now started thinking about the Normandy landing scene on Medal of Honor:Allied Assault, nicked almost to the T from Saving private Ryan... Oops Digressing statement.Later down the line, the game has a turret section, and another, and another yet again.. That kills the feel a bit, since you wonder ""Why did it give me another turret section? Can't i just run around and shoot them in the head instead?"" Actually, at one point you can, but it makes it a bit harder. But don't get me wrong, the helicopter segment at the start of the game (and the redo of it later) was well executed. I cannot really say the same from the rest though.Anyway, the biggest sin, i feel from the game-designs part is the linearity. It shows from the start and it carries through to the end. The strangest thing though... I noticed on my last playthrough that i had missed options in the story. All because the game told me to do this, instead of that and now i need to download it again to see the other parts i missed. Since i feel, ""if i missed that one so obvious, what others i missed ?""CONCLUSION:Even with its story, The Line seems (to untrained eye atleast) a generic 3rd-person shooter. Even the changes the characters go through during the story, kind of brush by with a big red sign over their head saying ""FEEL SH_T"". And some of the stuff does have some shock value, but it loses even that rather quickly. All and all, the story (if flawed, yes flawed. Shoot me if you disagree.) is the only thing that is interesting about this game. Is it enough to carry it? No. Is it enough to make it stand out from the rest? Yes. Is it actually worth playing? Maybe.__________________________________________________________________I gave the game 80/100 on Greenman, and at second thought, it might have been a bit too generous. I should have given it a score middling 60-75, since it had all the classic modern era shooter problems. But as it stands, it is still worth the money.			"

												Talk about a game that exceeded my expectations. I recently purchased that Humble Bundle for 2K and this was one of the games in the tier. I had never heard of it before and I thought, why the heck not. I was already going to get the bundle for the Bioshock series and that was enough justification for the purchase. A quick google search of the title revealed that it was a third person shooter, a genre that I was not familiar with. I went into the game with the bar set pretty low, expecting mediocre gameplay and a typical shooter campaign storyline. I was wrong in my expectations lets just say. The story was exceptional and unique while maintaining my interest and enveloping me in to the plot. The gameplay on the normal difficulty setting was a nice balance with combat progressively getting more challenging as the story progressed. If I had any complaints (petty they are at that) it would be that the control and combat style was a little basic though still better than some other shooter style games out on the market (cough cough COD cough cough). Overall, I really enjoyed the game and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh and unique. (PS: The soundtrack was also really good in terms of piece selection and timing. Made the game feel very authentic and exciting. A+)			"

												I've ignored the game and forgotten about it for two years, only got it as a part of a Humble Bundle pack. Saw a friend mention he just finished it and his comment just said ""OMG"". So I was intrigued. I gave it a shot. Few hours later......OMG.This is by far the most messed up and thought-provoking game I've played in quite a while, as well as action packed and fast paced, in book terms - it's a real page-turner and you'll want to keep on going, I guarantee it.Not going to comment on the technical stuff or mechanics, everything is as it should be. above average at least.

It separates itself from other shooters because it forces you to make tough choices and dosen't shy away from the brutality of war and loss of life on a massive scale.It's a game that really makes you think about your actions and makes you contemplate the horrors of war in the real world.Having just finished the campaign, i'm keen to play through again to see the alternative endings.3.5/5 rubber chickens			"

												Just fantastic -- I could simple leave it at that (but I'll elaborate anyway). Spec Ops: The Line combines some of the best third-person shooter action I've ever played with one of the most gut-wrenching literary works in history and ends up with a weekend-worthy masterpiece of gaming that, by the end, will leave you mouth agape and unsure of what to do with yourself.

												There are few times in your life when you will have the chance to experience something as outstanding as Spec Ops: The Line.The setting is the city of Dubai, a few months after it has been hit by a devastating sandstorm and an evacuation operation has apparently failed. The focus is on three US Army soldiers sent to find out if there are any survivors and getting caught right in the middle of a conflict between the 33rd Infantry Battalion and local CIA operatives. The story shows the atrocities that the protagonists have to commit during their mission and the descent of the main character into madness, as he realizes that there are no redeeming choices in his reality and he can't cope with his own actions. The plot contains parallels from various horrifying situations of real-world war zones, particularly the use of white phosphorus mortar bombs on civilian populations in Iraq and Gaza. At its core, Spec Ops: The Line explores the concepts of PTSD, cognitive dissonance, escapism and the idea that the main character is not the player's avatar but instead, the player is the main character's super-ego.The story is amazing and it is delivered superbly by all aspects of the game. The cutscenes, the direction, the characters' models, the tone and content of the voice acting (not only during scripted sequences, but even in the way the main character addresses his companions during battles), the animations (most notably the executions of dying enemies), the level design and even the loading screen text snippets - everything in the game shifts and transforms in order to serve the story and highlight the increasingly obvious psychosis of the main character, his increasingly violent tendencies, his inescapable and growing guilt, his detachment from sanity (and reality) and his companions' gradual loss of respect, trust and faith in him, as one of the premises of the game is revealed and confirmed (""Ιt takes a strong man to deny what's right in front of him.""). The game embraces literally everything at its disposal and raises every expectation regarding what we should accept as character development from modern works of art.The graphics are decent, including realistic and detailed shaders, rich well-crafted animations, just the right amount of post-processing and destructible environments. It is one of the best uses of the Unreal Engine that I've seen to date. When you are inside the extravagant but deserted buildings of Dubai, the art style is often reminiscent of that of the original BioShock.In the sound department, the game performs excellent - the voice acting is simply outstanding, while the soundtrack consists of a post-rock soundscape that blends perfectly with the environments and the psychological state of the characters, coupled with a plethora of known pieces from various artists, ranging from Deep Purple and Jimi Hendrix to Björk and Giuseppe Verdi.The gameplay is that of a typical third-person cover-based shooter, with the right balance between cool (to keep you interested), surreal (to underline that something isn't quite right) and repetitive (to make you feel even more desensitized before it hits you). The levels often seem open but the level design is actually quite linear. The game's idea of tactics revolves mostly (though not exclusively) around finding a good cover, adapting by changing your position, drawing enemies out of their covers and some micromanaging with weapons, bullets and grenades. At no point do you get to choose where you are going to fight your enemies and stealth tactics, wherever applicable, don't make a lot of difference compared to just charging in. You can, however, drown your enemies using tons of sand that's trapped on glass roofs and other places.Where the gameplay shines is in choices: instead of presenting choices with a bland menu that's disconnected from the rest of the game, Spec Ops: The Line embraces them tightly and features them exclusively as part of the gameplay. In many occasions, the game organically recognizes the intent behind your actions without having previously made the choice (or all of your options) explicit. This not only helps maintain the cinematic feel of the game, but also forces you to ponder your choices as real actions with real consequences (rather than items in a menu) and, most importantly, it makes you question your previous actions and constantly reevaluate situations retrospectively, highlighting another premise of the game, the idea that apparently you had choices all along (""There's always a choice!""), but you kept going (""None of this would've happened if you'd just stopped.""). There are four endings for you to discover and they are all well-made and perfect epilogues to what your actions say about the protagonist (and you) by the end.Some final things:-The campaign is 6-12 hours long depending on your pace, not particularly difficult once you get used to the gameplay.-After you finish the campaign, a variable portion of the game's events are left open to interpretation. Almost all possible interpretations have at least some plot holes or unconvincing details. For me, they are forgivable but your mileage may vary.-There is a multiplayer mode that I simply won't consider in this review, because this game is essentially its campaign mode and the very existence of a multiplayer mode defeats the point that the story is trying to make.-Some people have said that there are bugs (particularly sound-related ones, which can be overcome, as they say), but I can't comment on those because for me it worked flawlessly.And that's it. This is an extraordinary game and every developer should take notes, because Spec Ops: The Line demonstrates what games should aim to be.			"

												Ignored it upon release as I'd wrongly assumed it was another one-sided AMERRCUHHH, KILL THE TERRORISTS, BE A HERO game (the first 30 or so minutes kind of are, to lull you into a false sense of confidence and righteousness) but it quickly turns out to be anything but - throughout, and increasingly so, you'll be questioning whether you're doing more harm than good, and that's putting it lightly. Surprisingly deep and clever. Several references to Heart Of Darkness which it seems to be based on.Lots can be said about how well it manages it (I ended up writing an essay on the game for uni), but without spoiling anything, you'll feel like a monster by the end. In one small example, there's a part where you're fighting enemies in a shopping mall, with civilians hiding inside. I'd been fighting for roughly 10-15 minutes and hadn't seen a single civilian. An enemy ran down a hallway, and I chased him, ready to shoot back, when a civilian dives out from a gap and ran for cover. Before I had time to think, I shot them, and felt SO bad. It was clear that it was a mistake the game was counting on me to make, and I fell for it.Downsides: criticises military shooty games while being one (whether that works for or against it is up for debate), fairly unimaginative Gears Of War style cover/shooting mechanics.Overall: I really recommend anyone gives it a go, if they're into any shooter games, or are just looking for something different within the genre (hard to find, as anyone'll know). BUY IIIIIIT!(oh, and avoid multiplayer. the devs didn't want it in the game but the publisher got another studio to quickly hash it together, which completely misses/ignores the point of the story.)

												Dark, gritty and very accurate about it's portrayal of war, If you want to get away from the glorified war game that is CoD this is worth it. The game pulls no punches displaying the carnage of war. The game is story driven in a compelling and addicting manner and well written.The game only has two outcomes for choices: Bad or Worse. You never feel like you made the right choice, but you do what you think is neccessary.The best part about this game is that it never dehumanizes the enemies you fight, in fact it tends to stress that fact that you are killing fellow human beings, you aren't supposed to feel good that you just shot the guy with the head wrapping, you did it because you had to survive.All in all this game rates a solid 9.5/10- Loved the game, hated myself.

												This game.. What can I say. Its beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a truly mature game. It shows all the Call of duties, modern warfares and battlefields and their various clones for the pretentious hogwash they are. It starts out looking like a bad COD clone, it even plays like one to start, but it uses that set up to rip the rug out from under ones feet. A great and insightful game, but by no means a fun game. I had to put it down on multiple occasions because I couldn't handle it for more than an hour at a time. This is a game that does the horrors of war justice.			"

												This is basically PTSD: The Game.As a game, it's pretty standard.  You get into cover.  You shoot guys with guns.  Run to the waypoint to continue getting into cover and shooting guys with guns.  It feels fairly clunky to actually get into cover.  I felt like I had to hit the space bar a specific way to actually get into cover.  There are a handful of weapons in different categories like rifles, shotguns, small arms, snipers and heavy weapons.  Everything feels fairly generic with a few exceptions like shooting a part of the environment to dump sand on your foes and that's about it.  You can give orders to your team, but some orders only pop up at specific times and I could never seem to be able to use the attack order.  I was able to beat the campaign on the hardest availible starting difficulty in under 7 hours.  Again, as a game, it's pretty generic.As an experience, it's a completely different beast.  Never in my life have I played a military shooter that was this shocking.  If you thought the nuke scene and ""no russian"" from Call of Duty were hardcore, then you haven't seen anything yet.  It's really something you have to see for yourself and I wouldn't dare spoil it.  If I had to compare the story to anything, it feels a lot like the movie ""Apocalypse Now"" and if you've seen that movie then you should be aware of the levels of shock you are getting into...but even the story here goes above and beyond that.   Again, as an experience, it's quite unique.If you can get it cheap, do not pass it up even if you don't like cover shooters.  This is one game you need to see to the end...			"

												Overall I am a little broken on if I should suggest this game or not for many of the reasons outlined by both camps recommending and not recommending this game. So I figured I would give a well-rounded opinion of this game as I see it. I had to say that I would either recommend or not recommend it and I will wrap up at the very end why I eventually ended up recommending it. The GoodOverall the storyline is good, if you are looking for a modern shooter that falls in line with something like Mass Effect look elsewhere. ***SPOILERS HERE***The decisions you make have little impact until the VERY end of the game. That said the storyline itself is really quite good. ***NO MORE SPOILERS***Great voice acting unlike many other games, and on the note of voice acting the ambiance and stagnant dialogue given while you are walking around or just in a general area are also quite good. All adds to the rather interesting atmosphere created by this game. This game does have very interesting interiors if you take some time to look at them. They did seemingly put some detail there even if you don’t notice it. It was a fun added bonus that I appreciated time and time again. The characters develop throughout the plot as one would expect and the witty comments given throughout the game are quite good and keep things funny at times.  But other times create a very real sense of tension among the team mates. The general feel of this story starts off with you feeling great about yourself and your mission. But that slowly degrades and unlike COD or BF you aren’t left feeling like a hero at all. Even the loading screens about half way through the game start to become very macabre with things like “Do you feel like a hero yet?” and “This is all your fault.” So don’t play if you have a low self-esteem. This game will likely not help you any.  The combat in the game can be intense at times, leaving you with a sense of accomplishment if you have the game set on the correct difficulty. Literally don’t play this game on easy you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice by doing so. The BadThe actual gameplay can actually be really back braking at times. You want to do one thing but your character does another. And the game is over the right shoulder 3rd person so at times this is very frustrating. I felt like I needed the extra two side buttons on my mouse just to bind to grenade and melee.Speaking of which I can’t recall EVER using the melee button in the game at all.The controls aren’t intuitive and sometimes you want to do one thing but the game seemingly has a mind of its own. So this WILL get you killed a ton. Like a metric ton. No really…A TON. It is going to get annoying. Your fireteam doesn’t seem to have any real sense of direction when you direct them. About the only thing I found useful was having Lugo snipe people when someone was getting annoying. Really the other guy Adams was useless for the most part. The enemies do follow distinct lanes and don’t really vary from it much. However there will be times where you are thinking the fight is over and you are looking for that one LAST guy somewhere. He is always somewhere illogical and always armed with a shotgun it seems. Which never ends well. And by well I mean it usually ends with you dead and having to redo the entire firefight again. The SynopsisMany here suggest just watching a play through on youtube since many people play it for the storyline anyway. I can actually suggest this if you are going between buying and not buying the game. Since likely you will only enjoy it for the storyline anyway, the actual gameplay is a labor in futility and just frustrating at best. I found it to be a really welcome break from many other FPS games which is why I bought it discounted. If I had paid full price I would not have been happy with my purchase.  But it is a very good storyline and I enjoyed it as much as was honestly possible. But I can suggest it with one caveat, buy it on sale.  "

												100% Completion ReviewForgive Them, For They Know Not What They DoThis game may just be one of the best single player experiences I have ever had. The story is mind-blowingly amazing, and nothing much comes close, except maybe the story of COD: Black OPS. This game features several choices of morality, which in turn don't affect the gameplay much, but in the end it's how they affect you as a person. This game really makes you feel for the characters and how that in turn reflects on you at the end.The atmospheric design and levels in this game are truly unique and offer something different to the typical shooter genre. The weapons are varied yet simple, and the shooting mechanics/cover system is simple but great. With the cover system, squad management and varied selection of weapons Spec Ops: The Line keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting, with a complex story that keeps you wanting more.All in all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone for the story alone, let's just hope you can live with the choices you make...

												This is a great game and in my view has one of the most memorable stories in all of the games i have played. It's one of the games that even after playing it you still think about it, the story stuck in your head for a number of reasons. It is a game that tries to show another side of war. Not the side that other games show where you kill and kill, but the side that shows consequences for your killing and the impact it has.			"

												Outstanding Story with a breathtaking plot with alternative endings.Spec Ops is about you, the effects of your actions, and events that are out of your control.This game defies the standard army shooter in a way that you have never seen before, it actually makes you question your actions, where you find yourself asking if killing is right or wrong.Multiplayer's a wash, but the campaign is worth replaying - seeing the same events while knowing what's really going on is uncomfortable in new ways, but the intelligent encounters and level design make each fight exciting, and the voice acting creates genuine and believable characters.Absolutely, and without a doubt, one of the best stories you'll find in any game.

												Spec Ops: The Line could have been amazing, but is merely good overall. However, aspects of it truly shines.The sense of progression in this game is simply amazing. Starting out as a typical military shooter, over time it becomes something more - and quite subtly at that. At first the killing seems inconsequential, you're following orders and being the archetypal soldier, mowing down the opposition for the greater good. As things progress though, it starts to challenge that notion, albeit vaguely at first. The loading screen text at the start of a level (or reloading a checkpoint in the case of death) even starts to change its tone, and it's these details that I admire so.As the plot progresses, so do the characters and their tone of communication. Your character model and the environment follows suit, ever altering as you move forward. There's a ton of commentary in the background and it's up to the player to explore it and read between the lines.Down to gameplay:This is where it stays typical, moving from cover to cover, shooting people in the head and waiting for your health to regenerate. That's pretty much what combat comes down to.One thing I loathed was my squad. The AI is so incompetent, I wanted to wrap my fist in an eisbein and punch them in the face. Forever. They're less trained combat operatives and more overconfident football players. They would've been more in place in a Serious Sam game. I got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at having to revive these guys all the time.You can order your squad to attack an enemy, but not to hold their position or to move to another. Game devs, what the♥♥♥♥♥♥ man? I hated those guys. And yes, they need to stay alive, as they're not just generic soldiers, but characters essential to the story.Other than that, solid stuff. Get it on sale. Experience your own Apocalypse Now.			"

What I can say is it's not Call of Duty. This isn't Duke Nukem. It's the anti-duke. This is the game that makes war war. It makes the whole thing feel like a great big ""WTF are we doing"". It's been said that Spec Ops The Line can only be won by not playing.It's great, it's thought provoking, it'll make you think, it'll make you question what you're playing a war game for and it'll stick in your mind for years after.Absolute must play.

												A title that will make you think about the nature of gaming itself, if you allow it. It is a slow burning type of game, one which questions quietly, slowly... through cliches, repetition and excellent timing.Spec ops: the line is a first person shooter game that has little to do with its past pedigree. Mechanically is a fast paced game. The slow burn comes in the way the story unravels and the choices the protagonist makes.A must play.			"

												First off if you ever think you are going to play this game stop looking for info on it and while the main hook may have already been spoiled that is far from the only one so don't write it off. The things I can say about this game are the mechanics are solid and satisfying, the slight time dilation when you get a head-shot really carries weight. The controls can be a little wonky at first but they work (mine only showed Xbox prompts which didn't help). The graphics hold up well so far and while the setting dictates the brown color palette there are some splashes of color provided by the graffiti spread around the world. There are also some pretty impressive establishing shots spread throughout. The story was a risk for the developer which definitely payed off but, while it was absolutely the best choice, I feel the intentionally bland marketing limited sales a bit and pushed the impact below the radar a bit. Please hold out through the end for this one, you owe it to yourself to dig into this story and let it impact you, however it touches you. Even if you find it hard to play. There is so much more I'd love to say and discuss about this game but I've already said too much. Just play this, as soon as possible.

												This review is only for the single player campaign on normal difficulty.  Pretty well everything about this game was exactly what I would want out of a FPS campaign.  There was a decent variety of guns, some of them had secondary fire options, a few gernade choices and a melee option.  The best thing about the guns was that there wasn't one or two that were obviously the ones you had to take with you, you had the choice to pick whatever two you liked and make your way through the game.  Of course there were times that one gun was much more useful than another but for the rest of the time you could run with what you want, till you ran out of ammo anyways.  Enemies were not to difficult for the most part outside of a few areas that were tricky.  Later game enemies did start presenting a bit more of a challenge.  They used cover surprisingly well and did attempt flanks and the like.The setting, enviroment, graphics, etc... were all top notch, there is pretty well nothing that I could complain about in that department.  From the beauty of the open spaces in destroyed dubia to the smaller areas were unspeakable horrors abounded, everything was just so well presented.And the story.  Without getting into spoilers because this is a game that should be experienced spoiler free.  I loved the story, I'm still not sure I entirely got everything that there was to get from the story, but thats the great part.  The game did leave some choices to make, as to what exactly those choices decided at the end of the day, well thats why I want to play the game more than once, and I can't really think of any FPS single player campaings that made me want to come back for more.  The only big gripe that I had with this game was with your AI teammates and their use of cover, or well lack of cover I guess.  The two AI teamates that you travel the game with are better than a lot of other AI teamates other games have stuck you with, these guys actually can kill an enemy or two but they tend to walk stupidly out of cover every now and then.  They would end up dying foolishly and you'd have to break cover to revive them or mission failure.But to sum it all up.  This is exactly what I've wanted out of a FPS single player campaign.  Everything was presented beautifully.  There was a decent selection of weapons to keep the shooting interesting and a story that above all else makes the game stand out far above a lot of other FPS campaigns and is something that I would whole heartedly recommend to almost any FPS fan.

												A gamers must read as it were, it is so impactful and horrific that I often bring it up as an example of what video game stories can be. I played a demo for this game at pax east and left thinking it was nothing more than a 3rd person shoot the brown people game. I could not of been more worng. It teaches you a less in blood and ash that is impossible to forget. The highway to hell as it were is in fact a stairway. Each step on it seems more and more important and needed. You justify each and every transgretion in your own way. Further and further you go down the stairs until you look up and see the mountain of your sins behind you. There, you must ask the queston, could you ever even redeem yourself from that mountain or will it hang over you always.Play this game, I cannot say it simply enough and like anything good you will wisfuly think about it years later.

The Gameplay is very railroady but that does not mean it is disappointing.Vault from cover to cover in third person mowing down your enemies with a variety of weapons.Unfortunately, you can only equip two weapons at a time, this leads to having to decide carefully before proceeding, as if you run out of ammo you are screwed. What makes the campaign interesting are the difficult ethical choices it forces upon you, and the realization that you may not be the good guy afterall... but are you?Do you feel like a Hero Yet?

												Great storyline as well as gameplay. It is fun to click and pop heads in this Third-person shooter and it contains a really sad truth about war.Not gonna spoil much but this game will definitely make you feel like a horrible person. The challenge in changing the difficulty (especially FUBAR) really put me on edge on how carefully I should time,move from cover to cover and shoot even thought it is kinda anooying to die over 50 times. Little details I noticed as well were put into this game, for example, the image of the main menu screen changing as you progress the following chapters and how your characters' gear, mental stability and how badly wounded they are increases as you near the end of the game piqued my interest. In conclusion, this game is definitely a (+) to me.			"

												This game starts out as your typical first person shooter and quickly evolves into a memorable immersive experience. You will begin questioning if your doing the right thing or not. You will slowly learn what it means to be a true solder and experience the difficult decisions in front of you. And the many dead bodies you leave behind.This game is very story driven. It shows how war can change a person and make them question reality. By the end of the game I was stunned by the ending and even after playing it through a second time my feelings didn't change. If you want a regular FPS get something like CoD or Battlefield. If you want something that you wont forget and will tug your mind in different directions get this!			"

												This game is absolutely amazing and has one of the best storyline I have ever came across in any video games. Make sure you pay attention to the dialogues as the game progresses, as not fully understanding the backstory or one event in a chain may drastically hamper the feelings of what the story is trying to push onto you. In my opinion, it's far more important than the gameplay at times in order to get the most of this game because of so. The plot development is very well thought out and unpredictable, and the chain of events plus the sudden twist near the end will really make you think deeply once the game concludes. A lot of the cutscenes in the game are not like typical ones you'd find in modern shooters, as they were made to emphesize the emotions felt by the characters as well as passing it to you. A movie should be made based on the plot of this game, as there hasn't been much military movies made with plot that will make you feel emotional about what the mental torments the soldiers have to go through.

												My overall experience of the game was great. 9/10Moral Choices: There were some choices in the game, but a bit difficult to actually notice them or understand how to make the choice for a couple of them.Story: Was alright, not entirely easy to follow and the end is a bit of a mind♥♥♥♥.Graphics: Some cheap explosive effects from cannisters, and the sandstorms could have used a little polishing.  Other than that the graphics were fantastic, they paid a decent amount to minor details such as injuries and bandaging them up as the game goes along.Guns: There was a decent variety, but I mostly stuck to the starting weapons, the pistol had amazing accuracy and stopping power, and the rifle had little kickback.Controls: Pretty good with some dashing/sprinting exceptions. IE: Trying to manuever around and taking cover on a column was tough.  Also the toggle mode for sprint was annoying as hell, holding it down and letting go would have been much better.AI: The AI was decent, but at some points there were glaring issues and oddities in their behaviour.  Not enough to detract too much from the gameplay.Some of what these guys were wearing made absolutely no sense for a desert. IE: A super heavy suit of armorDifficulty: Played it on the 2nd hardest mode, felt it was mostly well balanced.Theres a difficuly spike towards the end, which I found very frustrating.I don't think the game was done justice, for my first over the shoulder ""FPS"" I was quite pleased with it.

Good mecanics and fun banter between the characters etc.Then a sudden turn happens and from there on you're forced to question not only the characters but your own morality.Never has a shooter made me feel this way. So much so that at a certain point in the game I put my pad down and thought ""I don't want to do this anymore"" Shooters do not normally do this so cudos to the makers of this game!Easily a 10/10 from me!

												Spec Ops: The Line, man oh man was that a great game.  While the game was a very generic third person shooter, it had an amazing story, very similar to Heart of Darkness or Apocalypse Now.   You see the transformation of a man into a monster as he makes his way through the game, and sometimes you fell really bad about some of the things that go down.   The Sandstorm and falling sand concept was interesting, though not much of a game changer.  Mutliplayer however is dead, I think I've managed to play five games the entire time I've owned it, and three of them were a friend and I against one random who popped into the game.  So the game looks good, plays well but bland, but its the story that keeps you hooked.  Don't bother with multiplayer unless you have some friends who might be kind enough to play with you.  I'd say this game is a 9/10 in my eyes, and yes this game has a few flaws, but its nothing game breaking, and to some people they might not even be flaws.  So I would recommend picking this game up, it isn't much since its been out for a while, or get it when it comes on sale, you won't regret it, and you'll get your money's worth out of it.  K thanks.			"

PROS:+ cool gameplay feel+ really awesome story+ big variety of weapons+ enviromental tactics+ multiple endings+ atmosphere and look of apocalyptic DubaiCONS:- somewhat linear levels- standard shooting without any inovation- multiplayer is badComment:The gameplay is great, while the levels are linear there is still room for you to choose your tactic and at the very least each level plays differently. You have to use tactics, whether it is the enviroment or your squadmates, you will need both. The game is fun just on the gameplay aspect itself. But the story, holy bonkers, the story is great. Not going to spoil anything but simply put this starts as your usual middle-east shooter and ends, well, somewhere else. And has different outcomes dependant on your choice. How to describe this game to give it justice ...well ... this is a fantastic piece of video game art!			"

												This game has terrible gameplay, but an ok story. Although it becomes a bit ridiculously moralistic towards the end, chastising you in loading screens for killing American soldiers and doing other acts necessary to complete the game. The attack on the on-rails jingoistic pro-American rail 'modern military' arcade shooter is welcome, but attacking the player for just playing the game that he paid for is a bit silly and out of place.

If your someone who is into a strong cerebral military style story line aka apocalypse now. then you will greatly enjoy this.

												If you haven't played it yet, I suggest you do, as it has the greatest story ever written in my opinion.  While it's multiplayer may not be the best, it is the single player that it was made for.The game tricks you by making it look like a Call of Duty clone in the third person, but it than hits you with something that you never see in games.  The US Soldiers as the villians.  As you journey, the game shows you many of the terrible things that is happening, even showing you what you have done in a scene so full of emotion, that it should go down as one of the greatest scenes in gaming.  The further you go, the more your character becomes more violent, showing what war does to soldiers.  Soon you feel conflicted, as you don't want to kill the enemy, but you must... because you are the hero.  Than it wraps up with an ending that you will never see coming.  In the end, you are left with your thoughts, with the credits rolling, and asking yourself this ""Am I doing this in every FPS and TPS I play?""If that doesnt get you to buy the game, I don't know what will.  This game gets an 9/10, only because of one major plothole in the game, and the floaty controls.			"

												Unique TPS with good gameplay mechanics, an apocalypse-now type story and an excellent setting.Good♥♥♥♥♥♥+The setting is one of my favourites so far in gaming. Think a creative, beautiful and post apocalyptic Dubai.+Story is interesting and different than the norm with subtle clues and interesting decisions.+Gameplay mechanics worked well for me, but not for some. It's mainly a cover based shooter.+Style, sounds, weapons and music. The main title has (I think) Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix playing.+Melee finishers on downed enemies work nicely. No instant takedowns.+Multiplayer is actually pretty good. There's free co-op to but I havn't tried it yet.+(MINOR SPOILER) As the story progresses your character's finishing moves and ""taunts"" get more brutal. Nice touch.Don't feel right: -The shooting can get somewhat repetetive as there is not a lot of variation in what you can do.-Little replay value unless you want the story again from a more understanding perspective.Conclusion:The game is solid and of appropriate length for a shooter. I'm glad they didn't drag it out unecessarily and that the gameplay mechanics are of good quality. Nothing ruins immersion and good story like bad gameplay. Sadly the story didn't get a hold of me emotionally as it did for some, I really wish I could get into it but I just couldn't get real emotion from it as a whole. Certain parts got to me a little but not overwhelmingly. Still, it was a very satisfying take on one of my favourite tales: man goes into darkness and creates his own vision of society. Certain parts of the story/ending confused me a little but the whole thing is up to interpretation and certainly worth venturing into. Games like Far Cry 3, The Last of Us (especially), Mass Effect series and MGS series are examples of what engaged me emotionally. It's unfortunate that this did not but I still loved the experience and was always eager to play on and uncover the story unfolding. Maybe I've played too many shooters and become a little detached, who knows? Throughout the story you will get to make a few moral decisions but I won't say any more on that.Anyway, I'd give it a 9/10 easily, a full 10 if it had increased combat options/variation. I'm not gonna mark it down for failing to grab me as it did for others, however, as it deserves praise nonetheless.			"

												Cover based third person shooter set in a sand-covered Dubai, the gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing very different.  The beginning is a tad slow, but that's alright.  The thing that makes Spec Ops: The Line so incredible is the story.  A story that focuses on the horrors of war and violence.  You'll be forced to do horrible things, and make horrible choices. If you're looking for a multiplayer game, you probably won't want this.  If you're looking for a game with a fantastic story, this is it.  When it's all over, and the sand settles, all you'll be able to think is ""Dear God...what have I done?"".Highly recommended.			"

The controls differ from ""standard"" first person shooter controls, and taking cover is pretty clunky.  If you can tolerate those mild inconveniences, I entirely recommend this one.			"

												The gameplay is decent (a competent cover based shooter) but it's the atmosphere and story that sell this one. Acting as a modern Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now, the game forcees you to question your actions and morality in a way no other title has.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a reboot of the old Spec Ops franchise which last game was released a decade ago. Despite being lauded for its ""accurate"" portrayal of the military life, The Line still plays like your typical third person cover shooter.Its cookie cutter mechanics aside, one thing The Line will certainly be remembered for is its dark and gripping plot. The player assumes the role of Captain Walker, one of three Delta Force soldiers tasked with locating a missing battalion.On top of the many twists and turns, the game will also ask the player to make several moral choices. Unfortunately, these moments are far in between, even in a game as short as 6 to 7 hours, and their impacts aren't played out to their fullest potential.In a game where the biggest threat comes from American soldiers and civilians, Spec Ops: The Line bends the expectation of modern shooters. Sadly, with its short campaign, subpar mechanics and dead multiplayer, full price is a tad too much.Grade: B-			"

												Gameplay is bland and mediocre, since everything it does HAS and WILL be done (I honestly thought we evolved beyond turret sections, but I was mistaken) and it's pretty short (took me about 8 hours in total on hard mode in my first playthrough). But the story is good; there are a few really good moments that simulate PTSD in your character, and the protagonist slowly grows a beard throughout the game. The multiplayer, as described by the lead designer Cory Davis, is a ""low-quality Call of Duty clone in third-person"" and a ""waste of money."" I played one match with a total of 4 people (including myself) and it crashed mid-match. I was never able to join a second one.			"

												Got this during the 2k bundle sale for $6. Would easily have paid full price and given it a 10/10.The corrupted morality and very dark look at PTSD that this game offers developed a story that you won't find in your modern shooter powerhouses like COD or BF.The gameplay itself is mediocre, even though there is definite satisfaction in taking down enemies.Commit to the story and this game will take you to places you didn't think still existed in video games. Excitement, shock, horror, and a not so happy ending.10/10 - Story/Plot7/10 - Game Play & Mechanics9/10 - Graphics10/10 - Dialogue10/10 - Overall, would recommend to anyone who gets immersed in story and plot.

												Spec Ops: The Line. Praised for the wrong reasons, bashed for the wrong reasons. As someone who took the time to complete all achievements in this game, I think I can safely say it has a special place in my heart. So maybe I'm biased. Oh well. Look, there's more to this game than the infamous scenes you probably know about by now. The game's so much more interesting in its subtle elements and references to previous works of literature or film. Look, just play The Line. Or don't. Some people played it and thought it was a pretentius piece of crap. Well, they're kind of right. It tries too hard sometimes. But for some reason, I can't keep forgetting about this little game. Something about it just feels... right to me. Maybe it's the 33rd's interesting personalities. Maybe it's the great music. Maybe it's the feeling of ""what just happened?"" you'll often experience.

												Brilliant game, wonderful and insightful commentary on the tropes of first person shooters and the morality of conflict as a whole. By the end of the game, I was hating myself for what had simply seemed natural at the time.Let me qualify this, however, by saying that the game does box you into some of the ""choices"" you make. Where the game's intended plotline does not coincide with your actual wishes, there's a distinct dissonance that can lead to blaming the game rather than yourself, as I think was probably intended.Addionally, the gameplay was rather frustrating and not very well designed. I would often end up repeating certain segments again and again simply because of lack of cover, clunky controls, or unclear sources of damage. One segment, in which there was a helicopter shooting in through a window that had to be avoided, I ended up repeating over and over simply because I couldn't tell where it was shooting (where I could run) and nothing seemed to be working. In the end, I got through by pure chance. Also, these sections would frequently be in the vicinity of a cutscene (which would have to be rewatched every time), or at least take a rather large amount of time to reload, which contributed to an overall feeling of extreme frustration at times.Overall, do play this game, and do try to play it through to completion, but perhaps choose one of the easier difficulties to avoid the experience being ruined by poor gameplay design.

												If you want a great single player experience, this really is a great game for that.Spec Ops The Line may look like your standard 3rd person shooter. In many ways, it is. However, this is somewhat deliberate due to the context of the game being a gritty, dark game in a unique setting that makes you question everything about shooters such as these.This is a game that reminds you the reality of war compared to war in video games. In many games, you gun through loads of enemies because thee game told you to without thinking why. This game makes you think why.  In many games, you're a hero that saves the  day. This game makes you think what makes you that hero. The game beats you up for doing tthings that it common practice in shooters, and really makes you think differently about modern day shooters we see all so much of. This is helped by some great voice acting and script work along with both subtle and shocking story devices that make this game feel unique. The story has some shocking moments that you'll want to experience for yourself. Those looking for a rich gameplay experience or a multiplayer masterpiece or even a game that makes you feel good for being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that kills more people than he saves may want to go elsewhere. Those looking for a unique story and setting with developed characters and good enough gameplay that questions everything in the shooter genre to date, this game is for you.			"

												Fantastic game that i have finished in two sittings today, kept me hooked with excellent gunplay and story telling. Guns feel weighty and have some nice recoil. The music soundtrack is fantatsic and utilised perfectly at the right times. The scripting, voice acting,  gun and all round sound design is just superb. Funny how the titles that seem to basically go unnotcied these days always end up impressing me the most. Only 5 hours so maybe best to purchase in a sale but really the work that went into this, having played this now, i can say it's worth it. Nice use of the Unreal Engine aswell at times with some nice eye candy. First game i have completed aswell in a day for a long long time.AI also desreve a big mention as they are what made it enjoyable for me. They flank and try to flush you  out with grenades if you try and hamper down too long. They also try to move if you pin them down and will jump away from nades. They still do dumb stuff every now and then, but 90% of the time they are actually really aggressive and realistic.			"

												This game isn't GOTY by any means, at least not on modern terms anyway.This game isn't a fully-grown RPG or a thoroughly made shooter either. It's mechanics in both shooting and plot advancement are somewhat bulky and unfinished, and you will have to deal with it while playing all the time.This very game, however, excels at telling a story like few games I could recall over the last decade. Its story is grim, plainly simple and unhappy. The story isn't precisely original or ground-breaking, but you will not predict it all the way. And it'll take your breath away from time to time like rarely before.You will enter Dubai and perish there. There is no other choice, and you will understand why.			"

												First, let me point out the things I didn't enjoy about the game. It's a corridor shooter where every event is scripted; you have little control over the development of the story, though you do have to make some decisions along the way. The game has a lot of cut-scenes and provides few challenges, other than just shooting people. There are not really any puzzles and the game points you to every direction you need to go. The controls can also be awkward at times, for example you cannot leap over a tiny obstacle, but move slightly and you'll be able to jump over the taller part of the obstacle. However, I did enjoy the game. The story is good, and it just keeps getting better and better throughout the game. I also really enjoyed the voice acting of the game and character development. If you like third-person corridor shooters, this is definitely a game worth your time.			"

Another good point is that the various choices you have to make are integrated in the continous flow of the gameplay instead of pausing the story at a junction waiting for you to decide. Something else I really liked was the change of the behavior and mental state of the characters as the story progresses which helps even more with the immersion.			"

												I went into this game thinking I'd get a mindless third-person Call of Duty that I could play every once in a while when I'm bored.Boy was I wrong.Graphics are pretty good, especially lighting-effects, the fire and shadows look amazing and even though you're walking through sand the whole time. You get enough variety in the colors and set-dressing that it doesn't get boring.Some things that need to be fixed on the Linux version though:-Even when it's installed on an SSD there are multiple moments where the game freezes for several seconds in every level, usually when it's saving, which is pretty annoying. Other than that the performance is good (constant 60+FPS at max settings with a 560TI and a Core 2 Quad)-If you have two monitors the game seems so only start on the left one unless you put ""--eon_force_display=1"" into your launch-options but even then it will start with the resolution of the left monitor, so you have to disable or unplug it, which is annoying.-I got less than one FPS when enabling VSYNC, meaning the game would freeze for several seconds even in the main menu.I haven't tried the game on Windows, but I'm pretty sure those issues aren't present there. The port is very new and I'm sure these issues will be fixed very quickly.			"

Only every 15 minutes or so, the action stops, zooms in on one of the bodies and a voiceover comes on, telling you all about his parents, childhood dreams, and the 2 kids and cancer stricken wife he's left behind. And every time it ends with ""and we wouldn't have had to kill this guy if it wasn't for you and your sick entertainment habits. You horrible, ♥♥♥♥ing monster, stop enjoying war."" This game doesn't hold your hand, it doesn't make you feel self-rightous for playing the hero. It just tosses you a gun, throws you into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation, and actually makes you feel for what's going on. You will not find another modern warfare game that dares make you think this hard, or even at all, about what it is you're actually ""enjoying"" doing. If you play games just for a bit of fun, move along. But if you think that gaming can tell affecting stories just as well if not better than other mediums, you have to pick this game up.			"

												This game ruined other games. Itis one of the few games I have thought about long after completing it. In favt, it is more like an experiment than a game. Play it through to the end then play it through a second time. It will make you hate yourself and question why you play games. 10/10 - Grab it on special and sink a rainy day into exploring your psyche :)			"

												I got this game on sale expecting it to be a typical third person shooter. This game has by far one of the most believable characters and this game gives you the strongest sense of agency. I'll admit the ""stealth"" sections were a little bit unclear, but this game is fantastic and deserves to be played.			"

												I can say, its definitely a game I really recommend to play, yet the game I don't want people to play. The Line really let oneself immersed into its deep and very much engaging story (too engaging, perhaps) while gives a realistic feedback on every action we choose.The story, perhaps, the greatest element in the game. The way its unravel, while keeping the Heart of Darkness inspiration, really push it. It really makes me think twice on the options I chosen. Its, too great to say it.In the end, it makes one wonder oneself on our own very morality. After all, sometimes in life, we have a clear line that we shouldn't cross.

												Let me start off with this important fact; this game is NOT fun. It is incredibly gripping, and engaging as all hell, but it is not fun. This is intentional, and it is a FANTASTIC decision by Yager. If you're looking for a millitary shooter wherein the multiplayer is used to put the campaign in passanger seat, this is not what you want. This game's campaign is the entire focus, there is a multiplayer mode, and it is entertaining, it's a distant second to the amazing piece of work that the campaign is. This is a shooter that manages to deliver on an absolutely astounding narrative and succeeds in critically examining the reasons we play these military shooters as frequently as we do. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.			"

												This game is tedious, annoying, frustrating and simply not much fun.And that's what makes it so great.""What?"" You might be asking yourself. What makes a tedious, unfun game so great? Is it some kind of ""So bad it's good"" kind of thing? Absolutely not, it was made this way intentionally, and for very good reasons. Spec Ops: The Line is very much like Schindler's List. You're not supposed to feel good about it once you've gone throught he story.The real problem with reviewing a game like this is that, without giving out spoilers, it's impossible to find a way to say, ""Ya, play it guys, seriously!"" Without some kind of attempt to list out what makes this game special, all I can say is, ""The gameplay is lackluster, there are obvious monster closets, the AI is horrid and the multiplayer should have just been ignored entirely. I totally recommend this, 8/10."" And that comes off as just strange.So, to try and do this without spoiling too much (and if I do, I apologize for the unintentional spoil), Spec Ops is less a game and more a thematic deconstruction and criticism of modern military shooters. And by deconstruction, I mean a total, across the board deconstruction. The game goes all-in on many gaming tropes and points out various areas that could easily use improvement or development into a generally quality mechanic and also makes it a point to deconstruct the players who play military shooters themselves.The following topics are given a deep insight:- The player's relationship with the main character- Who really controls who? Does the player control the character or is the game controlling the player?- The effects of dehumanizing the enemy on a person and, by extension, the player- Tedious gameplay that highlights the effects and shock of what people experience in combat- Moral ambiguity and a lack of any real clear ""good"" or ""evil"" in the game- Demonstratably real effects of cognitive dissonance experienced by returning soldiers suffering PTSD- The illusion of choice in video games- How easy it is to convince people to blame others for ""forcing"" them into choices they don't have to makeA particular poignant point takes part in the final acts of the game where the game questions if you, the player, are beyond help and are incapable of seeing what's beyond Call of Duty and its clones and pre-emptively telling anyone that scores the game low due to monster closets and tedious third person cover shooting mechanics that they completely missed the point and are beyond help.Everything about the game is designed as intentional and develops a deep experience that's difficult to find in gaming. While games like The Stanley Parable do a good job parodying the insanity of player choice, it fails to truly get the player to stop and think about it, let alone cast a wide net over the entire first person shooter genre and intelligently question nearly every gameplay mechanic, enemy AI complexity, faceless enemy syndrome, plot decisions and concept of legitimate choice.If it wasn't for the deliberate end-game reveal, various load screen quotes and even the changing menu screen graphic, I would have simply thrown this game to the side as some kind of boring, derivitive shooter trying to be macho. But everything about this game is lovingly intentional, from the three man squad with token black man explosive expert and wisecracking white guy to wave after endless wave of idiot enemy. The whole game exists as a critique of the FPS genre, the games industry and the players themselves. And it's not a caustic, nasty critique, but one that asks us to think why we suffer through these mechanics and why we don't demand improvement or something better. Even using the fact that this game can be called ""Spec Ops 11"" is deep in and of itself since using a brand new IP would have missed out on critically adressing the excessive sequelitis that the gaming industry is stuck in.Spec Ops: The Line is a bad and tedious game, but it's meant to be, and with the plot and decisions made within the game itself turns it into a brilliant commentary on what has happened to the games industry and the modern games consumer. I highly recommend you experience it in full to understand for yourself what's happening. It's a game that needs to be played since those Let's Play videos will do it a disservice as your active participation is necessary to get the complete experience as to what Yaeger is attempting to tell us all.And I thank Yaeger for making me think.The gameplay is lackluster, there are obvious monster closets, the AI is horrid and the multiplayer should have just been ignored entirely. I totally recommend this, 8/10.			"

												One of the best games I ever played. Not very outstanding gameplay but still much fun at high difficulty. The Story is mind-melting and goes under your skin, [spoileri]though there should have been more diversity about your choices and how they really matter. Even though I understand  the devs message behind making them having often the same outcome.[/spoileri] Overall a splendid gem in story-telling. Its sad that YAEGER wont do games like that anymore, since it was at first a commercial failure, which in my opinion was not the game's fault but 2k games greed (hence the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer that wasnt even meant to be implemented in the game), and a bad marketing strategy. It would have been more popular if they wouldnt have it agressively marketed a an obvious anti war shooter, but just made it a little more subtle. "

												This game is one of the diamonds in the ocean of coal for its genre. I am personally not in to modern military. However I do play Counter Strike I never was one to buy Call of Duty for a campaign, or any shooting game in general. This one has a excellent story, and it leaves you feeling as if it was crafted with much care. This is a third person shooter instead of a FPS. Again, this has never been my forte. However they do the third person shooting so well compared to generic TPS. That it felt very fluent and was actually made the game. if you are a modern military story fan, get this.If you are a third person shooter fan get this.For everyone who is like me that usually avoids those genre like the plague.I suggest to at least try it, because I was thoroughly surprised with the experience I was given.

He and his squad are tasked with searching for any survivors left in Dubai, after receiving a message from Colonel John Konrad detailing his failed attempt at evacuating the city. Walker shows great respect for Konrad and expresses strong feelings of trust towards him throughout the game.As the game progresses, Walker's mental stability slowly begins to deteriorate under the pressure of his actions within Dubai.-Choices matter but does not have a big impact SPOILER ALERT   No spolilers here!

												In my opinion this is such an underrated game - I hardly knew about it until a month after it released after stumbling across it in a shop. I bought the Xbox 360 version and I loved it; it has a really dark and gritty tone to it and the story made me keep coming back to it. Gameplay can be said to be generic, but your AI squadmates are perfectly fine and can handle themselves, although the squad mechanic does come in handy in tough situations.If this game is on sale, buy it. If not, buy it. And then question your morality after you've played it.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line, to me, is an underrated game because it tells one hell of a story. While it doesn't offer a lot of innovation in terms of gameplay, the story truly makes up for everything it lacks. Set in a future, sand-ridden Dubai, you and your 2 Delta Force comrades are sent in to investigate the disappearance of a group of U.S. soldiers stationed in Dubai. What you and your team discover is something darker than expected and nothing ever goes the way you want it to. The way this game delivers the story is truly fantastic and story is truly gritty and will leave thinking about certain aspects in life. If you ever want a modern 3rd person shooter with a great story, get Spec Ops; you won't be disappointed. The gameplay is similar to many 3rd person shooters but like I stated previously, it's the story that makes this game truly shine.			"

												Apocalypse Now:  DubaiThe combat is solid enough, controls are slightly strange but entirely passable.   I'm not personally a fan of games on rails but this one is a decent roller coaster ride that makes the rails a bit more acceptable for me.Enemies react to being shot in limbs appropriately and shotguns feel great, which is honestly a rarity in games.  The game gives a lot of forced prompts for commands and actions you have to or are only capable of doing at those moments which is strange and irritating.  The giant flashing prompts on the screen forcing your hand really take you out of the immersion of the story, which could be pretty good if the prompts didn't reinforce an arcade shooter feel.  The cover system is done fairly well, although i found myself fighting with the controls in many instances because it's just a few slight changes from what standard shooters bring you to expect.I have run into some instances where invisible barriers would block my shots and they threw in the generic heavily armored (Commonly known as bulldozer) type unit who can be frustrating to an extreme when most enemies react appropriately, a sticky grenade or an RPG on his facemask will do little more than break the mask off and stun him.  The bare face of his still requires significant amounts of shots to kill him with any weapon despite being unarmored which means damage is based on body parts and not types of armored cover.  In a shooter, this can be pretty irritating but expected from the lazier ones, so it might not bother other people as much.Ammo can be quite scarce for you and you alone as your team mates have unlimited ammo, dreadful aim, and unlimited grenades but can only be used in designated situations or of their own personal choosing.  They also pick their own cover in your general area which can occasionally put them on the wrong side of it, forcing your hand to go save them in the open during a bad enough situation to get them downed.  I haven't tried the Multiplayer or Co-Op yet so I can't comment on those.Combat  7/10Story      7/10Controls 6/10Visuals   7/10Docking score for the excessive HUD prompts and the heavily armored Bulldozer unit because those are just lazy, especially considering the environment.I'd have to give the game a 6/10 overallThe game is good for a few bucks, I would recommend it if you can catch it on a decent sale.

												Spec Ops: The Line offers a campaign of approximately 8 hours in length when you play on the two hardest difficulties or about 18 hours if you seek to get all the achievements. I found the story engagging and thought provoking. The difficulty for this game is perfect but ultimately felt gamey as enemies shoot about enough lead to sink a large warship. I did not experience multiplayer as it appears to be dead at the time of this review. It looks to be a tack on that has nothing to do with the campaign anyway.Gameplay mechanics are solid offering a 3rd person shooter with a cover system. It is key to use this system in order to excel at the game so there really isn't any option to play differently. Ammunition is scarce enough that you must rely on accuracy and making your shots count. Your two squadmates that you work with are able to be given attack commands unless you are in the middle of a standstorm with them or seperated.I experienced no technical difficulties and no crashes whatsoever which is way too rare nowdays. Performance is superb; experienced no framerate issues or laggy input.			"

												Well, I finished this game almost at once, so we can kinda say it sucked me in. Let's start with a little summary of the game.Spec Ops: The Line is a rather linear TPS with a couple of places you can make your own decision between♥♥♥♥♥♥ and even bigger♥♥♥♥♥♥ And you'll feel♥♥♥♥♥♥in the end. The story:Delta Force sent to Dubai for a recon mission that quickly turns into a rescue mission, then into a ""shoot everything that moves"" mission. It gets confusing at times, but the end (which I won't spoil you) helps. It's...not what you'd expect. You start out as your standard US Soldier shooter with the grizzled veterans shouting commands, shooting baddies, being badass, but that quickly turns around. You are just a piece of the chess game of the forces behind the scenes. To give credit to the game, the story of Dubai getting hit by sandstorms, and getting Fallout'd is rather cool. And the visuals match, but bit later about that.Through the game I felt I was playing a TV series. Heck, it'd make a bloody good mini-series - about 6 episodes or so. The characters are good, and while not overdetailed, they do their job. And when I finished it, I felt like after a good TV show or movie. It left satisfied, but somehow empty. The conversions are awesome. I had a few laughs, but the interactions between the characters never went over the top, and kept me interested throughout the story. Nobody felt flat or uninteresting, so that's a pretty good thing too.Overall, 8/10. I had little to no expectations, but left with something I won't forget soon.Gameplay:It's a rather standard TPS with a decent selection of firearms. You get Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Pistols, SMGs, LMGs, and so forth. Most of them has a secondary mode, which is to say switch the sniper rifle's zoom (from 8x to 16x), or put a sound suppressor to the M4A1. It's fun, and while the diversity forces you to either be a really accurate shooter, or switch your weapons frequently. Ammo boxes scattered around the maps help you. The cover system while sometimes tad awkward, is good. Made me think of Mass Effect. In every section you can find pieces of intels - a great way for knowing the backstory a bit better, and adds to the overall feel to the game. You'll be more disturbed after you find them fo' sure. Sometimes they are at obvious places, but you gotta look for the to find all.The game is rather linear, but with a game like this, it's not much of a problem. I wouldn't list this as a pro, but neither as a con. It's just linear and that's it. 7/10 - you'll remember the game for the story, as the gameplay is, while rather flowing, brings nothing new.The visuals:Like in my Sleeping Dogs review (which you probably haven't read, but I like to mention my other written stuffs), I have to state I don't have the full specifics to play the game on High graphics. I went with medium, and it ran with about 30 fps. For me, it's solid, and the game, while not gorgeous, it looked good. The Sandstorm'd Dubai (which is almost Darude, but let's stay away from memes for a second) looks good. It's pretty detailed, and I never got bored of the environment. It wasn't exactly the same as far as I recall, and fighting on the top of a skyscraper is a nice change after eating sand on ground level. It matched the game, so I'm fine with it as is.Overall a 8/10.Sounds:Okay, this is awesome. The mad DJ with the hits of the 80s that he plays seemingly random, the ambient music, and the OST for the game is AWESOME. Fitting, believable, and you'll feel that it gives a lot to the game. You'll eventually search for the OST on Youtube, and save it to listen later. It's really good. Kudos to the composer.10/10Overall I'd give this game a 8.5 out of 10, totally worth playing, and totally worth your money. Be aware of the graphic images of gore, death, and the feeling of emptiness and guilt after you've finished the game, regardless of your choices.			"

												Nolan North voicing the main character is a strong selling point in this game. As tired as I am of 1st Person militaristic shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, with all their awestruck destruction and ""omg"" comradery moments, it's a tired genre. Well this is a 3rd person action adventure game with incredibly well done sand effects that apply to combat. Like shooting a glass ceiling and watching the sand envelop your enemies. Fighting in sandstorms provides intense drama during the impaired visibility. This game takes you on a journey, both storywise and comraderywise with your two cohorts. There's moments that blur the lines between right and wrong and survival and completing the mission. The lines really blur when you fight American troops because they shoot at you first. Trying to figure out what happened before the sandstorm took down Dubai and where all the survivors and the troops are, is so intense.			"

												Eh, sh*t.Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai.FFS stop reading about this game and get it/play it.Yeah it's cover based third person modern military shooter but it's subversive and a genre deconstruction piece focused on STORY so even if you think you don't like the genre, play it anyway. This is rather important piece of video game history if you want to be well-versed in more artsy aspects of the industry.Unless you hate well crafted story and seeing how gameplay can meld well together with what authors try to convey/the narrative.

												8/10Although the game is kinda short (it took me ~6 hours to complete at one of the higher difficulty settings) it is defniteley worth checking out and is IMO the best military shooter out there right now. Gameplay: Standard cover based shooting as we all know it from Unchated, GOW or Max payne 3. Nothing special but it is fun and works almost flawless.Story: It is the story the stands out the most in SO:the Line and is what seperates this game from other modern shooters. Games such as BF, COD or Medal of Honor often try to show the cruelty of war but always fail to do that. But SO:The Line differs from those games because it takes it's time and let you soak in the atmosphere. Scenes like walking through a mass grave or an execution give you goose bumps. Also the characters are well written and voiced. "

												What drew me initially to this game was the fact that it is indeed an offical part of the ""Spec Ops"" series (As in ""Spec Ops: Rangers Lead The Way"" and ""Spec Ops: Ranger Elite"", two of my favorite old school tactical third person shooters). I did some research, and the buzz/hype around the story for this game caught me off guard, as the older titles were not particularly known for their storylines, but instead for their difficult and tactical gameplay. I gave in, and decided to buy it, and was most certainly NOT dissapointed. The story was absolutely incredible, and definitely deserved every bit of praise it's been given. For me personally, it was pretty mind blowing. The gameplay however, did not quite match up. The tactical shooter gameplay was almost non-existant, and was traded in for a more bog standard Gears-like style of cover based third person shooting. I do admit the combat was punchy, and satisfying, but definitely nothing too note worthy. It's also a very good looking game, with the destroyed city of Dubai still managing to be stunning, even in sand dune filled ruins. Definitely recommended!			"

												At a glance, you could easily dismiss this game as another generic military shooter. It is and it isn't. The mission structure is by the books Call of Duty style: move forward, stop, kill a million enemies, move forward a bit and do the same. However, what elevates it above other military shooters is the story.You're deployed to Dubai -- or what's left of it -- on a mission to locate survivors of a cataclysmic sandstorm. Simple enough, right? It would be, if not for the war raging within. As you explore the ruins of Dubai, questions are raised. How far is too far? Is the pursuit of your mission worth it, in spite of the casualties along the way?If a thought-provoking story is of interest to you, I strongly recommend Spec Ops. On the other hand, if you are simply looking to kill people with abandon, you're best to look elsewhere. Whilst the shooting is solid, it can't carry the game and actually becomes tedious towards the end. "

												8.2/10+ Interesting Story+ Amazing writing/script+ Great Characters and Nice Character Development + Engaging story that makes you feel emotionally involved+ You make decisions that affect outcomes+ Great Twist at the end+ Nice use of environments in play+ Different locations throughout Dubai that all are interesting- Some ""choices"" seem like you actually have no control- Nothing new with gameplay (Generic Third Person Shooter Gameplay)- Some controls were frustrating (ex. X [Gamepad] was used to get to cover AND to run)Overall Spec Ops: The Line was an interesting and engaging interactive cinematic experience. Spec Ops had the story of a big budget hollywood action movie, but also had the familiar third person shooter in it. The story kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting to know what happens next. At some parts Specs Ops was just another grindfest, but then again what sooter today isn't? Spec Ops did not have a huge selection of guns, which did not hurt the game at all. Instead of looking for the coolest weapon, you were looking for weapons to help you clear the level so you could find out what happens next. In conclusion Spec Ops: The Line is a great game that should not be missed out on due to the new emotional and mental take on war. The game will rank up there with my favorite games that would make me want to play again, to play the many different ending.P.S. The graphics for this game was pretty okay, nothing fancy, but nothing terrible. I put this at the end of my review as to not get this confused with pluses and minuses. I would NEVER include graphics as a means of judging a game.I hope you found this review helpful.			"

												Ok, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥  Its an over the shoulder third person squad shooter.  The controls are spot on ( i use x-360 gamepad) and the gameplay is a blend of shooting with some tactics and uses cover a lot.You get to order your other two squad members two basic commands, either focus fire (useful for heavly armorded targets) or stun grenade targetes.  You can also order them to move to different locations to flank enemies which is important if you are pinned down by a machine gun.  Overall their AI is pretty smart and they usually do fine on their own, providing you backup while you are the star.The best part of the game is the story and environment though.  The ruined city of Dubai has a life of its own, and even effects strategies to a certain extent.  The story shines and will really have you thinking and wanting to replay it to see just how your decisions during the game effect how things shape up.Graphics are really nice and ran flawlessly on my computer (nothig special here).  The sounds are realistic and high quality.I cant comment on the mulitplayer as I havent tried it yet, but I look forward to the co-op mode. "

												Spec Ops: The Line is really nothing at first glance. Any passerby would glance at this online and assume it to be a pseudo rip-off of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and subsequently Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, complete with a generic third person shooter element and cover system.And thus the game has already tricked you, the first of many narrative and visual tricks The Line will pull. Maybe as a gamer you don’t want to be tricked. You want to be entertained or praised. But there is none of that here. So why play this game? Because quite simply, love it or hate it, there is simply nothing quite like this.storySpec Ops: The Line opens generically enough. Nolan North voicing the gruff captain Martin Walker, leading a Delta team consisting of Lieutenant Adams and Staff Sergeant Lugo, ordered by the US Army to do recon and bring in John Konrad (one of many nods to Hearts of Darkness), commander of the 33rd Battalion, lost in Dubai after sandstorms destroyed the city. As Walker and his team traverse the desert, it soon becomes clear that not all is clear, and the lines of good and evil are blurred to a point where you, the player, will be questioning whether you’re doing the right thing.narrativeIt’s clear that the dark narrative mixed with sensational sound and voice acting meant that Yager Development (the developers) took an extra step in ensuring that the player was giving a harrowing and memorable experience that would leave you talking about it for years to come. Special props must be given to head writer Walt Williams, who provides a sensational story with huge mature undertones. If anything, The Line must be experienced for the story alone.graphicsIn terms of graphics, the sand-covered Dubai is quite a stunning vista. The towering skyscrapers all half buried in sand, the gorgeous backdrop that makes you feel like a tiny ant in a huge (linear) world and the graphic depictions of violence all lend a hand to the amount of immersion you would feel. In terms of violence, the game goes all in and really makes you question how much fun you’re really having, as you sickeningly pop another head in a cloud of red.For a graphics comparison, the PC version remains the slight winner, with sharper graphics all around, along with the standard freedom of tweaking for your personal rig. But the differences are honestly quite small and on any platform of your choice you’ll end up with the same experience.gameplayIn terms of gameplay, The Line remains painfully average, though this, like everything in the game, is for a reason. It’s an unremarkable third person shooter that you would have played in dozens of past games (Gears of War comes to mind immediately), complete with wonky cover system. The game gives you different weapons from rifles and pistols to shotguns and launchers to dispatch your foes in appropriately gruesome ways, as you slowly make your way through the corpses of the Damned 33rd.There is a ‘sand’ mechanic that honestly feels a little like a missed opportunity, where the sand of Dubai plays a big part in firefights. This comes in the form of sandstorms and sinkholes that change the dynamic of the battlefield, but these happen very rarely and in a strictly linear and scripted sense. It would’ve been nice to see a bit more random events thrown in.shootingThere are also random ‘moral’ choice events that come up every now and then that throw up an interesting thought. For fear of spoiling, they aren’t as black and white as you’d assume in normal games (Mass Effect or Bioshock comes to mind), but really just shades of dark and death, and they are never what they same. It’s a relief to see that acknowledgements were made to the gamer for thinking outside of the box, as there is always a ‘hidden’ option to choose, if you did not want to choose between two face options.The soundtrack lends a huge hand in The Line’s final presentation. The orchestral score blaring in the background as you conduct firefights is spectacular and the choices of classic rock songs gives off a sense of atmosphere and feeling that you are in a war. The music that accompanies the final few minutes in particular will send shivers up your spine and result in an ending that you will never forget.conclusionSpec Ops: The Line is really an unremarkable game on the surface, but below the surface is one of the best narratives you could ever experience. The Line is one of the most exciting things to happen to a ‘modern military shooter’ game in a very, very long time, and it is something that should be experienced, whether or not you’ll end up liking it. The Line is one of the best games of 2012, from a year of winners, and deserves to be played, even once.			"

												Beneath what's apparently yet another generic shooter, watch as a man suffers an ongoing mental breakdown - denying the harsh reality of a disaster so strongly that he hallucinates a more convenient one for himself, losing his mind and alienating everyone that used to trust him. A wonderful kick-in-the-teeth deconstruction of the gung-ho military shooter.Do you feel like a hero yet?			"

												Truly amazing. A third-person shooter with a realy good story. At first glance it can look as an ordinary shooter. But it's now the story is deep and dark, asking many difficult questions. A goory game that will make you thing about shooting other people. For the gameplay I like. Shooting is nice. The cover system could use some work and also ther is a fricking button for vault and mlee combat. Very many times you are just smacking the obstacle then jumping over it. Unfortunatly I didn't have pleasure to play Co-op. Also Multiplayer is dead :( ,so don't even think about playing realy. A big plus for me gets also the soundtrack that is switching on in some shootout's. Story is short it should take tou about 5-6 hours to complete (depending on the diffculty).Conclusion:+Ok shooting+Superb story and characters+Soundtrack+Varaitety of locations+Dubai-Cover system-Length-You can miss a lot of intresting backstory when you aren't collecting intel			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is really nothing at first glance. Any passerby would glance at this online and assume it to be a pseudo rip-off of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and subsequently Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, complete with a generic third person shooter element and cover system.And thus the game has already tricked you, the first of many narrative and visual tricks The Line will pull. Maybe as a gamer you don’t want to be tricked. You want to be entertained or praised. But there is none of that here. So why play this game? Because quite simply, love it or hate it, there is simply nothing quite like this.storySpec Ops: The Line opens generically enough. Nolan North voicing the gruff captain Martin Walker, leading a Delta team consisting of Lieutenant Adams and Staff Sergeant Lugo, ordered by the US Army to do recon and bring in John Konrad (one of many nods to Hearts of Darkness), commander of the 33rd Battalion, lost in Dubai after sandstorms destroyed the city. As Walker and his team traverse the desert, it soon becomes clear that not all is clear, and the lines of good and evil are blurred to a point where you, the player, will be questioning whether you’re doing the right thing.narrativeIt’s clear that the dark narrative mixed with sensational sound and voice acting meant that Yager Development (the developers) took an extra step in ensuring that the player was giving a harrowing and memorable experience that would leave you talking about it for years to come. Special props must be given to head writer Walt Williams, who provides a sensational story with huge mature undertones. If anything, The Line must be experienced for the story alone.graphicsIn terms of graphics, the sand-covered Dubai is quite a stunning vista. The towering skyscrapers all half buried in sand, the gorgeous backdrop that makes you feel like a tiny ant in a huge (linear) world and the graphic depictions of violence all lend a hand to the amount of immersion you would feel. In terms of violence, the game goes all in and really makes you question how much fun you’re really having, as you sickeningly pop another head in a cloud of red.For a graphics comparison, the PC version remains the slight winner, with sharper graphics all around, along with the standard freedom of tweaking for your personal rig. But the differences are honestly quite small and on any platform of your choice you’ll end up with the same experience.gameplayIn terms of gameplay, The Line remains painfully average, though this, like everything in the game, is for a reason. It’s an unremarkable third person shooter that you would have played in dozens of past games (Gears of War comes to mind immediately), complete with wonky cover system. The game gives you different weapons from rifles and pistols to shotguns and launchers to dispatch your foes in appropriately gruesome ways, as you slowly make your way through the corpses of the Damned 33rd.There is a ‘sand’ mechanic that honestly feels a little like a missed opportunity, where the sand of Dubai plays a big part in firefights. This comes in the form of sandstorms and sinkholes that change the dynamic of the battlefield, but these happen very rarely and in a strictly linear and scripted sense. It would’ve been nice to see a bit more random events thrown in.shootingThere are also random ‘moral’ choice events that come up every now and then that throw up an interesting thought. For fear of spoiling, they aren’t as black and white as you’d assume in normal games (Mass Effect or Bioshock comes to mind), but really just shades of dark and death, and they are never what they same. It’s a relief to see that acknowledgements were made to the gamer for thinking outside of the box, as there is always a ‘hidden’ option to choose, if you did not want to choose between two face options.The soundtrack lends a huge hand in The Line’s final presentation. The orchestral score blaring in the background as you conduct firefights is spectacular and the choices of classic rock songs gives off a sense of atmosphere and feeling that you are in a war. The music that accompanies the final few minutes in particular will send shivers up your spine and result in an ending that you will never forget.conclusionSpec Ops: The Line is really an unremarkable game on the surface, but below the surface is one of the best narratives you could ever experience. The Line is one of the most exciting things to happen to a ‘modern military shooter’ game in a very, very long time, and it is something that should be experienced, whether or not you’ll end up liking it. The Line is one of the best games of 2012, from a year of winners, and deserves to be played, even once.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but this game definitely deserves it.  In the beginning, it seems like some cheesy, cheap shooter with pretty decent graphics that is going to be mediocre.  It will feel like you are just running and gunning to rock music playing in the background, trying to make you look like a hard[butt].  The controls can also use some work because the character will do stuff you didn't intend for him to do.  But really soon you find out there is more to it then just that....you forget about the glitchy controls, you forget about the cheesy music and gameplay.  The game grows on you!Throughout the game you taken through the brutality of war, and its consequences.  You see the main characters change over time and see how the war plays a role on them.  Without spoiling anything else, I definitely recommend playing this game at least once! If not, twice or more!			"

One of the best games I have ever played.Spec Ops: The Line has one of the most intricate, ominous, and heart-wrenching storylines I have ever seen. Playing this game, you truly feel that every action you take has a lasting effect. With each ultimatum you face, it is difficult to decide between what is easy, what is ethical, and what is right; and it's even harder to decipher if you chose correctly.The gameplay, cinematics, and dialog throughout the game are incredibly immersive. You use your surroundings, you flank the enemies, you work together with AI teammates… When commanding my teammates to take out an imminent threat, I once heard the character shout, ""Take out that shotgunner on the stairs to the right!"" I couldn't have been more specific myself!I'm not sure I have ever been as captivated and emotionally tied as I have been while playing Spec Ops: The Line. Though the campaign goes quickly, I would HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone who could handle the intense story. It really does take you past the line you never thought you'd cross.			"

The game a pretty interesting story the gameplay made me think oh gears of war the way its setup almost. Its kinda almost like a phycological type of fps the game just plays with your mind and then it just explodes at the very end. As you get farther into the game you notice it has a darker sense too it instead of just going around kill ppl since you can make decisions at points in the game that have different effects on the gameplay.7.5/10 i would have to say.

												If you're looking for a new gaming experience then this isn't it. The gameplay is your standard cover based shooter format, you won't find anything that you haven't seen in hundreds of games before. Despite this Spec Ops: The Line stands out because of its story which will make you do a double take. The characters are voiced well and the dialogue is spot on giving the game more depth then the run of the mill shooter.At most you won't get more then two replays out of it. If you're considering picking it up I suggest waiting for it to go on sale and ignoring everything about it until you have finished a playthrough since if the story is spoiled the number one reason to purchase it is to.

												When I picked up this game, I thought I was buying another faceless brown-and-bloom military shooter on the cheap... you know, Call of Duty/Modern Warfare knock-off with a ruined Dubai gimmick.What I got was so much more. I wish I had purchased it at full price, because the developers deserve much more money than I gave them. This game was fantastic for the story alone. I can't give more detail without spoiling it, but with only a few games have I ever felt this affected or deeply moved by the gameplay. There's a lot of shooting and some of it is repetitive, but it's vastly over-shadowed by the narrative and it's damned beautiful the whole way through. If you haven't played it, I really recommend picking this game up immediately... it's SO much better than it lets on and one of the only games I've ever played that manages to prove its point through every facet of the gameplay.In fact, one of my favorite moments I've ever had in a game happened during one of The Line's loading screens... that's a tall feat, considering. It's that good.			"

												On the surface, this game looks like anyother war shooter. You're an American soldier tearing through enemy forces and trying to be the God dang hero! To be honest, Spec ops' gameplay doesnt add much when compared to other third person shooters. But this isnt a game about being a hero, this is a game about war , and in some sense, a game about games. A game that holds you accountable for every life you take, every action you chose, and makes you really think everytime you pull the trigger.  Spec ops adds a new deminsion to the War genre, and blurs the lines between good and evil, right and wrong, etc. As you play, you will begin to notice a twist in the games identity from generic war shooter, to horrific game depicting the harsh reprocusions of war. The character development in this game is unreal and is what really drives this game home. You will see the degredation of your squads morals, mental health, and humanity as they have to deal with the reprocusions of your actions. While the gameplay is somewhat lackluster, the story is truly the best part about this game, and i would easily recommend it to someone who is looking for one heck of a story, and a life ruining experience!

												Suicide Mission was chosen for my first run, and Fubar second time.No spoilers in this review, after all, there is no fun if you know any story of it before enjoying it.Compared with other shooting games, Spec Ops: The Line is not unique at all or even much more tedious about its gameplay. What players have to do is shoot targets, take cover from gunfire and  move on to a next point, continuously.Control is a bit clumsy, sometimes it may get you killed and repeating under some critical situations couple times. For instance, Sprinting to sandbags for cover, taking cover and vaulting through it, all of the movements do not seem to flow smoothly. Mere conditions that some spots look available to interact with, like beside a low closet of a bar table,  actually not for cover,  are annoying.Graphics is not that appealing even in 2012 , but it is still fine and acceptable. Personally, I like how the developer created the feel while a desert storm is striking. When headshots happen, there is a moment of slow motion effect. With some high-caliber rounded weapons, there is also a gore effect.Music is great, and some classic old rock songs are introduced as well.The essence of this game is about its storyline. I guess that is something worth playing, especially for players who have played lots of shooting games, shooting games especially like CODs. Spec Ops: The Line will definitely blow your mind and thought on shooting games.If you are an enthusiastic shoot'em up gamer and want something different, this game is absolutely for you.Strongly advised, do not read any articles related to its story before finishing the whole game.

												Behind the average cover-shooter gameplay of Spec Ops: The Line is one of the most amazing story-driven gaming experiences in recent memory. Memorable and complex characters with plenty of surprises kept me playing through the sometimes spotty cover system and difficulty spike toward the end of the campaign. I did not try out the multiplayer, but honestly, why bother? The story, not the gameplay, is this title's strength. Definitely worth purchasing when it's heavily discounted, which is pretty often.

												Игра сок,1) Графон просто топ.2)Сюжет настолько запутанный,что интересный,что проходишь на 1 дыхании.3)В этой игре вам придётся делать выбор.Да,игра не идеальна и есть свои недостатки:1)Мультиплеер мёртв,так как игре 5 лет.Я думаю,что это ед. минус.Я рекомендую данную игру,так как сам проходил её 5 раз на макс. сложностях.Игру я запомнил надолго.Она окупит все потраченные 650р.

												Awesome Game AND NOT TOO LONGNow.....either I am a complete Psychopath or too Pragmatic. I never made a decision in this game I didn't feel was justified when the ""greater good"" is taken into account.  Having said that I feel compelled to play through it again just to be sure I didnt miss something or ignore that I might be missing something ie. My Humanity.Put it another way (and I say this with Dark Humour)...either most people who played this needed to Harden The F8%K Up or I have no Soul!			"

												Beneath what's apparently yet another generic shooter, watch as a man suffers an ongoing mental breakdown - denying the harsh reality of a disaster so strongly that he hallucinates a more convenient one for himself, losing his mind and alienating everyone that used to trust him. A wonderful kick-in-the-teeth deconstruction of the gung-ho military shooter.Do you feel like a hero yet?			"

												I'll try to make a pros/cons list while doing less spoilers possible, i advise you to dont read too many reviews because the less you know about the plot the better, in my opinionPROS-Solid gameplay system-Very good plot-Awesome characterization-Good settings/atmospheres-There are a lot of symbols and hidden things in the plot which require more than one run to get-Very nice graphic system but it ran quite smoothly on my very old pcCONS-It gets a little repetitive by the end (maybe because i kinda speedran the game in a single 8 hour long session it's just me) but yet this is quite functional to the plot-After u played the whole plot 2 or 3 times you are most likely never going to touch the game ever again, which maybe doesnt make it worth 20 bucks-Some scenes may be disturbing -Plot is quite confused, but this is also meant and functional to the main thing			"

												I found this game to have a stellar story mode the multiplayer is fun but nothing to write home about. There are many decisions to be made during the 12-14 hour campaign not all of them are obvious but they all have an impact on how the game plays out. If your someone who is into a strong cerebral military style story line aka apocalypse now. then you will greatly enjoy this. Overall I'd give the game a 4/5 its got interesting characters and it really pulls you in to finish it...			"

												This is an exceedingly unusual game and I don't entirely know what to make of it. It starts off as a fairly conventional good guys shoot up the bad guys desert army affair, but after a while it becomes apparent that something's different. It makes you do terrible things -- no, that's not fair, it doesn't *make* you do anything, but it allows you to do them and then confronts you with them.It's not a fun game in the conventional sense, it's actually quite harrowing and I came away from it feeling rather chewed up inside, but I'm really glad I played it and I'd urge anyone interested in a game that actually confronts the reality of war to give it a go.

												I enjoyed the single player campaign. The story is very interesting and disturbing on many levels. I commend the writers.The gameplay is fairly mediocre. Not much new in this sticky cover shooter. Enemy AI is non existent, on normal difficulty ammo management was important. The guns are fairly standard military shooter. Shotguns encourage aggressive play, the AA12 is great fun. Squad management is present but not very good or original. Star Wars Republic Commando did it better 10 years ago.The graphics are very good, lots of extra effort put into detail. Everywhere you look are enviroments that look unique and add to the story. Level design is almost completely linear with only a few examples of paths for setting up flanking fire.Overall I recommend it, but wait for a steep discount. One playthrough at a fairly slow pace is about 8 hours. How much is 8 hours of good but not great entertainment worth to you?			"

												Dark Gritty 3rd Person Shooter. Far more deserving of praise than many in its genre. Multiple choices that affect the story and each choice has its own gut-wrenching consequences. Manages to take the monotony of repetitive shooting and make it interesting by weaving the combat into intense theatrical situations. Your decisions weigh in on the story and take a toll on the everyones mental state. Either way, its never a happy ending. Just keep reminding yourself that you're still a good person. 8/10I need a drink after that.			"

												What we have here is a true GOOD game. Spec Ops : The Line is a straightforward cover shooter, in a military setting with a twist. So what makes it special ?Of course, as many reviewers, I praise the writing first. It's on-par with the first Bioshock in my opinion, and share a few elements. The design is classic military brownfest, but this time, it serves the story. Also, exploring the weird ruins of Dubai's decadence is a really nice change of setting. But more than that, the gameplay is the real force behing this game. The guns feels good, the pacing is good, the difficulty is just right, each weapons feels really different and has its uses, yet you can't really abuse it or stick to one favorite gun, you'll have to make-do. And once again, this serves the story.A great lesson.			"

												I heard voices saying ""you know this is wrong, this isn't fair they don't deserve this"" but I ignored them and just carried on killing.Anyway the game itself is a easy 3rd person tunnel shooter up to chapter 12 and then suddenly you have to pay attention to your surroundings. First playthrough was roughly six hours on hardest possible difficulty so just use common sense and you don't have to worry about how many bullets you got left or where you should hide to stay alive. The overall experience was fun and theres not much to whine about apart from couple ugly moments when the movement mechanics with vaulting, sprinting and hiding behind objects didn't happen as I wanted. Right now I don't want to play the game again on FUBAR difficulty you get for completing it and I propably will not ever play it so get the game from a sale if the price is right. "

And that mortar part is one of those like you are forced by you don hit that sop you die and even if you die it blows up in size of 10 times more than mortar shell. Soooo ye gg otherwise fairly good game. One thing for the studio that developed this is please reformulate a bit your statements about this game.

												I think this game is one of the most powerful pieces of modern media and art out there. Many people say they are still waiting for the Citizen Kane of gaming yet completely overlook this. The horrors of the human mind are on display in the most grounded way possible. The genius of the game is the darkness wrapped on an easily digestible shell, you don't know what's wrong until it's too late. Of all the amazing, and I use that term lightly, moments in this game it's the little touches that get you. A good portion into the game you are given the option of executing two men. One stole water rations for his family, the other killed the man's family but he only did so under orders. Who do you choose? When you get to the end you understand what that choice means but in the moment you must weigh your options. I did what don't think most people know about, I shot the snipers who were waiting for me to choose. The two men died in the crossfire but I believed I had done the right thing. That is truly your first step into the madness. Most FPS games hardly tackle the atrocities of war but SO: The Line forces you to confront it, forces you to experience hell. As you descend further into depravity you will undoubtedly question yourself, and the game tries to reassure you, 'You are still a good person', yet in the next breath chastises you, 'Do you feel like a hero yet?'. This leads to the player ultimately coming to grips with the terrible things they've done, and for what? A man back home and a medal that gathers dust, never mind those whose life bled into that godforsaken sand. Never mind the mother clutching her child in a desperate attempt to safe them. Never mind that there was always a choice. There is always a choice, in the moment it might not seem like it but after the dust settles you have to live with the choice you made. You have to live with the blood on your hands, haunted by the sights that are forever burned into your mind so that every second is a nightmare. War is hell. And hell is human. Humanity feared the monsters they believed lurked in the trees, lakes, mountains, and deserts, but the true monster, the one we should all fear, is the monster inside each and every one of us. The darkness that claws and howls to be let loose, the beast that begs for blood, we all have it. Some are more in touch with it and give in, while others are scarred and forever changed by giving into their demons and living with the consequences. Spec Ops explores that beautifully and it can't be praised enough.﻿ I don't feel like a hero. Not in the slightest.			"

												Playing this game is rather like watching the proverbial train wreck: you'll be horrified, but you can't look away. This is in no way a bad thing. Spec Ops wants to tell a story about soldiers in war. But unlike games such as Call of Duty, it doesn't want you to feel like an awesome, unstoppable killing machine that's fighting terrorism FOR 'MERICA!!! or whatever; it wants you to see that war is not glamorous, awesome, fun, or desirable. It wants you to see the terrible toll that combat can exact on those who experience it. And above all, it wants you to see that in real conflict, there are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" and the world is full of gray areas. War is hell, and anyone who goes in will either join the fortunate dead...or have to live with what they've done to survive.Spec Ops is a third-person cover-based shooter that alternates between desert environments and crumbling urban ruin. You have two squadmates who can be directed to attack specific targets or heal a fallen comrade; they're pretty good at following orders in a timely fashion and, unlike some other AI partners, they're not highly prone to getting themselves shot constantly or hung up on the level geometry. Enemies are decently clever, more than willing to flank you, toss grenades to get you out of cover, or trick you into walking right into a Heavy Trooper's line of fire.The game also offers the clever idea of having drifts of sand piled up on fragile surfaces like windows, which you can shoot out to bury your enemies. It doesn't show up that often, but it's kind of neat when it's there.There's the usual shooter stable of weapons: pistols, heavy pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. They sound good and feel decently punchy, and aiming is never a problem. Most weapons also have an alternate fire mode, which does add a little depth to the combat.I didn't play the multiplayer, so I can't honestly review it. I will say the developers originally didn't even want multiplayer, and the campaign is designed well enough to stand on its own, so make of that what you will.I highly recommend this game. It is a breath of fresh air in an over-crowded genre that's becoming increasingly generic. This game is also visually stunning, with exceptional voice acting, and sound. It is definitely worth the money and the effort to play the game from the beginning to the end.Final Decision: 8/10			"

Gunplay feels good and there's a good variety of weapons to shooty shoot. Graphics are decent and have some nice effects here and there. Music fits the action and sound effects have the boom they should have.Only 2 flaws stand out for me. First, the combination of certain actions to one key can be annoying, like sprint+cover and melee+vault-over-a-cover. Must be a console thing. Second, the multiplayer seems to be dead.7/10			"

There is the nice slow motion effects when you score a headshot the guns feel hefty and are able to differentiate themselves enough to make each one feel like it comes with its own playstyle.As I mentioned the story however is the driving force. There is a weighty and crushing atmosphere which addmittedly tempered my enthusiasm for playing the game whenever I just wanted to sit down and relax, but if you are up for the dark themes, it delivers a powerful payoff in the form of unique plot twists.

												An absolutely engrossing experience examining the human psyche through the eyes and minds of ""hard boiled"" American soldiers.  Spec Ops delivers one of the most enjoyable and thought provoking stories in both military shooters and video games to date.  The gameplay, the graphics, and the soundtrack helpt to carry the game well, but it's the story that will make you want to keep on going The gameplay is well refined, with the 3rd person shooting mechanics working very well as you would expect from a game within the past few years.  Decent amounts of environmental disasters and interactions help to keep things fresh and enjoyable.  I was able to complete the game in about 7 hours, though to be honest it seemed like much longer, but in a positive way as I enjoyed my time with this game.The multiplayer seems to be a bust and thats a shame because when there are others to play with it isn't half bad, especially considering the limited 3rd person shooter options for PC gamers.Overall I would absolutely recommend this game, it deserves a playthrough for anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters and/or especially to those who like a good, thought provoking story.Please upvote this if you agree with this review and enjoyed this game!  I'd love to have as many people play this game as possible and I'd love anyone/everyone's help to attain this goal!  :)			"

												For a shirt review read the next few lines, for a longer review then go read the shorter review you skimming ♥♥♥♥bag. So the Steam Summer Sale 2015 claimed another $9.89 of my money and thus this game gommba stomped its way to the top of my play priority list. Not at gunpoint this time so I have that going for me. Well it might as well be at gunpoint seeing as the state it left me in after the 4 hours of pure pain and suffering, and yelling to take cover. I knew a few spoilers before picking up this game, the white phosphorus bit, the bit where the black guy turns into Irish from BF4, the turret section, etc., etc. I wanted to get through this game with no surprises and shock. Well the game saw my wants and said,""Well this guy actually wanted a positive outlook on life, he gets the special treatment"". I played through it, got frustrated but perservered. My mental state was pretty much neutral: shooting people that were already down, letting characters die, just to see what happens if I actually played the character like I was supposed to. This game made sure that playing the part would be ♥♥♥♥ing disturbing. Imagine Chris Pratt playing as Hitler but with a relatable personality and the whole role revolved around improvising around being cruel. He'll watch the footage and probably curl up into a ball and think on his thought based sins. That's how I felt after seeing what the actual hell Walker was thinking this whole game. No spoilers but when I remembered that the game is based directly on Heart of Darkness/Apocolypse Now near the end, I nearly pisses the bed when I thought I had it all figured out. In the end, the twist made me play through all the endings in a trans and afterwards I started sniffing fundip hoping that it'd improve my mood. Buy the game(on sale) and just go ♥♥♥♥in' nuts. I'll go back to listening to Mad World. All around me are familliar faces, worn out places, worn out face-e-e-e-es....			"

And every second of this masterpiece is against war. It must be quite hard to make a shooter, that is against war and this game is in this role not perfect. So for example you kill hundreds of enemy soldiers without really asking about that or an option to make themgive up. But what makes this game so great? It's the great atmosphrere of a beautiful Dubai which is falling into chaos.It is how the game shows what war makes out of humans. So for example the main characters get more and more brutalduring the story. So while the execution kills are in the beginnning a simple shot in the head, does the main character a jump onto the vitim, ramms him his rifle in the mouth and splatters his brain all over the floor.The game shows the player again and again how horrible war can be and much better the player often has the opportunity tochoose.to choose between life and death. To choose between cruelty and mercy. To choose between good and bad. Just too show theplayer in the next moment that his good was the real bad. And this is something you can see then in the protagonist too how he and his unit struggles with the crimes they have done...And way more the game talks to the player so for example in one of the loadingscreens after you killed douzends of civilians there is written, that usually this behaviour would be spoken about infront of the military court but that thisis not reality, right?I can just tell you that I really enyoed playing this game. But except of the great story and the parts that are mentionend up there is it almost a 08/15 shooter.But I can tell you if you want to play a game with a really intense, emotional and great story this game is it.So trust a not-trustfull random stranger and buy this game.

												It's difficult to say anything about Spec Ops: The Line without ruining what makes it what it is. Suffice to say, its strength lies completely in its story, its message, and the fascinating and morbid deconstruction of the modern action game it provides.Its not a 'good' game in the traditional sense; but then again, what it provides is hard to value. And many people will have to judge it for themselves. But I reccomend it, if only because its the only game of its kind to truly make an impact.After all these years, its (in)famous reputation has spread across the 'net, so spoilers are abound. Which is sad, because it's an experience people need to play through first to truly appreciate. But that experince has stood the test of time, and to this day is still just as brilliant and terrible as ever.So, if you've never/barely have heard of Spec Ops up to this point, and have a strong stomach, pick it up and play it. Because I can garuntee there's nothing that comes close to it. No matter what other people may say or think of it, Spec Ops is the only game that has ever changed the way I look at games, forever.

												I've just finished this game, and I have to say that it is an excellent game overall. While it (like others have pointed out) has clunky controls which at times has made me say ""grrrrr...."", the story is nonetheless great -- it is thought provoking while depressing at the same time. The graphics are nice, and the audio/soundtrack is good. A non-so-classic take on a (classic?) genre. My total playtime was about 6 hours, which is in agreement with others' times. Hope this helps.Overall, I would recommend if you are looking for a great story, but not necessarily for gameplay. I have to think that the gameplay wasn't *that* bad though. I'm pretty sure that multiplayer is dead, but I'm not really sure. I suspect may be surviving in a dying state... on  the line  (hehe... get it?) 9/10 I'll probably edit this more later.Spoiler thoughts (caution):   I do wonder if I did make choices or if it was only the illusion of choice. An interesting thing is that I sometimes felt like I was doing a little right, even when doing the wrong. I also liked the witty/snarky remarks, like ""Do you even remember why you came here?"", in the loading screens. The allusions (e.g. ""News of my survival have been greatly exaggerated,"" humored me.)  "

												I'll recommend this game, but hesitantly. It really takes a certain kind of person to enjoy a game like this. I only say that because it's a boring, generic, and repetitive military shooter. There's quite literally nothing else to the gameplay except hiding behind cover and shooting at enemies. If you actually enjoy that sort of thing, then by all means, buy this game. Personally, I'm not one for that sort of thing in the slightest. I forced myself to finish it purely because the story was decent. Of all the military shooters I've played, this one actually had a story, and it was quite good. The setting is also pretty cool and vivid, which is uncommon in military shooters. So to sum it up, if you like shooting at people, get it. It's great and has an even better story. If you're like me and you need something more to your games, pass it up.			"

												I just finished the first play through on ""Suicide Mission"" difficulty. Shooting and all that gives a pretty standard fps feel; there is nothing very unique, but I still enjoyed it. The graphic of the game, being one released in 2012, is looks pretty.The true shining bit of this game is the story. The story is touching; it makes me feel shooting is not fun. At some point of the storyline, you get to make hard decisions as to kill or let go, kill using this way or that way. In this game, your decisions have consequences and these consequences make differences in gameplay and story. So far I have discovered four endings.After the first play through, the most unforgiving difficulty is unlocked. I can’t wait to play it again and try different options.			"

												When people bring up examples of games is art, chances are this game is brought up at some point or another because of it's subversion of the tropes common of FPS. And this isn't without good reason. Spec Ops works as a creative take on the sort of ""War is Hell"" stories we've seen a billion times such as ""Apoclypse Now"" (In fact, both those take inspiration from the book ""Heart of Darkness""), but in a way that makes its interactivity mean something. It likely started a trend of games that are not meant to make the player feel good (with varying degrees of success). It's worth experiencing at least once.8/10			"

												This is a very strong and heavy title. It's really good but prepare for heavy material and emotional moments. The story is amazing, I won't spoil anything but it shows a very interesting side and has a few choices you can make throughout the game that can influence dialogue and scenes to strenghten the emotional immersion the player has regarding the story and actual real life events, to a degree. The gameplay, which is fully linear, is great. You move from point to point throughout beautiful setpieces with your team as you shoot down tons of 'baddies' (maybe?). There are a lot of grey areas explained in the form of extra lore 'Intel' spread about the battlefield that you can find. The voice acting is great, no flaws there and that's very important as they carry the weight of the story very well. Important: some people are saying the game is buggy or broken; it's not. I, in 10 hours of play (2 playthroughs) had 0 crashes. Running on Windows 7, max settings. If the game doesn't work for you, chances are it's on your end, or some uncommon problem you might want to search for online. The sound design and music is great, it really works to pull you in the story and the game itself isn't too hard.There are settings from really easy all the way to pretty darn hard (I recommend hardest settings because it enhances the story experience in my opinion) although going for just the story on easy mode is definitely a possibility. Overall this is a great game, and it does interesting things. I highly recommend this game to any and every fps gamer, or person who's looking for an interesting story. I absolutely loved it and after having completed it I went back immediately to beat the game on FUBAR (definitely the best way to play).			"

												Usually I can't stand any of the modern, strictly scripted and linear shooters, for plenty of reasons. Most of them do not offer anything interesting in gameplay, and their scripts are generally so bad that they seem to be written by a trained monkey. Well, Spec Ops: The Line is quite an average shooter, when considering the gameplay, but the script and the story are something truly extraordinary and unforgettable. If you're a fan of the Heart of Darkness novella or any of its adaptations, for example Apocalypse Now, you should give this game a try.All in all, I have not encountered before any strictly linear modern warfare shooters with an interesting single player campaign and a truly thought-provoking story. Well, I really hope that this wasn't the first and the last time.			"

												Simply amazing.A MUST PLAY for anyone who loves storytelling in games. This one is on par with the greats like Bioshock and Portal.WARNING:THIS IS NOT A CALL OF DUTY CLONE LIKE THE TRAILERS AND BOX ART WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE, IT IS BASICALLY THE MOST ANTI-CALL OF DUTY TRIPLE A SHOOTER GAME EVER MADE.THIS GAME ISN'T ""FUN"" IT'S ENGAGING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE A TRADITIONAL GOOD TIME PLAYING IT!The best way to explain what this game is to start at it's creation.Spec Ops was a shooter series that nobody cared about in the late 90s/early 2000s.2K (the publisher) wanted Yager (the developers) to make a new Spec Ops game. It could be about ANYTHING so long as it was about the US military.What they made was a decent into madness that will make you rethink everything you knew about the Modern Military genre.Many games are ""adult"" because they have violence and sexual themes, though children still play and enjoy them. This game is adult because it's got mature themes and will make you think.I can't spoil ANYTHING because it's best to go in completely fresh but it's amazingly dark and you will feel awful after beating it, but in a good way.Gameplay's standard MMS fare but played from a third person perspective, similarly to Gears of War. The shooting feels good and they keep adding new, varied weapons to keep things at least somewhat varied. The cover mechanics are pretty clunky and awkward and It all gets kinda boring.But it's not about that, it's about the story.Play this if you want something that questions the MMS genre.Play this if you want to play something that makes you feel awful and think.DON'T play this if you want a pro-USA shooter where you kill the terrorists and stop World War 3.I wholeheartedly reccomend this.

												This game is amazing because, like most people have pointed out, it breaks alot of ""norms"" in the shooter genre. The story is amazing, and by the end of it all you genuinely feel bad for walker and for yourself for the things you have done. Alot of reviewers have said that while the story is good the gameplay leaves alot to be desired. Im not really going to argue that but i will say that the shooting mechanics get the job done. This is a 3rd person cover based shooter. There is not really much room to ""revolutionize"" the industry in terms of shooting mechanics here. It gets the job done and thats it. I found the gameplay fun, and the AI, while not exactly Skynet level intelligent, DOES attempt to give you a hard time if you dont take them out quickly. They will flank you, and use grenades quite frequently (i was playing on the hardest initial difficulty, before unlocking the FUBAR difficulty). A wider choice in weaponry would have been welcome, and perhaps some sort of weapon customization options, but considering the type of game this is, weapon customization would have probably not been incredibly useful overall anyways.What i appreciate the most though, above everything else, are the subtle changes to Walkers character and personality as the game progresses. I dont want to spoil anything, but i will say this: from the start of the game pay attention to how walker acts. From reloading, to taking out enemies, to using the teammate commands. EVERYTHING. Then notice towards the end of the game how he handles taking out enemies, how he gets impatient and screams while reloading, how progressively more brutal and unneccesarily cruel executions become.This is definitely a game that deserves your time. It has an amazing story, amazing characters, and the gameplay is solid. I highly recommend playing this game on the hardest initial difficulty though, because on normal it can feel a tad on the easy side.			"

												TLDR; I love this gameCaptain Walker is sexy, especially when he gets mad7/10 overall*This review is for single player campaign mode. I have not tried co-op.I played on a laptop with minimum specs. Framerate drops a lttile at times, but nothing unbearable. Personally I think graphics were great, the characters very well done, and the scenery at times is beautiful...Well, as far as bloody battlefield goes anyway. Don't expect amazing gameplay. Gunplay is clunky when I first played, but after a time I got used to it and ended up getting headshots with my pistol and whatever easy peasy. Gosh, but the sniping is difficult. Some of the guns in this game are a real pain, but I guess that's what's unique about the selection. Each gun is a little different from the next in various ways. After the initial awkwardness, shooting did get satisfiying, but also tired easily. No boss battles of any sort. No real challenges, just...A few obstacles that require just a little more effort than usual. You can spend a fair amount of time searching for hidden journals, which I highly suggest if you want to understand the story completely, but they're very few of these anyway.I actually found myself taking advantage of melee kills moreso than shooting; nothing like Rambo'in down the hallway and elbowing people's faces in.♥♥♥♥♥♥was waay funnn and much more rewarding than shooting. Oh, there are some other glaring problems. For example, there is this one feature where you can apparently command your buddies to shoot something for you...That feature don't work. Plain and simple. Cover system is wonky at best. Stealth? What the hell is the point? But you know, it's all small kinks. It really doesn't matter. It's still functional, enjoyable gameplay.Other than that...Well, you shoot baddies to progress to the next point in the story, and that's about it. No rewards system. Very straightforward get-from-point-A-to-point-B linear play, but that's okay for what this game is because...The game's selling point has to be its story. And this story has some serious DEPTH. The fantastic pacing, the storytelling, the relatable characters...All this coupled with amazing voice acting. I just love hearing Walker's battle cries. Really, talent at its finest. While you actually don't make many tough decisions much like you would in Mass Effect or whatever (in fact you hardly choose at all), the few times that you do, you quickly come to realize just how highly or how little you regard Walker, the MC, and his buddies. That's just how well this game builds you up towards the climax. I don't want to say too much for the story, else I risk spoiling it...Just play it and see for yourself! 7/10, damn well good and one for the records.			"

												Rife with choice and moral dilema, this game is one of the few thats ever actually made me feel something.This game isn't as finely tuned or glamorous as Battlefield or Call of duty, but it doesn't need to be, thats not the experience they're trying to deliver on. However this will still lead to frustrations when elements aren't explained properly, or are simply difficult for obscenely stupid reasons. This game tackles hard subjects, and does so well. Almost every encounter has one or two obvious choices, with maybe one or two other decisions to make that you may not be aware are things you can do, and I love that.The designers took a risky choice with some of the themes they tackled, and I believe how they handled it should be commended.

												Под личиной типичного милитари шутера, а то и вовсе ""каловдутия от 2К"" на самом деле скрывается нечто совсем иное. Почему? Во-первых, явно вдохновленный ""Апокалипсисом сегодня"" сюжет в конце оставляет игрока в растерянности, чего я давно в играх не видел. Во-вторых, сеттинг не только подкупает своей определенной оригинальностью, но и дает возможность полюбоваться красивыми видами Дубая. В третьих, подход разработчиков к музыке нетипичен. То тут, то там нам дают послушать Хендрикса, Deep Purple, Mogwai, The Black Angels. Все остальное же время игрока сопровождает построковый саундтрек, который на удивление, как отлично вписывается в игру, так и интересно слушается отдельно от нее (и уже, само собой, отправился на ipod). Да, консольная механика с укрытиями, перекатами и ""нажмите А, чтобы спрыгнуть"" немного портят впечатление. Но в данном случае даже как-то не хочется ругаться. Очень приятный сюрприз, в общем.			"

												Outstanding Story with a breathtaking plot with alternative endings.Spec Ops is about you, the effects of your actions, and events that are out of your control.This game defies the standard army shooter in a way that you have never seen before, it actually makes you question your actions, where you find yourself asking if killing is right or wrong.Multiplayer's a wash, but the campaign is worth replaying - seeing the same events while knowing what's really going on is uncomfortable in new ways, but the intelligent encounters and level design make each fight exciting, and the voice acting creates genuine and believable characters.Absolutely, and without a doubt, one of the best stories you'll find in any game.

												The gameplay is defined by the fact that this game is a console port. For me 3rd person shooters are nightmare as I am used to FPS like Batttlefied, Nuclear Dawn, etc. BUT: The story is amazing. Well, that might not be the right word. Let's just say that I will remember.So my recomendation is go for the easiest difficulty setting (I did this on the 2nd and toward the ending it was hell) and enjoy the storyline and your ""choice"".Well, there is one exception (slight spoilers ahead), if you are like to play RPGs like me, where you have insane amount of choice... then, you are going to suffer, because there will be a lot of things you will not want to do.

Smart writing saves average shooterSpec Ops: The line is a bit of an odd beast. It starts as a very average 3rd person cover shooter. You get to hear the usual gung-ho callouts, and slaughter the usual terrorists. Then, somewhere an hour in or so, the story starts to pick up speed. And what a story it is. Unlike the vast majority of shooters this isn't a story about heros slaughtering evil goons to save the world. This is a story about actions and their consequences, about atrocities commited in the name of a greater good. This is not a game for 18 year old kids who still think war is a fun adventure. Or maybe it is. Maybe it will make them stop and think for a few moments. Maybe it will make them read heart of darkness.For the adults, if you can look past the average game mecanics, it's well worth playing.			"

												Apocalypse Now:  DubaiThe combat is solid enough, controls are slightly strange but entirely passable.   I'm not personally a fan of games on rails but this one is a decent roller coaster ride that makes the rails a bit more acceptable for me.Enemies react to being shot in limbs appropriately and shotguns feel great, which is honestly a rarity in games.  The game gives a lot of forced prompts for commands and actions you have to or are only capable of doing at those moments which is strange and irritating.  The giant flashing prompts on the screen forcing your hand really take you out of the immersion of the story, which could be pretty good if the prompts didn't reinforce an arcade shooter feel.  The cover system is done fairly well, although i found myself fighting with the controls in many instances because it's just a few slight changes from what standard shooters bring you to expect.I have run into some instances where invisible barriers would block my shots and they threw in the generic heavily armored (Commonly known as bulldozer) type unit who can be frustrating to an extreme when most enemies react appropriately, a sticky grenade or an RPG on his facemask will do little more than break the mask off and stun him.  The bare face of his still requires significant amounts of shots to kill him with any weapon despite being unarmored which means damage is based on body parts and not types of armored cover.  In a shooter, this can be pretty irritating but expected from the lazier ones, so it might not bother other people as much.Ammo can be quite scarce for you and you alone as your team mates have unlimited ammo, dreadful aim, and unlimited grenades but can only be used in designated situations or of their own personal choosing.  They also pick their own cover in your general area which can occasionally put them on the wrong side of it, forcing your hand to go save them in the open during a bad enough situation to get them downed.  I haven't tried the Multiplayer or Co-Op yet so I can't comment on those.Combat  7/10Story      7/10Controls 6/10Visuals   7/10Docking score for the excessive HUD prompts and the heavily armored Bulldozer unit because those are just lazy, especially considering the environment.I'd have to give the game a 6/10 overallThe game is good for a few bucks, I would recommend it if you can catch it on a decent sale.

												Dark, gritty and very accurate about it's portrayal of war, If you want to get away from the glorified war game that is CoD this is worth it. The game pulls no punches displaying the carnage of war. The game is story driven in a compelling and addicting manner and well written.The game only has two outcomes for choices: Bad or Worse. You never feel like you made the right choice, but you do what you think is neccessary.The best part about this game is that it never dehumanizes the enemies you fight, in fact it tends to stress that fact that you are killing fellow human beings, you aren't supposed to feel good that you just shot the guy with the head wrapping, you did it because you had to survive.All in all this game rates a solid 9.5/10- Loved the game, hated myself.

												Where do i even start. I guess i should start by saying if you are in the military or a veteran, don't play this game. This game was intended for people to understand what a soldier goes though when dealing with PTSD. There is a ton of feels in this game. Which is weird considering how short it is. The first play through i did of this game was only about 4.5 hours. But man what an intense game. Even with how short it is i cant make myself complete it in one sitting. Its the only game i have to take a break while playing. Simply because of how ♥♥♥♥ed up it gets with all the break downs your character has when dealing with high stress situations. The game overall is filled with very old spawn points and boring cover based shooting. Nothing in the combat is special all stuff done years before this game was realeased. Very linear so much that you spend almost the full game just walking down what felt like hall ways; painted differently to give you the sense of moving forward.I would say its worth buying if the game is on sale. Just to experience what all the hype was about when the game came out. Just to read the loading screens. "

												Just 2 hours and I'm already freaking out about the storyline. This game shows people that war just isn't that patriotic ideal all the time. Maybe this is a comment on how the minds of soldiers/marines/etc. are tested in combat, warzones and the like. There have been several twists and turns already and I'm anxious for proceeding even further into the story. A big item in the pro-column is the sound of game and also some scenery (those who've played will know what I'm talking about) are brilliantly made and horrific at the same time. A negative thing about the game are the controls, but once you get the hang of them...If I had to describe my experience in the game in one word, it would be 'mindf*ck'.

Whoever wrote the script is definitely a fan of Apocalypse Now, with all the major plot points being mirrored throughout the story.  The combat system is polished with only a few minor hiccups (but you kinda expect that in a duck and cover shooter.  Pacing was great, with cutscenes breaking up a lot of the action, although it's obvious when a firefight is about to break out due to the layout of the point you're at.

Например, песчаную бурю можно использовать в качестве прикрытия для наступления или наоборот – засады, если метет уж очень сильно. В мультиплеере бури и деформация песчаного покрова тоже будут играть очень важную роль. Моя оценка 10/10.			"

												Unique TPS with good gameplay mechanics, an apocalypse-now type story and an excellent setting.Good♥♥♥♥♥♥+The setting is one of my favourites so far in gaming. Think a creative, beautiful and post apocalyptic Dubai.+Story is interesting and different than the norm with subtle clues and interesting decisions.+Gameplay mechanics worked well for me, but not for some. It's mainly a cover based shooter.+Style, sounds, weapons and music. The main title has (I think) Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix playing.+Melee finishers on downed enemies work nicely. No instant takedowns.+Multiplayer is actually pretty good. There's free co-op to but I havn't tried it yet.+(MINOR SPOILER) As the story progresses your character's finishing moves and ""taunts"" get more brutal. Nice touch.Don't feel right: -The shooting can get somewhat repetetive as there is not a lot of variation in what you can do.-Little replay value unless you want the story again from a more understanding perspective.Conclusion:The game is solid and of appropriate length for a shooter. I'm glad they didn't drag it out unecessarily and that the gameplay mechanics are of good quality. Nothing ruins immersion and good story like bad gameplay. Sadly the story didn't get a hold of me emotionally as it did for some, I really wish I could get into it but I just couldn't get real emotion from it as a whole. Certain parts got to me a little but not overwhelmingly. Still, it was a very satisfying take on one of my favourite tales: man goes into darkness and creates his own vision of society. Certain parts of the story/ending confused me a little but the whole thing is up to interpretation and certainly worth venturing into. Games like Far Cry 3, The Last of Us (especially), Mass Effect series and MGS series are examples of what engaged me emotionally. It's unfortunate that this did not but I still loved the experience and was always eager to play on and uncover the story unfolding. Maybe I've played too many shooters and become a little detached, who knows? Throughout the story you will get to make a few moral decisions but I won't say any more on that.Anyway, I'd give it a 9/10 easily, a full 10 if it had increased combat options/variation. I'm not gonna mark it down for failing to grab me as it did for others, however, as it deserves praise nonetheless.			"

												Spec Ops is a strange, yet very interesting beast.It starts off like one of theses bombastic console shooters (Call of Duty, Gears of Wars 2, ...) both in terms of gameplay (lots of cutscenes and action set pieces), and story (Americans going at the opposite side of the world to kill baddies). But after the first mission, which is also the tutorial, it suddenly takes a more interesting turn.On the gameplay side, the game is a third person, cover-based, shooter but is more interesting than others cover based titles. A rudimentary command system allows you to give some orders to your AI teammates. The level design is also well done, with more verticality than most shooters. Combining the command system with a clever use of the map allow for nice flanking positions. That feels very satisfying when you can dispatch a wave of ennemies by being actually clever rather than just rushing in. It's also a lot more dynamic and interesting than the extremely static ""first guy to raise his head above his barricade is dead"" gameplay of Gears of War 2.On the story side, well...it's hard to talk about it without spoiling, but i will just say that it will soon take an unexpected turn. That story is interesting enough that i enjoyed playing the game twice (something i usually never do, even when i like a game). It allowed me to find some details that i didn't notice on my first playthrough (such as paintings on the walls, or references in the NPC dialogs) as well as better understand the story and its characters.The game however is not perfect. On the story side, it's not conveyed perfectly. It tries to be interesting with many stuff happening (again, i'm trying to not spoil), but it's sometimes more confusing than it should be due to some slightly wonky dialogs from time to tim (either too heavy-handed, or on the contrary not explaining enough). The second playthrough will of course help clear out any remaining doubt you may have on the storyOn the gameplay side, the controls are clearly made for console, and are therefore annoying to use on PC (many buttons have 2 or 3 roles, which lead to confusion and stupid deaths while in battle). I would have wished to be able to rebind all actions separately. Another annoyance is that there are still some of theses set action pieces (such as defending with an infinite ammo turret) that you get in the bombastic shooters. The kind of stuff that are exhilarating the first time you encounter them in a game, but get annoying when all games have them. Finally, and probably the biggest issue, is that it shares some of the usual problems of cover-based shooters. If you're next to a ledge/barricade, but not actually in cover, you magically can't fire down the ledge and you take more damage even though the barricade should protect you. That's annoying, but well, it's part of the genre that you have to stay in cover every single time.On the whole, Spec Ops feels like a game that has some slight issues, but is original and interesting enough to have its own charm, and i find it quite endearing. It will remain as an interesting experimentation, and i'm sad it didn't have more commercial success, as I'm sure a spiritual sequel would have fixed the small issues while keeping what makes it good. I recommend it if you like solo shooters, but want a deeper story experience than what Call of Duty-style game offer.			"

												If you looked at this game and thought ""oh great, another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD clone"", you're right; it would be a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone - if that's what it was actually aiming for. No, ladies and gentlemen, this game's developers knew full well what you were expecting, so they use it to punch you in the gut. Even if you have a knowledge of this before hand, the punches just don't stop coming.I wouldn't exactly call this game fun, it didn't leave me feeling empowered and heroic. It ripped my heart out, made me feel guilty and disempowered, smacked me in the face with hard choices and left me feeling very discontent with the choices I had to make. So no, it's not fun in any real meaning of the word, but it's the most engaging game I've played recently. I couldn't close the game or quit because this darn thing had such an iron grip on me. This game actually tackles some pretty deep issues - PTSD, use of white phosphorus - actually I should let you see these for yourself. I don't want to spoil anything accidentally while trying to encourage you to play this game.While you're playing it (which you should), I do have some suggestions: listen to/read what's being said - they're not just talking to Walker; they're talking to you - even in the loading screen text; particularly as you get closer to the end. I should also mention that, if the controls and combat sequences feel a little dissonant, they're supposed to. I'd elaborate, but spoilers.I love this game, but I wouldn't play through it again unless I wanted to feel horrible about myself! :pIf that didn't convince you, perhaps the guys at Extra Credits will:

SPEC OPS: THE LINEAn updated retelling of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness shackled to an average cover based shooter.Rating 6/10If it wasn't for the story propelling the action I doubt the game would have been noticed amongst numerous other 3rd person cover based shooters. It doesn't do anything particularly well, enemies attack in waves whilst you hide behind waist high cover. This format doesn't change through the game but the enemies get smarter using grenades to try and flush you out and at times they destroy your cover. You have two other members in your squad, a sniper and heavy MG and they should be a help but the AI lets them down and they often become a hindrance especially on tougher difficult levels. There is a lot of good to be found in the game and it's not all bad, firstly the ruined setting of Dubai is well realised in places, the sand taking over many of the buildings and it's a beautifully eerie place as you make your way through the ruins of what was once a populated city.As the game progresses it also offers up a few moral choices, tough choices in a tough environment. Sadly though these choices have no effect on the ending, so no matter which path you choose you'll end up in the same place. It continues to ask moral questions throughout about the justification of your actions. If you've read Heart of Darkness or seen Apocalypse Now you'll know what to expect, I won't ruin the story but it has a few nice twists and turns as you discover what's really been happening in Dubai.So I recommend you buy the game for the story but don't expect much from the actual gameplay.

												Great storyline as well as gameplay. It is fun to click and pop heads in this Third-person shooter and it contains a really sad truth about war.Not gonna spoil much but this game will definitely make you feel like a horrible person. The challenge in changing the difficulty (especially FUBAR) really put me on edge on how carefully I should time,move from cover to cover and shoot even thought it is kinda anooying to die over 50 times. Little details I noticed as well were put into this game, for example, the image of the main menu screen changing as you progress the following chapters and how your characters' gear, mental stability and how badly wounded they are increases as you near the end of the game piqued my interest. In conclusion, this game is definitely a (+) to me.			"

												The gamplay of Spec Ops: The Line is pretty bad when compaired to other shooters.  Its genrally fun enough, though there are a few overly frustrating parts.  I would never recomend this game for its gameplay.  The single player story is really amazing though. Its not the sort of story I have come to expect from these cinematic shooters.   Its also a story that I think is best told in video game form.  Its dark, and it won't leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy.  There are plenty of other video game plots that fit that description, but this is nothing like them.  Im not going to say more about it than that.If I have one non-gameplay-machanic complaint about this game, its that the choices you make throughout the game don't effect the ending you get.  There is a good reason for that I guess, but Im not a big fan of being able to easily get all endings by loading your almost end of game save.  It makes it so there is far less reason to replay the game.  This is a pretty minor complaint with a game like this though, as its very unusual for them to have more than one ending.; "

												This is a third person shooter that stands out for its highly unconventional storyline. The plot is that the worst sandstorm in history has engulfed the glitzy city of Dubai. After six months of no contact from the city it is presumed that everyone has died, including a US infantry battalion that was there on a humanitarian relief mission. You're a special forces commando sent to investigate a garbled radio transmission that has started broadcasting from the supposedly dead city.Right from the beginning the plot grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. I don't want to be too spoilerish, but I'll just say that moral ambiguity plays a big role in this game, and it is one of the few video games that has been able to evoke a strong emotional response from me. Like with Bioshock, expect to be wowed both by the unique setting and a complex storyline that can be interpreted on multiple levels.Graphically this game is on par with other AAA titles. You'll fight across a ruined cityscape of fallen skyscrapers, luxury hotels buried under sand dunes, squalid refugee camps, and impressive sandstorms. They really did a great job here, even little things like the graffiti on the walls is worth looking at.This is a cover-based third person shooter. I hated the cover-based combat in Mass Effect and Splinter Cell because I felt the controls were clunky and unintuitive. Fortunately Spec Ops The Line does the best implementation of cover-based combat I've seen yet, with controls that are both easy and allow for seamless movement. The battles used some interesting gameplay mechanics. Sometimes sandstorms will sweep across the battlefield, which severely affects your accuracy and visibility -- but this is a doubled-edged sword, because the enemies are likewise hindered. Many times you'll be fighting in skyscrapers submerged under the sand, and you can shoot out the windows to bury nearby enemies under an ocean of sand.Ammo is scarce in this game, so ammo management is important. This makes sense from a storyline perspective but also means that you're going to be switching weapons a lot. This forces the player to learn how to use all the different kinds of weapons, rather than just relying on a few favored guns.You'll have two AI-controlled teammates with you for much of the game, and you can issue orders to them. There are also a few mini-games, for example there's one scene where you're on a moving truck convoy and you've got to protect it. In another scene you've got to aim an artillery strike on an enemy encampment.The plot is mostly linear, but this is OK because the quality is high throughout.The music is a mix of an unobtrusive orchestral score and a few popular songs from the 60s and 70s. I never cared too much for those songs before, but they really fit the setting here.There is a multiplayer mode, if you're a fan of deathmatch-type games. There are also 4 maps designed specifically for co-op! If you like shooters or games with a strong story you'll like Spec Ops: The Line. You should be able to get it relatively cheap, I think I got mine for only $5, and that's a steal for 8+ hours of high quality entertainment.			"

												It's difficult to say anything about Spec Ops: The Line without ruining what makes it what it is. Suffice to say, its strength lies completely in its story, its message, and the fascinating and morbid deconstruction of the modern action game it provides.Its not a 'good' game in the traditional sense; but then again, what it provides is hard to value. And many people will have to judge it for themselves. But I reccomend it, if only because its the only game of its kind to truly make an impact.After all these years, its (in)famous reputation has spread across the 'net, so spoilers are abound. Which is sad, because it's an experience people need to play through first to truly appreciate. But that experince has stood the test of time, and to this day is still just as brilliant and terrible as ever.So, if you've never/barely have heard of Spec Ops up to this point, and have a strong stomach, pick it up and play it. Because I can garuntee there's nothing that comes close to it. No matter what other people may say or think of it, Spec Ops is the only game that has ever changed the way I look at games, forever.

												Sometimes is sad for me to say that there are games who we judge of how they look at first instance, or how they sound by the tittle. Or hell even of just what they show on the trailer (which will make the most sense). Sometimes if you don’t do a lot of research you may come across one of those cases on which you expect sometime in a game and turns out to be sometime completely different. In most cases is a game that looked good but it turn out to be bad, but in the case of Spec Ops the Line is just some 3rd person shooter type of call of duty that in reality turns out to be a very much enhancing and twisted adventure that “plays with the player”, speaking of the traumas of war in a gory and dark way. It all comes down with the story and the pace that this brings to the game, the type of emotions that you may feel as you lead your squad who is looking for survivors in a post-apocalyptic Dubai after a massive sandstorm (in resume). That’s how you started the game, in an instance you may think that it is not too much in depth as I point out before, same may be said for the characters, there just your standard soldiers following orders (there is even a funny one). But it is as soon as all plans start to hit south when the game gets to shine, and it shines in a really messy pattern.Without getting to many spoilers, in the middle of your researching you encounter dead soldiers from the previous team that were trying to rescue the survivors of the recent apocalypse, followed by angry locals that you sadly will have to gun down. You quickly start to think that the rebels had gone crazy and are confronting the USA soldiers that came to help and that the story will move on a monotonous military style way, well not on this case since later on those same comrade soldiers will be trying to wipe you down for “invading and threating their mission” (wait what?) so you are forced to defend yourself and nail down basically everybody, looking who brainwashed this soldiers, but are they really? Here is when you begin to question the game itself of whether or not you’re making the right decisions, asking if you are the bad guy or the good guy, who is the hero? Because the enemy may have a point of their actions that could only be or may not be known until the end of the game, your squad is also asking themselves the same thing, Is this the reality of the situation or is it just an illusion caused by war traumas?I wanted to make a lot of emphasis to that because you as the player may also be in doubt every time you take a headshot, don’t get me wrong the game is scripted for the most part with merely some decision that really doesn’t affect the game’s outcome. These heavy story points and the fact that you are unsure of the protagonist’s actions is what really will make you feel the pain that the soldiers are having, as if you were there as well. That is a unique interactivity that is hard to get in other games of the same genre, especially military base shooter, it also helps that there is not a lot of cut scenes more than the necessary to tell the story, is a game that lets you play without killing the pace, maybe it was intentional or not, either way it works. As for the rest of the aspects, it plays as you may think a third person shooter is. You carry up to 2 weapons, each with different characteristics, you can crouch, take cover, give minimal orders to your teammates and even sneak on approach if you desire. It’s all very simple and solid, but sometimes the cover and sprinting system can be frustrating, doing things that you may not wanted that leads to a painful dead and then to repeat several minutes due to not so great checkpoints. There is of course the obvious turret and “scripted you have got to be kidding” parts of the game that you could expect by this style of shooter, which can actually be delightful (maybe because of the fact that are not a lot and very far between), but other than that there is not a lot of anything else than shooting until you go through the 6 to 7 hours of the campaign. So gameplay wise it’s not revolutionary and it doesn’t merge much with the storytelling, just kind of there in another room, working for the most part. There is also multiplayer, which is probably death by now so why bother, that can also be consider as an extra. Basically is the single player  gameplay in objectives of team death matches and so on, with unbalanced progression system and coop options, not really a lot to look at there and I really didn’t play it too much to know about it.Other things that have to be say here are the graphic and sound option, and the PC port itself. Game use unreal 3 engine with several light adjustments that make it look just beautiful, followed by nice post-apocalyptic worlds and the amazing sand storms that happen time to time, affecting even gameplay. Merge that with compelling and fairly accurate tracks on the background, as well as ambience sounds and themes) you will have a good taste of a Dubai filled with sand (interesting setting may have to tell). The port is also great, taking advantage of my pc as much as it could without lagging, even if I max it out, and you may argue that there is not a lot of graphic option or pc features, but in the end is still a console focused game, at least it doesn’t run poorly. Spec Ops the Line is like a kid in high cool trying to be one of the cool mainstream guys, hiding his characteristic that makes him great and innovative with layers of monotony and explosions. There is more than that on this game, like I explained extendedly, there is that emotional aspect that makes you feel a doubt of who is really the bad guy here or what is really happening, the plot or even the game is playing with you and that’s something not a lot of military shooters really have. Solid gameplay for the most part and good visual made this grim tale something to remember and also something that really deserved more attention back in 2012.			"

												8/10Brilliant storyline. 10/10 for that. Immersive, shocking. Several moments that really highlighted the horrors of war, especially knowing that it ws you that pulled the trigger. This game will make you hate yourself.Gameplay, however, holds back this otherwise amazing experience.1. As a tactical shooter, cover plays a very important role. The cover mechanics in this game, however, are laughable. Often, the only way to get from cover to cover is to stand up and fully revealing yourself to the enemy. The game enters and exits cover in very counterintuitive ways, which, again, often means you will be stainging up in full view of the enemy.This shouldn't be a problem. Cover mechanics are nothing new. Mass Effect, Deus EX: HR, etc all have done infinitely better.2. The squad commands are limited to ""kill this guy"". Not even ""hold back"", which means your two vulnerable squadmates will sometimes rush, then require medical attention deep into enemy lines. Other than that, the game is amazing.			"

												Wow, now here's a suprise.  What starts off as a bland Gears of War style third person shooter, turns into a gripping war drama that looks at the horrors of war and what is right and wrong. Throughout most the game the shooting is functional albiet not that special but it's the story that really carries the experience and makes you want to keep playing. Spec Ops does what other modern shooters wish they could do, it makes you care, care about the choices you have to make along the way and about the characters that are involved. Spec Ops: The Line is a dark and gloomy ride that provides a refreshing experience from modern military shooters and whilst at first it seems just a shallow, this is done intentionally to lull you into a false frame of mind to make the experience all that more suprising. So if you see it on sale and you're up for a different kind of shooter that emphasis atmosphere and story then give it a try!			"

												Spec Ops: The Line, man oh man was that a great game.  While the game was a very generic third person shooter, it had an amazing story, very similar to Heart of Darkness or Apocalypse Now.   You see the transformation of a man into a monster as he makes his way through the game, and sometimes you fell really bad about some of the things that go down.   The Sandstorm and falling sand concept was interesting, though not much of a game changer.  Mutliplayer however is dead, I think I've managed to play five games the entire time I've owned it, and three of them were a friend and I against one random who popped into the game.  So the game looks good, plays well but bland, but its the story that keeps you hooked.  Don't bother with multiplayer unless you have some friends who might be kind enough to play with you.  I'd say this game is a 9/10 in my eyes, and yes this game has a few flaws, but its nothing game breaking, and to some people they might not even be flaws.  So I would recommend picking this game up, it isn't much since its been out for a while, or get it when it comes on sale, you won't regret it, and you'll get your money's worth out of it.  K thanks.			"

												It's a shame that Yager have publicly stated that there won't be a Spec Ops sequel as there is enough evidence in this game to hint at rich promises.In Spec Ops: The Line you are Captain Walker in charge of an elite Delta squad consisting of Staff Sergeant Lugo, the sniper, and Liutenant Adams, the heavy gunner. The premise is simple, your mission is to enter Dubai, confirm the statuses of Colonel John Konrad; who with his squad, the Damned 33rd, attempted to lead a rescue effort for the storm ravaged city of Dubai, and any remaining survivors of the storm, then radio for extraction. What follows however is anything but simple as you find yourself led deeper into the heart of the city, coming directly into contact with the conflict between the 33rd, the civilians and the CIA.In an ever shifting narrative where the lines between good and evil are constantly evolving yet becoming increasingly blurred , it is without a doubt that the story is the work of breathtaking brilliance. The game does not shy away from showing the ravages of war and how it can take its toll on individuals. Playing through the game, there are evocative and poignant moments which causes one to pause, think and consider. Even the collectibles in the game demand to be sought after as they genuinely add further to the story, providing additional layers to the narrative and helping to provide some enlightening backstories to some of the characters in the game.Unsurprisingly there are certain parts in the game where you are given a decision to make, whether it be to save a few civilians here or rescue a potentially valuable informat there. Whilst this adds a bit of variety proceedings, it is disappointing to see that the consequences of these decisions have little bearing in the grander scheme of the story so there is little in the way of replayability. Furthermore the gamplay itself is rather subpar. There is little to excite the player with the now standard 'on-the-rails' vehicle section making its way into the game to inspire a change of pace. The shooting itself can prove clunky at times and your team are largely annonymous in a gunfight. However the subpar gameplay is never too intrusive as to ruin the experience. Indeed it may be appropriate for it complements the story. It feels restrained, modest and bare. This way, the gameplay perfectly chimes with the wider subdued tone of the game where the horrors of war unfold. As such your focus remains firmly on the narrative.Visually speaking, Yager have achieved that sun-kissed perished paradise look that suggests a ruined landscape shorn of its riches. A neat metaphor for Captain Walker's mission. There are memorably evocative passages in the game which arouse a number of emotions in the player. The behaviour of the waves of sand as they bury enemies underneath is also believable. Yet the sand really comes into its own element in online multiplayer where the shifting terrain can alter and shift the balance of matches, offering greater tactical depth and encouraging careful planning.Overall Spec Ops: The Line is a welcome addition to the bloated shooting genre. It stands out on its own with its daring original story, distinctive setting and complex characters. Whilst it does not offer the brash, over-the-top, adrenaline filled fun of other shooters, enjoyment can still be had from this slow-burning, emotionally affecting, multi-faceted adventure.			"

												Spec Ops: The Line is a good shooter and a FANTASTIC story!  I played this game thinking it's just another war shooter game...  Boy was I wrong!  The narrative and themes tackled in this game are thought provoking to say the least.  The journey will take you to some dark corners and make you reassess some of your preconceptions... Special thanks to the developers for their tremendous work in this game!  I could tell that there was a lot of love and passion behind such a project and I hope to see more story telling of this quality in your future games.Verdict: B+			"

												This game is nearly perfect, to be honest.The gunplay is average; it's what you would expect, and it's fun enough. The game is just short enough so that it doesn't get boring.The graphics are great and still perform well even now due to the stylized sunburst filters and gorgeous emphasis of sand.The real kicker is the story. An epic tale of one man's quest to save the people of Dubai and how it all turns bad. That's all that I should say.EDIT: I have caught myself throughout the day thinking about ways that things could have happened differently had I made different decisions.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i just finished the game and im going to go all out on this review.Spec Ops: The Line explained as:A Third-Person modern military Shooter designed to challenge players' morality by putting them in the middle of unspeakable situations. | This description matches a small part of the game, you are putin unspekable situations to judge your morality, the game slowly turns against you till the ending.What would you do? Save the civilians or save a military guy who has info?You are Captain Martin Walker leader of delta squad which is You, Sgt Lugo and Lt Adam.You are sent on a mission to evacuate dubai but things turn a rough corner you are attacked by the 33rd which is the only law in dubai since its a war zone, that war zone turns from hell to hell lucifer ♥♥♥♥ed me in the♥♥♥♥♥with a big ♥♥♥♥ing black dragon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hell.You are put between tough choices save the civilians or continue with your mission?This game really captures and explains WAR's true form, either you survive or you dont, in this case you survive or do you? Even i cannot explain it, your true form survives but your spirit is dead and confused or is it now? Do i recommend this game? HELL YES I DO! PLAY IT RIGHT NOW!Is the price right for the game? Hell yes it is best money i ever spent.Should i watch a youtube video to get the feel and dont buy it? Your choice but if you want to expirience the true nature buy the game and play it.Why buy it when i can crack it? : Fine go ahead and crack it, but the developers really won their money with this game, its one amazing game and they deserve every cent.

												SO:TL is hard to classify, but it falls into that awesome zone ""Games About Games"" because this technically is a ""Shooter About Shooters.""  What I really want to do is spoil the hell out of this and share in the mindblow, but I guess you'll just have to play it.  Don't miss it.This one hurts to play, but that's because the truth hurts.

PROS:+ cool gameplay feel+ really awesome story+ big variety of weapons+ enviromental tactics+ multiple endings+ atmosphere and look of apocalyptic DubaiCONS:- somewhat linear levels- standard shooting without any inovation- multiplayer is badComment:The gameplay is great, while the levels are linear there is still room for you to choose your tactic and at the very least each level plays differently. You have to use tactics, whether it is the enviroment or your squadmates, you will need both. The game is fun just on the gameplay aspect itself. But the story, holy bonkers, the story is great. Not going to spoil anything but simply put this starts as your usual middle-east shooter and ends, well, somewhere else. And has different outcomes dependant on your choice. How to describe this game to give it justice ...well ... this is a fantastic piece of video game art!			"

												8/10.As a shooter, Spec Ops is solid but shallow. There is a glaring lack of stealth gameplay; weapons loadout is forced on the player, with sniper rifles conveniently leaning against the wall 10 meters before each sniping opportunity; and the combat system itself misses the opportunity to capitalise on the three-man squad setup.This game leads you by the nose - little effort is made create the illusion of free roaming. This is forgivable, as the narrative by and large manages to stride between two cliches - the patriotic shoot 'em up, and the war is hell morality play - avoiding both (for the most part). Spec Ops does a good job of engaging the player by presenting meaty moral decisions with real impact. Given this, the times (one in particular) when choice is removed from the player, when you are forced to make one egregious choice when others are so obviously available, are both glaring and unforgivable.Despite all this, the game has a consistent, unique style. If played in one or two sittings, you may find yourself swept along by the narrative, and at times genuinely moved, like I did.			"

												As PC Gamer states ""Set my Brain on FIRE!"" I have to agree; the most unique Single-Player game in ages; especially as a military shooter - I am surprised a company had the balls to pull off a story as dark and ♥♥♥♥ED UP as this games story; with moral choices you are forced to make that change the reactions and outcome; and three differing final endings (with an optional ending prior to those as well) - it's the only military shooter that focuses on being a dark amazing SP work of art rather than a cash cow yearly franchise of patrotism and heroism about saving the world from terrorists.Perhaps in Spec Ops: The Line no choice is good or bad at the moment. It's all just horrifying; overly disturbingly realistic in the best way possible and leaves you thinking for days after - a contender for best story in a game at the end of the year for SURE.			"

												Apart from the somewhat clunky control mechanics, I really liked the story to this game. I wont give any spoilers, but if you want to do horri-bad things that seem good at the moment, buy this game as soon as possible. It's a very tough feat for a gaming company to really make their players attached to the characters of the game, and 2K Games really hit the nail on the head in that field. The Inception-like storyline really starts to stray from the road-most-travelled like COD usually does (no offense to COD fanboys), which is a great breath of fresh air for people like me, who like a good shoot-em-up, but get tired of the average FPS.

												This cover to cover first-person-shooter seems a run of the mill at first, but hits a spot alot of other first-person-shooters missed for me. The well written, adult plot starts basic, but the development the charakters make true visual and physiological makes this game!  Spec ops: The Line is dirty and shoves it in you'r face; gore, torture, posttraumatic stress disorder, all kinds of craziness. It all comes together graphics, sound, gameplay. Downside thats its short, 8 to 10 hours.I will come back for another playtrought in the future. Very well done Shooter, i recommend it!  "

												Easily the BEST stand alone story I have ever played. This game has some of the best voice acting available. It isn't afraid of being gritty. Spec Ops: The Line is a must have. Gameplay is decent enough, but you won't be playing this for top of the line gameplay. Its the top of The Line story that makes this game something truly special.			"
