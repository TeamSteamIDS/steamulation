												If anybody else had trouble to start up this game like me then here is what i did to fix it.1) If steam remains stuck in preparing to launch. Make sure the game is installed on the same hard drive as steam. Usually the C drive.2) If the game flickers. Go to your steamapps/common folder then safecracker2. In config AND STEAM_config files change bFullScreen=1 TO bFullScreen=0 and save.3) I also had the game freeze on a black screen. To resolve this in my case i went to Nvidia control panel, manage 3d settings. Safecracker2 then manually turn Antialiasing mode to off. That solved all my issues and yes it was worth it.I love games that put your brain to the test and Safecracker certainly did that!The puzzles were varied enough to keep the whole experience interesting. It was nice having a subtle story behind it too, as it gave it more meaning. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy solving puzzles and feel rewarded when they finally crack a safe. Took around 6 hours to complete and i found having a pen and paper handy helped :)			"

												This is a puzzle game for those who genuinely like puzzles. If you think most puzzle games are too easy, you will like this one. Note I am saying the game is challenging, not obtuse. The solutions are fair in this title. You may have to look for context clues, but they are there.In 2015, the graphics are nothing to write home about, they still look good in my eyes. This is an old school click-to-move first-person puzzler, by the way. No true 3D here.The audio is fairly thrilling and haunting when it wants to be. Player character is masterfully voice-acted by some British fellow whose name I cannot track down.One last thing. This is an old game. You will need to play it in windowed mode. The game does not provide a way to do this out of editing a file named config.ini in the game's directory. Edit the bFullscreen variable in this file to equal 0 instead of 1. The game is worth the trouble.			"

												This is not a game for everybody, but I LOVED it. As other reviewers are saying, it won't hold your hand--the puzzles are pretty darn difficult and usually don't explain themselves. But that's the appeal for me. It's like I really get to be a detective in some movie or something, and I have nothing but my wits to go on. The downside to the difficulty is, of course, you WILL get frustrated from time to time--pretty often, in fact, so if you don't like scratching your head too much, this isn't your game. But the difficulty of the puzzles and having to figure out even what you have to do to figure them out means that you get a huge rush from solving them. Not joking, the satisfaction of solving these things is great, makes ya feel like an extra-special clever lil cupcake. Beating the game made me feel like a genius.I do want to point out, someof the puzzles require you to give up on the room you're working through, try another route, then come back when you've gained a clue or insight from somewhere later in the game. If you have to come back to a puzzle, it doesn't mean you've failed, and you're probably doing what you're actually supposed to by saving it for later.The problems I did have were mostly interface ones: when you do get a verbal clue from your character, it is only ever said once, and there's no way of it being logged in a Notes menu or anything, so if you go AFK for a minute at the wrong time or don't have your sound turned on, you can miss the hint completely. The hints usually aren't going to be crucial to solving a given puzzle, though. Also, I wished it was easier to move around the house; because the game is a point-and-click, you walk down hallways by clicking your mouse in the direction you want to go, and the screen changes to the part of the room you're in as you move. There is a map in your menu that gets marked off when you solve the puzzle in that room, and I wanted to be able to ""fast-travel"" or something similar by clicking on the room I wanted to go to, instead of having to go through the whole house one scene-frame at a time. It IS a point-and-click from the early-2000s, though, so not a lot to be expected there.Overall, I loved the game, and when I was done, I went and bought another whole package of point-and-click puzzlers from the same company, I liked it so much!

												Oh puzzles how you annoy me so, but I keep coming back because you also intrigue me.I have not beat this game so my opinion is subject to change however the premise of this game is quite nice and both hilarious at the same time. The idea a rich guy retired and went into making ridiculous puzzles to hide his fortune is quite interesting and funny. That being said this game makes me rage quit a lot, maybe I am not good at puzzles but I generally find myself stomped on puzzles trying to figure them out. Till i recently tried taking a picture and pasting it into gimp to put trials for example of what i tried and what failed in different colors. It felt really cool planning out the path to complete the puzzle in some instances and gratifying when it worked. The game links puzzles together in some instances where you get parts for completing some puzzles and had to piece them together to complete others to go into the rooms. I really liked how the system worked basically the locks on doors were only accessed through solving the puzzles around you and limited your freedom of movement but the more you solved puzzles and opened doors the more pathways you had to return to places you came back from. I would defintly recommend this game to people who like puzzles and jotting down notes trying to work out what paths didn't work out or not to deduce where to go to beat it!

												Despite being old, it's worth its current value. Not-over-complicated puzzles with logical solutions make this game a very enjoyable experience minimizing frustration moments. It features nice pre-rendered old-school 360º scenes coupled with somewhat suitable music. It's not too long, with about 30 totally different puzzles to solve and about 5 hours of gameplay.Due to its age, it doesn't come without technical problems:Resolution is fixed to 1024x768 which will stretch on wide-screen monitors.On some installations, the game flickers constantly making it unplayable. This seems to be related to FPS and nVidia adapters. I have no problems on AMD. Either way, the solution is to go windowed mode, which is covered in the forums.In short, taking into account its release date and current price, a very recommendable product.			"

												Interesting, to say the least. Safecracker is a Point-n-Click style adventure game with a first-person perspective and 3D environment. You play as a professional safecracker hired to find the long-lost will of some guy who owns an oil rig. This game was released in late 2006 and the graphics are pretty stellar for it's time. Clean, sharp textures and smooth lighting. However, this isn't saying much as the majority of the game takes place inside an old Victorian manor. The puzzles are very interesting and require a wide variety of logic and situational awareness.  My only complaint is the somewhat steep learning curve for some of the puzzles. I've also heard that this game isn't optimized for♥♥♥♥♥♥ so keep that in mind if you're considering buying.OVERALL RATING: 6.5/10			"

												Doesn't work on newer operating systems! It's unconscionable that Valve would even leave this up on the store.Remember: Steam's refund policy only works if you refund it right away. Pick it up on sale and then discover a few months later the game doesn't work? Your money is SUNK. It pretty much ruins using Steam sales to build a backlog because now you have to test every single game you get.At this moment I'm leaving the game open 3 more minutes because I'm literally not allowed to say the game doesn't work until it sits there functionless long enough to satisfy Valve.

												Another pleasant surprise in a bargain. I thought it would be a safe cracking simulation game, but in fact it is a nice collection of puzzles with pleasant graphics, a plot, and a British accented narrator. Similar concept as in The 7th Guest, only absolutely not spooky and without cinematics or lenghty animations in the puzzles. The graphics are pre-rendered, with a 360-degrees free look system which worked surprisingly well for me. The game is not without humour, solutions to puzzles are sometimes so unpredictable. None are sadistically difficult, but some require pen and paper to work them out. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys well designed puzzles. Although it is for Windows only, I play it on a Macbook Pro using Crossover.			"

												On Windows 7, this game is a flickering mess because apparently the double buffering failed or something. The German voiceovers are amateurish and sound American. Not sure about the gameplay, but the start of it wasn't very challenging.Be aware that there are at least three different games called ""Safe Cracker"" - if you have fond memories of one, this might not be it.[Addendum: On my old XP machine, the game runs as intended. For the first 20 minutes or so, the puzzles were mildly challenging, then a slide/rotate puzzle with far too many parts annoyed me into quitting.]			"

												First of all - yeah, when I first started this game on my Win7 it had a twitchy picture and was virtually unplayable. My solution was to run it in windowed mode (via config file). Not a perfect way, but I've hardly seen any downsides.Apart from that - don't get it wrong. It is a puzzle-puzzle game. It's short, it has next to nonexistent plot (which at the ending seems not only nearly nonexistent, but unnecessary as well). All in all - guys, it's not Myst, ok? It's a collection of assorted puzzles in a comfy environment. It will be a mistake to see it as anything but.And so, the cornerstone of the game - puzzles. Puzzles are mostly really good. Some are quite inventive, some do a sort of unexpected play on widely known puzzle (like a famous pipeline puzzle with restricted movements, for instances) But, well, at the same time couple of puzzles are really dumb, while others just require decent amount of mix-and-match, which is not that fun. And of course, it can't be unmentioned - The confederate Cipher wheel WAS NOT used this way. It's a vanilla Caesar cipher in game! Come on, son! The whole point of cipher wheel is to scramble the letter statistics. Why can't you've used the proper codeword instead?! Oh, and a 6 moving pins puzzle is WAY too easy for it's own idea. That said, other puzzles are fairly decent and inventive, though I've actually managed to solve 2 or 3 of them by semi-random clicking.So there you have it, it's a compendium of puzzles set in a nicely drawn decor. Some are genuinely good, some are fairly stupid, some are unnecessary hard (that damn broken lock!). So pick it up on a sale cheap, go have your grey matter for a swing for an evening or two, but be cautious whether you'd manage to run it properly on a modern system.			"

												In this point and click game, you move from room to room unlocking safes and solving more puzzles to get more clues (and pieces of other puzzles) to solve more puzzles until you finally solve them all and say ""oh good, I solved all the puzzles.'For the first time in aaaaaaages I found myself using a sheet of paper to solve puzzles in a video game. This was a pleasant surprise - I found myself noting things I'd never need, as well as making notes that really helped me solve puzzles without having to backtrack to look at something again. Don't be fooled - the game does give you some clues you can take with you, but some things have to be carried in your memory only. My memory is awful, so I used paper. I am only writing this review so that I don't buy this game again by mistake. That's how bad my memory is.Do you like solving puzzles? This game has some neat puzzles, and I don't think a single answer annoyed me, which is rare.Do you hate sliding tile puzzles? I do! But this game only has 1, and you can cheat (like I did. I have no shame. I hate sliding puzzles). The game is linear in the sense that you will need to solve some puzzles before you can solve others, but it is also not linear in that you don't need to unlock a clue before you can solve a puzzle. I solved one early puzzle by writing a simple script. Later I found a clue that was useless to me at that point, because I'd already solved the puzzle. The game didn't make me wait until I'd found the clue, which was great. It's awful to play a game like this and know that even if you're entering the right code, it won't work because you didn't pick up a porcelain pig with the number 7 scratched on its♥♥♥♥♥There are no porcelain pigs in this game. Porcelain pigs are not playable characters. If you like pigs this might still be the game for you, but don't go into this expecting pigs. There are 100% more pigs in this review than there are in the game.For the first time in aaaaaaages I found myself using a sheet of paper to solve puzzles in a video game.

I am only writing this review so that I don't buy this game again by mistake. That's how bad my memory is.The game is kind of short, but it's stable enough that you can tab in and out, so you can play it when you're supposed to be working and then tab out to pull up notepad++ or whatever it is you use at work. I don't know - I've probably never even seen you before, so how would I know what you use. Maybe you are unemployed. Maybe you made a ton of money lawyering and retired ridiculously early to rule an Internet Space Empire and have a cute dog. It's all good here, we're just talking about a little game about solving puzzles. I'm not judging you. I'm judging this game, and it is pretty good. Is it $5 good? Yeah, it's worth the price of a sandwich. Even if its a sandwich you have to cram resistors in before you can eat it.The game might be a bit of a puzzle to get started. That happened to me but I edited my config files. If you have a problem making this run, go to your Steam directory and go to /steamapps/common/Safecracker2 and open config.ini and STEAM_config.ini and change bFullScreen=1 to bFullScreen=0 in both of them. If you have notepad++ you can do it there.The ending is a bit bland and I don't think I will be replaying to get all the different endings. It might be my imagination but at the end the narrator seemed to start talking as fast as the people at the end of financial product advertisements where they cram in all the stuff about how you will probably go bankrupt and lose your house and the respect of all but the lowest of bums. This actually made the ending better, especially as I looked away for a moment because my printer started working.That's the biggest mystery. WHY DID MY PRINTER START WORKING.I'll tell you why. At the end, the game says ""do you want to print the will?"" and I said ""Yes, sure,"" thinking I'd be able to read it on the screen. Of course it really tried to print the will, and I stopped it by hammering the big red x button until the printer stopped making noise. If you are the kind of person who is married and likes to play games at night while your spouse is sleeping in the same room and you have a loud printer and you are likely to just click in the affirmative on a button that says ""DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A NUCLEAR-DETONATION LEVEL OF NOISE RIGHT NOW?"" then this might not be the game for you.It's not bedtime yet so I got away with this. I'm wondering if I should print the will, though. I don't have that recent a save file. If I don't print the will, I will miss out on the game's REAL final puzzle. If I do print the will it will all be white text on black and it will cost me an extra $30 to have played this game. It's like the cat in the box but all the outcomes are bad, like if you were allergic to cats but also terrified of cat corpses.I liked playing this game, it was a pretty good time for $2.50. If you want a pretty good time and you have $2.50 then I HEAR YOUR MOM MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT. "

												In general I hate oldschool adventure games, with their nonsense non-logic, pixel hunting, try everything on everything, and generally broken mechanics.This isn't one of those, instead it's a series of discrete, self-contained logic puzzles. Most players will probably have seen at least some of these puzzle types before.The story is minimal and mostly serves as a loose way to tie the puzzles together.I enjoyed this because if I got stuck it was because I was too dumb to logically figure it out, and not because of the reasons that generally put me off adventure games.

												This game will NOT work right off the bat. However, I was able to make it run on my Windows 8.1 by doing the following: 1. In NVIDIA control panel, change settings to Antialiasing: Off (as NAYKID said in another review)2. Enable compatibility mode for Windows 7.Game didn't run perfectly smoothly, but it was good enough for me and perfectly playable, just a little bit on the slow side.As far as the game itself: definitely worth $1.24 if you get it in a sale. There are many different types of puzzles, and they range in difficulty from some very easy ones to some extremely difficult/obscure ones. Most of the harder ones have some sort of clue somewhere, but they can sometimes be tricky to spot. I needed to consult a walkthrough often, but back when I first played this (several years ago now) I ALWAYS needed a walkthrough, being quite impatient, so that may not be the best help. There's a pretty big house to roam around and many different puzzles to solve, and only one or two were of the sort that didn't make sense in hindsight.It's not a huge or spectacular game, but it's worth a small amount of money to get if you enjoy this sort of game.-EIF			"

Not worth full price, recommended because I got it as a part of a bundle.I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would. I got it as part of The New Adventure Company Hits Collection when it was on sale (I wanted some of the games there and the price difference wasn't that much at the time, so I thought wth). Considering how old it is and that the graphics isn't pretty, I was surprised that I kept wanting to finish the game after I started it. Despite being very short (~6 hours for me) and the old graphics, the voice acting, the story, and the puzzles were enough to keep me engaged.It's not worth the full price, but I'd recommend it at 90% off or as part of a bundle.

												This is a beautiful puzzle game. It provided me some hours of thrilling, frustration and happiness.The fact that the player has to solve different types of puzzles keeps the game exciting to be played.If you are willing to play this, you may need some information from the internet in order to complete about 2 of the puzzles, but they are very specific and you will know it when the time comes. Otherwise, I highly recommend you to do not search any answer in the internet. If you get stucked, just give it an hour, or a day. When you return, things might be much more clear and the joy of success will come right after.The click-to-walk mechanic is interesting and the story gives context and meaning to the game. Very good.			"

												It's a collection of puzzle games, loosely connected by simple storyline. In most cases, solving a puzzle will grant you an item or a hint which you need to solve another puzzle. Unfortunately it's not very intuitive that you need a hint or a specific item to solve a puzzle when you first take a look at it. The difficulty of the various puzzles varies a lot. All in all it's fun nonetheless as long as you buy it when it's on sale.			"

												Unforgivingly cruel, to be honest. There were plenty of the puzzles that made absolutely no sense as to how to solve them. After finding the method online, the puzzles were a little more fun, but still, the game just ran you around in circles, with no hints or clues as to solve any of the number of safes. The visuals themselves were pretty great, with lots of pretty scenery to see around the giant house, though I wish the game has been set at a first person view, allowing you to freely view the house, instead of the frame by frame. The voicework was decent, though sometimes being rather emotionless, as if the VA for the expert safecracker just didn't seem to care for it as much, especially during the ending voicework.       Maybe I'm just not as creative or cunning as the rest of the players who might have enjoyed it. I normally enjoy puzzle games, and this one just had me shaking my head. Had I not bought it for 25 cents, I would have probably stayed well away.			"

												First game completed on Steam, very nice!The game is a puzzle-oriented game by the Adventure Company. The most important feature of the game is of different creative safes, giving real challenges to the players. If you are a big fan to this genre, you must be satisfied by the difficulty the puzzles posed to you. It is the first time I have purchased their product and it is worth the money. Thank you for giving me a nice time of ""puzzling"". XD			"

												This game disappoints on almost every front. A spiritual sequel to the 1997 game Safecracker by Daydream Software, this game puts you in the shoes of a professional safecracker tasked with finding the will of a recently deceased oil baron hidden inside his mansion. Now, let's go over the standard review claptrap:Graphics: Good-looking, but terribly bland. For a purported eccentric, this mansion is generic as hell apart from the occasional interesting bit, and it just puts me to sleep. Thumbs down.Sound: Once again, the music is serviceable, but terribly generic. Half of it feels like it's trying to fit into a horror game, but this isn't even close to being a horror game. Thumbs down. Puzzles: The game's strong point, but even then, it doesn't fail to disappoint. Half of the puzzles are painfully uninspired, and even those that are fairly interesting fail to provide a meaty challenge (apart from one that is just unreasonably annoying to go through) and are instead leave you with a fairly resounding ""meh"". And to add insult to injury, the 1997 Safecracker had more interesting puzzles. Thumbs down.Plot: Yes, this game apparently feels its plot is important, and honestly, it's a joke. Way too little time is given to flesh the characters out, and in the end, the game expects us to make a decision based on our judgement of those characters we don't have a bloody clue about. Thumbs down.Overall: A complete disappointment, outclassed on every front by its predecessor, and it comes along with technical problems to boot. Not recommended.			"

												SOOOOO I did some crack last weekend and ended up playing this game (because this game is all about ""cracking"" safe...get it? huehuehue) while listening to the Two Best Friend Cast which is the hypest♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. And here's my review:Graphic and sounds: Why do I start with these parts of the game first? For a game made back in 2006 where I still played pretty much every adventure game based on Agatha Christie's novels, which were also made by The Adventure Company, Safecracker has such a pleasant 3D graphic though the camera is panoramic so you can only move your camera angle without making any actual movements. The soundtracks may not be plentiful but quite attractive to my ears due its intriguing theme provoking my curiosity. Story: The plot of the game is pretty simple. You are an expert on cracking safes, having a stereotypical British accent and get hired by family members of an eccentric multi-millionaire oil tycoon who possesses an interest in making safe EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THEM HAS ANY MONEY IN IT, to find his will. There are subtle plot points on his relationship with his siblings and relatives but they do not weigh in much regarding the gameplay. Gameplay: There is not much gameplay in this game yet you can find the sense of variety due to the *absurd* amount of different ""safes."" There are safes requiring keys, safes using lazzzer, safes using numpad, safes using physics.  It is unlikely to crack a safe similar to another in terms of the solution and how to find it.Difficulty: This is actually my most concern  about puzzle games because games like Syberia and The Longest Journey can be ridiculously hard and impossible due to its fictional logic. Safecracker is on the other side of the spectrum, where everything is logical and sensible given you have the tools to solve it. There are 20-25 safes to be cracked in the game and 5-10 of them require you to use clues retrievable from other puzzles and about 10 other cracks demand you to have keycard or a activating device to use on them first before actually solve them. The average length of time for me to solve 1 safe fluctuated from 5' to 25' and some are ridiculously complex that I needed to get some fresh air before continue cracking it. There are only 2 safes that I have to look up the solution which are the safe with 5 wheels on the 2nd floor and the chess puzzle on the loft.In conclusion, this game is dope and is quite a remnant for its genre. I do not know any similar games that were made recently. I never had to pull my hair which also surprised me and the bloody safes are not that hard to crack at all. This game would even impress me more if it had MOAR safes and the final choice did have any actual meaning or made you feel your decision matter.Score: If Conan O'brien means perfect and Jay Leno is diarrhea after Taco Bell night, then this game gets a Craig Ferguson while flirting with any female guest. Yes, it means the game is good.			"

												I really, really, wanted to play this game. I wanted to enjoy it. I wanted my brain to work! But this game is unplayable on my PC even though I'm absolutely sure I should be able to play it. I can run Far Cry 3, Ultra, no prob. But load up Safecracker, and boy, You're in for a world of headaches. Missing text, flickering UI, black screen unless you start in in windowed mode or only have one monitor. And i can't tell you anything about the gameplay, seeing as I can't even play the dang thing. Im getting 12 FPS max, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, plus at least a half second of input lag throughout. Frankly, it's unplayable! I would love to give this game a chance, but I can't even get to a puzzle within the first 5 minutes, let alone feasibly beat it. I'm sorry, but this might be one product you should avoid altogether.			"

I had trouble with some of the puzzles having a bit weird logic in my opinion, but I've seen that other people think the same puzzle was a breeze, so this game does require you to look at the puzzle from multiple different angles to just find the right angle (just like Myst). A bit short on duration, takes about one or two evenings to complete, but for the price, this is well worth the money.			"

												Really fun game, reminds me of Riven but set in the modern age. Great voice acting, very challenging puzzles. Only criticisms are that it's too short, and there's no achievements (but I don't know how they would be able to fit them in).If you do end up needing a walkthrough, I suggest using the UHS hints located here: http://www.uhs-hints.com/uhsweb/hints/safecracker-2006/1.phpIt's much more useful than a simple walkthrough, as they mostly push you in the right direction rather than spoiling the solution immediately.

												Note - the only way I got this game to work was by hackign the config.ini and changing ""bFullScreen=1"" to ""bFullScreen=0""  Thank you to whoever figured out the fix and to everyone who's posted it.Good graphics but the puzzles varied from silly easy to ""even with the cheat sheet, the logic escapes me"".  The plotline was sparse but serviceable enough though the main character wasn't too bright.  He's an expert safe cracker with no equipment.  If any of the clues in the house had been missing (over zealous maid, for example), the character would have been totally hosed.  I've also come to the conclusion that the character is a vampire.  The sun was already down when he started going through the house and he didn't have a reflection in any of the mirrors.The game has aged well so despite a couple of WTF puzzles I'd recommend it.			"

												This game is (still) broken. I don't remember when I got Safecracker - I think it came as a part of a bundle at some point, so it's brokennesss didn't bother me. I could click ""new game"" and that was it, everything would glitch out and ""catch"" in the opening and prevent me from going futher (or getting out) without a restart. Now, I'm here with a new up to date computer build (note, my old one more than met the system requirements). I can get futher than before, though the skipping in the intro still occurs - I can simply reach the actual game now. It glitches between room transistions and the menu screen only exists for small moments during mouse movement. Technically, I guess it's playable for me now but it's still unacceptably difficult to fiddle with and reach that point. The sound clips sound good, the graphics are pretty enough, and I enjoyed what I got to deal with when it comes to the puzzles themselves. If you're one of the people who this game works for and you like point and click puzzle games, I say give this a try, but as it stands it isn't worth the $5 gamble in my opinion. At best, purchase it (on sale), see if it works, and if not get your refund. The positive reviews on this game imply that it's fun enough if you can get it to work.			"

I have tried everything to get the game to run on my Windows 10 laptop including changing all of the compatibility settings, setting the game to windowed mode and disabling features like antialiasing and the game still only loads the splash screens.To be honest its very unlikely that the devs care at this point considering the number of people complaining. I will be keeping my copy just in case I can get it to work in the future but im not confident it will - it is apparently quite good when it works!Some people have got the game to run fine so if you really want to try it then get the game and test it before the no questions asked refund runs out, I hope it works for you!

This plays the game in windowed mode and goes from unplayable to perfectly smooth.This seems to be the cause of the negative reviews. After fixing this is a perfectly fine game. You play a detective hired by a family to find the will of their deceased uncle. Uncle had a hobby collecting safes, and you have to open several throughout the house to find the will. Each safe with its own unique puzzle-opening, varying in difficulty. Walking through the house you find letters giving some information about the family.

												Pretty good game.Pros: Very satisfying to crack a difficult puzzle. Some of the puzzles were just really fun to figure out (even before you cracked them). Ambiance/atmosphere is nice. Storyline is minimal, but interesting enough. Voice acting was good.Cons: Some puzzles were really frustrating and/or random so I had to resort to a walkthrough a couple times (but that's just me). The puzzle variety was alright, but could have been better (entirely too many keypads for my liking). Replayability is nil. I had to run it in compatibility mode (I have windows 8) to avoid graphical glitches, so no steam overlay. Moving around by clicking is just really tedious sometimes, especially if you're going from one end of the house to the other.Still, despite my complaints, I did enjoy this game.

												The puzzles in this game are pretty good for an indie company although there were a few instances where part of the puzzle was figuring out what the hell you needed to actually do and that was a bit counter-intuitive. Additionally one of the puzzles requires knowledge of the rules of snooker (something I have no idea how to play) and I had to pull a UHS to get through it. Other than that pretty good and definitely challenging.			"

												Mediocre puzzle game with some flaws but overall the puzzles themselves are alright.It took me about 2h to go through the game and I wasn't in a hurry. So don't expect a lengthy game.It has a lot of going back and forth between rooms witch get's a bit annoying after awhile.And some of the problems are trial-and-error based which in my opinion dosen't make them puzzles.A notable example of this is a puzzle in the basement for turning on the light.You are given but one non-appearant clue and just have to fiddle with it until you figure it out.(Or give up and check a guide.)Overall I'd say the game is worth it for the good puzzles but overall as a puzzle game it's mediocre at best.6/10.

												After spending way too long trying to debug this game, I was finally able to play it. This isn't worth $4. Get it on sale. Graphically (when the bugs are out) it really isn't too bad. Its a fun quick play, that only took me about 2 hours. Some of the puzzles are fairly good ones. My only suggestion, is write down things you see that you think might help. As for a recommendation, sure, its a fun fast little game.			"

												Game does not work at all. You'd expect an older game such as this one to run like the wind on current PCs, but nope, this thing lags more than Congress does passing a law. The FPS for a game this age and a computer of my caliber is ridiculously slow, and there are times when the game is nonresponsive to clicks, such as the options menu not working properly. That being said, it looks like a good game, but a good game is nothing if the game is designed badly, which is the case with this game. Do not buy it, even if it's on sale.			"

												A tough puzzle game. Like 'late Myst series' tough.You try to solve a house full of puzzles in which a millionaire left his will. It starts you off easy enough and lulls you into a false sense of smartness when you manage to crack some of the puzzles, but by the end of it you're just banging your head against the wall and having to come back to play every so often because leaving it alone gives you time to think about the puzzle. All the time.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes point and click puzzle games. If you play the game without any walktrough sites you will find it quite challenging.Pros: The game has a somewhat interesting story. Everything is a puzzle and every puzzle is different from the previous. Nice art.Challenging.Cons: The game has some problems while running on full screen on some systems, so you might end up having to play in windowed mode (must edit 2 config files in game dir to switch to windowed mode) which is not that bad after all.

												TLDR: A bit old, but very focused puzzle experience. Recommended if you like puzzles of the slightly harder variety.You are an investigator hired to find the will of a recluse millionaire who also happens to love safes and puzzles. This pretense is used to put you in a mansion full of puzzles. As a story it is not much to get excited about, but that is not the point of Safecracker at all; it is all about the puzzles. Therefore it is good that the puzzles are mostly good an logical. They range from pure logic to observational (you will have to pay attention to notes and hidden signs in the surrounding... they are usually not too tricky to find, as long as you realize you have to look for them and that you are simply not missing an object from another puzzle to progress). Overall it is a fun game that has stood the test of time well. Deserves a playthrough if you like puzzles.			"

												For being an 8+ year old game, it is pretty fun. It is the point and click type. You have to find the Will of some dead guy, who hid it in his many safes around his house, that you have to crack. Downside is, none of the house moves, except for the safes or water that has to do with some puzzles. Also it does not work in full screen mode, I guess being an old game and all.I would rate it maybe 6/10. Still a lot fo fun for the point and click type, but is aint no MYST.			"

												Verdict: Meh...Got it for a few cents.Puzzles are not very hard.It's a 3D game, yet you can't walk around freely, even though you can look around freely at every stop. Not sure if it's a Google maps kind of deal, or if walking around freely would have been 5 lines of additional code. Would have been nice in any case. Also, it can't handle any other resolution than the standard (which is like 800x600 or something), it won't start in a multi monitor setup if the config is not tweaked beforehand, and it likes to crash. I understand that you don't make a top notch engine for a 2h game, yet the gameplay itself is just not enough to amaze me.Graphics are nice, though.			"

Be warned: I only recoomend this game to people who accept that it might not be running without some further steps after the installation. This game is known to cause problems on any system with Win7 or a later version. For me on Win 7 it was sufficient, to edit one entry in the .ini to turn the game into windowed mode, but it seems that this easy step does not work for everybody. So you might be forced to do some additional research and steps to get the game running.While testing said fixing step, I started the game vie it's .exe and not through steam and then finished the game in one session. So my shown game time is incorrect.When the game finaly runs, it is a nice point&Click adventure with some really good puzzles. It's not too long (about 4 hours), but it isn't expensive so that's what you might expect. If it's still too expensive for your likings, wait for a deal or but it within a bundle.I did not experience any bugs inside the game after I got it running.While the game is mostly fun, it's ending is really awsome and, in some kind, unexpected.

												Well, it is 2016 and I got this game off a group deal. Did not have high expectations but after solving the initial 16 fps issue by switching to windowed mode, solving a few puzzles and clicking/moving around, I am abandoning the game.It has crappy gui controls and I find it simply dull, boring, tedious, extremely static and plain OLD!Last time I played something like this was back in 1993, 23 years ago!""The 7th Guest"" it was called and it was impressive at the time with a few animations and a creepy atmosphere. This game seem to have none of that and although I often play older games and have a nostalgic mind, a line has to be drawn at some point.Maybe I'd feel better about it if I would give it more time but then again, why would I when there is so many way better things to waste my precious time on in...after all, 2016!

												Note - the only way I got this game to work was by hackign the config.ini and changing ""bFullScreen=1"" to ""bFullScreen=0""  Thank you to whoever figured out the fix and to everyone who's posted it.Good graphics but the puzzles varied from silly easy to ""even with the cheat sheet, the logic escapes me"".  The plotline was sparse but serviceable enough though the main character wasn't too bright.  He's an expert safe cracker with no equipment.  If any of the clues in the house had been missing (over zealous maid, for example), the character would have been totally hosed.  I've also come to the conclusion that the character is a vampire.  The sun was already down when he started going through the house and he didn't have a reflection in any of the mirrors.The game has aged well so despite a couple of WTF puzzles I'd recommend it.			"

												This game is (still) broken. I don't remember when I got Safecracker - I think it came as a part of a bundle at some point, so it's brokennesss didn't bother me. I could click ""new game"" and that was it, everything would glitch out and ""catch"" in the opening and prevent me from going futher (or getting out) without a restart. Now, I'm here with a new up to date computer build (note, my old one more than met the system requirements). I can get futher than before, though the skipping in the intro still occurs - I can simply reach the actual game now. It glitches between room transistions and the menu screen only exists for small moments during mouse movement. Technically, I guess it's playable for me now but it's still unacceptably difficult to fiddle with and reach that point. The sound clips sound good, the graphics are pretty enough, and I enjoyed what I got to deal with when it comes to the puzzles themselves. If you're one of the people who this game works for and you like point and click puzzle games, I say give this a try, but as it stands it isn't worth the $5 gamble in my opinion. At best, purchase it (on sale), see if it works, and if not get your refund. The positive reviews on this game imply that it's fun enough if you can get it to work.			"

Did not have high expectations but after solving the initial 16 fps issue by switching to windowed mode, solving a few puzzles and clicking/moving around, I am abandoning the game.It has crappy gui controls and I find it simply dull, boring, tedious, extremely static and plain OLD!Last time I played something like this was back in 1993, 23 years ago!""The 7th Guest"" it was called and it was impressive at the time with a few animations and a creepy atmosphere. This game seem to have none of that and although I often play older games and have a nostalgic mind, a line has to be drawn at some point.Maybe I'd feel better about it if I would give it more time but then again, why would I when there is so many way better things to waste my precious time on in...after all, 2016!

												This game looked like a lot of fun, however the the interface is too glitchy words on menu options to show up, none of the onscreen displays work correctly and when navigating the mansion it flashed horribly and I was feeling like I was about to get sick. despite this I decided to still give it a try, managed to play/crack the first safe but since the gui was broke so bad I was unable to read the keycode to get to the next area. Just incase anyone is thinking I could be attempting to play this on a commadore 64 or something, no it's not my system for example I have over 1000 (yes 3 zeroes) time the recomended RAM.			"

												Nice oldie.A beautiful mansion to explore with relaxing music and comfy atmosphere.Ran like a charm on my toaster, and than I managed to get it working on a new machine by looking through community suggestions, which I'd also recommend you do. A game like this is better enjoyed in moderation, just keep coming back to it time after time.I had to look up 2 puzzles, the phone and a switch, which had me facepalmed at my stupidity, and the snooker puzzle, which was moderately confusing. Some might have been harder actually, but maybe I lucked out on them.The feeling when the puzzle is solved is always rewarding.Wrapping up, nice puzzles and atmosphere, but take a look at required specs and the forums first.

												The biggest puzzle is to find a solution to get it running on post-90's personal computer. Once you've figured out starting it in window-mode, it gives you a blast. Not. Therefore, I'm going to recommend this game to all people who want to play Counter-Strike. Just try this one here, it's much more elaborate. Do it. Seriously, do it.			"

												Finally some challenging puzzle which is not blatantly obvious or cluelessly difficult (I remember the poetry to play the piano in Silent Hill to unlock the medal which is one of the baddest ideas ever).Good game, it will let you have fun times if you like puzzles.			"

												Note - the only way I got this game to work was by hackign the config.ini and changing ""bFullScreen=1"" to ""bFullScreen=0""  Thank you to whoever figured out the fix and to everyone who's posted it.Good graphics but the puzzles varied from silly easy to ""even with the cheat sheet, the logic escapes me"".  The plotline was sparse but serviceable enough though the main character wasn't too bright.  He's an expert safe cracker with no equipment.  If any of the clues in the house had been missing (over zealous maid, for example), the character would have been totally hosed.  I've also come to the conclusion that the character is a vampire.  The sun was already down when he started going through the house and he didn't have a reflection in any of the mirrors.The game has aged well so despite a couple of WTF puzzles I'd recommend it.			"

												If you like puzzles, this game is for you!I love Myst-like games. This one is almost all puzzles with a simple story and only a little adventuring, but I loved it just the same.My favorite part is that many of the puzzles are self-contained; no trapesing about to find clues - most of what you need is right in front of you or there is an obvious connection (like keys for locks, parts for machines, etc.). I took frequent breaks as I got stuck a few times, but I almost always had the ah-ha moment I needed right after returning to the game.Note: I ran the game on a 64-bit Windows 7 computer in windowed mode and it ran almost perfectly. (I had to edit the config file to make it run in windowed mode - ""bFullScreen=0"".) Make sure to look at other reviews and the forum to make sure it will work on your setup and find out what tweaks you might have to perform. And try it out before Steam's two week return window has passed.P.S. At the end of the game there is an option to print something. If you say yes, it will print on your default printer without any further warning or options. It may be worth it to try once, but you won't see the system print dialog - it just does it.			"
