												WARNING! THIS GAME CAN BE DIFFICULT!But, AH! The memories! :DThe protagonist of this memorable tale is named Abe. A Mudokon who was born a slave and works for RuptureFarms, a meat processing factory. One day Abe discovers that he and his kind are to be sent to the slaughterhouse. Not only that, they will soon become the ""new & tasty"" delicasy on the menu! He decides that he better make a break from the Glukkons who hold him captive and decides to rescue as many of his fellow Mudokons as he can along the way.And so, his unexpected quest begins! There are a total of 99 Mudokons that await liberation. Some of them you really have to look for and there are a bunch of hidden rooms to find them in. Abe must rescue at least 50 of his kinfolk in order to survive the games ending. At times it can be a demanding task with little or no room for mistake to succeed. The game offers a very steep learning curve and rewards you with silly characters, enjoyable scenery, great music (which can and will become annoying when you get stuck), comical yet very well done cutscenes and most importantly, you will experience a fun and satisfying time overall.PROS:+ A hilariously alluring story line that draws from a serious matter concerning slavery+ Fantastic character design and visual concepts+ Nice graphics and animations (originally released in 1997 and it still looks pretty good)+ Lots of secret rooms to discover+ Innovative gameplay that will fulfill your desires for a real challengeCONS:- The save feature is not what you'd hope for in a game this grueling (you must reach checkpoints which means you better look forward to replaying strenuous parts over and over, again and again... and again)- There is no incentive for saving all 99 Mudokons (except for a video that was only featured in the original Playstation version)- I broke at least one Playstation controller during a rage quit I remember all the excitement of 3D gaming with the PS1 and still choosing to suffer this brutal sidescrolling platformer in 2D because the game is just so intriguingly awesome. One that still stands compelling to this day. I'd definitely recommend it. A replay even, for nostalgic purposes at least, if you're a gamer of the day. And it's absolutely worth a ""taste"" if Mudokon is new to you!My personal rating: 8.5/10			"

												This game is odd. It's very very odd. It's also dark, disturbing, messed up, scary, and freaking hilarious. But more importantly. it's one of the most clever and well-made games of it's kind, you should buy it the moment after you read this review.Also, people who say something like Dark Souls is extremely difficult obviously haven't played this. Oddworld is basically Dark Souls if were a puzzle platformer with stealth and 10x the trial and error, not to mention more unforgiving (One hit deaths+few checkpoints). You will struggle often, but once you succeed, you'll feel like a total champion.			"

												I'm happy this game is availble to play on steam, I'm also happy it worked.However, I bought this with the aim of saving all 99 Mudokons, something I never did as a child.I did it and was expecting the special end cut scene for finding all the secrets and instead I got a message saying their lawyers wouldn't allow them to use the old content and instead my reward was a list of all the cutscenes through out the game and the only one that actually loaded was the bad ending. What a joke.I feel robbed.			"

												Oddworld Abe's Oddysee is a ""cinematic"" puzzle platformer.Many would argue its not that ""Cinematic"" if compared to other Cinematic Platformers from the 90's Prince of persia etc.The Game will need alot of Patience and sometimes even Strategy.This game has a very dark story behind it. And its not afraid to show it in its game design.If i would have to describe this game in one word its Odd. And thats not a pun.The Character design is odd. The Creatures are odd. And The World is odd.Please notice that this game is a port of the DOS version of the game. It has very many bugs. But there is a patch online that is very easy to install that fixes all this. GAMEPLAY This game is pretty much everything you would expect from a Cinematic Platformer.You have a Jump Button. You have a roll button. you have Game Talk.Now gametalk is the part that makes oddworld an unique game (Atleast for its time)Game talk basicly allows you to Talk to your Mudoken Friends. You can tell them to follow you. and stop.When you tell them to follow you they will do that. Theyll just follow you. Tell Them Stop They will stopIn this game you dont have an attack button. But you can Chan and take over some of the Enemy Sligs minds and controll them. The Sligs have guns. So you will know what to do.Just watchout not to kill your buddies.Im too lazy to write more.10/10 Still Holds Up.This game franchise has a huge community even to this day.as some examples there are plenty of Tumbr ask blogs of this game( http://oddworld-fandom.tumblr.com/ )			"

												Ah, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. There is much that can be said about this particular gem of a game, good challange, great fun and a lot of old fashioned slapstick humor. As I play this game I start to reminice, reminice about the old times long past; it began in 1990- something, when I was just an inexperienced youngling with the world ahead of me. I had never heard much of games, save the windows 95 classics such as minesweeper and the like. I remember the cold winter evening when I sat behind the window, about a week earlier we got a letter saying that my father was honorably discharged from the frontlines, and that he would return home.He had fought the swedes in the attempt to secure Norways freedom. I saw a shade move into the garden, the sound of footsteps pressing their way into the wast snow on the ground. I ran to the door to find my father standing there, standing so proud, yet humble in his fusilier uniform, the musket over his shoulder, and a smile of joy visible through his thick beard. As he stepped into the house I saw a strange gray box in his left hand, a box that would later change my life.Me and my father played many an hour, many games with this gray box, but the first we ever played was Abe's Oddysee.It was this game that I played in these dark times, and when I played I knew that some day there would be peace.It also has a great sequel!

												Nostalgia is 20/20. Abes oddysee still has a great visual aesthetic that marks its world as it's own, and still oozes charm amidst it's meat factory dread. The puzzle platforming rescuing the slaved mudokons has aged terribly without the ability to quicksave, and you will find yourself fighting against some bad design choices and trial and death gameplay which is more punishing than rewarding. As relic of the of the past, it's still worth playing to the end, but you would be suprised how much gameplay has improved over the years, so newcomers might be better persuaded into getting the modern remake. I played this as a kid back when it first released, and playing it now, I found a lot more context in oddworld. There's an enviromentalist message amidst it's grim take on overconsumption and capitalism. PROS:Feels like an adventureDifficult puzzlesGreat style, a very immersive worldCONS: No quicksave, puzzles can frustrateThe platforming has dated, unresponsive.requires dedication to save the only obvious 50 mudokons. 50 are in very well hidden locations, and 50 is the cap for the good ending. Its gonna suck finishing the game witht he bad one is all Im saying.6/10   "

												Full disclosure: I started playing this years ago on Steam, abandoned it, then played and fininished it this year on my Vita.Abe's Oddysee is one of those ""classics"" that comes with a big asterisk. For the most part it's difficult but fare, with your success coming down to timing, preparation, and patience, making each success all the more satisfying, even I'm still convinced the jump button stops working every now and then just to troll you (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it). The 2 main problems with it, then, are the fail states and the save system - deaths (which are VERY frequent) are met with prolonged musical cues and delays before starting the levels again, and there's no way of telling just how far back a reloaded saved-game is going to take you.If you can get over those two major problems, it's definitely worth checking out for the puzzles and interesting world alone. If you can't, I won't blame you.			"

												I played this as a kid, but never truly finished ... couldn't remember why, so I thought to get it and play it again just for nostalgia sake. Ah yes, that's right, now I remember why I didn't enjoy this as a kid. For a game that has a lot of platforming, the controls are delayed and imprecise. But I still tremendously enjoy the game's atmosphere, story, SFX and voice acting! Even by today standards its holding up, but I'm not sure about the ""comedy"" route the Oddworld series took.

												Don't let the graphics of this game fool you because this game is ingenious, the puzzles still feel fresh, The programming to me is solid (The game rarely crashes which is a positive too but the only con I can think of is the save system & if you want a better save system than you should play the sequel Abe's Exoddus) & the game is really weird so overall this game is a must play. The story also has a good message about fighting big corporations that abuse their power to make life miserable for employees like what almost happened to the Mudokons in the game. If you want more info on the Oddworld games go follow Lorne Lanning & his company on twitter. http://www.twitter.com/OddworldIncUPDATE: The remake is now available so I'll probably make a longer review for that game since this review is really short but I appreciate the feedback from this old steam review I made  "

It's replay value is enormous, the storyline is very well written, the puzzles are a real brain teaser the game mechanics are really great and it's overall great fun.-The only downside is that there are no resolution and video settings to mess around and if you have no controller it can be a pain to play. It's also kinda buggy but nothing mazor.It's really a value for money game and if you liked it, wait until the remake comes out... It's to die for...			"

												A brilliantly weird side-scrolling adventure. Getting through the assorted hazards is tough enough on its own, but you also have a secondary task to consider: rescuing other Mudokons by leading them safely past danger and into magical portals. You're free to ignore them and simply blast through the central challenges, in which case you'll get a shorter experience and a downer ending. Alternatively you can work to save them all, which involves discovering and exploring a lot of trap-filled secret rooms, which is a lot more rewarding.Great Game from the old days			"

												I remembered about the Oddword series recently and knew that I was too young and dumb to ever finish it. I liked the fact that you could fart and also I had a PS2 from a friend with no memory card.Thus, I really wanted to play and see what the game is all about.I'm finding hard to believe that this game was released in 1997 and that I chose to play this game when I missed on a lot of other modern games, but the reasons strenghten my decision. The lore is intriguing and the characters are funny and in combination with the artistic direction it offers you a friendly, mysterious, dark and constantly a dangerous environment.Most of the time I found the game very challenging, in 3 situations I had to check for solutions on YouTube or a written walkthrough. This game is not giving you constant and obvious hints, if you don't pay attention to the environment and don't read thoroughly the promped texts you will find yourself clueless and you get frustrated. Also, the control of the character is going to punish you if you make a single additional step in certain situations, so you have to be very coordinated and disciplined in order to pass certain sections of the game.Game mechanics are smart and unique, considering when this game was released, generating puzzles that do not feel repetitive and putting your brain to use. I didn't play more than 1 hour constantly because I got frustrated and felt the need to take a break, that's how challenging I found this game to be.This game is also aiming to test your personality and how much you are willing to sacrifice for the greater good, but I'm not going to talk about this. There's so much I'd like to write so that I highly praise this iconic game that everybody should experience.			"

												Easily a contender for my favorite game of all time. The story is a fantastic example of handling serious issues without being preachy, never forgetting to be fun and amusing. The blend of 2D stealth, puzzling and platforming gameplay is just about perfect, and challenging without being excessively punishing. The controls are similar to Tomb Raider, in that they are very precise; they follow strict rules, and your every move is calculable. The visuals are also pushed to the absolute limits of the PlayStation; you won't find any polygons in this one, and the cutscene-to-gameplay transitions are so seamless it's uncanny.The only reasonable gripe I can see people having with it is the difficulty. The game is not without its trial and error, for sure, and this game lacks the quicksave option of Exoddus. I've heard some describe its challenge as ranging from ""unreasonable"" to ""impossible."" On the front of the old PlayStation jewel case, you'll even see it blantantly say it has ""inexplicably challenging gameplay,"" and all you have to deal with that is a functional brain and infinite lives (you'll need them.) Oh, and magical powers. The game might have ""forgotten"" to tell you that until the third level... whoops. Yes, all this game teaches you are the basics. There isn't much hand-holding, and you will likely get the bad ending on your first playthrough. However, you will get a chance to fix that, starting from the beginning of the final level. This was certainly a deliberate design decision. If you have reservations about the difficulty of this game, play Exoddus first, for the quicksave, and an even larger game.			"

												My first time playing this game and i must say, i am blown away! the only thing i could remember from an oddworld game is munch's oddysee trailer from somewhere on the first xbox. After seeing gameplay online and my brothers experience i just wasn't interested. i was such a fool! it's only $3 so i just decided to give it a try. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! amazing atmosphere thanks to the the visuals and the music which sets the scene really well. the only problem that i had with the game i that i didnt know i could possess sligs or save the mudokons at the start of the game (maybe i missed something? probably...) which caused me to have the bad ending. which was not necessarily a problem since i couldn't stop thinking about this game after the last cutscene. While replaying it was kinda a drag just for the sake of the good ending, doesn't mean it wasn't a blast! Anyway, this was an amazing experience to have and i HIGHLY suggest it to anyone looking for a challenging and tense game. 8/10			"

												I remember playing this when I was a lad. I could never finish it with my kid fingers, so I redownloaded it for a PS1 emulator and finally beat it about two years ago. Unfortunately, I got the worst possible ending. So here I am, back again, playing this game for the third time in my life, and hopefully I'll get the good ending. Wish me luck! Oh, and nostalgia aside, this is a great platformer, requiring a lot of thought, timing, patience and the ability to refrain from punching a hole in your PC screen. All round great game, a solid 10/10 from me. A good thing to note is that you will absolutely need your sound on to communicate with the other Mudokons, a detail, but relatively important none the less.EDIT: There's an HD remake of this game called New 'n Tasty and it looks even better than the original. They are replacing the screen by screen gameplay with a more modern scrolling style. Check it out before buying this just in case you prefer it. I bought both.			"

												A game that awakens every bit of nostalgia left in your soul. You'll get to experience the importance of patience in a game, while solving numerous well thought-out puzzles. The storyline and concept are unique in its genre and work well with the twisted and subtle humor created by the developpers.A great game to play in your free time and the best solution to prevent another night of mindless - and time wasting - internet browsing.

												While the game's remake is already available on Steam (under the title New 'N' Tasty) you can still pick up the original Oddworld game which was released back in 1997 - almost 20 years ago! This was what started the Oddworld franchise that since that year has seen several sequels.These games are all about Abe, the titular character, who is a Mudokon slave being captive in a factory. Initially just a worker, but later labelled as ""meat to be processed"", Abe sets out to escape from his captors and also to free his fellow Mudokons in the process. The game's first cutscene (which is pretty long considering it is an old game) summarises the story very well and we can quickly understand what's ahead of us.This is a 2D platformer, so we go from screen to screen and every new ""room"" represents a new challenge. We have patrolling enemies as well as traps and of course members of the Mudokon race who we need to rescue. We can issue some basic commands to them to make sure they follow us - this part where you communicate with the others can be hilarious. Do note that this is one of those games where one mistake can lead to certain death. Checkpoints are regularly placed, though, so at least the game is not punishing you for being a little careless from time to time. One particularly interesting thing is how you can make other Mudokons die if you are not careful - the game does not take you back to the last checkpoint so you may think this is not a problem. Truth is, the number of saved Mudokons determines the ending of the game - you can either get the Good or the Bad ending.The gameplay is really good - Abe can do a lot of things in terms of movement and activating various mechanisms throughout the factory. Sections tend to get more and more difficult but Oddworld offers an acceptable learning curve here. I haven't tried the remake so I do not know how good a job they did - still, if you like old games or you are, just like myself, someone having played this back in the '90s do give it a try once more!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee little grown old over the past years. It still has the captivating climate which is pleasantly acting on the imagination, intelligent and cunning puzzles and interesting ideas that are able to impress even today. Its difficulty may put off a more casual audience but there will never be a time when it is unfair on you. With a clear conscience I recommend it to any fan of retro-play.			"

												Do you love platformers? Like games with lots of secrets? Need a challenge? Then Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is the game for you. Abe's Oddysee is a 2D sidescrolling cinematic platformer/puzzle game (phew!) with some interesting twists. Story: You are Abe, a mudokon who works on Rupture Farms. Abe lives a great life, despite being a slave. One day, while roaming the area, Abe finds that Glukkons (the scumbag rich species of Oddworld) want to turn mudokons into food. Abe, finding that out, decides that the best thing to do is save the 99 mudokons in Rupture Farms. Your journey won't be easy, because deadly enemies are almost everywhere.Gameplay: As I said before, this is a 2D platformer. The game is divided in screens (fixed camera, i,e., go to the right edge of the screen and it moves to the next camera/play area). This system gives the player a sense of suspense, because you never know what's in the next screen. One of the powers Abe has is possessing his enemies. Press the button, wait some seconds, you are controlling the enemy. You can do almost everything with him (kill him, kill other enemies, pull levers, fall off a cliff, you name it!) and it's an helpful power to finish your journey. There is a basic speaking system called GameSpeak that allows to control other mudokons using basic sentences (Hi!, Follow me, wait and even farting!). Mudokons must be moved using this system and taken to the nearest bird portal. Just chant and voila! The portal opens and they're saved! (:D) Unless... they trip on a mine. ( :( ) The only problem this game has in terms of gameplay is that checkpoints are infrequent and sometimes you will have to do same thing again and again only to die in the same place.Graphics: Even though some screens look 3D, they are actually pre-rendered. The environments are beautiful and varied.Sound: The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere, and the sound effects are pretty good.Final thoughts: Despite the somewhat dated graphics, Oddworld is an amazing game. The story is amazing, the gameplay is easy to learn and hard to master, and the soundtrack is pretty good.** If you are playing this game in Windows Vista, 7 or 8, be sure to download this and put in the game's folder. The game has some incompatibility issues in recent Windows versions: http://koti.mbnet.fi/vaultec/files/miscellaneous/ddhack_abe.zip **			"

												Ah, Oddworld: Abe's Oddyssee, a game from my childhood I have very fond memories of. I used to spend hours playing this wonderful game with my dad. I still remember the moment we first found out about the possession skill of Abe and our amazement that followed. The eerie atmosphere combined with relentlessly high difficulty at some points and comic relief at others had left an ever lasting impression in my then game-inexperienced mind. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find the Oddbox, which includes this game, on Steam, if only to relive the many moments which, to some extent, have shaped my perspective on videogames. Of course, the graphics are outdated and the controls may need some getting used to for new players, but this is a videogame I can recommend with my fullest conviction! The action-packed levels, the puzzle-solving and the story of a slave trying to save his kind are things many a gamer will enjoy.			"

												If I remember right, this is one of the first games I've played on the PS1. Pure nostalgia! No matter how often I play this game, it never gets old. It's a classic that everyone should play at least once, especially if you are a fan of platform video games.The story is just great and Abe will always be one of my favorite video game heroes. Although the game is almost 20 years old, the visuals still look awesome. The backgrounds are beautifully made. The soundtrack also is pretty nice. The dark humor is also something I always loved about this game.If you didn't play this game, I recommend you try it out. For me, it's a piece of video game history that everyone should experience.

												I remember playing this way back on the PlayStation One when it first came out. I found it so hard (I was only like 8), but I remember finding the world and concept intriguing. So much so that a few years later, in my teens, I decided to dig out my ageing PS1 again to play it. This time I got so much more absorbed into the game. It's a great game. There's so much to explore and do, and the puzzles can be really quite challenging if you want to rescue all the Mudokons. But even if you don't (at least on a first playthrough), it's still a really enjoyable game. I love the world, Abe is really likeable, and the game is just great, and it's great to be able to play it on here without having to dig out my now quite ancient PS1. If you love Platformers, puzzle games, and PS1 classics, then this is for you.			"

But i was 3/4ths of the way through. So happy they brought this to steam where i play all my games. The port is fine if not a little sensitive, A controller might be an easier way to handle it. The backgrounds can be so beautiful with the 3 moons, canyons and jungle. I wish there were real scrabs you would keep as pets @_@' Do want.

The opening levels help you understand how to play this game.It's a side-scroller puzzle game. With a dash of dystopian and some of the most cheesiest dialouge and yet amazing graphics for it's time. And since this is a PC port getting the game to work properly might take some challenge. Luckily there are fan made patches for the PC and also a helpful community. Because you are going to need it.I won't spoil the story, of course. But it's an amazing yet sometimes frustrating puzzle game.

But fun nonetheless, if you ever pick up this game play it and love it (O)_(O). Hehe....I never took intrest in all the other games in the series, but if I could play them I would :3. I am very excited when I get my hands on Oddworld: New n' Tasty. It looks too be a different version of Abe's Oddysee NOT A REMAKE! Please go and get this game and if you don't like it thats fine, try another one in the series. Also do not play this with other people it kills the atmosphere and takes away the experience.

												It's wonderful. Oddworld itself is a great creation and the music, design and gameplay is simply terrific. It can be difficult but it's always to the fault of the player rather than the game. It encourages you to learn and solve the puzzles and you'll be eager to progress because Abe is such a likable character that you want him to succeed in the story. I didn't get the best ending but i'll certainly return to the game again regardless; for the time being my focus will be on the sequel. This game was made so long ago and still holds up so if you have never played it please do because you'll not be dissapointed; I played this on the first playstation and gave up at the time. I'm glad I tried again to enter Oddworld but most of all I wish I could eat those scrabcakes to be honest.			"

												Fantastic classic game. Remember playing on PS1. Runs terribly on my computer, and my husband had to do something complicated to get it to work at all, however just played a bit tonight and I will be back despite the awful video sequences. Solid game. Love it! NB Don't be afraid of its datedness and don't give up if you can't get it to run first up. There is a way!			"

												Oddworld: Abes Oddysee is a very interesting platformer. The game heavily relies upon it's visuals and puzzle solving, along with it's platforming. The main character, Abe, dies instantly upon being hit by an enemy, and cannot attack. So you are reliant on avoiding enemies and using the environment to your advantage.The game is extremely beautiful, imaginative, and perfect for players that enjoy platformers. It adds something new for everyone.			"

												I recommend this game because the in game controller configuration works.Works with Xbox 360 controller (although movement was with the analogue stick)Works with SNES USB controllerYou can assign buttons but not directions for the controller.The best thing about the controller setup is that it's similar to the PS1, so all of Abe's speaking commands can be done by holding down multiple buttons. No need for a 20 button controller.The game worked without issue on first launch (Win7) but the low-res graphics are a bit yuck on a large LCD screen. Still looks good on an old TV or old monitor though. There are no graphics/video options at all.			"

												PC port is great, controls work great apart from the awkward chanting and sometimes awkward speaking buttons. Its awesome nostalgia since i used to play this game with my dad as a kid and i still remember to this day the whole starting cutscene. Its awesome opportunity for me to finish the game if im able since i never did as a kid, obviously cause i wasnt probably that great at gaming back then. 7/10 since the cutscenes are like slideshow and some people have saving issues (Both have quite easy fix but you shouldnt need to download external programs or mess around in the game files for your game to work properly)			"

												This truly takes me back, back to a time when half my in-game time went to pressing ""7"" to fart then leading the Mudokons down dangerous hatches to kill them for the fun of it, then reloading and saving them because they're adorable. Ignorant morons, but adorable. If you haven't played this, this game is a 2D plattformer with some puzzle elements. Your goal as Abe is saving your species the Modokons to safety so they don't end up as food for the bad guy and his species. The graphics and controls may be a little outdated by todays standard (the graphics more than a little), but it doesn't matter. It's still a great game, with lots of humour. It has a special kind of charm that makes game simply work, both in 1997 and now. I had some issues with the graphics, but it's still a better alternative to digging up your old PS1 and trying to find the memory card you dog ate in -98.7.2/10			"

My girlfriend is not a very big game fan and she loves this so I think that alone is a sign of how enjoyable Abes story is. Some of the control issues and problems from the previous abe have been solved with Oddyee. I would recommend old Abe to anyone. Bring him back please!			"

												I have yet to play more than an hour, but yes, I can definitely recommend this game, since I played countless hours when it was originally released! I've noticed in the community that some people were having FPS issues, or other problems related to the cutscenes. For new players, and those that fail to look for fixes before shouting ""bad port"", without looking to the community hub first, here are links to two similar fixes, both seeking to accomplish the same thing... use whichever you would like.http://steamcommunity.com/app/15700/discussions/0/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1765599/I just would hate to see such an incredible game, one of the best I've ever played, one that is often touted among the best of all time, recieve negative reviews over something so trivial. So if you're here, (and I know a lot more reviews will start pouring in since it's free today). and having issues, before reviewing, stop, try to fix it yourself, then enjoy! This game.... what can I say? It's difficult, and not in the ""OMG THE ENEMIES ARE SO OP"", Dark Souls kind of difficult,(not hating, I love DS), but the Oddworld kind. It has to be experienced. This platform adventure will require serious brain power, and you will need to really try if you want to succeed here... but when you do, it is oh, so satisfying. It will change your life for the better.			"

												Hard, but fun. It should be logic game, however it is more the type of game - press the right button in the right moment. So what makes this game good? Honestly, I don't know. I simply play it and I enjoy it. Abe is incredibly fragile, so the timing has to be perfect. Once you get it, it's satisfying to run through whole level without error :). The theme and plot are original and well designed. For me, only major drawback is unability to save the game. There are checkpoints, but...			"

												The BEST PSX era game ever created, me and my dad played it to the end where I got the bad ending.  It was funny all that hard work and I get the bad ending, but that was so good about the game it was SO BLOODY DIFFICULT that even if you got the bad ending you patted yourself on the back for actually beating the game.Pros-Beautiful setting-Actual humor, you can fart in this game with a press of a button-Awesome storyline-Game is very intense you will be on the edge of your seat the entire time-Best enemies ever in a game, including sligs and scrabs-You can possess enemies thats freaking cool-Great voice acting, espcially Abe and the Mudokons-Unforgettable endings espcially the bad ending-Very long game will take you about 15-20 hours to beat on your first playthrough-Perfect difficulty, every death is your fault, the game never feels unfair-The music is atmospheric and goes great with the setting of Oddworld-Nice variety of levels you'll go from meat packing plants to a desert to a forest and so on-Game speak is a nice mechanic in this game-Despite the humor, this game has a very serious storyline that focuses on the horrors of slavery and the corruption of industry-Best last level ever; I wont spoil it but its freaking amazingCons-Not the best PC port but if you don't have a Playstation this is the best option-Terrible save system; this was fixed in the sequel which included the awesome feature of quick savingI don't have many cons for this game for me this game is an absolute masterpiece and I think it is both underrated and underappreciated.  If you are turned off by old 2d graphics I suggest you wait for the remake that is coming out soon, if you are not however buy this masterpiece of a game already, it is only $2.50. "

												I love the Oddworld games, Abe's Oddysee is the first one I have had the chance to play on PC. Abe's  Oddysee is the first Oddworld game released, and the first one I ever played way back on the PlayStation 1. Oddworld games are always filled with dark comedy, the Oddworld games always manage to keep a sense of adventure coupled with a macabre feel that I just love. In Abe's Oddysee you play a character named Abe, a Mudokon slave worker who uncovers a nefarious plot that could lead to the death of his people. He sets out on a quest to free them, slowly uncovering more of his Mudokon culture along the way.  Gameplay wise Abe's Oddysee is a 2D platformer filled with puzzles and obstacles to complete or circumvent, but remember the ending is dependent on how well you do.Overall I would recommend Oddworld games to anyone who is a fan of adventure or puzzle games. Oddworld is one of those series that feels really unique, so you'd be challenged to find something close enough to the Oddworld games.			"

												STORY!Our story beings with a mudokon named abeHe was the employee of the month!He work at a food procesing plant, problem was they were running out of foodso his employers decided Hey why not eat all the mudokons!abe now has to escape, and become abraham lincoln for all of his buddies, and free the slavesor become abe hilter and work outside of the employers plan and kill of all of his buddies!that abouts some up the storyGAMEPLAY!while the game may seem simple as in easy at 1st, your going to start dieing your going to die as much as you would in dark souls, but most of the deaths seem fair there are some i would question about being fair at all, also there are small puzzles but its more of a maze then a puzzle go found out how to get to the switch to open the door, type thing. so what makes this game stand out, well YOU CAN TALK! no seriously you can talk to your modokon friends and tell them to follow you wait and..... thats about it, but you might be surprise how insanely hard that turns out in some of the levels. one major down side to the game is, once you beat it your probly not coming back to it, unless its to see the other ending, here a small tip you need to save 50 people in order to get the good ending, any less will result in the bad ending.ONE MAJOR DOWN SIDE! while you can save the game its very passive aggressive with how it works, you may save it, close the game and come back only to found out that your back a entire area, aka your last check point and yes there are some areas where if you die, you have to do a lot of things all over agin PERFECTLY! or you will die. the sequal fixes this problemalso just a small note some cuts sences where a bit wierd on morden day hardware, they feel really slow, almost slideshow like, it wasn't like this back in the day, so if anyone knows a fix, please let me know so i can put it in this reviewMUISC!okay, i am a bit nostalgic blind in this deparment...... i like it, its very short simple and basic, i sometimes come up with my own lyrics in my head when listing to it, but agin i am a bit nostalgic blind in this areaoveralla very fun, diffcult and satifiyng game, everytime you beat something you feel like you can take on the world, only to walk into the next area and get slap down to reality, that you are just some cleaner, that has nothing better to do then spend 2 days stright saving all the modokons... but once you done that you feel like a MODOKON GOD!!!!

												Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee: is a strategy platformer with some unique and interesting gameplay experiences. Coming back from my childhood, this game was one of the nostalgia flashbacks. A game my parents used to play while I watched. Now playing it for myself it's a lot more fun and the gameplay is addicting. Seriously the obsatcles in levels are a lot of fun and I feel as though I want to play it every day since I got it. Though it can get frustrating at times, can take a while to beat the level andcan be a little overbearing for some players. There are obstacles that will make you panic is you're easily scared: Such as running from enemies in a full on pursuit. The stress rate can get high at times, and even some levels are gut wrenchingly hard and make you wanna slap your computer.Still this game is probably one of the most unique platformers out there. The player has a choice to save as many Mudokens as they feel: and depending on how many you save at the end of the game, you will be featured with an ending based on how well you did. With so many unique ways of going about a level and the amazing cut scenes (although old), this game has it all.I would reccomend to anyone who's into strategy platformers or just brilliant unique art styled games.

												Nostalgic game, one of my favorite childhood games and one of the best 2d games ever created.It has a very nice story and the gameplay is about avoiding enemies, solving puzzles, navigating obstacles, rescuing friendly Mudokons and many more.Don't forget secret stages are everywhere ...

												Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee® has to be one of my favourite playstation titles. The game has gotten a HD remake Oddworld New and Tasty but if you would like to go back to where it all beganOddworld: Abe's Oddysee® is alot more challenging than New and Tasty.Pick up this game if you can it is worth it.

												One of the greatest platformers of all time. The cinematic style of this game has always astounded me even to this day, the games visual style still holds up today which is good for a playstation one era game. From the dark, dirty factories of Rupture farms to the vast plains of Scrabania, this game is an absoloute pleasure to look at no matter where you go.The gameplay is another one of this games strongpoints. The game focuses around controlling Abe, trying to escape Rupture Farms and save his Mudokon brothers from slavery by the Glukkons. The gameplay focuses around avoiding your adverseries by any means necessary, as Abe doesnt have a way to attack but that is where possesion comes in.The controls are amazingly responsive, no real delay or anything which is an essential requirement for a sidescrolling platfromer of this type and Oddwolrd Inhabitants hit the nail on the head with this one. Abe controls just how he should, your main controls are the usual things such as running, sneaking jumping etc. The tone of the game is also fantastic. The game has a dark overtone through the whole experience, showing how Oddworld is changing and not in a good way. But the game is sort of lightened up with the characters that are presented to us throughout the full game. All the characters are likable in this game in their own way. The Sligs, The Glukkons, The Mudokons and especially Abe himself.Oddworld Inhabitants managed to create a character that was relatable in his own way, a character that was innocent enough but has been dropped into a situation that is so much bigger than he is. Oddworld Inhabitants have crafted a masterpiece here and i would recommend this game to anybody who loves platformers, action games or even stealth games.My only complaints have to be the checkpoint system is irritating, with checkpoints being very scarce and this game being very unforgiving with one hit deaths, learning puzzles can be rather difficult. Also not being able to call upon more than one Mudokon at once is kind of annoying. Luckily both of these issues have been fixed in the sequal.Abe's Oddysee still holds up today and is still one of my favourite games to date and a fantastic addition to the platforming genre. 8/10			"

												This game was definitely designed to be played with a controller. So, it’s kind of stupid that this port has such terrible controller support. I’ve got a 360 controller plugged in. The movement is mapped to the left stick. The pause menu is mapped to clicking the left stick. Neither of those things can be remapped.			"

												What can I say about Abe's Oddysee? For its time I feel that it's a near perfect game, if it wasn't for a few of the problems like not being able to quicksave, and not being able to talk to more than one mudokon at a time, which was later fixed in Abe's Exoddus. A true classic that I can play any day and not get tired of. 9/10 would bang.			"

Product received for free
												Never been a PS man myself, making this playthrough of Oddworld my first. Judging from what I've read, I think our situation here is a terrible port of an excellent game.The positives:-Interesting and thought-provoking puzzles-While meager, a fun world, sense of humor and plot-Cool art design, yoThe negatives:-Abysmal controls. Controlling Abe as he runs, jumps, walks slowly, rolls, mounts creatures and communicates with other characters is so blocky and obtuse to the point of aggravation. I know exactly what I want Abe to do. Translating that to the mechanics of the controls was excrutiating.-Frame rate in the cut scenes (excellent for the 90's!) is bested by old Gumby claymation. I can hardly tell what's going on in cutscenes with all the tearing.-Saving system is unclear. I can save at any point, but there's no telling where I will end up when I load a file. I may end up seven zones back from where I left off. I can lose up to half an hour of progress thanks to inaccurate saving.-Several times I loaded save files without Abe. I was stuck on a screen with no playable character. Rebooting the game fixed this but geez.-For the love of God why isn't there any controller support for Oddworld? This is killer on my hands trying to play this on my laptop keyboard! Why would a game designed for a controller not receive controller functionality during its port?-This game caused one of my laptops to crash whenever I tried loading it.I don't recommend this particular port. That is, assuming that your experience on your machine will be anything like mine. I wish I could play this game as it was originally designed. I can just imagine how excellent a playable Oddworld would be.FULL DISCLOSURE: I received this product for free during a special free download day a while ago.			"

												Awesome game! I originally played it on PS1 when it came out. A bit more challenging this time.... playing it on the laptop with the keyboard controls. I had'nt played the Abe for about 15 yrs heaps fun! I liked trying to find all the secret spots again to make sure to find all 99 . The game has a dark humour/brutaliy about it(was always good posessing a Slig and tearing him up from the inside) Helping Abe the tourtured soul was good and always an adventure.I bought a steam bundle with all the other Odd World games cant wait to get back into the World of Odd. i'll review each one as well.

												The game is from 1997. Keep that in mind. The resolution is 640x480 and can't be changed. The controls are fiddly, and while it seems to support a controller, it doesn't play nicely with my xbox one.There's lots to like about the game, especially if you are old enough to remember its release. But alas, it just doesn't play well with more modern computers, and as there are too many options to really work with a controller, it is just a pain to play.If you are running XP, you may have better luck. But, I'm afraid I just can't recommend this game on Windows 10. I really wish I could, as I honestly love it.			"

												oddworld abe's oddysee is one of the greatest games ever created on the PS1 console. the cut scenes are amazing (even for the 90's these are pretty high class videos)GAMEPLAY-this games plays really well, the controls are amazing on keyboard, albeit a tad confusing. BUT not to worry, if you have a playstation game pad for the PC you can hook it up and play this game to your hearts content ... well ... you could do it already if you have a keyboard, but this game is made with a controller in mind so it would only improve on this already fantastic game. not to mention how you save game, just pause and save and you're done ... come back when you've decided you won't rage quit over how challenging the game is ... forgot to mention that actually. This game is incredibly unforgiving. one wrong move and ""BOOM"" ... you're blue paste gets splattered all over the screen, and you're left to think about what would happen to your green comrades if you could not re-spawn ... a banjo kazooie 'quit game ending if you will.it doesn't do that, i'm just saying thinking about it is weird ... what if they all get eaten and they sell your organs for dog food, humanity goes into a downward spiral as events you couldn't stop, happen. The sequels always end with the sad ending, and you're no where to be seen because you died 2 games ago, nobody even knows your name anymore. As a slag (animal) begins to munch on your tinned mudoken fingers and eyeballs, the last sentient part of you is converted into fecal matter and your race DIES ... all because you took one step to the right and got crushed by a barrel of meat ... but i digressSTORY-the story to this game is essentially one giant Eco friendly metaphor for our own industrial prowess ... but it is so subtle/just plain ignorable that it will not rest on your conscience at all. basically you're an actual ""skrub"" worker in the biggest meat factory on odd-world, your bosses want to kill and sell your race to (possibly) unwary, cannibalistic consumers (it's never specified who actually buys all this food). you get found out, chase scene happens, voodoo hoodoo guy with funny mask gives you powers, and you basically take off from there. the story is a lot more in-depth than that but, meh. it would spoil a lot of the lot to go into full detail (I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, THE PURCHASER OF THIS FINE PRODUCT! DON'T HATE ME!)GRAPHICS-It's a ps1 game, so you can expect some ... aging, to take place. it's a side scroller from the 90's so its 32 bit graphic style will always hold up pretty well (if you're a forgiving sort of person who enjoys game play over graphics). it's not the worst game you will ever see in your life ... it definitely gives some 3D games i know of a run for there money.OVERALL-i would definitely recommend that you buy this game, as a matter of fact, just buy the entire Oddbox bundle. you get all the Odd-world games for £6.99 (when not on sale). that is a steal for anyone's library as they are all definitely worth purchasing. strangers wrath although not as popular as other Odd-world title is definitely commendable for a referral as well.

												I don't recommend this version for a few reasons. First off, on modern hardware, the movies have extreme stuttering or just plain don't work. Second, unless you love keyboard controls for platformers, I had a lot of difficulties getting my gamepad to work properly with this game and mapping controls. FWIW, I would recommend finding this on the PSN or picking up the New'N'Tasty remake version if you really want to play it.edit: After playing into the second and third parts, I just got bored. It's incredibly same-y feeling. I'd rather just go play the old Prince of Persia games on SNES to get my fix for this style of platformer.			"

												I don't think I can love duology more than I can love the two Abe Games. Heck, I was more than willing to buy the game a second time when I saw it on Steam. I cannot recommend this game enough: it has a spot-on atmosphere, gameplay that is as satisfying as it is challenging, a simple but effective story told both with and without words, and one of the most interesting worlds ever created for any game ever. I JUSTI JUSTI just adore this game man. buy it it's good 7.8/10 ign too many paramites			"

												A truly excellent game. It's a dark themed puzzle platformer. Its sequel Abe's Exoddus which is just as good if not better leans more towards comedy than the dark theme of this game, it's less depressing.If you don't mind the PS1 graphics (which to be honest you get used to very fast while playing the game) then you can wait for the re-release that's coming in 2014 called New 'N Tasty.Either way this is something everyone needs to play!

												This game has not aged well, and I don't mean the graphics. This game still looks and sounds fine in my opinion. The problem is the gameplay. The puzzles here are incredibley cheap. Walking offscreen into a landmine is a common occurence, or running out of throwable items at a crucial moment. You'll be redoing the same puzzles alot, and after a while it just gets frustrating. The game doesn't feel fair at all. Not to mention the fact that none of the controls are rebindable, you're stuck with arrow keys for the entire game. Due to all this I cannot recommend this game.If you do decide to buy this, here's a tip: 0 is the chant key, despite what the tutorial tells you.			"

												The art is amazing, the voice acting was top notch for it's time, and the creatures are genius.It's the best platform game I've ever played and it's difficulty is may put off a more casual audience but there will never be a time when it is unfair on you, when you make a mistake and die you always think to your self ""Ok, that didn't work but now i know where I went wrong"". It's a masterpiece and you should pick it up seeing it's quite cheap on certain services.			"

												The dos series Oddworld:Aby's Oddysee / Exodus is a 2D platform game with 3D pre-rendered animations. This tiny marvel of the long lost past is suitable for anyone whom even does not have any nostalgic attachment towards it.Anyway, the game followes after our protagonist Abe whom wants to emancipate his people from the malevolent lords of food products after a horrific discovery; shorty after you discover you are set to a quest to turn the proccessed food kindom to dust and return your people to their former glory.Gameplay:The game is pretty formal plat': * Death punishment via insufficient saves.* Secret areas to be discovered where your people are ought to be saved.* A fluid difficulty increase after every level.But, the game introduces a set of features that makes this game unique and aswell difficult, like possessable foes and the inability to damage otheres just by yourself.This game can be such a challange, that it is such a blast.8/10, for the lack of beta-testers.

Saving at Stockyard pt6 takes you back to Stockyard pt1 upon reloading, losing literal hours of gameplay, especially if you've taken the time to free every Mudokan up to that last point.Such a shame but unless someone has a solid fix for this I can't recommend it.

												Intense platforming with a charming funny world and inhabitents.Fun is ruined by an inconsistent saving system.  Death comes easy and fast but returning to where you died to try again can take a frustratingly long time.  A quick save would have fixed this, but no such option exists.Designed to be harsh but completely at the expense of fun.  Each death can reset a considerable amount of progress - to the point of being unfair.The later iterations have fixed this, but this 1997 version has little respect for your time.  I find it impossible to recommend because the genre (punishing game play that teaches through deaths) has been far more refined in modern games.Claims of this being 'hardcore' or for 'oldschool' players aren't made by those who value their time.A more in-depth fleshed out review here:http://theboilingpot.net/oddworld-abes-oddysee/ "

												Well that's weird, I have to write the review for Abe's Exoddus here because the time I spent playing that has been applied to Oddysee for some reason not known to man nor beast.This release of Exoddus is broken due to port-induced bugs. Glukkons are totally immobile once possessed, which breaks the game and makes it unfinishable due to the need to use them to finish certain puzzles. I got this as part of the Oddbox and along with the utter disgrace that was Stranger's Wrath, i'm sadly forced to slam the No button when it comes to recommending a series I used to adore wholeheartedly.

												The game is great, as long as you make no mistakes, ever.The plot is insanely original, the art design is among the best ever put to screen, and the gameplay was revolutionary at the time.But, the CONTROLS, and the CHECKPOINT SYSTEM.Combine fidgety controls compounded with a save system that puts you through 18.5 meatgrinders before granting you ANY respite, and you soon accrue frustration on ""I-Wanna-Be-The-Guy"" levels, to the point where you just don't care to continue the level, and therefore leave the game in the ultimate state of defeat, where you truly beat the game unequivocally: by not playing it.I picked this up for free, and that was the perfect price. I'd have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off had I bought it for even the three dollars they're charging now.The game's a fossil. Leave it buried. The juice isn't worth the squeeze.			"

												It took me 14 hours to beat this game, and probably 10 of those hours were spent repeating parts I had already finished because this game's checkpoint system is awful.Yes, this game is challenging. But the challenge comes from a combination of trial-and-error gameplay, spaced-out checkpoints, and sluggish, awkward controls. If you make one minor mistake, you will die, and you will have to repeat the entire section over again. Graphically, the game is great (for something that came out in '97), but this port is atrocious. You're stuck with a 640 x 480 resolution game in full screen. The plot is a little thin and kind of puerile, but there's a certain charm to the Oddworld Universe.During my 14 hours playing this game, I can say I had fun during the first half-hour. The rest of the experience was painful.			"

												Game is from 1997... So dont expect crazy graphics. What you CAN expect is some crazy story. You seem to play as a weird mutant looking creature who commits entirely to jumping once the action begins. He creeps around pulling levers and getting his fellow oddballs to walk into...bird portals. Oh and this all starts in a meat factory.My point: if your looking for some wild story with some clunky gameplay this is your kind of game. Especially if you have some nostalgia for it. Personally, I couldnt deal with the low resolution or the nonresponsive controls for much more than 20 minutes.			"

												This is one of the best games from the 90s and an all time classic. Great story (should get a movie), great atmosphere, great arcade gameplay. I remember playing this as a kid on the PS1 and I loved it, one of my favourite games. Despite everything I can't recommend this version of the game, it's not up-to-date. It looks like the developer just wanted to make some money until they released ""New'n'Tasty! - Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee"" in 2015 (remake of this game). They didn't put any effort in this version of the game for the Steam release: no graphic updates, low resolution, no fully controller support... They didn't do anything to make this version of the game worthy to play. So if you like to play Abe's Oddysee, buy New'n'Tasty!! "

After a lot of fiddling, I was one of the lucky ones that could get it to almost functioning on their computer. that isn't saying too much though.CONS: No Steam overlay, meaning no broadcasting, ingame browser, clock, or screenshots. That'd be okay if tabbing out didn't also crash the game. Corrupted saves. Controls were messed up by porting and make some parts unbelievably hard. This game incited a ground-up remake (New 'n' Tasty,) currently available for 19.99USD. Yet the original wasn't worth a proper port? Why??WORTH: Don't bother with this release. Not even on sale.OVERALL: Abe's Oddysee deserves far better of a release than this buggy travesty.SCORE: 1/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

Posted: May 10, 2016
												I remember buying this game back when it was released for the PlayStation 1. As far as I remember, it was a popular release and it received many positive reviews by the major publications of the time. I was excited to buy it but as soon as I began playing it, I remember being disappointed. I can't remember whether or not I beat it back then but chances are high that I got bored and quit playing just as I did now.Despite what the multitude of nostalgic, rabid and headstrong fans say, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee  didn't age well at all from what was already a mediocre effort to begin with. While the character design is interesting and charming, everything else is quite flawed. The background graphics and animations are average to below average, the music is nearly non-existent, the sound effects can get borderline annoying at times, and worst of all, the controls are extremely unresponsive, sluggish and awkward. Getting Abe to perform the most basic of platforming moves such as seamlessly running, stopping, climbing on a ledge and then sneaking is painful and inadequate. Controlling Abe feels very much delayed and as if the movements were restricted in some way. The puzzles and rooms are designed competently for the most part but when you have to deal with the game's awful controls, solving each screen is too aggravating and devoid of any fun whatsoever. The gameplay revolves around traversing the game world one screen at a time. Even though not every screen presents the player with a puzzle or a situation that needs his or her attention, there is still the need to advance through each screen individually and with a slight pause between each transition. Deaths come often and the player will be forced to repeatedly wait through a lengthy death and restart animation that takes about five seconds to complete. The save system is based on checkpoints, so if the player dies several screens beyond the last checkpoint, every screen from the checkpoint to the point of death will need to be redone as many times as it takes until you reach the next checkpoint. Without mentioning any spoilers, it is encouraged that there is at least one additional playthrough after you beat the game once. In relation to this, one of the worst design choices in the game presents itself. The goal is to rescue slaves. Unfortunately for the player, many of the slaves are hidden away in secret areas that are absolutely not easy to find. Thanks to this design decision, this means the player will fail at the goal the game has set to be accomplished.It's surprising to me how much love Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee has garnered through the years. It has far too many flaws to be enjoyed and it's way too annoying to be played to completion. This game could easily have been so much better than it actually is.Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is mediocre.			"

												Theres a reason they remade this game. This original has alot of problems.Progress is slow due to lack of checkpoints and wonky save systemEnimies far too overpowered. Everything is a 1 hit kill.Thats pretty much it. Every other Oddworld game, however, I really enjoyed. Abe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee, Stranger's Wrath and New 'n' Tasty I really enjoyed. Theres just this black sheeep of the bunch.  Its 2016 (or future) theres no point buying it. Get New 'n' Tasty instead. The only reason I brought this was because I really enjoyed New 'n' Tasty AND it was during the Summer Sale. Only 49p! Moral of the story: Play the remake.			"

												Was a great game when I was a kid. I'm sure it is now. But lemme tell you why I hate it soo much now.  The Devs man, the Devs.    Windowed Mode:  The version that has been released does not work in windowed mode. If you are looking to broadcast,♥♥♥♥♥♥off cuz it won't work.(WITHOUT THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE REQ) Even if you do get third party software, it will make the game so unplayable it will just disgust you.  Game Controllers:   Do not work. (THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE REQ) Again, the third party software sort of works. Ie A button works but directionals do not. Not only that but you can not set your key bindings to your controller let alone your own keyboard. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DEVS!!!???  WinCompat:  Sure it ""works"" on windows xp and newer versions but the direct x needs a super ♥♥♥♥ing upgrade to play nicely with windows 7 or 8. It is super ♥♥♥♥ing laggy. Like 8fps laggy. It literally skips frames through video. Game play is fine at moments.  Broadcasting:  Forget about it. The simple fact that windowed mode is not a option nor something that can be edited via steam gamelaunch settings. Just give up. You cannot broadcast it because the normal steam hot keys Shift+Tab doesn't work. Also it is not a game that can be auto-detected. On top of that, most broadcasters use extended displays. Well this game ♥♥♥♥s that up too. Have windows open on your other display and game on main? Well guess what, now you only have your game on your main screen because for whatever ♥♥♥♥ed up reasons the game does not allow it.  End Points:  Do I like the game. I liked it on its' console counter part. This ""works on pc"" release is♥♥♥♥♥♥ PURE♥♥♥♥♥♥ I would recommend spending your money elsewhere until or unless the DEVS come out with a update to fix that crap. Which I doubt will ever happen because they just do not give any ♥♥♥♥♥. If they did they would sell this half completed pc compatible game to us via steam. Which brings me to my last point. STEAM please pull your co-workers head out of their♥♥♥♥♥ We could use games that work the way the rest do. WINDOWED MODES, AND GAME SETUP ISSUES ON PURCHASE PAGES. DON""T WAIT FOR US TO FIND THIS CRAP. IT WASTES OUR TIME LOOKING FOR FIXES AND JUST FURTHER UPSETS US.Thank you for understanding.A very frustrated and disgruntled me at the moment. Sorry. You had it coming.Me "

												Don't buy this... ever... the games were great on the original PS1, but the port sucks balls as it always (100% of the times I tried starting it) crashed my entire laptop. According to some threads on the forums there are some solutions, but they are not foulproof at all, as a lot of the people still said that it still didn't work.I haven't been able to try out if the games run well on PC as it always crashes.If you really want to play this game, I suggest digging up your PS1 and buy the game for the console as it works great there.Sad to say, but steam messed up bigtime  by offering this up for sale when it's not even properly ported to PC			"

												I don't know what to make of this game. The game has some really good puzzles to get through but it is at the same time it is so infuriating to get through.When the game sets itself into small micro levels (such as the trails or zulag rooms) then the game is fun to get through where it gives you a decent checkpoint and a set of objectvies to complete to get through the area. Where you can easily try and complete the puzzles put before you. The limitations of the area which you need to transcend lets the game to florish.Unfortnately the game falls apart in the more larger levels. This mainly down to the extremly poor checkpoint system. The checkpointing system is too sparse and any bonus you do will not create a new checkpoint after completion so you end having to re do any bonus area if you die and this can make sections last alot longer then needed and it becomes infurtiating that you have to constantly have to recomplete large sections of the game to proceed.Another problem is the hit detection and platforming sections of the game. When sections of the game demand precise platform is where the worst parts of the game shows up. You can be hurt by jumping obstacles by just standing on the edge of the platform which is extremly annoying considering the one hit kills in this game. The game also demands extremly precise platforming that you can easily miss the jump. This is also not helped by slow turning movements and unresponsive controls.The AI is also annoying as you try to get it to do something specific and it ends up doing something else entirely.Overall This game was infuriating to play but when it slowed down and placed into much tighter and smaller areas the game really shines but it doesn't make up for the rest of the game.

												Oddworld games had an incredibly cinematic graphic for that time. Its gameplay is intelligent, and not as easy and boring as today´s games. It is truly challenging and fun! The story is interesting enough, and in overall it is a great game.EDIT: This will probably not work unless your PC is running on Windows XP. I recommend you play the remake instead.			"

												Look this isn't a bad game.It's just I never played it before now.I got it from the AGDQ 2015 humble bundle... I think...Anyways it doesnt seem to have controller support and the game just feels really really outdated.I know it's old and I'm probably missing out but for someone who never played it before I can't really get into it.I will probably give it another try in the future but whatever.If you did play it before and want to get the steam version, it works fine besides the fact that you need a little hack to get it to play in 1920x1080 (it doen't fill up the screen still but without it you can't see anything)I'll probably get Oddworld: New and Tasty at some point to get a more modern updated experience for this great game that I always heard it was.

												Thank you for making me waste my money I got this game a few days ago and Abe's exodus and both games don't want to work, I played this game originally and I hate it how I can't even play such a good game and to add insult to injury is that my money was wasted while there are plenty other things I could get. If I don't get a refund I would at least want the problem resolved. This is what happens I will start up Abe's Oddysee and It will start but when the first couple of lines of text come up it starts to go away but not all the way, then the looping of sounds start, after around 30-50 seconds a really annoying beep just plays non-stop. Like I said I loved these games and I would really like to play them but it's not worth this stress please either give me a refund or fix it. Thank you for your time.			"

												I hate this game. Hate it. HATE IT.I hate the clunky controls. I hate the music that inexplicably consists of explosion noises half the time. I hate its art style in which you cannot tell if something is a wall or not or on which plane of existence it's located. I hate its ever-changing rules.This is a game that will kill you for any mistake, however small, force you to replay the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whistling puzzle for the 45th bloody time, have you awkwardly platform around gun wielding enemies that react differently to you on every screen, and just before you reach the checkpoint it's gonna troll you. Something will happen. Something you couldn't have predicted. An enemy is gonna drop from the sky. A bat you assumed was in the background is gonna attack you. A boulder will fall on your head. And you will die. And you will have to replay everything above AGAIN.Small things will also change from screen to screen. Rules by which the game plays. They're never major. Just little inconsistencies that are just enough to kill and annoy you.There are good things in this game. The animal interactions, some of the puzzles and ideas behind the game are good. Too bad they're buried under the unfair trial and error ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the mind melting repetition.3/10			"

												Abe's Oddysee is an excellent game, although in this case you might save yourself some hassle and buy it from GOG where along with the latest patched version of the game you also get other goodies (soundtrack, wallpapers, etc). As much as I like Steam, Valve's staff doesn't really care about the state of the games they release (bugs, incompatibilities, DRM) so you might not enjoy the version released here (some reviews mention problems with cutscenes or just general laggy feeling).

Highly recomend getting the remake New n Tasty as it has better graphics and is supported on more mordern PC's.			"

												Where the Oddness began. And where one of the brightest childhood memories of mine also began.Hard not to love a game that has so much love put into it. The characters, the fleshed out world, the artstyle, visuals, humor, story, lore it's all there. As a kid this game's strangeness blew me away, the fun and challenging gameplay did the same. Using gamespeak you have to save your fellow mudokens from the evil Glukkons... or not. You can lead them to amusing deaths as well and just get the bad ending. It's all up to you. You can rush through if you wish.Be ready for oddness, for challenge, for visuals that look amazing to this day and for one helluva ride through Rupture Farms.""Legendary Limitless Luscious Lorne Lanning/10"" - Caddicarus			"

												Abe's Oddysee... a game that changed my pathetic little life so much that I became a cool kid instantly.The atmosphere is perfect, the music builds and releases so much tension. The gameplay is at a quick and gut busting pace with slow and high tension sneaking parts slapped in. Defusing bombs will leave a line of sweat running down your head and guiding each mudokkon to the bird portals is another notch on the belt that is your ever extending sympathetic exsistance.Your are a messiah sent to free your spirtual speices from the deathgrip of the industrious Glukkon, Magog Cartel.You and everyone around you is a slave to the meat factory that is about to start serving them as the main course, due to lack in sales and depletting numbers of the local wildlife. If you couldn't tell this game has tons of messages written in and compares to a lot of real world problems, but the cool part is you can completely ignore it all and still play this amazing 2-D screen-to-screen platformer.The character animations are fluid and controls have a somewhat high learning curve, but also a diverse and streamed lined running and jumping system once you learn them completely.There are a few bugs in this game, but none of them are game breaking in the sense that you can't just replay that section... and actually most bugs just leave me laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.It is fun to talk to the gaurds and other mudokkons with the genius game-speak. (although you can only talk to one person at a time *fixed in the second game*)There is one good and bad ending to this game depending on if you are nice and save people or a big meany that goes around killing all your fellow peoples. Oh and did I mention the cutscenes were legendary for their time... and IMHO still hold up today and look terrific.This game is hard, but no worry as you have infinite lifes and restart at specific check point locations. In the second game they upped the difficulty, but also added a quick save feature.Try it out... it will make you laugh, cry, scream, and say OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥!! Truely a master peice in my eyes.			"

												One of my absolute favourite games of all time and a cult classic of the PS1. If you aren't familiar with the Oddworld series, you have to play this game. It is dark, atmospheric, vast and epic and was one of the most revoutionary action-platformer's of its time. Yes the graphics are technically 2D, but they are GORGEOUS and the cutscenes are to die for. And this is from 1998.It's also really cheap so money doesn't even come into it. Buy this game! Do it!

However, this game work with Windows-8, so I'm not sure that problem is in OS... probably the problem is mostly in graphic cards ( resizing the screen properties)The game is awesome. And I don't really want to thumb it down. The price doesn't bite and you can try it at your own risk. I warned you!			"

I was born 1996 so I did not play it straight away but I do know as a fact it was one of the very first games I played and was the first game I leaned all the controls and strategy etc.  Again I don't really want to give away any story because I strongly encourage everyone to pick it up and play...And again IT'S ONLY £1.99!!!

												A long long time ago this was the pinacle of platforming. However degraded the graphics the gameplay and fun is still all there.It is way past a reboot, will anyone please kick-off a crowdfunding?The game encorperates sneaky mindcontrol, tactics and a avriable ending depending on how well you've done. So be carfull to liverate enough of your fellow slaves or pay the consequences!!			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. The world is filled with amazing creatures and environments. It's hard to believe that one developer could come up with so many interesting designs. The gameplay is very difficult at points, especially if you're trying to rescue every mudokan, but it is a rewarding experience. Each area is well thought out and designed. My only complaint is the that you can only have one mudokan follow you at a time, unlike the next game in the series where you can have multiple. This is used to give increased challenge in certain areas, but outside of those situations it is a nuisance.You will get many hours of enjoyment, as this is a fairly long game. I recommend everyone play this wonderful game.			"

												A bit of an indy game when it was originally released in the '90s for console, the only thing holding back this version is poor support for the XBOX 360 controller.  I strongly recommend using a 3rd party application to map the analog inputs to digital, because this game wants a controller, and it wants it bad.Stellar example of the genre, serious challenge, lots of dark (and yet lighthearted) humor.  Worth a playthrough for its atmosphere alone.			"

												While having excellent story, world and artwork, the game itself is extremely hard. You have to be 100% perfect about your timing, character location and movement, otherwise you will be dead. The game has zero tolerance for player's mistakes. Big part of the game difficulty is added by that weird checkpoint system which made you to go through the same screens again and again and make the same actions again and again, until you're dead and have to go through all those damn screens one more time. It's a shame it doesn't have a quicksave system, which would greatly improve player's experience and lower frustration. I see now why people usually recommend to play this game using the PS1 emulator which has the save system implemented.What's more to say? Just download the demo and try it for yourself. If you're patient and skillfull enough that game could be quite exciting. But for me... well, I beat Dark Souls, which is not the easisest game in the world, but Abe got on my nerves so much, that I had to quit playing,			"

												A nice blast from the past. I remember never finishing this many moons ago. Thought I would try again. I still very much enjoy the novelty of the game and the nice graphics.Trouble is, it's still very unforgiving and very frustrating in parts. Though those things are ok as that's just part of a good platformer. The thing I really don't like about the game is all the cheap deaths you incur. Some are there I'm sure, just so you can't do a level in one go. Pull a lever to bring down a lift and a slig pops up and creams you. Or you just go from one screen to the next and suddenly a slog  jumps in from behind you and kills you. Hard, fair games I enjoy and will battle on with. Games that make you do repeat screens because of cheap tricks turns me off.Thankfully, Abe's Oddysee has much to like about it but it doesn't fully compensate for the cheap tricks. Then comes the ending. This is the cheapest trick of all. ++++ spoiler alert +++ but read it anyway if you want to keep your sanity! So you battle all through the game. 26hrs of it (for me at least). You get to the end, only to be fed into the grinding machine because you didn't happen to save enough Mudokons!!! Up pops a smarta@@ sign saying blah, blah do it again you need to save at least 50 Mudokons. With that, I quit the game and will never go back to it. Just another example of a good game ruined. Why not give us that detail to begin with? Would simply have added another dimension to the game. But no, the old cheap tricks prevail. I have marked this as recommended, but it is with reservation that I do. I just wish I knew about the 50 limit when I started. Either that, or I wish I had blown up and splatted every Mudokon I saw. The worst part, was that I did actually try to save every Mudokon I came across and didn't give any a cheap death. Maybe I should play it again just so I can see Mudokon bits flying everwhere bwahahahaha.			"

												Played this game when I was young but got bad ending, decided to get it and replay to try and get the good ending. Generally, it is a game that requires careful planning and good control.A great game that I'll recommend. However, the bad thing is that when you save, you actually save by region rather than progress, and furthermore, there is no clear indication of where is the checkpoint. Which means if you played halfway through a particular region and rescued, for example, half of the mudokuns in that region and then did a manual save, then made a wrong move and decided to reload that saved game, you'll end up restarting the region instead of continuing from the part where you already saved half the number of mudokuns.

												I had very fond memories of Abe's Oddysee playing the PS1 demo, but when I finally got the game on steam I found out that this game was so much better than I remember. On your first playthrough you're gonna stumble on so many hurdles but can still be fun, but I think the game will shine even brighter on your next playthroughs when you try to get 100%, and have experience to know what to look out for for secret portals/areas.Despite it's age Abe's Oddysee can still hold its own, if you're the nostalgic type.

												A classic back from the hardcore days. It's balls to the walls hard but it will reward you in a way that current games don't anymore. It's Dark Souls difficulty still keeping with the theme of fairness but there are points where if you don't think it through you will scream and curse the game.Also you can't say a good thing about Abe without mentioning the black humor apparent in these games. 'All Mudokons who pass by this point will be beaten and shot before being processed into disgusting yet yummy novelty meat'.			"

												As the initial game in the Oddworld universe, Abe's Obyssee takes some beating.  The characters are quirky, the world is well-defined, and the level design is tight.  And who doesn't love a soon-to-be-eaten slave with his mouth sewn shut?			"

												Abe: Hello  Slig: *Replies* Hi...*Pause*...what?Abe Oddysee, one of my most beloved games I've played since I was a little lad. Playing this again makes me want to keep playing it all the way through, finding all the secrets and rescue all the Mudokons!Anyway, excellent game! Controls well, very puzzly and complicated for your mind to figure out, rememberable and likable characters. It does tend to error and glitch sometimes, but not very often, not much of a problem.I give this game 10/10 Scrab Cakes! MmmMm![No Scrabs were injuried or served as food during the making of this recommendation. I love Scrabs dearly and hope nothing horrible will happen to them.]			"

												One of the funnest, most nostalgic games I remember playing. Still is just as challenging as it was the first time I played it years ago. Plenty of traps, puzzles, mind control, and everything that a good game needs to keep you thinking of what's up ahead, and what's there to kill you. Definitely an easy to get into game, and really easy right from the start, but brings you a whole heap of challenges once you really get into it. If you enjoy platformers, thinking on your feet, and running from terrifying creatures, I definitely reccomend this game.			"

												OddWorld: Abe's Oddyee( hehe) is a classic. I stumble upon this game as a child from a old PS1 Demo. The demo showcased the game to me as a child that I would remember it as an Adult. I built my PC recently and been buying & collecting the Wonderful Classics( Not trashy ones). This game is a Classic and to be frank, if you can't use your brain or lack patience, you best watch some youtube walkthroughs or read one to unwind into this wonderful game because this game ain't for stupid, son.

												A great old time game with great amount of challenge that ( in my opinion ) could even match that of Dark Souls, as this games puzzles and challenges can be unforgiving, punishing you for failing by making you repeat difficult and tedious parts after each death unless there is a checkpoint or you manage to reach one.Personally, for a game that dates back to 1997, its graphics aren't half bad - although for me, graphics don't make a game.The difficulity in this game feels a bit ""zig zaggy"", meaning that it changes from easy to hard to easy to hard and at some points of the game it especially feels like so, where one puzzle is easily solved in a moment, but the following one can be difficult and tedious.Also, I've already twice come across ILS ( Infinite Loading Screen ) problem, where on the first time I lost my 3 hours of progress due to not having saved - and not expecting this problem to even occur in this game - and second one not too long ago since writing this review. I don't know if it's just me or if anyone else might have this problem occur.Despite its scale of difficulity, its sometimes tedious puzzles and the mentioned ILS problem, I truly love this game, for both nostalgia reasons - as I used to play this when I was young - and for the fact that I find it fun in general.Would I recommend this game? Yes! Definately! If difficult, puzzle platformers are to your liking. Or if you are curious about it overall, then I do recommend to check it out.			"

												Oh Abe. Just a guy who's seen too much, the only person who can stop these Fat Cats from chewing his people among others out of existence literally. Gameplay that might only be appreiciated at the time of it's release or hopefully will be a fresh feel for those who are new. Worth readjusting to the play style for puzzles and events. Very tough on gamer's thinking and problem solving abilities. Hilarious satire on modern life now -  not too mention the direct look on what CEO's do on a daily basis.			"

												A nice blast from the past. I remember never finishing this many moons ago. Thought I would try again. I still very much enjoy the novelty of the game and the nice graphics.Trouble is, it's still very unforgiving and very frustrating in parts. Though those things are ok as that's just part of a good platformer. The thing I really don't like about the game is all the cheap deaths you incur. Some are there I'm sure, just so you can't do a level in one go. Pull a lever to bring down a lift and a slig pops up and creams you. Or you just go from one screen to the next and suddenly a slog  jumps in from behind you and kills you. Hard, fair games I enjoy and will battle on with. Games that make you do repeat screens because of cheap tricks turns me off.Thankfully, Abe's Oddysee has much to like about it but it doesn't fully compensate for the cheap tricks. Then comes the ending. This is the cheapest trick of all. ++++ spoiler alert +++ but read it anyway if you want to keep your sanity! So you battle all through the game. 26hrs of it (for me at least). You get to the end, only to be fed into the grinding machine because you didn't happen to save enough Mudokons!!! Up pops a smarta@@ sign saying blah, blah do it again you need to save at least 50 Mudokons. With that, I quit the game and will never go back to it. Just another example of a good game ruined. Why not give us that detail to begin with? Would simply have added another dimension to the game. But no, the old cheap tricks prevail. I have marked this as recommended, but it is with reservation that I do. I just wish I knew about the 50 limit when I started. Either that, or I wish I had blown up and splatted every Mudokon I saw. The worst part, was that I did actually try to save every Mudokon I came across and didn't give any a cheap death. Maybe I should play it again just so I can see Mudokon bits flying everwhere bwahahahaha.			"

												   They don't make them like this anymore, or at least, not until the release of the New and Tasty HD version.  This game can be quite easy, or devilishly tough, depending on how many of the secrets you want to find and complete.  To finish the game with all 99 rescued is very tough indeed.  Classic 2D platform gameplay with a clever twist, the posession chant makes for some very clever puzzles and the wide variety of creatures and bad guys, each with their own behaviour traits, gives an ever changing experience throught the game, even if some parts do leave you tearing your hair out.  For the price it's on Steam at, this game is a must.			"

P.S I noticed a reviewer mention that this steam version doesnt have the multiple endings. Not true its exactly like the original, i saved all the mudokens and I got the good ending.

												Abe's Oddysee... a game that changed my pathetic little life so much that I became a cool kid instantly.The atmosphere is perfect, the music builds and releases so much tension. The gameplay is at a quick and gut busting pace with slow and high tension sneaking parts slapped in. Defusing bombs will leave a line of sweat running down your head and guiding each mudokkon to the bird portals is another notch on the belt that is your ever extending sympathetic exsistance.Your are a messiah sent to free your spirtual speices from the deathgrip of the industrious Glukkon, Magog Cartel.You and everyone around you is a slave to the meat factory that is about to start serving them as the main course, due to lack in sales and depletting numbers of the local wildlife. If you couldn't tell this game has tons of messages written in and compares to a lot of real world problems, but the cool part is you can completely ignore it all and still play this amazing 2-D screen-to-screen platformer.The character animations are fluid and controls have a somewhat high learning curve, but also a diverse and streamed lined running and jumping system once you learn them completely.There are a few bugs in this game, but none of them are game breaking in the sense that you can't just replay that section... and actually most bugs just leave me laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.It is fun to talk to the gaurds and other mudokkons with the genius game-speak. (although you can only talk to one person at a time *fixed in the second game*)There is one good and bad ending to this game depending on if you are nice and save people or a big meany that goes around killing all your fellow peoples. Oh and did I mention the cutscenes were legendary for their time... and IMHO still hold up today and look terrific.This game is hard, but no worry as you have infinite lifes and restart at specific check point locations. In the second game they upped the difficulty, but also added a quick save feature.Try it out... it will make you laugh, cry, scream, and say OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥!! Truely a master peice in my eyes.			"

Abe's Oddysee on Steam however, some users might find that they have to fidgit with their computer settings and video settings to get the game to work.  I still haven't figured how to get the game's cut scenes to look better, but I managed to get the game overall to work.  Also, a gamepad is VERY highly recommended.			"

												One of the greatest action-adventure platform games ever made! (Abe's Exodus was better but I haven't even finished any of them...). The puzzles can be excrutiatingly hard and it would be almost fitting to call this the Demon/Dark Souls of the platform games. If you want to get a 100% completion rate, expect to die, A LOT. Fantastic game nonetheless.			"

And maybe Abe is just sluggish, but when you die from like one hit to anything, you kinda want some more precision. >.<			"

												Buy this instead of New 'n' Tasty (the remake). The graphics are much darker and more depressing like they should be, the animations and the controls are better for this type of game. Also the backgrounds are better because the art team had the chance to edit them after the rendering process and add a bit of extra detail. The remake is too bright, flashy and Abe moves in a different, less clunky way which makes him feel more powerful. This version runs perfectly on old computers as well as modern ones. I recommend it for both new players and old Oddworld fans back from the PS1 era.			"

This game and its offshoot Abe's Exodus have aged well over the years, solid platforming and puzzle solving using speech are a plus.

												Mountain of nostalgia aside, OAO is a classic. Its a solid platformer with all of the unintentionally unforgiving mechanics that came naturally to videos games of the 90s which more recent games have intentionally tried to recreate. I would suggest playing with a controller, the way it was meant to be played. The keyboard feels terribly clunky and OAO requires tight timing and reflexes.			"

The only drawback is the saving.The story is very good and pulling with rememrable characters.You are Abe a Mudokon, you and your fellow Mudokons work in Rupterfarms the biggest meat-prossesing plant on Oddworld (you are really a slave) One dark night you discover the horrible truth the Glukkens (the manegers of the factory) running out of wildlife to chup-up and now they're planning to make the Mudokons into tasty treats.Help Abe to escape Rupterfarms reveal his destiny unlock new powers and save as many Mudokons as you can.I highly recommend this game 10/10			"

												This game was my childhood from start to finsh. But for now lets talk about about the gameplay itself. Firstly this game can be rather hard at times, but when you master the controls you will never fail. Oh did i mention you will get killed ALOT. lorne lanning's voice for abe was ingenius. The music was atmospheric from a dark factory to a moonlight valley. The characters npc and enimes were diffrent from normal animals or mythical creatures from Crash bandicoot or Spyro. So incheck this game is good for people who like nail biting sneaking and mind bending puzzles.			"

												Abe's Oddysee... a game that changed my pathetic little life so much that I became a cool kid instantly.The atmosphere is perfect, the music builds and releases so much tension. The gameplay is at a quick and gut busting pace with slow and high tension sneaking parts slapped in. Defusing bombs will leave a line of sweat running down your head and guiding each mudokkon to the bird portals is another notch on the belt that is your ever extending sympathetic exsistance.Your are a messiah sent to free your spirtual speices from the deathgrip of the industrious Glukkon, Magog Cartel.You and everyone around you is a slave to the meat factory that is about to start serving them as the main course, due to lack in sales and depletting numbers of the local wildlife. If you couldn't tell this game has tons of messages written in and compares to a lot of real world problems, but the cool part is you can completely ignore it all and still play this amazing 2-D screen-to-screen platformer.The character animations are fluid and controls have a somewhat high learning curve, but also a diverse and streamed lined running and jumping system once you learn them completely.There are a few bugs in this game, but none of them are game breaking in the sense that you can't just replay that section... and actually most bugs just leave me laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.It is fun to talk to the gaurds and other mudokkons with the genius game-speak. (although you can only talk to one person at a time *fixed in the second game*)There is one good and bad ending to this game depending on if you are nice and save people or a big meany that goes around killing all your fellow peoples. Oh and did I mention the cutscenes were legendary for their time... and IMHO still hold up today and look terrific.This game is hard, but no worry as you have infinite lifes and restart at specific check point locations. In the second game they upped the difficulty, but also added a quick save feature.Try it out... it will make you laugh, cry, scream, and say OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥!! Truely a master peice in my eyes.			"

												A long long time ago this was the pinacle of platforming. However degraded the graphics the gameplay and fun is still all there.It is way past a reboot, will anyone please kick-off a crowdfunding?The game encorperates sneaky mindcontrol, tactics and a avriable ending depending on how well you've done. So be carfull to liverate enough of your fellow slaves or pay the consequences!!			"

												You will NEVER find a game series quite like this. I'm serious, out of all the games I have seen, none of them can match up to the Odd World series in terms of pure artistry. And that is exactly what this game is: Pure Interactive Art. So much effort is put into the creature designs and world design that it's almost enough to carry this game, but, for me at least, what really makes this game shine is its story telling. The way it introduces you to this world and the environments it takes you to will completely captivate you and drive you to see what else this game has to offer. Not to mention that this game has aged like fine wine in terms of graphics and art style. To this day it still looks every bit as beautiful as it did back then and no other game (not even Donkey Kong Country) has aged quite as well as this has. Hell, I didn't even notice the slightest hint of wrinkles until I saw footage of the game's remake, New and Tasty.Now despite this game having aged beautifully graphics wise, the gameplay (while still really satisfying at points) is balls to the wall hard. How hard? I couldn't finish it, that's how hard. It doesn't help that this game has a checkpoint system that reminded me quite a bit of Jak 2. *shivers* I'm not even going to tell you how many times I screamed at this game out of pure frustration. Either of them. Despite that, however, I can't help but think very fondly of this game because this game is just that damn charming even after it figurartively punched you in the balls twice.All in all this game is one of the greats purely by art style and story telling alone, however be prepared for when this game decides to flip its♥♥♥♥♥♥and make you suffer.8.9/10			"

												This game is a 2D platformer with a lot to show.You play as the role of Abe and your instantly threw into danger where you must run, sneak and make smart moves in order to stay alive, take use of Abe's chanting power to control the minds of the sligs, Rapture farm's half robotic, half something else security team.Your job is to save all the modukons who are trapped working as slaves before they get turned into a tasty snack, but who wants to be a do gooder? this game does not give a s*** as your free to kill them all with funny and inventive ways just remember bad things happen to bad people.The level design is fantastic, you do feel like your in a very dangerous place and thanks to everything being in 2D, the game's artists really got to show of their skills with this, escaping rapture farms is your first priority, this can be done by running. sneaking or a cheat code (you lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) after that you get to see so much and encounter plenty of heart pounding momments that really get your exited in the game (not a sex scene you dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)The story is kept together very well, you know why he does what he is doing and you understand why the ending plays out the way it is. hell, you could even say that you feel like you are abe at points.The game's humour quite adult at times with some immature humour thrown in at some momments, its very well timed and keeps you laughting all the way through such a gritty and depressing landscape.You should know plenty now, you will want this game and if you missed out playing it on the playstation 1, I feel bad for you. I really do.If you did, why the hell did you read this review			"

I had this game for the PS ONE and when it came out on Steam... I couldn't resist. I had to play this game over and over again. If you pay attention to the story, you'll see our world taken to ridiculously true levels. Also, fart jokes have been made fun again.			"

												This game was my childhood from start to finsh. But for now lets talk about about the gameplay itself. Firstly this game can be rather hard at times, but when you master the controls you will never fail. Oh did i mention you will get killed ALOT. lorne lanning's voice for abe was ingenius. The music was atmospheric from a dark factory to a moonlight valley. The characters npc and enimes were diffrent from normal animals or mythical creatures from Crash bandicoot or Spyro. So incheck this game is good for people who like nail biting sneaking and mind bending puzzles.			"

												Mountain of nostalgia aside, OAO is a classic. Its a solid platformer with all of the unintentionally unforgiving mechanics that came naturally to videos games of the 90s which more recent games have intentionally tried to recreate. I would suggest playing with a controller, the way it was meant to be played. The keyboard feels terribly clunky and OAO requires tight timing and reflexes.			"

												First of all: I've experienced none of the bugs described in some reviews here; I run the game in compatability mode for Windows 2000 and as admin every time and it works fine. My only slight issue is that if I remap the keys it automatically resets them the next time the game loads up but it's not a huge issue.Personally I'd say I can't speak from a ""never played it before"" perspective, if you never have and you dislike platformers (as I tend to do as well) normally then you may well dislike this too, but if you played this as a kid and enjoyed it back then, it's cheap and definitely worth it for some reminiscing! And I suppose it speaks for how much I've grown up in the last 15 years that I still chuckle at the fart noises and making him roll head-first into walls...			"

""Hello!"" ""Hello"" ""follow me"" ""ok""tricking friends into walking into traps for you, ah the good days. when I moved houses I thought I would never be able to play this fantastic game again, but thanks to SteamTM I can. The only down side is that it is INSANELY difficult and that you need a lot of patience. But other than that it's still the game I remember and will always love, I can't wait for the hd re-release of the series.P.S:Bats can kill you with one bite.			"

												My last review of this game was negative. I had tried several of the different fixes to get it running correctly, and none had done what they claimed to do. I have finally found a fix for both this and Exoddus, and other than a framerate issue during the videos they work as they should. If you have these games already I will give you a link to the .zip file that fixed my problem. If you do not have them in your library, I would recommend you wait until New 'N Tasty is released, and buy that instead. For those of you that own it I would recommend you install it, download the fix, and play the hell out of them before the new one is released. Overall this game is a 9.5/10.https://www.dropbox.com/s/y83j47btjhpesq8/Oddworld%20Win7%268%20Fix%20%2B%20Windowed%20Mode%20Fix.zip^^^The link to the .zip file fix.

												This game was my childhood, and I can say without a doubt that it's just as brilliant and enthralling now as it was back in the 90's. This, alongside Abe's Exoddus, is a must have for anyone looking for an exciting, fun, amusing and challenging game. The world is beautiful, the story is riveting and deep, even philosophical if you look deep enough, and the characters are engaging and easy to become attached to, and this runs right throughout the Oddworld series. I think this is second to only the sequel, Abe's Exoddus, only because of the implementation of the quick save feature and the 'All o' ya!' button in gamespeak. Although my steam play time may not show it, this is one of the games I've played the most of, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. If you haven't played this game yet, do it now, it's dirt cheap and you're paying for an unforgettable experience.			"

												Abe's Oddysee... a game that changed my pathetic little life so much that I became a cool kid instantly.The atmosphere is perfect, the music builds and releases so much tension. The gameplay is at a quick and gut busting pace with slow and high tension sneaking parts slapped in. Defusing bombs will leave a line of sweat running down your head and guiding each mudokkon to the bird portals is another notch on the belt that is your ever extending sympathetic exsistance.Your are a messiah sent to free your spirtual speices from the deathgrip of the industrious Glukkon, Magog Cartel.You and everyone around you is a slave to the meat factory that is about to start serving them as the main course, due to lack in sales and depletting numbers of the local wildlife. If you couldn't tell this game has tons of messages written in and compares to a lot of real world problems, but the cool part is you can completely ignore it all and still play this amazing 2-D screen-to-screen platformer.The character animations are fluid and controls have a somewhat high learning curve, but also a diverse and streamed lined running and jumping system once you learn them completely.There are a few bugs in this game, but none of them are game breaking in the sense that you can't just replay that section... and actually most bugs just leave me laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.It is fun to talk to the gaurds and other mudokkons with the genius game-speak. (although you can only talk to one person at a time *fixed in the second game*)There is one good and bad ending to this game depending on if you are nice and save people or a big meany that goes around killing all your fellow peoples. Oh and did I mention the cutscenes were legendary for their time... and IMHO still hold up today and look terrific.This game is hard, but no worry as you have infinite lifes and restart at specific check point locations. In the second game they upped the difficulty, but also added a quick save feature.Try it out... it will make you laugh, cry, scream, and say OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥OH♥♥♥♥♥♥!!

This first game in what is intended to be a quintology features 2D platforming puzzles where you lead the helpless Mudoken slaves out of the massive interior of Rupture Farms; an environment that never lets you forget how small you are.Sadly, this PC port offers nothing more than the original Playstation version and lacks true gamepad support.

												Abe's Oddysee, a beloved game from the past and a ""gorgeous bit of crumpet"" [Caddicarus, 2013] set in an abstract world seemingly run by a corporate overworld called 'the glukkens'.Here's the thing, as some people might find nostalgia and enjoyment out of a game they loved so much, I went in completely blind and had to learn everything and experience everything from a modern perspective. At first I didn't mind the old look about it, Abe was adorable and charming, the story was sinister and the enemies had reason to be enemies.I began playing, runnin away from soldiers, saving mudokens and having a jolly good time...until I escaped. After a silly cutscene of Abe escaping the farm, I'm tossed into a pit with more escaping to do. This is where the absolute BULL**** started to seep in. The 'puzzles' began to lean into the side of ""get to the other side before the creatures get you/soldiers shoot you"" and that's when my thumb went from up to down. Don't worry I gave this game a fair go, I escaped the pit, made it through mudoken city and through the desert of pointy faced f***ers, only to finally stop at the next trial. It was this place I finally learned that this game is dated, the controls are kind of like a pokemon game in which Abe is only in one specific spot at a time which can lead to extremely pinpoint interactions of having to be in one specific square on the grid that is this game's exploration.The puzzles themselves start to get horrendous, sometimes with no visible solution and the only plausible way of getting around it takes 20 tries to get right, each try sending you an unfair distance back due to a lack of quicksaving or well placed checkpoints.There is a completionist goal however, there are 99 mudokens to liberate and they can be either well hidden, out in the open or in a place where they'll be killed if you don't act or do the wrong thing. The fact that they're so well hidden gives this game plenty of replayability if you want that sweet completionist rating, however the puzzles are too bloody difficult that I'm going to have to dissapoint Mr. Jirard Dragonrider Khalil and never complete (let alone finish) this frustrating mess.Overall 2/10, for all the praise this game gets, it sure does give me a ton of broken furniture.

												I have first played a demo on this game on PlayStation on December 6th 1998, as an 8-year old scrub, not knowing enough english to understand anything aside from Game Speak, and yet I immediately fell in love with it. So much, that for Christmas in the same year I got the full version, in German so I didn't understand the plot AT ALL. But, the gameplay, that was something else. This was probably the first game of this type where you could interact with characters in such a way (giving them commands), and I'm not entirely sure if anything other than Oddworld series did that. The game is also very hard, but in a good way (think like Dark Souls - challenging, but fair, and the moment you beat a hard segment? Pure satisfaction).Now go forward a few years, to December 21, 2010. The date OddBox released on Steam, containing within two classics, Abe's Oddysee with it's sequel, Exoddus; another game from the series Munch's Oddysee and a spinoff Stranger's Wrath, where the last two were released for the first time outside of original Xbox. It was a must have, and now, knowing english very well, the plot is a masterpiece.In short, if you are a fan of challenging platforming games and love some dark humor going with a great story, this game is for you.

												You know those games you got when you were a child and you played the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, even when you already beat them? This is one of those games of my childhood, it comes with a major problem, sadly.1: Checkpoints. Often I will find a secret area, spend 1-15 minutes figuring out how to do it, leave the secret area, die to something and have that 1-15 minutes of progress lost and having to be repeated EACH time you make a mistake until the next checkpoint. You get better and can execute the puzzles faster, but the ""secret area"" puzzles are generally very difficult. There's one as early on as the first few screens of the game and damn is it frustrating to be forced to redo it each time you die to something entirely unrelated later on. This isn't the kind of game you can just pick up and not make any mistakes, and sticking to the main path the game handles it's saves very well, but you will die, you will come across trial and error moments, and you will lose some progress.2:Controls: Once you get familiar, or played this game for your entire childhood (oh and use good gamepad) the controls aren't AS big of an issue. They are still an issue, it's just not as awful. There's also very little in the way of explaining some of the more advanced things you can do. You can run into a jump, you can run into a roll, you can throw objects while crouching and in 4 directions, if you tap forward you will take one step no matter what. These aren't really problems for the guy who spent countless hours (no steam time counter on ps1 lol) on the game in his childhood but to new comers I can imagine the controls are a bit frustrating to learn on your own.The game is great if you don't try to be a completionist and stay on the main storyline and is challenging without being frustrating, but when you start to try to solve the longer/more difficult secret areas later in the game, losing that 1-15 minutes of progress EACH time you have a death to something that would've been hard to predict, it's easy to lose motivation when there is a really out of date save system. I mean cheap deaths or ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ didn't see that coming"" moments can be entertaining and I don't even think there's anything wrong with them, but replaying big portions of complex/difficult levels gets tedious for those of us who seek out the extra/secret areas and want to finish them.That being said, I believe Abe's exodus introduced a quicksave and a ton of other great features. This game's story and world will captivate you, it's gameplay is great, but the checkpoint system and learning curve that come with a completionist mindset are harsh and likely not worth it without the massive nostalgia goggles I have on.

												Played this game when I was young but got bad ending, decided to get it and replay to try and get the good ending. Generally, it is a game that requires careful planning and good control.A great game that I'll recommend. However, the bad thing is that when you save, you actually save by region rather than progress, and furthermore, there is no clear indication of where is the checkpoint. Which means if you played halfway through a particular region and rescued, for example, half of the mudokuns in that region and then did a manual save, then made a wrong move and decided to reload that saved game, you'll end up restarting the region instead of continuing from the part where you already saved half the number of mudokuns.

Best I can say is if you have Windows 10 don't purchase, but if not, going by other reviews, I can only assume it's as amazing as the original.			"

												Buy this instead of New 'n' Tasty (the remake). The graphics are much darker and more depressing like they should be, the animations and the controls are better for this type of game. Also the backgrounds are better because the art team had the chance to edit them after the rendering process and add a bit of extra detail. The remake is too bright, flashy and Abe moves in a different, less clunky way which makes him feel more powerful. This version runs perfectly on old computers as well as modern ones. I recommend it for both new players and old Oddworld fans back from the PS1 era.			"

												Having extensively played the PS1 original and fully completed the PC port version of this absolute masterpiece of a game, I can safely say that this is perhaps the worst PC port of any game that I have ever come across.Pay no attention to my playtime, I completed this while my net was down.The controls are even blockier and less responsive than on PS1. Naturally, this comes with the platform but somehow this PC port manages to worsen the issue. You're left having to press 2 five or six times to tell your friends to follow you, as much of the time nothing whatsoever happens when you attempt to do so. You will often kill yourself not due to your own personal error but because you have simply kept going when you've stopped pressing your movement keys. This is particularly frustrating when you're  disarming bombs , due to the precision needed. Next, cutscenes. For whatever reason, every single cutscene and animation in the game, including the  startup animations , are limited to a literal frame per second. Again, originally being a PS1 game obviously would place limits on framerate but you'd expect for a PC port to increase framerates, not the exact opposite. What were memorable and important moments in the game on PS1 are now frustrating and unwelcome breaks in the already blocky play of this port. Only actual gameplay runs semi-respectably.My only quall with the original PS1 version was the saving system and, you guessed it, this port makes absolutely no effort to rectify the problems. You can save anywhere, anytime, however you are almost guaranteed to pick up the game again in an entirely different spot to where you saved. We aren't talking ages back, more a couple of rooms or puzzles back from where you were, but this is frustrating nonetheless- I've personally lost up to ten minutes of progress from an awful save system.Finally, we reach the biggest problem. The one aspect that makes this port absolutely unforgiveable.The ending. It isn't the same.I spent hours working out how to successfully save all 99 of your mudokon friends, as I was never able to complete this when I was younger. The last one jumps into the portal, and I'm expecting to get some sort of special cutscene or something, a reward for full completion.I get a message, telling me that I cannot actually see the content that I would have seen, due to recommendations from their lawyers. Instead, I get a list of the cutscenes that I've already seen, and of course, they don't load.Abe's Oddysee is an incredible game, a real classic of the PS1 era.This port destroys it, and it does downplay the great memories I had trying to complete it when I was younger.Play the PS1 version.

												Abe's Oddysee is a masterpiece of satire, dark humour and social commentary. One of the few video games to tackle serious real-world issues, Oddysee shines a darkly comedic yet sickly light on the cruelties of factory farming, as well as the exploitation of native cultures and wildlife by corporate greed. The game deals with the dichotomy of industrial and spiritual world views, and places us into a violent, weird and odd world. Just like our own.While these meanings and intentions are confirmed and stem from Oddworld's brainchild Lorne Lanning, all of this is likely lost on most of Oddworld's audience. It certainly was lost on me when I played it as a small child. However, Oddworld Inhabitants provided an exciting, intruiging and challenging experience in Oddysee whether or not the meanings were decoded. And later on, when the messages become more prevalent, it simply gives us more to talk about, and furthers the cause of games as effective, communicative art.Overall, Abe's Oddysee is a great game with a compelling setting and story. Exoddus is a brilliant follow-up, with more of the same. Both highly recommended and unexpectedly intelligent gems.			"

												Oh man. I remember playing this game in elementary school about 15 years ago. This game was pure nostalgia from the into on. Playing this game now as an adult, I don't know how I ever played this game without royaly freaking out. For anyone looking for a true challenge I highly recommend this game. There is so much trial and error with frustration in the middle. Fifteen years later I finally completed the game, making it so much more satisfying.			"

												You know what I want in a platformer? Moving on a grid where if I start moving I cant stop untill i get to the next space like i'm playing chess then, being asked to quickly move on small platforms to save 99 nameless people that I couldn't conceivably care about, exept for the fact they would give me a better ending, Which makes any commentary on people using others as a means to an end being bad hypocritical, as anyone that plays this game will be doing exact the same thing as the main villans, which is using other people as a means to an end. honestly i dont know why people enjoy this game.

												Must be one of the hardest platformer games in history. I played it lots when I was a kid and never got beyond half way. I'm playing my way through it again (patience permitting) but I'm settling in for the long hall: there's only so many hundreds of deaths I can handle before I hit uninstall and leave it for a few monthsSolving how to get through the levels... nearly impossibleGetting the timing right to do it ... nearly impossibleGetting the other mudokons out while you do it ... laughaby impossibleActually managing to accomplish it... incredibly satisfyingFrustrating and compelling.

												Abes Oddysee: This game is what got me into video games from the start. When i was about 10-12 years old my dad pulled out a PS1 gave me a copy of Abes Odysee and it was as love at first play, the gritty textures, the darkness, the sligs and other habitants make this game a game to remember with there sounds unique controles and puzzles. I hope you play this game and if doesnt work on steam, go buy a ps1/2/3 and play it on there. You wont regret it. Also consider buying Abes Exodus, its almos as good as the first! Peace out! "

												Having extensively played the PS1 original and fully completed the PC port version of this absolute masterpiece of a game, I can safely say that this is perhaps the worst PC port of any game that I have ever come across.Pay no attention to my playtime, I completed this while my net was down.The controls are even blockier and less responsive than on PS1. Naturally, this comes with the platform but somehow this PC port manages to worsen the issue. You're left having to press 2 five or six times to tell your friends to follow you, as much of the time nothing whatsoever happens when you attempt to do so. You will often kill yourself not due to your own personal error but because you have simply kept going when you've stopped pressing your movement keys. This is particularly frustrating when you're  disarming bombs , due to the precision needed. Next, cutscenes. For whatever reason, every single cutscene and animation in the game, including the  startup animations , are limited to a literal frame per second. Again, originally being a PS1 game obviously would place limits on framerate but you'd expect for a PC port to increase framerates, not the exact opposite. What were memorable and important moments in the game on PS1 are now frustrating and unwelcome breaks in the already blocky play of this port. Only actual gameplay runs semi-respectably.My only quall with the original PS1 version was the saving system and, you guessed it, this port makes absolutely no effort to rectify the problems. You can save anywhere, anytime, however you are almost guaranteed to pick up the game again in an entirely different spot to where you saved. We aren't talking ages back, more a couple of rooms or puzzles back from where you were, but this is frustrating nonetheless- I've personally lost up to ten minutes of progress from an awful save system.Finally, we reach the biggest problem. The one aspect that makes this port absolutely unforgiveable.The ending. It isn't the same.I spent hours working out how to successfully save all 99 of your mudokon friends, as I was never able to complete this when I was younger. The last one jumps into the portal, and I'm expecting to get some sort of special cutscene or something, a reward for full completion.I get a message, telling me that I cannot actually see the content that I would have seen, due to recommendations from their lawyers. Instead, I get a list of the cutscenes that I've already seen, and of course, they don't load.Abe's Oddysee is an incredible game, a real classic of the PS1 era.This port destroys it, and it does downplay the great memories I had trying to complete it when I was younger.Play the PS1 version.

												One of the most difficult, most original, and gorgeous games you'll ever play.If you've played, you know what I mean: ODDWORLD  is a universe as deep as Lucas' original STAR WARS.  Play one, and you know nothing else plays like it.  It's not just that the creature designs make Stan Winston green with envy (Paramites.  Paramites paramites paramites.), or that the in-game world feels alive and like its own independent entity (from industrial signage to mystic caverns), and the difficulty of the puzzles is only matched by the precision controls (which  help you handle and eventually defeat the puzzles) and endless lives (novel for its time!) ...but all of this hangs together with its story in such a way that elevates ODDWORLD into its own realm.  This is a special game, a difficult one!, tense in mood, but oh-so-satisfying when you win it.  Recommended for basically everyone with opposable thumbs. "

												I have first played a demo on this game on PlayStation on December 6th 1998, as an 8-year old scrub, not knowing enough english to understand anything aside from Game Speak, and yet I immediately fell in love with it. So much, that for Christmas in the same year I got the full version, in German so I didn't understand the plot AT ALL. But, the gameplay, that was something else. This was probably the first game of this type where you could interact with characters in such a way (giving them commands), and I'm not entirely sure if anything other than Oddworld series did that. The game is also very hard, but in a good way (think like Dark Souls - challenging, but fair, and the moment you beat a hard segment? Pure satisfaction).Now go forward a few years, to December 21, 2010. The date OddBox released on Steam, containing within two classics, Abe's Oddysee with it's sequel, Exoddus; another game from the series Munch's Oddysee and a spinoff Stranger's Wrath, where the last two were released for the first time outside of original Xbox. It was a must have, and now, knowing english very well, the plot is a masterpiece.In short, if you are a fan of challenging platforming games and love some dark humor going with a great story, this game is for you.

												This is my favorite game of all time, and I realize I'm saying this from a biased position;as a kid, I used to play this game, and Abe's Exoddus a lot, it was pretty much all I did when I got home, I just loved the rush of running away from sligs and solving puzzles.But having played it again on my phone, recently, I found that it easily stood the test of time for me, and with the release of New N' Tasty, I got to experience the wonderful world design, characters, funny story, mechanics and gameplay.Even today, I can appreciate the artstyle of the old game, despite the low quality textures, I still think it looks amazing.You pretty much have to play this with a controller or on your phone, the controls are a bit delayed on this version, but if you can make it work, great, but I would still heavily recommend buying New N' Tasty.

It doesn't suffer from a lot of the issues other games from its time may normally suffer from and the majority of the game has aged very well. I believe it's aged so well because of how far ahead of its time it was and of course, the amount of time and love that was put into it. I have beaten this game numerous times on Playstation and I even beat it once with 100% completion, which was no easy task, but it was a lot of fun and more rewarding than achievements in many more modern games.The political undertones within Abe's Oddysee are by no means subtle but they are done so well and clearly weren't just shoehorned in; this game and its story were all built with meaning everywhere. The message is found within it and not the other way around. It's a great message with meaningful characters that could easily have felt generic and certainly could have been more two dimensional like many games at the time. Keep in mind - this is before we even touch the surface of the gameplay. This game is a work of art in that respect as well. The game design is very tightly knit. It's so obvious that the developer loved this game and poured hundreds of hours into ensuring it had a fine layer of polish in every aspect of its design. Your motive is clear from a story standpoint and from a gameplay standpoint. You can almost always immediately see what needs to be done and any thought process required for figuring something out always ends with an intutive solution and never leaves you shaking your head in frustration or disbelief. This game is incredible and at its price point, it's a crime not to already own it; don't get me started on what I think if you're still wondering if you should buy it. I would recommend this to almost everyone but it's certainly not a casual game. If you do NOT like difficulty BUT possess patience then I STILL recommend this game to you.If you don't mind getting stuck and find joy in figuring things out and in continued success in a slightly uphill battle then this game is absolutely for you!If you think you're a boss at games and that difficulty is something you've no intentions of experiencing then prepare to meet it for the first time. This game can be tough but it's a good kind of tough.You know how a good medium rare steak is utterly delicious but requires you to be paitent and chew it a bit?Abe's Oddysee puts that steak to shame because it's got even more seasoning, flavor, and doesn't cost $12 dollars for just a few bites of gameplay.Add this to your library today - unless you're going to play New 'n' Tasty, which DOES include this original as well!If you need help getting this running correctly then check in the community section or do some googling. You just need to a download a config file, open in notepad, make some changes to it and you're on your way! It took me about three minutes. 10/10 from me and I RARELY hand one of those out!Also - I personally recommend a controller for most platformers and I'm the king of platformers.			"

												This game has a few bugs and odd design choices from being poorly ported.On controller, controls for 2 of the actions are linked together. run/speak2 and sneak/speak1.  Instead of listing those actions together, they're listed in separate locations.Navigating the menu is somewhat odd.  Pressing escape to go back is pretty normal, however once it reaches the main menu it actually selects the current menu option (i.e. load or options) instead of either doing nothing or exiting the game.for me the game crashes when closing, thereby forgetting any changed game settings.The cutscenes run at ~4 fps. Many people note that the game requires a modification of direct draw in order to fix the issue.gameplay wise the game has a checkpoint system that makes timing based sections rather annoying.  This is common in older games.  However, dying also results in a respawning animation that takes a few seconds which is a poor design choice.			"

												This game has led me to rethink my life and go vegetarian, 9/10But seriously, this is a hell of an adventure through trial after trial. Every new area is wrought with danger, excitement, and fun. Nothing is more satisfying than taking over a slig and raining hot high-velocity vengeance upon his fellow slavedriving guards. As you fight, sneak, and run through the word of Oddworld, saving your mudokon buddies from a life of labor, you will meet scrabs, sligs, slogs, and paramites who will either try to stop you, or simply try to eat you. Quick reflexes and a sharp wit will prolong your survival, but will you have enough of both to end the operations at Rupture Farms?Pros:2 endings that reflect your karma and compassion for fellow workerscontrols that react consistently It took me 18 hours to beat on my first playthrough. so the length is pretty goodneutral:Difficult, mostly trial and error if you arent quick to reactthe soundtrack is not the best, but it fits the atmosphere well enoughThere isn't much to the story, but it's enough to keep you going. Save the mudokons, shut down the plantCons:some of the mudokons are so well hidden, you will ask yourself ""HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO FIND THAT!?""Some save points require a good streak to reach the next one. frustrating if you die to the last obstacle.soundtrack: 8/ 10visuals 8.5/10gameplay 9.5/10Overall: 9/10 "

												Most people familiar with this game probably know it from one of the many demo discs for the original PlaystationI was one of them too, and the game blew me away back thenIt still does to this dayIt's one of the few games I have introduced to other people throughout the years and actually gotten positive reactions from my friends through the times. Because nearly everything in the game works, the story uses it's imagination, the gameplay is the best Prince of Persia-esque, and the puzzles are clever and can be very challengingIf I have to be honest, the game has not aged well over the years. It can be hard for a newcomer to play this game nowadays, because of stiff controls, unforgiving checkpoints and the tediousness of saving mudokons. But to me, it's still a thousand times more enjoyable than the remake New 'n' Tasty, not because of rose-tinted glasses, but because if you can really get past all those flaws, there's a gem not far under the surface. And if you really can't get past all those flaws, Exoddus is basically flawless and perfect. I prefer Oddysee tho. Probably because of rose-tinted glasses.			"

												I played this on the PS1 when it came out.  First game I ever played.  All these years later and it's still as good as it was back then!  I nominated this game for the ""Test of Time"" award because out of all of the games I've played in my lifetime nothing stands as strong as this one.  Of course it's not without it's flaws.  There are several little glitches here and there, and the resolution can be a problem on PC.  It's an experience better had on the PS1.  But still, I highly recommend it.  It's worth every penny!Exoddus' gameplay is better overall, but that's because it builds off of the foundations of Oddysee.  Just thought I'd mention that.  They're both great!			"

												Abe's Oddysee was my favourite game on PS1 nearly sixteen years ago and today it's reminding me why I loved it. Great immersive storyline, questions of morality and what makes a God, and topped with an approach to a genuinely fantastic game without taking itself seriously.I paid less than £1 for some of the best and best value nostalgia I have ever enjoyed.Now, if you'll excuse me I must  massacre my former coworkers and fart at my boss before assassinating him...    :D  "

												I didn't play this game as a kid, so there's no nostalgia factor in my view.This was a big surprise for me, since I always thought this was kind of a simple old game, but recently I decided to give it a try, and I was really amazed. The controls were a bit difficult to get into at first, because of the weight of Abe and some delay on the jumps, but after getting used to it, I really enjoyed this. This game is still great after so many years since its release, and I can only recommend it to anyone who is mildly interested in this.			"
