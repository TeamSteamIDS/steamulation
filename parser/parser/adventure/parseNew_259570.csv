Early Access Review
								10/10 concept.....with some minor cautions.If you are into resource gathering/building games then this is definetly the game for you. It is beautifully designed, with game mechanics that are our of this world ;).  I very much enjoyed the first few times playing, however i have noticed as few things that i would caution you to either to consider prior to buying or prior to playing for the first time.first i have heard from people who have played the game that is it almost tediously easy. however i must have started playign after the patch because i found the game so grueling at night that every playthrough ends up exactly the same:Day1-collect eden, collect materials for building, then build a baseNight1- continue collecting maerials for building because NOTHING will attack you the first night (unless provoked)Day2- keep on collecting and building (dont forget to upgrade eden with spare material)Night2- Crap your pants as onslaughts of aliens attack from all sides; barely surviveDay3- cry a little as you see all the work put into harvesting and buiding was just destroyed in one night, but you continue to collect and build anyway.Night3- stock up ammo and energy because you will die. and if you dont, you will be left with a 80% destroyed base and will most certainly die on Night 4.So, although it is fun and exciting the first few playthroughs, eventually you will get discouraged because everything you do will all end on night 3 (possibly 4). And if you were wondering about more specifics of me trying to survive will no prevail: Ive tried mulpiple ""strategic"" base locations, (backed up againt a mountain/cliff, away from enemy hives,up high where they cant reach me) but they get you either way. not only do they seem to spawn in on my base at night, but it also seems that killing one of there hives (which should stop them from coming from said hive since its ...well...dead) doesnt not stop them from pouring in from that dead hive. I also tried to purely harvest and save resources from day 1 until day 4 then build a grand fortrace thinking i would be ahead of the game and they wouldnt be able to take out a large base with walls and blockades and six turrets and me ....but they did. they destroyed everything. and killed me.I know much of this sounds negative, but i truly do enjoy the game. it just has some quirks that make it hard to keep replaying for me personally. i really hope that the creators keep doing a great job and continue to progres with this game.One last thing....If you were wondering what i would want to be better or worked on, this is it:-more varied % for harvesting . ei. maybe a different type of tree that is  a higher percentage of the wood (protanium or whatever) and rocks that would all range in % not just 25 or 30%.-not easier aliens, just more timely placed or spaced out. The first night being alien free is sweet, however a barrage on night 2 and getting harder form there is kind of sudden. maybe ease into heavier waves or more aggressive aliens? it would deffinetly increase my play time and willingness to go to such lengths to build a solid base.-better turrets. i know this one is odd but i have run into a problem that i dont really like or trust turrets to do their one job, which is shoot at the enemy. Which i cant trust them because they dont seem to do much damage anyway and only half the time they even work; i feel like an alien needs to be directly in front of a turret and not moving to be able for the turret to do any real damage. in the end im just lapping my base killing everything i can while i hear the turrets turn on and off for no reason. can turrets just be on and on guard at night and off during the day? cuz that would be pretty cool.-a different ""start"" location at random. the map doesnt seem to change and i pretty much know where to go from the start so maybe making the pods land in different areas of the map would be cool.

Early Access Review
								Currently, Eden Star is a game with some incredibly amusing concepts, great visuals and suprising amounts of polish considering its an Early Access tittle still being in early alpha. Currently, the main aspect of the game is building and protecting a base in a tower defense esque setting. Starting out, you will spawn in a pretty small world of floating isles, having the ability to collect resources trying to set up a small base before the first night. You do so using a system reminiscent of Rust or Ark: Survival Evolved which is quite well implemented in this game. You will be able to roam the world using the suprisingly competent parkour movement, avoiding being mauled by enemies roaming the world. On your travels you will be able to harvest resources that can be used to build up your base and craft new gear for your character. Af it stands, the content that is there is fairly solid and is quite well implemented with some nice modeling and animations on your enemies, very simple to understand buildign and material mechanics and simplified crafting systems making the mechanic a fun method of progressing rather than a tedious bore. This is however where the good things about the game end as the amount of content currently avaiable is rather slim. Yes, there is a fairly nice variety of resources and structures you can build to defend your self from the incoming enemies, however you will find that the enemy variety it self is limited to a few monsters. The amount of things to do simply seems too small for the amount of time the game expects you to spend preparing for enemy attacks. Yes you can build up your defences, however I found that the amount of enemies that attack you at night is not big enough to pose a threat and while it might increase slowly over time, I found that its too slow allowing you to greatly outmatch the upcoming waves removing challenge from the equation. To summarise, while the amount of content is fairly small, the quality of the content that is there is mostly outstanding. This game has a lot of potential, with the quality of the content thats there, I am having no doubpts about this game becoming something great. If you don't mind the lack of features, I'd say give it a go and see if you enjoy it your self.			"

Early Access Review
								Notice: Played a lot more before Steam release.I checked out Eden Star way back when it was a tech demo, it had its ups and downs, and seeing it still alive and kicking is always awesome. It was using the Unreal Engine 3, and now they're using the Unreal Engine 4, but did it change much in terms of how it plays out? only a tiny bit.This is their very first release of the game to the public (aside from that tech demo), which is really early, where you go and build an 'Eden' which protects you from the night damaging atmosphere, and it's also your main point of where you can construct structures, weapons, tools, and powers. And you have to protect it from the creatures it lures in the night, by constructing defenses (walls), turrets to shoot them, guns for you to shoot them, and new powers to destroy them, OR use your telekinetic melee powers to hold them, and then smash them in the direction of you choosing, to the closest hard object that will deal massive damage.That's the game at the moment, gather resources, build stuff, protect and attack, but how good is it? well to me, it has the good looks, although a higher field of vision would help in making the world feel bigger, it's relatively easy to get into and have a good game going with how simple you get the resources, and then craft the structures you want, but all that is low in performance to what I think the game does extremely well, and that is its melee combat system with how amazing awesome it plays out, and that's what lured me to the game in the first place.The developers really have a great thing going on Eden Star with its satisfying melee combat system, keep on improving it, making it more awesome with a lot of more fun way to go on wrecking havoc on enemies with it, and honestly without that combat system, the game would be another survival horde mode type of game, so keep on improving and adding on on that combat system devs!But at the current moment of the game, is it worth playing it? it depends. If you think it looks cool and really want to try it out, sure go ahead, but how I see it, the game will be at its finest when it's out, or near release out of development, with a good story and progression to go along with it. I see this as a structured sand'boxed' experience, with a path drawn for you to walk in, but that path is really wide for you to move around comfortably. So again, if you want to check it out, go ahead, but if you want the experience that the developers (I would presume) want you to play through, then I'd advise of waiting for the release.

Early Access Review
								This game is a mix between first-person shooter, tower-defense, and sandbox-survival. This game is Minecaft with a Sanctum twist.The game is as visually pleasing as it is fluid in movement. You have the parkour abilities necessary to climb almost anything, which makes the game a whole lot more interesting. You can wall-run and shoot down aliens that are attacking you and your base. The game is also very physics oriented which means destroying something from the base topples the entire structure.So far I have only seen 3 aliens, but there might be more, since the game seems to be infinitely-generated. There are 2 weapons for the player to use, a pistol (which you start with) and an assault rifle. As for defending your 'Eden Kit' (which is your life-support), you can craft 4 (or 5, I can't remember) defensive structures. The game also has basic parts for making a base. On that note, building in this game works very well, I was able to adjust the orientation of everything I placed to whatever I needed.From what I have read on the forums' this dev-team only releases updates when they are certain it is as far developed as possible, which makes for a far better play experience compared to indie titles that release buggier updates and simply fix them over time.All-in-all this is an incredible title, all it is missing (in my opinion) is a multiplayer, which would make this one of my top 10 favorite games. I definitely recommend buying, and playing, this game!			"

Early Access Review
								An excellent Pre-Alpha Early Access game. It's fast paced with a 15 minute ""Day"" cycle to use for exploration, material gathering, indiginious pacification and building your Eden Complex, and a 3 minute ""Night"" cycle where your Eden Complex becomes key, defend it, repair it or hide in it. There is much to learn, much to discover and much to upgrade to survive. Despite having an excellent guide and ingame tutorial, be prepared to have several short unsuccessful games at first while you experiment and find out what works and what does not, because what may seem like a simple plan that obviously should work may not! Developers are very active and in touch with the community and seem to try to reply to any bugs or issues reported on the Steam Discussions and/or by e-mail.Keep in mind this game is still in early developement so it will not be performance optomized, may be prone to crashing on some systems and subject to balance shifts both good and bad.

								I really want this game to succeed because it deserves to. In our time when steam market is overblown with early access buggy and glitchy games comes the devs like Flix who treat their game well, implementing new features slowly but right, with no bugs or glitches. Everything that is in the game right now works properly and while it is true that at the moment there is no heaps of content (cus Early Access of course) it is still a joy to play even in current state.  This game for me ,in a nutshell, is something i wanted to see from StarForge, but SF turned out to be a scam (fortunately i got my refund). I think the problem with not many people buying Eden Star is lack of advertisement i guess, because i never heard about the game till this day, and i found out about it accidentally through steam recommendations.I wish Flix best of luck with finishing the game.BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT THE DEVS!!!

Early Access Review
								After playing quite a bit let's start with the negative points:- saving errors and related issues are unfortunately quite common, which makes it frustrating. especially when you did not save for a while and all your progress and work is lost.- the ""audio-atmosphere"" is still not quite there. the sound effects are well made, but a background-music does not yet exist. it seems to be under development though- the base is not much more than blocks and bricks yet. I do not quite get why I am defending a place which is as close to a home as a rock- very few craftable weapons and no craftable armor yetAnd the positive points:+ well made animations and graphics+ innovative fighting concept+ gameplay increases in difficulty after some time, which gives the player more of a challenge+ a well made mixture of fps, strategy and building simulatorAnd most of all:+++ the developpers!!! These guys are awesome and are really taking care of the community. I have not yet seen someone who would do this much for the average player and his problems and suggestions. Here, the contribution of the fans of this game is clearly rewarded!All in all: 8/10It still needs work, but it is an early access, so there is a real chance that this game will get to be as great as the developpers want it to be.

Early Access Review
								At the time of writing, In its current state. I would not recommend this game, which was not an easy decision despite my comments below.The premise of the game is:Mine minerals and construct a base on an alien world and build defences to fend of waves of enemies at night. Though when I say that, I by no means am condemning the game on its premise. There are some fantastic games in the genre, but also an awful lot of rubber-stamp garbage. At this point, I feel games that are attempting the Open World Survival genre, really need a new and captivating twist to keep players interested or invested, which this game just doesn’t have in its current state. However the developers list the game as ""Action, Adventure"" so perhaps the game is to be taken in a different direction? There is something about the game that seems deeply appealing, but currently, it’s buried under a lot of less appealing mechanics. The objective, at the time of writing, seems to be to upgrade your base core and see how long you can survive, which is what I was trying to do.Without further ado, the problems:The difficulty needs significant balancing. It’s chronically unforgiving to new players. After having difficulty, the first time playing, I rushed to build a base with 5 turrets and it was still taken out by night 5 by multiple waves of 10-20 flying enemies. There’s no time to relax and it’s horribly frustrating.Some people say mining is fast, some say it’s slow. My feeling is that you have to do such an overwhelming amount of it, it gradually feels slower the more you play because you’re sick of the grind. It feels very “No Mans Sky” in the way that mining is done. At the start of the game you can actually increase the mining speed, which is a good option to have for those that dislike the grind.  Apparently, there’s lots to explore. The map seems large initially, but even after a few hours of play relatively empty. There is not enough variety in map at present. Some areas look wonderfully pretty however. I did not play long enough to fully explore areas that looked potentially interesting in the far-flung corners of the map. Enemies are often seemingly spawned out of nowhere, often in large quantities suddenly and without warning and very close to the player’s location. In one situation, I looked away from my base for a brief moment, upon looking back there was a giant passive creature stuck inside it. I lost all my stuff after 2 hours of play to an enemy base, thinking it was friendly because of the blue shield/beacon (Enemy nests project a red beacon) I couldn’t retrieve my stuff because the turrets would kill me on approach. I figured I could trick the enemies into taking out the enemy base by sitting near it at night, but it turns out waves of enemies only attack your own base.The game explains nothing to you, except how to build, and how to repair. Everything else you have to figure out on your own, if you manage to survive the tutorial. Some people may like this, but unless the difficulty curve is tweaked, its only going to frustrate more people. All that said, this game has some serious potential. What it needs is decent base and player progression, something bright and shiny to aim for with a gradual difficulty curve.Currently the meat of this game is missing, it feels wrong to call it bare-bones, because there is a lot there, but it lacks depth. Which is why I had to have a serious think about recommending this or not. The game is very pretty and it plays very smoothly, but it doesn’t get off the hook because it’s early access. Early access does however, make me overlook the bugs and graphical glitches I came across. My recommendation is to save your money and watch its development with bated breath. The developers are along the right path, and if things continue as they are, the game will become something truly worth playing. "

								EDIT: V0.0.2.- Save feature added! I can finally care about building a base properly and defending it from the mites.- Inventory changes: Ammo stacks more so you can still haul a decent amount of materials AND ammo for your destruction needs.v0.0.1. reviewTake into consideration that this game is REALLY REALLY not finished. If you are looking for a game that has alot of content and options to build alot of stuff. Don't buy it yet.Eden star looks very promising, I'm having a blast blowing up rocks and trees with my hand and destroying nature with my human destruction powers.Pro's:- Looks amazing- Fun to mine, collect, materials because of the destruction you create. I toppled a mountain of iron, jumped on it and made a cave in it so I could hide from the nasty alienses!- Crafting is limited so far but pretty simple to create a cool base- Map is huge already but I hope it gets bigger- No hours of crafting to actually get something (weapons or turrets) (Got a gun after 20mins, with 2 turrets on my base)- Devs seem responsive here on the forums to help out if you have a problem.Cons:- No way to repair damaged walls/blocks, and no way to destroy them yourself. So if your walls are broken you can't repair them until an alien blows them up.- Inventory a bit to small to carry materials, building structures, 2 guns with ammo for them.- Missing some immersion (like a cutscene or some story)			"

								Ive had this game for a while and have seen it develop and upgrade. Its a pretty awesome game with great developers working hard to do their best for the future of Eden Star. I noticed this game doesnt have as much reviews as it should, meaning there possibly arent as many people buying the game so i thought i would just post a review in hopes that it might do something i guess, because this game deserves to be recognised. Im just going to list a few pros and cons of this gamePros:+AMAZING graphics+The MATA-tool is a unique thing about this game. It allows you to harvest resources and damage enemies in a unique superior feeling way+Defense/base building element (Build a base and protect your eden kit, which provides a shield around a certain area to protect you from the toxic atmosphere at night time)+A lot of upgradeable objects in the game including the MATA-tool+Dedicated developers working hard to add more content to the game+Multiplayer/Co-op support+ExplorationOk now for the Cons:-The last time I played this game there wasnt much to do. You simply just mined resources, built a base and had to defend it, but that has changed a lot since then. Theres more to do, more enemies and such and more to explore.-You may need a fairly powerful computer to run this game. Ive seen a few reviews where people want a refund due to not being able to run the game. But what do you expect from a game with amazing looking graphicsWith the computer running this game problem, it still is in early access. The developers still have optimisations to do that will improve the overall performance of this game :) also theres probably a lot more positives for this game, but none come to mind at this moment. Buy the game and try it for your self :D if you dont like it just get a refund, but if you like it so far, stay along for the long haul through the many updates the developers have planned for this game!As for those sitting on the fence of whether or not to buy this game, if enough people are interested i could make a quick pros and cons video on my YouTube channel of this game. or some kind of gameplay video. Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this review :D Enjoy the game if you decide to buy it.			"

								At this point in time the game is really there to make you feel like a badass.. attacking hives, using your power glove and your star wars force style ability to slam aliens into the ground only to bash their tiny heads with a baton or electric blade when upgraded. Dont want to do that? Build bases or even better. Make guns! Sniper, AR, Smg and pistols are currently in and if they're are not for you then you can upgrade your glove to fire a laser! Or just be a laser minigun. Still doesnt appeal to you? How about free-running? There are many trees and cliffs for you to climb and wallrun across. If you're still not interested how about stealth. Head to the metal swamp and hide in bushes and caves while giants stroll past.. and if you're still not interested, how about doing all of it with friends or get a bunch of people together and turn it into a generic online fps. There's a lot that you can do in this game and there is a story that is suppose to be coming soon. And if you have made it this far into this review, come see me on twitter or send me a steam friend request and we can hop on together and stream or something. We can build a fps shooter or have races. It's time to suit up and head for Eden Star!			"

								  A great game in the making. I bought it thinking it would be like Sanctum 2, and being a huge fan of that  type of game, grabbed this one. I was wrong, but it isn't a bad thing. The graphics are great, and the pressure to keep moving, killing, harvesting and upgrading is always on. At first the difficulty is insane. But once you learn the map a little, and figure out proper base placement and enemy capabilities, you gain a huge advantage. It's already fun as it is, albeit somewhat bare-bones, and a little buggy, but the developers seem to be dedicated to making it better. Looking at their Trello board only makes me more excited, seeing the new enemies, biomes and equipment that's upcoming.  If you're undecided, there's plenty of videos up on youtube about this game, and check the aforementioned Trello board, and bookmark it.   In short, If the devs keep this up, this one is definitely going to be a major contender.			"

								The game is really great at the current stage, although there still some features missing, like storages and more things you can do after you've built up your base. To keep it short, here's a Pros/Cons list.Pros- Great physics- The graphics of the game are overall breathtaking.- A huge Map with a lot of biomes and a bigger one is in developement.- The harvesting / destruction of the resources is really great and a lot of fun.- Nice crafting and upgrading system, which is still a work in progress.- Materials are respawning near their last location if you've harversted them.- The game is challenging and you can die very easilly, if you're not carefull.- The devs are very active and they show their progress on Trello.Cons- Quite hard start- The turrets have no range indicator.- Not enough different weapons or turrets.- Lack of late game objectives and challenges.In conclusion the game is really great, especially for it's current stage, even though there's still a lot to do, like objectives (or generally late game elements), more content in the world and some other small stuff that would make the game even greater. But everything i've mentioned is already in the works and a lot more too. For 20$ in it's current stage is quite reasonable. I would recommend it at it's current stage, as it only gets better.			"

								Below you'll find a video and written impression on the game


YouTube™ Video: Eden Star: Early Impressions (Indie game survival crafting gameplay and review) 

			Views: 18,846		

			Eden Star: Early Impressions Eden Star video created on version: 0.0.1.9005 Eden Star is advertised as a survival space crafting game.		

Eden Star is a high fidelity crafting survival game with a sci-fi spin. You'll be tossed into an alien planet, gathering resources to craft defenses for your base, as during the night you could potentially get swamped by waves of enemies. Besides the danger of facing hoards of mobs, you'll also be exposed to toxic air, as the atmosphere of the planet turns toxic when the sun sets.Though the game states that it's a survival game, from my experience I feel that it's not a ""true"" survival game. There's no hunger, or thirst meter, and you don't go around the map collecting scattered objects. Every thing you need is all crafted. I would compare Eden Star to Minecraft much more than DayZ. I think when the devs mentioned survival they were referring to the base defense aspect, and perhaps the toxic air during the nights. The flow of the game is this: During the day you'll explore the map, gathering as much materials as possible, and when night falls you'll be under the protection of your base from the toxic air, while crafting defensive items, such as walls, weapons, and sentries to help you defend, that's if you're lucky to get a night where you're not hounded by waves of enemies. If that is the case, you'll probably be spending the night fending off mobs and making repairs.In it's current state, Eden Star is very playable, with enough features and functions for the player to explore, and it's also quite stable with out any crashes and a mostly consistent frame rate. But, being in early access, at the point of this impression the game does lack an ""end game"". Once you have every thing you need crafted with a well fortified base, there's not really much more to do. Couple this with the game's lack of save function, the player may lose interest much sooner than the game intends.The game looks good overall, using the unreal4 engine and does a good job at conveying the alien landscape. I don't have much complaints about the games visuals, though a more robust options with better graphic settings would be welcomed.Overall, Eden Star looks like it has a lot of potential with an interesting premise for a crafting game. I would love to see the game live up to it's ""survival"" description a little more, but here's hoping in future patches, we'll see more of that aspect come to light. It's an intriguing entry into the genre, and at the very least, worth keeping an eye on.

								Great idea and starting to get implemented BUT F&%^$%$g HARD to play!Its frustrating that you can barely last a night because enemies are super strong and too numerous.  Spoils the game to start and make near impossible to survive.The biggest complaint is there is NO tutrial, help, or any idea on what your meant to be doing, and the building menu system, though interesting, is awkward to use and get your head around.Graphics and control are more than adequate and although not perfect, make the game more than playable and useable. (Except for the enemy and building system as mentioned.)The floating world is novel but I personally would love to see a solid world and more to explore etc. Dying because you ran off an edge to oblivian sort of loses it!I still recommend the game as it has too much potential to dismiss and unfortunately you can't give a mediocre score.I really really really hope the developers get it together and make this game show the true potential it has.IMO what this game requires sooner than later: Less aggressive enemies at the start.  let them build up.Re do the building system so you have some idea on what your actually building.  Building the same♥♥♥♥♥♥with different materials is good, but you basically have zero idea on what is the better, stronger etc...Give some better idea on the upgrade system.  IE explaing the crazy sci fi terms so the people can understand.Give a tutorial section, for example at the beginning, so players can get their head around the complex building, upgrade and maintenance cyle.Offer a repair option for structures.  There MAY already be some way of repairing and rebuilding the structures that get ruined so easily by the enemy, but I've yet to find it?!Lastly, although this may seem negative, I believe this game has huge potential, and hopefully will improve as development continues.  It looks good, plays well in regards to FPS and graphics etc.  And is fun to play, until nightfall when every super powerful indestructable alien comes out and wrecks everythin within minutes...Do I recommend ?  Yes but not for all at this stage...			"

								Updated Info: v0.0.4 New Enemy and Gameplay elements add further depth to the current game systems.  IKA enemy adds new challenge in the form of ground to air combat.   Expanded RMD allows you to invest more into your pioneer.  Upgrades like damage, accuracy and mining enhancements.  Increased Daylight allowing your pioneer to prepare for the nightly onslaught.  Ability to restore your base from said onslaught, available in AOE flavor.  Many new features and bug fixes, that add to the already excellent gameplay that is Eden Star. This update adds to the $20 value substantially!-----In it's current state, Eden Star is completely playable.  Their use of the UE4 here is amazing.  PhysX partnered with eyecandy particle effects and an excellent implementation on destruciton.  That alone is what makes the game worth it.  Now add in basic building and crafting, that will be further expanded in time.  Tower defense system makes you care for your base.  Two enemy types to eradicate from the planet.  The joys to be had in throwing bugs around are satisfying.  The environment is beautiful and fun to play in. There are some negatives at the moment.  Enemy and AI bug out, insane amounts and improper pathing.  Upgrading EKs are too easy.  Crashing if your unlucky.  FPS drops whilst mining trees, tons of bugs on screen. Now Flix interactive!  They seem to be transparent.  Communication with the community.  Trello board with plenty of information.  Seem trustworthy so far!I've been burnt, most recent was TSL sigh.  I have my doubts about EA just as everyone else.  So far color me impressed.  30 hours logged, will spend more.  $20 seems right for what your currently getting. UE4 is now free maybe Flix will allow us to mod.Edited and Updated for v0.0.4Review of v0.0.4			"

								This game is the perfect example of what an ""early access"" game should be. It executes its core gameplay perfectly, and simply adds to depth, content and polish as it evolves. As it stands now, the motivation stands mostly with base building and resource accumulation to defend yourself from hostile creatures. While that might seem a bit shallow, that process is so much fun, you'll find yourself dozens of hours in before you realize you haven't even tried to explore. There is a constantly evolving crafting aspect that only grows with each update as well. Eden Star is highly recommended.			"

								Absolutely amazing and breath takeing game. I found it by mistake, and Im very happy bout it. in the game you play as pionieer sent to other planet to colonise it or something ( you know, basic♥♥♥♥♥♥). But plot is not what its about. The gratest advantage of this game is its beauty. It runs on Unreal engine 4, and has TONS and TONS of particle effects. Second advantage is that it gives SO MUCH PURE FREAKIN FUN, just building all this♥♥♥♥♥♥ like turrets, energy fences and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that gives so much satisfaction. For a pre-alpha it has unbeliveable amount of content, and the fact that everything that is there will be expanded at least twice as much just made me fall in love with it. Of course it lacks in number of monsters and passive fauna, but its just pre alpha. I highly suggest buying it, best spent 20 EURO in my life.			"

								Another Survival game? yes... but it IS different, It has a faster pace, day and night cycles actually has a meaning, breaking the routine and forcing you to engage in some action.   Graphics and particles are great considering its current stage in development. The only negative point would be that that it lacks some content, but then again it is Pre-Alpha so it is understandable, and im sure more and more content will be added. If the devs maintain the current tragectory, we will have a fantastic Sci-FI survival game on our hands here.Should you buy it?  If your going to be impatient and pedantic?                      Then No                                 If you enjoy a game that delivers new aspects                                 to a very competitive genre of games, all whilst                                  you witness its development and increase in weight?

								Remember, this game is pre Alpha. So you are going to run into the occasinal bug, crash, or failed save attempt. That being said, it happens way less often than other alphas I have played.At it's price point, the game offers some great content. Awesome graphics, fun resource and crafting mechanics, and it controls like a pretty good shooter.But the best part about this game is its growth potential, and if you read through even a couple of the developer updates; you can tell this game is going to grow and grow and grow.Top marks for Eden Star			"

								Eden Star is another open world, survival and crafting game available in early access on Steam. But what separates it from the all the rest that are vying for your hard-earned money are some nice twists, a unique combat system, and a futurisitc sci-fi setting. (okay, GRAV has that last one but BitMonster,Inc really dropped the ball with their futuristic survival game)It’s worth noting at this point that Eden Star is in a very early alpha state and that there is a LOT of content that needs to be added. At the moment I’d say that there’s about 2-4 hours worth of gameplay (depending how much you like base building). But even in its current state it's good fun, it has a solid gameplay foundation, and has a vast amount of potential. Moreover, the devs seem genuinely passionate about their creation, are continually keeping us updated with their plans and their progress, and are very good at replying to comments in the forums. So, Eden Star has a unique combat system that involves grabbing enemies with your telekinetic device and then throwing them in a chosen direction. This brings no end of fun, as you can launch them soaring up high into the air only to have them plummet and splat back onto the ground several moments later (okay, the devs haven’t added a nice squishy “splat” yet). After grabbing you can also quickly turn around and cast individual aliens off a cliff and watch them disappear down into the misty abyss below, or (and my personal favourite) you can grab one alien bug and use it to smash another one in a truly delightful process that hasn’t ceased to amuse me.In addition to the grab and smash approach, your equipment has an energy blast weapon that does exactly what it says to the alien creatures. This can be upgraded through unlocks to increase the power and duration of the blast so that it becomes a concentrated beam of searing energy. Thus adding another unique feature to this genre.The final part of (the current) combat are the more traditional weapons (currently just a pistol and an assault rifle), which help to complete the FPS aspect of the game. (There’s a rather nice looking sniper rifle on the Eden Star drawing board, and there are plans for grenades too)Harvesting resources is an essential part of the survival genre, and here Eden Star provides another variation on the theme. Instead of hacking away at rocks and trees with hammers and axes you use your energy harness tool to disintegrate and extract materials from their surroundings. Large rock formations slowly fall to pieces as the “tractor beam” wrenches them out of place and into your inventory.It’s actually quite satisfying to watch a tree crumble under gravity and disintegrate in front of you as you harvest the materials and energy from it with your high-tech resource gathering tool. What makes this even greater is that you can upgrade this, as well, to make harvesting faster and also to allow you to perform it from a greater distance from the target material. I really do love the unlockable and upgradeable features they’ve included so far.An interesting twist to the genre appears upon nightfall. Whereas Savage Lands brings a terribly bitter cold that forces you to seek shelter and huddle around a campfire to which you cling for dear life, and The Forest plunges you into true pitch black conditions in a hostile woodland, Eden Star brings something new to the table. As well as an increase in enemy activity (this is when you’ll be doing the most of your tower defence of your base) night time brings a potentially lethal exposure to radiation that compels you to withdraw and find refuge under the protective umbrella of your base’s energy shield. Keep an eye on the planet’s local time because you will need to get back to safety before you become fatally irradiated and/or before the hostile indigenous life rips your base to shreds.Very briefly, the base building is excellent so far and seems to be a futuristic version of Rust. Eden Star allows you to build floors, walls, and ceilings separately so that you can construct your base exactly how you want it. No prefabricated rooms or buildings that constrict your creative freedom here!Obviously, because this is still very early access I will be updating this review in the future after the devs have released significant updates. But for the time being I’m giving Eden Star a definite thumbs up!Things I would like/need to see developed for the final game include:- More action. Many more hostile life forms that are more threatening, thus deepening the FPS and tower defence aspects of the game to develop it into a true survival experience. The world is a little tame at the moment.- More types of defence towers and the addition of traps to defend your base during the night time attacks.- More fauna. Hostile, neutral, and friendly to enhance the feeling of the environment and the immersive atmosphere.- More geological feature. E.g. caves, water systems, impassable cliffs, geothermal pits, volcanoes - again to improve the environment further and to provide some unique locations for exploration.- Some sort of story and quests (i.e. an end game scenario). E.g. destroy all enemy life to make the planet habitable for your race to colonise. Or survive long enough to build a shuttle to escape from the hostile world on which you’ve been stranded. These are just my ideas.*** 21st December 2015 Update ***- A new energy blade melee weapon (that's rather reminiscent of Star War's light sabres). This is really good fun to use, it sounds absolutely fantastic (although quite a few ingame sounds are still buggy), and it really adds to the futuristic setting of Eden Star.- Two new enemies, the best of which is a particularly agressive flying creature that will suicide bomb attack your eden kit if you're not careful. It'll also dive attack you as well, knocking you back quite a distance. This can easily push you outside the shield of your eden kit thereby exposing you to the lethal night time radiation, or even worse, can propel you off a cliff to instant death. Be careful how you fight them!- Multiplayer!!! Both coop and PvP!For more information on current progress and future plans, check out what the devs post on trello.com, and as always leave questions here and I'll get back to you.Happy surviving, and remember: if you do die, be sure to clean up the mess please.

Early Access Review
								This is an Early Access review of Eden Star. This review will contain what I've learned from my 15+hrs of playing the game.Eden Star is, currently, an Early Access game about a character who crashes on an alien planet and must find specific parts from an object called the Eden Kit. The tutorial gives you everything you need to know on how to play the game from start to finish. The game is created through the Unreal 4 Engine. The engine has great potential, and the developers have given the game rather nice texures for obvious reasons. You begin the game falling from the sky and landing in a pod of some kind. As the door shoots open you are greeted to the alien planet along with a fiery sky show of fallen ship parts. Your goal is to go and retrieve an Eden Kit to call your home. After building a base out of trees, rocks and other minerals you can gather, it should soon be night time. During this time you will want to stay near  your Eden Kit and inside of your bubble to keep your shield up and to stay safe from enemies that will come for your Eden Kit's power. Once your power is destroyed so is your respawn point. You are able to build guns, augments, upgrades, and eventually armor for your character to defend themselves with. You may also build defence weapons for your base like turrents and electrified fencing. Pros:+Great controles and rebinding capability+Ajustable resolutions+Great crafting system/UI+Amazing replayability+Perfect atmosphere+Multiplayer+Range of graphics options+Beautiful visuals/graphicsCons:+Can sometimes lag on max settings (980ti GPU)Bugs/Glitches:+Specific area of the map that allows your Eden Kit to never be attacked.Overall this game is a lot like Subnautica but, better in my opinion. It is a very fun game to waste time or let's play for a YouTube channel. If this game was played by a famous let's player it would get a lot of traffic.I give this game an 9/10! I've never been fond of Early Access games but, this game shows a lot of promise even in its current pre-alpha stage!			"

Early Access Review
Edited: This is one of the most helpful reviews on the page, so I cleaned it up a bit and added more stuff.Eden Star is one of those few early access titles that I've bought into. I generally stay away from them, apart from a few exceptions, and Eden Star is one of them. It caught my eye as a survival game with more of a base-building/tower defence focus, in which you gather resources and build your base and defences during the day, and defend it during the night. You start off with an Eden Kit and some resources, and you have until night to find a decent spot for your base. The base-building is quite versatile, and as long as you have the resources, you can create the base that you want to properly defend your Eden Kit. The Eden Kit is what protects you from this planet's toxic night air. If you go outside it's protective shield (which can be upgraded to increase it's radius) at night time, you start taking damage, and will eventually die. This makes defending it a top priority, and since the creatures that inhabit this world have taken a personal offence to your giant shield, defend it you must, as they will attack in swarms at night.This of course means combat, and it starts off as fairly standard, with a variety of guns and a melee weapon in case you run out of ammo. However, some upgrades to your MATA tool (essentially it's what allows you to harvest, build, etc), and you can basically become a jedi with an energy sword, and the ability to push and grab enemies and hurl them at whatever you want (this can also be chained, provided you don't hurl them outside grabbing range). Now, they may be cool to watch and everything, but they're just a gimmick right? Just shooting enemies is surely a lot easier? Well, in short, no. First off, the grab ability (the most useful and fun to watch) is tied in with your MATA tool's harvesting, so you don't have to bother switching to your gun. So depending on what you're pointing the reticle at, you can either harvest or kill. It's more of a convenience thing, but one I like. The second (and more important) benefit is that it saves on inventory space. Ammo for guns takes up inventory slots, so the more ammo you bring along for your trip, the less space you have to carry the resources you need.This means the non-gun options actually provide a tangible benefit to using them, since they don't require the ammo that guns do (although the push does require energy, but that is something completely separate and doesn't take up inventory space). And apart from all that, it's hilarious to grab an enemy, smash him into a rock, then fling him up into the sky.Right now, it is fairly light on content, and as you'd expect of an early access game, there are some bugs, glitches and crashes (although I personally haven't had a single crash), and I can always tell when a horde of enemies is about to attack my base at night, since the framerate dips fairly noticeably. However, I do have to say, the devs are doing a fantastic job with this game. They're passionate and dedicated, and I have no doubt they'll make this game the best they possibly can. They're incredibly transparent, regularly posting updates on what they're working on, and the vast majority of forum posts are answered by them personally. Ultimately, this is what convinced me to buy Eden Star, and if you like the concept and the direction of this game, you should too.			"

Early Access Review
								Eden star is an amazing game. It combines so many strange crazy ideas such as Minecraft, mirrors edge, mass effect and survival and somehow pulls it off but not just that it does it so well. The point of the game is that you are whoever you think your character is future Steve, Commander Shepard, a dog in a space suit, and you must survive as long as you can. Think Minecraft but with a survival mode during the night. During the night monsters will emerge and attempt to attack your base's heart the Eden Kit. The Eden Kit is important because it is responsible for three things. It allows you to respawn, it creates a shield that blocks out the radiation of the night which will eat away at your shield and it helps you regen health which as far as I can tell cannot be regenerated any other way. Also you die easy. The world is huge and it contains a gorgeous landscape that you could spend hours exploring and admiring. Even now though I have seen a lot of the environment it still makes me go wow as the colours and designs and contrasts are perfect. The render distance also helps as you can see so far and see so much. There are many puzzles comprised of jumps and plat forming however there is a free running mechanic. The free running mechanic is almost as good as mirrors edge the only problem is that the game doesn't run at 60 fps for me so it is a bit clunky but otherwise reminiscent of mirrors edge (which had one of the best free running system I have ever used that put assassins creed to shame). The crafting though simplistic is still detailed and very creative you have four different types of building shapes. Primitive which are simply cubes that can be crafted out of several materials, panels which is self-explanatory which can be made of many materials as well. Foundations which you use to create a flat area to build your base on and finally ramps which are ramps shocking I know.  The game also comes which a weapon system and upgrade system. So far there are few upgrades and only 2 weapons. A pistol and rifle. Yet the aiming feels precise and the weapons powerful while the upgrades feel effective. The respawn system is my favorite out of every game ever as it is good but so devilish. You use this material called tesliuim which is used also to increase the shield radius of your Eden Kit and it is used to respawn however it requires one but since there are no chest or other storage containers if you die you lose all your materials, blocks and ammo. So might as well be carrying 1 tesliuim but happily you keep all your weapons and upgrades. There is some much more to Eden Kit and there is some much is being added for example the developers have considered adding a multiplayer which sounds amazing.This game has so much potential it’s crazy especially because the concept is so strange. It is one of those ideas that if pulled off right will be just the best. Please check this game out at least go on YouTube and watch some gameplay because even if it never gets updated again it is worth the money. Have a great day and never stop gaming ever. Well unless you need a break. NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: Excuse me developers if/when you add multiplayer please make it private so friends can invite each other their games cause otherwise we will get what happens in mc grievers, trolls and other abominations of the gaming community, yet if it can be played amongst friends it will be just the greatest game ever made.

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game since before it was released on steam and followed it's development since it's initial release. Also, it's a little buggy in VR (not officially supported, but the Unreal Engine has built in VR support), but a fun experience!The biggest PRO of this game: The Devs.Yes development has been a lottle slow in comparison to some early access titles, but god damnit are they consistent. I don't think they've ever missed a single weekly update and they almost always have some new and interesting content in the works. The biggest CON: Early accessAs with any early access title, occaisonally there are bugs and gameplay is not as fleshed out as you would hope, However, the devs have done a great job of implementing and stablizing new content at a steady pace. Whenever I get tired of this game I know that I can set it down for 6 months and there will be fresh new content when I come back.Final Thoughts:This is a game I would pick up if it seems appealing, as the studio has said the price will increase proportionally to how finished they feel the game is. It's a great deal for $15 as it will provide 5-10 hrs of solid gameplay in it's current state, and the dev's have proven to be consistent in updating their content. This is on my top-10 early access list.7/10 for now, likely to be 8 or 9 by the end of 2017.			"

								Eden Star is a fantastic game, and the direction it is being taken in is one I can whole-heartedly support. I've backed numerous Survival EA games, and this one by far is the best one I've backed so far.You're dropped in an escape pod onto an alien planet, where the nights become so toxic they can kill you. The aliens on the planet do not like your being there, and attack you. You have your MATA-Tool on your hand to gather materials and build, but that's the extent of what you have in the beginning.You get an Eden Kit, which provides power and a shield to keep you safe at night. The aliens do not like the Eden Kit, and will attack it, becoming more aggressive as time goes on. Collecting materials, you have to craft with them to build your base to keep you and your Eden Kit safe from hostilities. You can craft a multitude of different blocks, turrets with different attributes, and utilities like doors and generators.You can also use what you have gathered to upgrade your suit, make weapons (assault rifle, pistol, sniper rifle, submachine gun) and to craft ammo, of which you can make different types.There are three biomes, with more planned. They are hand-crafted and well detailed, with different advantages and disadvantages. The aliens you encounter will all be different, from little splintermites crawling around like pests to a bird that likes to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and steal the materials you're working on gathering.They recently introduced multiplayer, which is basic for now, but has a colony system to allow people to group together.The game runs on Unreal Engine 4, and the graphics are fantastic compared to other EA titles I've seen in the Survival genre. The developers also release consistent blog development updates about the game, what they are working on, what they are fixing, and each individual person working on the game gives a short snippet of what they are currently focused on.All in all it's a great game, great concept, great execution, all done by a great and vocal development team.Edit: I've played the game more than the few hours it says, not sure why it says that. I've put in probably around 20 at least.			"

								So, I saw this last year and thought: ""That looks amazing, it can't be that good"" Well, I ate my words, here are some thoughts I've had about the game and the (amazing) company.Pros:1) Extremely involved and attentive development team - Not only do they communicate with the players, they ARE players themselves, they play the game and share many of the same interests as the community. They're friendly, polite and I'd love to join them in game some time.2) Even in alpha this game has very few bugs that I have found, and the developers find bugs I never knew existed and fix them quickly. In addition to this they give patch notes that explain in english any gamer can understand without being overwhelming.3) A well-planned development map that so far they have followed. The developers give frequent updates on the status of their work and share teaser screenshots. The development map is updated often with ideas that players and devs alike want. They don't seem to hear a new idea and go ""Oh we can't do that, that would require work!""4) Graphically pleasing, this game is gorgeous and performs well on even my 3-year old GPU and 5-6 year old motherboard/processor.Cons: 1) Being alpha, this game does not have quite as much content as I would like. However, see my comment about the development map and keep in mind they update frequently.So, in closing, would I recommend this game? Yes, I would. If you are patient and interested, help the devs out and join the pre-alpha. You'll have content to last you for quite a while and they're constantly adding more. If you aren't into early access? That's alright too, keep up with the development map and don't forget Eden Star: this game is going to be even more amazing than it is now. Cheers to the devs and anyone who made it this far-Pup			"

Early Access Review
								To say that there are a fair number of ""crafting survival"" games these days would be a dramatic understatement. It seems like nary a week goes by without a handful more hitting Steam, let alone other platforms. And yet, Eden Star is proof positive that there is still a lot of room for different, novel ideas to take root in a genre becoming increasingly crowded.It's highly likely that you've played this kind of game a thousand times before now. Start with nothing. Forage stuff. Build stuff. Survive the night. Forage better stuff. Survive the increasingly difficult nights. And so on. The basic gameplay loop hasn't fundamentally changed from what Minecraft established years ago.Where Eden Star differentiates itself is two fold: one, its sci fi skin actually proves to be pretty compelling, as both the bases, defences, and weaponry you have at your disposal genuinely feel rewarding. There's inklings of Mass Effect and Deus Ex here in everything from the weapon design to the way the ""magic"" feels. The core gameplay here is rock solid.More importantly, though, Eden Star differentiates itself by way of its developers. Early access games are hard to get right, and Eden Star is helmed by a crew who is deadset on staying active in the community. The Trello Board is updated frequently, and the communicativeness of their planning and execution makes this one Early Access title you shouldn't be afraid of. Plus, having just patched in an entire multiplayer mode right before the holidays, it's clear the crew is dedicated to their game.Ultimately, though, both of these differentiating factors wouldn't matter if the game wasn't fun to play, and it is. More content will only help Eden Star become an even better, more widely adopted and successful game than it already is. Here's to that future success.			"

Early Access Review
								I truely like the concept of this game even though it's at an early state.Sure there isn't much to do atm except collect, build and kill enemies.This game runs very well for being an alpha.It has a small map right now at 1,5km but there is going to be a mapat the size of 16km, cannot wait.Day/Night cycleThere is a day and night cycle in this game, day time last 15 minutes where it's safe to collect materials etc. Night last 5 minutes and right now not that fatal depends how you play, there is some kind of ""gas"" at night were you take damage from, but right now it just deplete your shield. Other than that, enemies/npc becomes hostile and will going to attack you/your base. Otherwise they will only attack if you are near their hive at day time.Build menuIt's functional, but could be better.Like that you can build walls, turrets, etc with other material to change the health of the building.CombatCombat...I cannot be to harsh on this, mainly because it's an alpha and you cannot except to much in this state.So let's say this, the combat is fine but could do some work.There will be new type of enemies as time goes by.UpgradesThis one is quite unique, like I said that you could change the hp depending on the material you were using on that wall, turret, etc. You can also upgrade your kinectic abilities, walls to become fortified and what I saw on dev post there will become armor upgrades. (see the link below for more information).WeaponsYou start out with 2 sort of kinectic abilities, one were you do splash damage and the other were you can lift enemies up and throw them away. Then you have atm 4 weapons, assault rifle, pistol, sniper and smg.For more information about their development click here[trello.com]I highly recommend this game, because of its conecpt and potential of becoming a great game. If you are uncertain, add it atleast to wishlist/follow.Hopefully this will help some to make a decision, first time doing a review so I hope I did not miss any crucial points.			"

								I really really want to play this game but I keep crashing on startup. I can't reccomend a game I can't play.Edit: The developers of this game are spectacular.Their quick responses to negative reviews involving bugs are great and helped many people solve their problems with bugs. Although my game isn't fixed yet I won't let this review drag this game down.Edit 2: Due to the recent update IT WORKS! I've been waiting to play this game for so long :D Thanks devs!			"

								""Eden Star :: Destroy - Build - Protect"" Review:Pros:1. Very good looking game for a pre-alpha2. Simple easy to understand3. Objectives (even tho there currently is very few)4. Very little bugs for a pre-alphaCons:1. Lack of content2. Very small map3. Only two types of enemies4. Very few building options Summary:""Eden Star :: Destroy - Build - Protect"" is still in Pre-Alpha build but from my time playing I realized it is a fantastic game (even tho there is a lack in content but hey its in Pre-Alpha). This game has a ton of potential, hopefully there will be multiplayer in the future (but I doubt it). I would definitly recommend buying this game and at least trying it.			"

								This game is something special. It uses a common genre of game, survival, and puts its own unique spin to it where theres no pickaxe or hatchet to gather resources, but instead the environment can be absorbed. This means resources don't disappear or have a crumbling animation, but instead you take chunks out of the environment and this gives a very satisfying feeling to gathering. In addition to this the map is large with diverse enemies which come with their respective biomes. And to add the cherry to the cake the dev team are active and involve the community in shaping the game.Since this game is still early access that means that we can expect so much more, which means there really isn't a reason NOT to get this game, its visually appealing and its mechanics are solid. So in all this game is definitely worth getting.EDIT: After checking out the Trello board for the game, I'm sold! This dev team reminds me of the Subnautica one, active and ambitious and thats a great mix for any games development, theres so many new features on the way it just helps further boost the reason why this game needs backers!

								After playing 33.8 hours of gameplay in 7 days and I work 65 hours a week with 2 jobs and I have a 3 month old son, im gonna say if you don't pick this up while its $20, your gonna miss out, this game will increase in price at some point, the quality of the content that is released is outstanding, the kind of stuff you would expect from AAA developers. Now I can personally say there has been a 1.5 gig update and a 1.6 gig update within 7 days of each other (first day I bought it, and day before I wrote the review). These updates are not chincy to say the least, they make sure every single update the release is polished and out standing with no bugs and glitches to be seen, Developers of this game are EXTREMELY amazing, they not only listen to the players but they take your suggestion to the drawing board if it should be in the game. They are adding friendly drones soon that I feel is gonna be extremely needed because the enemies do a lot of damage right now. They did just re-do the entire ORE system with all new ores, I like the update but wish they would bring back the old made-up scy fi rocks they originally created for the game just to make the game feel like there is a lot of choices. All-In-All great game pick it up now so we can get into Multi-Player and start designing a huge base together!			"

								March 12, 2016 - Pre-AlphaTLDRPros+Beautiful Environment+Smooth, flexible character mobility+Simple gathering system+Build a base, defend at nightCons-Combat feels unsatisfying-Extremely limited base building options-No sense of progression (resources / monsters)VerdictWhile the simplicity of it all is satisfying at first, you'll soon wonder what on earth you'll do next to keep things interesting.Full ReviewAfter over a year in Early Access, I expected more.I played the game for an hour, built everything there was to build, and tasted a few nights of combat. Some people are giggly wiggly over the fact that you can grab the monsters from afar and toss them around; I feel that overall, combat just isn't satisfying. Your weapons feel like crap; when you hit something, it'd be nice to have some feedback / recoil / monster recoiling / Something! Even the meelee doesn't work so well; half the time, you will automatically target a dead monster instead of the live one right next to it. What irks me even more is that monsters have no loot, in a world full of things to be looted.Indeed, if combat isn't so great, this type of game often falls back on creativity via building stuff, and exploration. I found however, that I could build everything right away! The resources aren't hard to find, or challenging to get; there's no sense of progression. I can't venture to a more dangerous area to retrieve a rare material to build a cooler turret to defend against a stronger monster. I can't discover more advanced tools or machines for my base, to fill it up with; I can just build a bigger base to fill up with a maximum of 3 types of turrets - and there isn't even an explanation of what differentiates them from one another.I really wanted to love this game, and was excited to play it, but after an hour, all that's left to do is build more iron foundations and walls, more of the 1 model power generator, more eden kits, more of the same 3 turrets, and watch it all take down more monsters at night. Inevitably, I will fall off another cliff along the way, or die inexplicably outside my front door, and lose all my gathered materials again.Perhaps in another year the game will be more fleshed out and start to resemble a final product; for now, all that can be done is play around with the mechanics.

Early Access Review
								the game so far (v0.0.1.)- the tutorial consists of 10x3 meaningfull pictures with a short text, explaining the basics you need to get into the game.You can access them anytime via the menu or just read them as they pop up at specific key-moments while playing the game.- the game itself (atm) is single player only. You start with a little spawning sequence and get told to pick up your first core-node-thingy (sry, forgot the name). After you did so, you can just roam arround and explore the quite interesting, not too big, world and get an idea where to find which resources.Enemies aren't a big problem, as long as you don't get too close to their nests. As soon as you place your first core, nearby enemies will try to reach and destroy it. Sadly, i placed mine too far away from any nest, so they didn't really realize it and didn't try to attack. I belive they are much more agressive at night.There is no save/load right now and if you die, you wont respawn, instead the game restarts where it began. (at least it did so for me, while the tutorial says you will respawn at your core... idk, maybe my core got destroyed while i have been dead)- stuff.... i wont list it all in details, but there are many quite interesting things you can craft and build already. The interface is done very well. Nothing too complicated while still having a good depth of complexity.Sooooo, quite interesing and recommended! Hopefully it wont take too long until there is a save/load feature and some of the other stuff the devs are currently working on (you may have a look at the trello if you are interested)Extremly high potential! Lets see where this will end up =)			"

								Wow.   To say the least, playing this game in 0.0.2 has felt like playing a complete game. Do not let the slides fool you, this game is tough, mobs of NPCs swarm your camp despite your best efforts and WILL, no matter what, destroy your fortifications. The constructions you make, unlike popular voxel games such as CraftMine and Rattaria, have meaning, as the center holds a delicate object that, if damaged enough, could set you back to square one, looking for a way to survive longer. To put it simply, during the day resource gathering and Base layout are the prelude to night time, where the game really becomes an image I hope these developers can keep.			"

								That is an interesting concept.In this game you are playing a some sort of fusion between a open world sandbox game, where you gather materials and build your place aaand a tower defense game in a way. The goal is to build a decent base, place couple of defenses around it and in a daytime, you can wander around, gather materials, fight some alien beetles in your way, explore, build some more. But in the night, you should go home and defend. The insects are coming to ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up.So, it's a bit unusual idea, graphics are good and I haven't seen any bugs so far. Also, this game promises coop in some time, so you could play it with a friend of yours. The only downside that I see so far, is that the updates are a little bit slow, but it is understandable, as the it's a small team behind this project. So... To keep it short, it's a good game and it's well worth it's price. I do recommend it.8/10.			"

								I won't lie, this game isn't the best. It has only a single pregenerated map, limited enemies, craftable items with no use or with no way to get the resources for them, and a playerbase that is almost nonexistent. That being said there are worse things you could do with $20. Weapon costumization is relativly advanced, you feel threatened without worrying that you'll die every five minutes, and most importantly the devs are still working on it. It might be two years before we ever see something aproaching a full game but we will get that game.			"

								Unfortunately my super outdated hardware fails to run this fantastic game without dropping to 10-15 frames/sec, but I've still tried to play. Backing this game since it was on Kickstarter, I know this will grow to be an immersive game backed by a knowledgable and driven team.Pros:- Dedicated team backing the project to completion with timely but commendable updates.- Feedback and new features suggested by the community are heard and responded to- Beautiful assets and landscapes- A new, fresh kind of Sci-Fi feel- Come a long way from its roots without fraying the original concept style- Can throw enemies to the heavens or have them halt suddenly as they date a wall- Weapons are useful, but don't feel as if they need to be depended upon- Story and world building potential is significant and flowing in at a controlled and professional pace                      + Lots more but this is quickly becoming a wall of text.Cons:- No true objectives as of yet other than survive (namely just building all-around game content)- Lack of varied enemies- My hardware is entirely out of date, so I can't enjoy this game to its fullest extentIn conclusion, Eden Star is certainly shining as its team engineer, sand and polish this game from the inside out but has the problem every Early Access has - Bugs, unfinished content and constant updates. If you can grit your teeth and ride with it, you may find it sneaking its blue neon aura into your heart.This is definitely the time to get in and help on a true community game.			"

								Concept is great. Gameplay is fun so far but rather shallow. Gather, Build, Defend, Repeat. Needs more depth. That being said, it is pre-alpha. so long as the game continues to make progress there are great things in it's future. Make sure you save every night. The game does not save itself right now and a crash (which is entirely possible given it's Pre-alpha status) could end days of work. Summing it up, right now this is a tower defense game with some crafting\survival elements, but the sky is the limit with the concept and design. Keep it up devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game, but have a hard time recommending it in it's current state. It's the risk of early access, I suppose, but still.- The premise:You're an advanced colonial super ninja type engineer cyborg dude in some sweet♥♥♥♥♥futuristic battle garments. Your left arm has a powerful piston powered baton spear thing (that would make a mean plot device in some weird Japanese sex game, but I digress) and your right arm has some device that can eat trees and rocks. There's currently no story, but the context more or less lets you know that you crashed landed on a strange environment, from an espace pad. The environment is abundant and has alien fauna and flora. You use the right hand device to deconstruct and ""consume"" and store elements from those objects. Different objects offer different elements.Those elements can be used to construct an ""Eden Star"" which is some sort of colonization kit that is the heart of your base. Around this base, there's a wide array of componets to build with. Basic things like foundation blocks, walls, doors, panels, but also turrets, laser fences, etc. Building anything use a block-like system where you snap-and-click different componenets together. Here's why I like this game so much: it takes the free-roam, sandbox games and gives you a clear purpose: gather, build and DEFEND. I love sandbox games, but their achilles heel is that they tend to be pointless: you gather, build and... then what?Eden Star on the other hand, offers a very solid narrative in that there's a day-night cycle. During the day, local alien goons are fairly inactive and will only pursue you if you get too close to their hives (ie.: destructable spawn points). During the night, however, they get the alien munchies and somehow have a taste for your Eden Kit. In other words, in a true open-world fashion they will flock to your base in numbers and it's up to you to defend it. This causes you to explore, harvest and build during the day, so you can defend your base at night. At some points, you're really minding the clock so you can manage your time in harvesting, building and defending. You, the player, can craft weapons and items that can be equipped, or you can upgrade your gear. For example, the right hand tool that is used to deconstruct the local fauna and flora, can be upgraded to become a gravity type weapon: lock on to a baddy, grab it in a gravity type field and just launch it into space, smash it against and object or my favorite: fling it at another alien. It's oddly satisfying.The Eden Kit can also be upgraded with a better shield and offers a few neat little tricks itself.- Gameplay:It's pretty nice. The mechanics are easy to use, the harvesting, combat and building aspect felt solid and fluid to me. The harvesting is fairly balanced, in that it does NOT get grindy. You do not need to take down an entire forest worth of trees to build a single block. Inventory management is also easy and hassle-free. You can focus on building, crafting, exploring, adventuring and defending. Going through the different categories and building materials can be a tad confusing.Game offers a solid single player experience and has added a multiplayer aspect not too long ago. Multiplayer needs some work, griefing is there but it's just not that easy to run up to another player's base and not get torn to shreds. Thus far, the player community has been helpful and non intrusive. Sure, I've been chased around by some random dude who really wanted to fist me with his left-hand-piston-power-spear-baton♥♥♥♥♥♥♥contraption, but I've also set up bases with random strangers I encountered. - Graphics:Noting extraordinairy, but nothing poor either. Everything feels well executed. Performance is also agreeable, game loads fast. Level design is actually pretty cool. The setting is no planet, but a series of giant, floating rocks. The terrain is diverse. Monsters currently feel a bit silly and stiff. Nothing at all threatening, as you can just bolt out of there with your infinite stamina colonial cyborg ninja. Did I mention you look pretty sweet? You look pretty ♥♥♥♥ing sweet. - Sound:A bit lacking as of yet. Nothing that really garners your attention. Currently, there are no missing sound clips and I suppose the devs are focussing on the core game.- Stability:Alas, this is my biggest gripe with Eden Star: Single player crashes to desktop one too many times. Multiplayer offers dedicated servers that appear and disappear at the blink of an eyes. Especially frustrating if you chanced upon a helpful stranger and were setting up a base... only to be dc'ed and can no longer find the server. I hope the devs take their time to increase this. At the moment, I've stopped playing Eden Star, because there is no point in investing any time in a single or multiplay session, your work is lost all too easily. A damn shame, because I honestly, believe this game really deserves a lot more credit.- The devs:These guys are really going for it. If you follow their updates, you cannot dislike them. They're very enthusiastic and they seem to listen to their community. I haven't been all that involved myself, so I might be off. The only thing I do want to say, is that I like seeing information on updates - ACTUAL GAME UPDATES.Never thought I'd say this about an indie dev, but these guys overdeliver on information. They share updates on... updates. That are to be released weeks later. It's fun, guys and I dig the spirit, but maybe you should keep those posts on the forum or something. Anyway, I'll be checking in on those game more often.- The conclusion:Buy it, try it, support the devs, enjoy a refreshing take on open-world sandbox games that offer a DECENT narrative and a goal and if your fancy is tickled by tower defense games, this game is the perfect hybrid. Be wary about stability, though. Both single player and multiplayer are NOT crash free.  "

Early Access Review
								EDEN STAR is what you get when Rust/H1Z1/survival games have a beautiful baby with gems such as Lost Planet 2, Titanfall, and more.There are so many wonderful ideas. From base construction, crafting, to automated defenses and a meaningful day/night cycle. But it doesn't stop there. Wall running parkour, grappling/riding enemies, unique abilities, and they are working on automatons to help you fight entire wars against other player factions.The game is pre-alpha, but I would buy it again. The dev team posts updates practically weekly, and provide a level of transparency that is on par with or beyond even the famously open Star Citizen. They speak to us, and they have a personal relationship with the community. Unlike so many big corporations that follow strict PR guidelines, this is a group of people that know their audience, people who have soul, and most of all dedication: this is obviously a project of passion for everyone involved.That really does meaning something, because gamers as consumers really care about the brands they play. They do have a more personal relationship with the creators and company than other consumers do. A game isn't like flour: I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the flour or who supplies it, so long as it isn't wood pulp and it's reasonably priced. But games are something I may spend hundreds to thousands of hours on. They are something people care about and grow to love. That's why gamers are notoriously fickle: because they're passionate. They want to see a game be everything that it can be, and they see the company and developers as *partners* in that endeavor. But most game companies have not caught on to this, and still treat it like any other customer-business relationshipBut not Flix Interactive. They understand the nature of their relationship with us. To have a game company actually listening and communicating is a breath of fresh air. There is no silence to make you nervous, there are no worries about if you're being heard or what's going on. You know. And they don't just talk to you. They listen. They take player feedback. For instance, players wanted to build huge bases, even cities. This was never planned for or intended. Do you know what they did? They began optimizing the game for accomodate large structures as best as they could. The idea for drones and fighting robots arose from this, and it's why they're developing it; it all came back to the players wanting large settlements, and those settlements needed defenders.With all that said, the game is a pre-alpha. Performance is not exceptional, though over the last patch it has improved immensely in my opinion. The movement is janky at times, the UI is kinda buggy now and then, and it has its mechanical problems. But that's how it goes with a pre-alpha.But as a cynical consumer, skeptical and disillusioned with a distant game industry stuffed with the same recycled material, this is a game that stands apart. This surely sounds like a contradiction, as the market is being flooded with survival games. Is this a survival game? Yes, absolutely. But it is not confined by that genre: it builds on it with great ideas. This is a game I can love with a dev team I can believe in.If you are something of a gaming philanthrophist, then let me say now: if there was ever a game that deserved your money, it is this one. If for whatever reason, you don't want to spend money on it in its current state, that's fair. But be sure to check back every few months. I don't think you'll be disappointed.If you want to see the future plans, what is being worked on at present, and what has been added, take a look at the trello board here: https://trello.com/b/dmyocCtO/eden-star-public-boardPlayers can vote on what they'd like to see added next, provide feedback, and provide ideas. The devs are also active on steam, and have a subreddit which at the moment is practically just updates and patch notes.			"

								Eden star is one of the best survival games out there. It has the best dev team I have ever seen, they are very active in thier community and will answer any question you have. Keep in mind that this is still early access and that the devs are working hard to improve it. there is already lots to do in this game, from slaming hostile aliens into wall, trees. and rocks (this alone is reason enough to buy it), to building  a fortress full of rocket turrets to defend you in the night, to taking the fight to the aliens and destroying thier hives. This game is a very good investment if you like sci-fi survivals, and is more than worth it at only $20.			"

								Considering that this is pre-alpha, it looks pretty darn good.  It's got all of my favorite thigs: crafting, survival, building, aliens, and guns, all in one package. Can't wait to see what the game will be when it's finished.Currently, the player can scavenge for materials, craft a few guns, build some structures and defenses, run up walls, use telekinetic tools to throw helpless wildlife off a cliff or into a big rock, and kill the alien buggers, which are especially irritating at night. As expected, the game is missing quite a bit of material to help it feel deep and compelling for now, but it's still pretty fun. Beware of game pad controller issues. It's still playable with one, just messy.			"

Early Access Review
								The game has a ton of potential. I'm really looking forward to them adding more content and enemies. Adding multiplayer is nice and all but there's not much to do in singleplayer, let alone multiplayer. The build system/UI in this game is light years ahead of other survival games that I've played. It's really streamlined and non-invasive. Only issue, however, is that you can basically build everything right from the get go. Not much researching needs to be done. Just need to find the materials.The combat system, both with guns and the MATA Tool, is great. Looking forward to more weapons and enemies! They should add melee weapons that can be weilded at all times like the guns.The movement system is also great. I love the parkour aspects of it. Being able to climb up walls/run across walls makes the entire experience more enjoyable.The only issue is there's no content to keep you coming back. Surviving isn't that difficult. Set up a few turrets and the game basically plays itself. I'm recommending it because I want them to get more funding to keep the project going, but don't expect to spend hours upon hours playing the game just yet.			"

								TL;DR : Buy this if you're a fan of crafting/basebuilding games. It looks great - especially for early access - and the devs are polite and know what they want to do. I've enjoyed this game immensely and though it's frustrating at times, it's an excellent title for it's sale price, which at the moment is around $15.I wholeheartedly enjoy the heck out of this game, and it's a recommended title to anyone on your friends list that may be a fan of basebuilding stuff. It's not an easy game, admittedly, and I will admit that often times I'm mucked up by the UI - but the dev's actually listened to the playerbase on that one and updated it circa version 0.1.9.			"

								ok, so ive had this game for long time, so decided to give a quick review. ive been playingthis game since it came out, there is alot to do between gathering materials to build weapons,fortresses, upgrades, ect ect. since they just added the experimental branch with the new map.... this became more fun and enjoyable as now you have to gather more materials to survive with food,water,air.but it also made it harder which is fine with me since i love a chalenge.Im sure once they get the bugs and everything fixed, it will be more insteresting as the Devs are very active in the forums to help with bugs and problems you have.this is a new map with alot of new stuff out now, and more coming soon as they are happy with the bug fixes and stability with some stuff ingame. All in all this game is sooo worth it if you like survival type of games as you will be busy each day/night gathering materials and sources to stay alive, daytime is 20 minutes while the night time is 5 minutes, thats when you get raided by mobs once you have a base set up.if you like action and survival types of games i HIGHLY recommend this game!

								I feel like this is going to, eventually, be a really good game...But, right now, it's just not there yet.I say that for a few reasons.- There's no real purpose. I understand I exist to survive and survival is the goal but, what's the point of my building? Am I protecting the thing in the middle? Do I need access to it?- The entire power structure is not only left 100% to guesswork but, that's a critical flaw. I want 3 turrets, okay...Well, now none of them are working...Do resources grant permanent power? Temporary?- Weapons - I would've never figured out I could build a rifle...It was only happenstance I figured out I could make more ammo...Still didn't help me, night 3, it was GG.I think that with a solid tutorial and some serious direction, this could be a really good game but, right now, it feels incredibly incomplete to me. I also feel very pigeon-holed. In the time that you're given to get the Eden kit and place it, you're limited to a very small area with very few resources...Unless you constantly mine trees, rock etc, you're really SOL.I still recommend the game - It's a great game, I just feel that in terms of development, it's not quite there yet.

								Very polished for an Early Access game. Pros:-Movement is very smooth, person can climb, grapple, hop, sprint, feels great-Alien theme, environment, graphics, weapons, resource gathering, the turrets, the base, and the overall look of this gameCons:-Multiplayer is in its very early stages, dedicated servers are laggy and you have to host and portforward your own server to avoid those laggy ones provided-Some bugs with turrets aiming at dead AI-Sometimes the aliens don't even attack at night, has to be some sort of path finding bug.Very fun game overall. I purchased it so I could play with my friends, and although slightly disappointing I can't do so without setting up my own server or playing on a laggy one provided, I am hopeful for the future since multiplayer was just added.Singleplayer is quite a blast though!

								Okay here is the run down.You are basically a Pioneer who is stranded on this unknown world with unknown creatures, floral, fauna etc. Your mission: Establish a base, defend your Eden Kit (Life Line of your Character) survive and thrive. I reccommend checking out the guides and video tutorials FIRST!!! There is so much to take in all at once!  I literally was lost when I started my first game. Here are a few quick tips if you're new:-PREPARE TO CRAFT-MELEE IS BAE > AMMO & GUNS LATER-BRING A BUDDY-PLAYED THOSE TD GAMES? THIS WILL HELP-SPRINT DAMNIT-PREPARE TO DIE AFTER DAY 3-4 -REPEATI have yet to get more people on board with me with this game. If you need a buddy to play with add me.Otherwise this is a good buy and I would recommend this to anyone who likes those Open World Sandbox Survival Games. "

								HelloSo Eden star is so far a good game that we don't have yet. See the game has little to no optimization yet, but don't this fool you it is still an amazing work in progress. Parkour is fluent and freckin amazballs, you can grab sh*t and throw it at other sh*t, nights are no longer a long boring time where you are wondering if any enemies are gonna come to your party and not forget the chips.     Even though this game has an amazing concept, it has some things to fix for example there are not enough enemy veriety or gun veriety, no amor types to craft, huge frame rate issues, and you need a powerfull computer for the game.      I am still recommending this game because at $21 this game is a jem and if the developers keep in the direction they are headed in, this game will be 4x the worth the price.EDIT 1: with three to four updates a month this game is living up to its potential but i still fear about the performance (mainly frames), Besides that the game is definitly worth $21. Keep it up guysEDIT 2: WHATS BAD- The updates are still comming along well but with no improvement on optimization, gameplay, or variety. The game still requires a strong pc, there is no armour craftables, one gun craftable, a bunch of augments (that were here since the start), and no melee weaons other than the one you start with. WHATS GOOD- With each update there are new enemy types and new bioms to explore. bugs are being worked on, helping people who have problems with crashing and other technical issues. Multiplayer is finally here, i haven't got to play it but its finally here! Still recommending the game as long as the price doesn't change.			"

								I'm pretty doggone partial to Sci-fi, Survival, Open-world, Exploration games with plenty of Crafting and Building.  I normally stay away from Multi-player games, in fact I always prefer Single-player games.  And I truly enjoy trying out Early Access games here at Steam.  It's fun to watch a game go from somewhat interesting to awesome and incredible.  That said, there's always a risk with Early Access games that the developers will run out of ambition and won't polish their efforts.  Well, the developers of Eden Star are obviously working tremendously hard at turning this game into a polished gem!  The last two updates in February brought all kinds of great surprises and improvements.  Even though this game is still in Alpha, there is plenty of exploring to do, loot to discover, resources to harvest, necessities to craft and shelters to build.  If you go to the developers website you can check out what they have planned for the future.  These developers are serious about improving this already very entertaining game.  And without a doubt it needs more content.  For example, I've built a huge warehouse like shelter and I would love to add a greenhouse for choice food production and perhaps an entertainment area for my hard-working Pioneer.  You can never have too much content or options in a PC game.Here, I must also add I always play in Single-player mode and I have had NO crashes or problems with loading saved games.  And what I find most gratifying about this game . . . . . . . the options.  Many games are so horribly inflexible in giving the player more game OPTIONS.  I hope the developers of this game don't take away any of the options now available.  For example,  if you don't like being constantly attacked by swarms of alien creatures, you CAN adjust sliders in the game options that affect spawn rates OR better yet, you can play the game without ANY hostile aliens spawning!  Love the options, I hate overly difficult or frustrating games.  You can even adjust the night and day length in this game.  The graphics are very nice, impressive landscapes, easy to use inventory and a very intuitive crafting menu.  For those who like to shoot, there are plenty of weapons to assemble and plenty of hostile creatures to shoot at.  Personally, I'm hoping that in the future, the available world to explore (the map) will grow.   If you enjoy Sci-fi, Survival, Open-world, Exploration games with plenty of Crafting and Building, you WILL get your money's worth out of this game.  Just keep in mind that this game is in Early Access and that it needs more content and tweaking.  I'd definitely recommend this game!			"

								At the moment the bones of something great are here, but it's incredibly grindy and near impossible. Probably worth holding off until a few patches and/or multiplayer is added.Even with only the most basic enemies available you'll find it almost impossible to progress as they chew through even the most durable of buildings.It's early access in a nut shell, it looks good it has potential...but like so many others it could either be great or absolutly terrible, so at this point I'd wait and see.

Early Access Review
								A game with a lot of potential, currently still early in its development cycle... and it shows at times.THE UPSIDE:I was really drawn to the sort of 'mass effect' feel in a survival game.  Even the tool you use to mine, craft, build or fight reminded me of an 'omni-tool', as do the weapons.  Survival games are so frequently based around the sword and board ages or... gah... zombies, this game presented a much welcomed alternative to those flavors.The game looks beautiful and the mechanics seem well polished and in fairly good working order, particularly when you take the development point of the game into account.THE DOWNSIDE:There are two major problems with the game right now and both are likely to change as development continues... i hope.The first as i see it, the game is extremely shallow.  While everything you can do works well and looks pretty good, you can do just about all of it within a few hours of play.  You can always make your base larger and more elaborate and you can always farm for more materials, but beyond that survival is never really an issue after the first few turrets are placed down.  That isn't to say there isn't something enjoyable about building elaborate structures and seeing just how difficult you can make it for another player to get into your base, but right now you are pretty limited by type/number of things you can build.The second major flaw in the system right now, and really i can't stress this enough, the server system is an exercise in pure frustration.  As it stands right now, you join a server and maybe you even took the time to visit the forums and find out which servers are ""most reliable"".  Even among these your doing well if your server is up more than two or three days in a row without disappearing for that at least that long.  You can switch servers of course and restart your base again... and then you can do it again when this server vanishes... and again... and honestly if you do it again you kind of deserve what you get.Largely for this reason multiplayer is a pretty lonely existence.  Rarely more than 2-3 people are ever on the supposedly ""most reliable"" servers.  And its fairly easy to understand why.  One confusing mechanic was that while all servers are listed as PVE, they are most certainly not.  By accident my friends and I had found our way into another base and were shocked to find we were able to access their resources.  We actually were somewhat pleased at this revelation because while i'm not sure its intended it meant the game had radically new meaning.  We had to rebuild our base to defend against players!  And we were going to gear up and venture out and see what other bases we could crack.  This was quite a lot of fun, but then enter the extreme unreliability of the servers, to say nothing of the general confusion as to the PVE/PVP status of those servers.THE LOWDOWN:  6.0/10  *with a lot of potentialFor someone who doesn't usually look twice at survival games this one really caught my attention.  It has a lot going for it and i really hope the development process continues along the very promising lines it seems to be.  If your truly are looking for a single player survival experiences (WHY?) then a lot of the issues i have with the game really don't impact you, however, if your looking for a multiplayer experience or to play with friends, the game right now is just not ready.  Its one i will most certainly be keeping an eye on and very hopeful that i'll feel i can rightly flip this review.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an interesting one. The whole thing revolves around a basic tower defense principal, where you build and protect your Eden Kit from hostile native species, because you're the invading alien and they don't like you. Beyond the possibility of some shoehorned social-political commentary or some such, this game is actually pretty good.The combat system is responsive and fun and you have to pay attention to pretty much every enemy so you don’t get pinned into a corner. The parkour system helps with this, allowing you to do a bit of guerilla warfare by running up with your Gauss Cannon, hitting a hive for a few seconds, before running back off into the trees and away from the hordes of enemies. You can and will augment your personal arsenal of firearms and energy weapons with turrets placed around your base to keep away the night time raids. The turrets are fairly basic, as there’s currently only 3 types, missile, auto (machine gun), and laser. You also have to manage power levels in your base, each turret takes some power, and each generator adds some power to the pool. I’m not terribly far in this game yet, so I’m not sure if there’s a practical limit on turrets.A big part of this game is the building system. As far as I know, your structures won’t collapse in Red factions style if you build them poorly (I hope that gets added in at some point) but if you’re not careful, you’ll eventually get a message telling you that you cannot place XYZ at that location because your structure is weak. This can get a bit annoying when trying to build a bridge, but I appreciate the realism. In order to build structures, you’ll need to strap on your big boy pants and venture out into the wilderness to collect resources. Each structure, as far as I know, can be built out of different base materials, depending on what you have or what you need. For example, an Ironite base is the strongest, but Ironite can be a bit annoying to come by, especially early in game if you don’t know where to look. So, instead of Ironite, you can build with Bridgmanite (no idea if I spelled that right) and take a slight dip in health to stock up on Ironite. Or, you may have a small Ironite structure protecting your Eden Kit, with a larger Bridgmenite fortification. Most weapons and modules can also be built from 2 or 3 base materials, which allows you to ration supplies more effectively.Storage is a big problem in this game. If there’s a storage container that isn’t your Eden Kit, I haven’t found it. The Eden Kit has 5 material storage slots, and each of those can hold a stack of 300 of one material. This is fine at first, until you’re going out and coming back with your inventory full, because you didn’t use all your bullets the previous night. Your character has an inventory of 10 slots, each able to hold a max of 300 of one raw material, much like the Eden Kit, the place where this gets a bit iffy, is that ammo only stacks to a certain amount, I think around 144 per slot (which sounds like a lot until you get mobbed by 20 enemies and you begin to fire wildly into the crowd).The last thing I want to say is just little things I like about the game. The physics in this game are amazing. Pretty much any material node can be deconstructed into physics particles (except for large boulders, which just fuzz out of existence if you try to cut them into smaller pieces). As you mine, collectable materials will spawn and then despawn as you absorb them. PSA though, don’t stand on top of what you’re mining, because there’s a rare chance that the game will flip its♥♥♥♥♥♥with the physics objects and launch you into the air. The environments, are beautiful, with each biome having different resource nodes that give you different materials. As far as I know, and I haven’t done any extensive exploration, the basic biomes are: Desert, Forest, and Swamp, with a nice blending where they border each other. Each biome will have its own sort of special resource nodes that will give you a specific material, so you’ll eventually need to branch out and explore to get a decent stockpile.So yeah, this game is pretty good so far, pretty solid gunplay, a decent parkour system, and it seems to have a lot of polish for an early access game. There isn’t a lot of depth to it yet, but I think I can see where they’ve left room to add that later, with time and more updates.			"

								Great game..... but still early access so limited content. The game runs well and seems very stable. i have had no save issues forcing me to restart  and so far it looks reliable but I am waiting to see how the updates will affect this.If you are into resource gathering/building games then this is definitely worth a look.  This game is great as both the immersion and graphics are beautifully designed. The game mechanics and physics run smooth and are amazing for an early access release.However, the real success for this game will be IF the creators keep updating the game. as it stands the game is a really solid game but it lacks enough buildable content and variety of enemies to stand the test of time as it is now.my recommendation is if you want to support what is already a really good game go further and you are happy to wait while the designers update the game this is a GREAT choice.If you want a well rounded near complet game with hours/days of playable content wait a bit longer.

Every time it has a new patch it gets better, think of a survival game (food, crafting, building, gathering) then add in base building with nasty critters, full set of options, including normal mode, free build, turn critters etc on and off as you see fit. Overall it gets a hermit thumbs up from the single player aspect, if you like people then its got mp coop stuff as well.			"

								Although there is very little here to even begin with, this is looking to be the start of a good game. They're obviously super early in developement, and do not yet even have the save/load features in. The graphics are solid, and the mechanics so far are nice. Gameplay is also surprisingly smooth. Although I do not have any performance issues, the game is taxing on the GPU. I would definitely love to see more optimization (again, I know this game is pre-alpha). The combat from what I've experienced is a little quirky, but nothing that can't be fixed. I was not able to experience the gunplay yet, so it may be more fliud and enjoyable than I first assumed. The price tag is where it gets you though. This game has very little content, and yet is charging a whopping $20.00 for it. I don't buy into many early access games, as I'm not a fan, but this one definitely caught my eye, so it better end up matching the price tag, unlike another early access game I regret purchasing... *cough* Interstellar Marines *cough*. This game has so many possibilities and I would love to see it skyrocket into it's final form with backing from the community. On a scale from 1-10 (I'm taking into account that they actually update this game in the future) I would give this a solid 8/10. It's not perfect, but it definitely should stay on your wishlist. If the price dropped a bit (which it won't) it would have been around a 9/10. ALos, I do realize why the pricing is so high this early, for budget reasons and to help for funding, but that's still a lot of money for such little content. Hope to see many updates and improvements made to this game!			"

Early Access Review
								I currently have about 70+ hours and thus so, I would like to give a nice review. The game as a whole is beautifully made, albeit there are some minor problems. These problems mainly consist to a mid-low end laptop that I run. The graphics are wonderful and the scenery are amazing, I love to build up windows around my base just to watch them. I also love that there are options that players can choose to make the game more unique, like amount of damage a creature can do, locations to drop pod into, and the ability to remove enemy creatures all together; just to name a few.I have a couple of issues, but as I said were mainly due to my own laptop being a medium-low end computer, but I still wanted the issues put forth incase it can be made slightly more ease of access for players with lesser/ lower build components. When I activate the game it takes about 3-5 minutes to boot up, then when creating a new game, it takes another 15 minutes, so it takes quite a long time for the game to actually boot up. I also experience lag throughout the game, which makes it hard to build and fight. The game lags when I have the graphics set too high or too low. I have to use ""post-processing"" and ""textures"" at medium levels while everything else is set to low else the game becomes way to lagged. Besides these two problems, I find nothing wrong ingame, albeit I havnt tried multiplayer as I wanted to be less nooby in it.If someone wants to get this game, just make sure you have a strong enough CPU/GPU for the game. As it can be a beefy game. Overall, Its a well put together game, and I am lucky to have bought this game, I have not regreted my purchase.			"

								I love this game. it a right combination of Survival and FPS that only gets harder and harder to play. Don't have much play time only becuase of work but if i didnt have to work it would a lot more. Having the choice of making stuff out of different metals makes it esier to  build up a base. Ammo is a life thing not easy to keep up which forces you to use meele a lot which is effective or just throwing the creature away. Its a fun game cant wait to see what more they will add. 10/10 rating hands down for me.			"

								[Updating this review since I originally posted May 25th 2015]The amount of changes, bug fixes and overall interaction with the devs and community goes above and beyond. I have yet to play an early access game that I desired to see improved upon and finished more than this. The previous issue I had with multiple eden kits and unbearable fps loss after some time into the playthrough is gone. I'm able to build and wrap my base around the map without having to worry about further expansion.///This game is fantastic even in its current state. Read several reviews and saw devs replying to those with issues and that alone brings me a lot of hope for this game. It's a bit overwhelming when you first start but either you'll die as I did to exploding bugs or you'll figure it out and press on. The build system is pretty nice and the quick craft is just awesome. Quick crafting ammo while fighting enemies is amazing. Hey Devs, unsure if others have brought this to your attention but once you acquire a secondary eden kit (whether from building or finding one), the game will start to lag at weird times once you build up a decent fortress/base. I find myself sticking to using one kit to avoid this. Other than that, keep doing what you do. This game is top.			"

								Eden Star has a ton of potential to be a completely astounding game however at the moment there is not much to really do, other than build a base and survive for as long as you can (which is harder than it sounds) the current weapons are fairly good but after trying them all I would definitely suggest getting the wrist mounted gauss cannon. The physics based combat is really a joy to use  but you have to be careful not to wreck your base by throwing things into it. Overall Eden Star is one of the early access that I am really glad I bought and would recommend people give it a try. (remember it is an early access so only get it if  you think you will like the end product) Edit: The new map at the time of editing is really cool and much bigger this game is developin in a very good direction.

Early Access Review
								This is what I experienced in the game and what my opinions are of it right now with about 2 hours of play (at the time of this review):Pro's -Clones - I can compare this game all day long to a bunch of different survival games, sci-fi games, etc. Not only is that not fair to do, it's impossible to find an exact clone. This game has elements from many different games, crammed into one. I'd say this game is more like Rift than anything else in that regard. They found what works, what was unique, and great and compiled it into their game.Graphics - I'm a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥... I like looking at things on my computer that don't bore me or damage my eyes. But, I also can find ways to disregard graphics with gameplay mechanics. This game solved that problem for me, because it has game mechanics I like, and looks amazing at the same time. This is top tier graphics and I was stuck on a low resolution. I streamed the game, it still looked absolutely amazing where others would look terrible.AI - I liked the way the AI functioned and responded to you, even if there was only one type. The one creature still managed to do a number of my ""base"" and was fun to hunt down. I enjoyed grabbing them and slamming them into trees, or better yet... throwing them up into the air and shooting them mid-fall. Like some sadistic skeet shooting. :PFreebuilding - This reminded me of Rusts style of building, without the whole naked man junk in my face. It's quirky and needs some work, but overall I could sit all day and build a massive base for myself. If only saves worked. :PPerformance - I have a solid rig and I'm glad this game treated me right. I usually get penalized for having a decent computer where my GPU or CPU is either not used enough, not balanced, or just flat out not compatible. Not only did it work great out of the shoot, it performed perfectly. I had a few instances of lag, but then I was also streaming too. I could see frames dropping on me, but not frequent enough to be a major issue. That's the sign of a good solid foundation of a game.Con's - Saves - I mention this first so it's out of the way. You can't save. So, everytime to jump in, don't get attached to anything. This is supposed to be fixed and the rumor was in a patch by 02-06-15. We'll see if that happens because that will be HUGE for people.Crashes - I list this, and not sure why I use the plural sense... because I had only one. I didn't get too far into the game (about 30 or 40 minutes) but because of the saves I lost everything. The crash may have been a collision issue that I'll forward to the devs. But, another hour or so of gaming... and not another crash.Multiplayer - Or in the case of this, lack thereof. I am a HUGE multiplayer guy and usually pass these games up if they don't have it. I took a gamble on this game and am satisfied with it, but I would be a fool not to mention that this game is IDEAL for multiplayer. The devs say it's a likely future addition... but until then, I'll be disappointed without it.Content - There's not much to do once you have a huge base and killed most of the creatures nearby. You can't explore and find anything else (besides resources for crafting). No additional AI, lairs, ship crashes, survivors, etc. I think once the base game gets finished more content will be added, but if you're hoping for this right off the bat you will be disappointed. All in all... worth the price of admission. I'll be playing it when I can and enjoying what the game has to offer in the meantime. Keep up the solid work and I look forward to seeing what you can add.			"

Early Access Review
								Easily one of the most beautiful space-themed games I have ever played. Fidelity wise and atmosphere wise this game is one of the prettiest games available on PC. I haven't felt this immersed while playing a single player game in a long time. When you run into what i call the 'acid egg sac' in the middle of the woods because you couldn't see it through the amazing looking grass and it explodes on you is one of those 'OH SH-- WTF WAS THAT' moments in gaming that are actually enjoyable somehow.The mechanic of dissassembling the enviornment for resources is very fun, with each piece of absorb having a chance to drop any one of a few resources instead of the usual guaranteed resource count from a node. The combat is challenging, almost a bit too challenging, but balance will come later in the process. Right now the scaling between the first few nights will take a few retries to get a good base build quickly.The basebuilding is extensive as well as easy to use, with parts easily fitting into place and orientated without really needing to struggle like in most games with the mechanic. It's honestly a pleasure to base build especially when you can get your resources back by absorbing a piece of you misplace something. Most of these systems are a struggle to use, Eden Star plays like an absolute dream.Probably the best part about this game is that the dev team is extremely responsive to feedback. I have bought at this point probably 100+ early access titles, and there are very few dev teams that respond like Flix Interactive does. I have watched the development of success stories like Prison Architect, and miserable failures like Blade Symphony, and Flix has that 'it' factor that really makes me believe they are going to go places. As a guy that watches game developers almost like some would watch a football team, I don't take such a positive evaluation lightly.The only negatives of this game as far as I can see is you need a really decent system to run on high settings, the balance is a bit poor at the moment, and the UI needs some work. The good thing is that all of those issues will eventually be fixed or already are being fixed by the dev team.Worth a buy, especially at the $20 USD price point. I've already gotten my moneys worth and I havent even made it an entire week in game yet.			"

								This game is incredible for an Early Access game. The crafting is solid. You can build your shelter in many shape or form which looks really good. You can craft things from one of many material which gives different stats (pro and cons for dmg resistance).  Combat in this game is also very good. Although there are only two kinds of enemies(Flying and ground ones) and two kinds of weapon(Pistol And Combat rifle) in this game, but the combat is a blast and pretty solid. You can throw your enemy against trees to make it collapse and collect the tree resources later. Customization is also good. You can craft many upgrades for your armor, such as faster resource collecting and an ability to repair your building. This game also has a clear tutorial and guide for how to play it, so it should be easy for anyone. In conclusion, Eden Star is a very interesting project and fun to be played. There are very fews content for now, but also very fews bugs to be found. Just get the damn game since it worth every baht and penny.			"

I will give you my feedback so far but as the game is literally changing as you read this it will change so if you play it get on the forums.Currently game play is fun real fun! though as they are still making it you wll get to a point where you start forming questions this is where you give feed back. Its a mix of resource gathering, strategy base building and defence and survival with polish! Its still in development so no review is accurate if you like strategy, survival, shooting, buildiing its a game for you i dont play many games like this im more a strategy fan but its good! Theres definately something here with the potential to be epic. Thats different to the myriad of survival concepts.			"

								From the moment upon hearing that this game was (is) in developement, I knew from that day on, a masterpiece was in the making, and here it finally is. I pre-ordered this game from the official website many months ago and boy ohhhhh boy!, words cannot describe how amazing this pre-alpha is and how much potential it has to becoming one of the greatest indie gems of all time.If I could even explain a fraction of my adoration of this game... it would probably overwhelm you. This game is one of a kind. Taking everything good from the genre and gaming in general, Eden Star is a feat I cannot fathom.The current state of the game is very playable and thoroughly enjoyable. I have not encountered any major glitches yet and the minor ones are not a game breaker at all. Runs smooth at maxed out settings on my PC (GTX 480, Core i7 8 core CPU 3.33GHz and 8GB RAM). This game offers the classic examples on how open worlds can be optimally designed. The graphics are stunning, thanks to the use of Unreal Engine 4. The crafting is overwhelmingly thoughtout and very complex to the point where by the time you have figured out everything that is craftable and buildable, you will end up discovering a new recipe.This is an extremely intelligent game and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any type of gamer alike. Stop reading this and Insta-buy now!			"

								Eden Star is a game with potential. Big potential. Fun, engaging, and challenging I recommend it. That said, in its current state it is A) little more than clean functioning fundamentals and B) A base defense game at it's core. It may be one of the most immersive, pretty, and well crafted tower defense games but it is still about hustling to get the materiel you need and craft (and place) the items you need before night falls and all hell breaks loose.Things to Know:The game is functional, very functional right now. Limited in scope (maybe 10 hours of fun right now, big patch coming soon), but plays like a final game.The dev's have addressed past problems such as no save system (still waiting on randomly generated worlds)The game seems well thought out, and the content they plan to add will be what fills out the potential of the game.ConclusionsMost of the early release games on steam are steaming piles of crap, Eden Star seems different. The game as it currently  stands is the most playable and functional Early Access games I have ever played. The game plan of the future, adding more content, such as new building options, defenses, items, and enemies is exactly what this game needs  to make it great....and that is just the start of what they plan. I check my updates every day waiting for the April patch, and i cannot remember the last time I was so eager for a game update.			"

								To say I'd recommend this game would be an understatement. Got it a little less than a year ago and have played a whopping 870 hours on it. There were weeks where I literally played like 60 hours or more (luckily I'm self employed...otherwise I'm sure I would've been fired). I can't express how much fun this has been, even with its periodic issues that pop up, as it is still somewhat early in development. It's a perfect mix of just casual building and mining, with fairly regular adrenalin-inducing fighting as the local wildlife rather violently protests your presence. Most of the fun is simply seeing how BIG you can build stuff. The building aspect here lets you get really creative, where you can experiment will all sorts of architecture and formations. That, and the look is simply beautiful. It's one of the best looking games I've ever seen, with this richly detailed, lush world that is mesmerizing.			"

								It's a pretty fun game with a great concept. My biggest wish is that it had more direction or an objective instead of just salvage and build. It would be super fun playing in a group, but it gets old playing solo. So it doesn't exactly hold my attention for too long. It just doesn't have enough variety in building for that to be its main pull. Or maybe I just haven't explored it enough. I love how you can build and interact with the enviornment and upgrade, but after you get the awesome weapons and upgrades and awesome base, then what?			"

Graphics are fantastic, one of the better looking survival games I have played. If you don't like to be attacked by swarms of xenos, you can adjust sliders in the game options that affect spawn rates and night length.

								I loving the game, but i put no hostiles, and still everything is going after me,  i highly suggest also putting option to have day and night length sliders. Ive only been playing a few hours. but have died, lost my shield so many times, everything comes after me! and I also suggest a better explination of the settings. I dont understand what some of them do. but love the game!Update:After playing the game, and exploring for awhile, i came to the conclusion that the game doesnt have many things to do. everything around you is the same pretty much. the animals are far and few between, and very few kinds of them, the recipies for building is hard to get at times, and there are very few things to build. the items you gather from the environment feels rushed, as you go to a rock and it lists 3 different types of mats you can get from it. The environment its self is cool, and amazingly done, i will give you that. The game is great. But you will get bored quick with what the game has now. I really do hope some more recipies become available. and they make the environment more diverse. until then, I will be waiting. Please also realize i figured out how to lower the hostiles, to a more managable pace.  The taturial is hard to get, and the voice from the flying pod thing is hard to hear. and you cant turn up the voluume on that. And you get slaughtered several times before you even get to the first base. then the first base gets its♥♥♥♥♥kicked by mobs nearby(this was before i turned down the settings) i highly suggest turning down the settings and reviewing them before you start the game.Dont get me wrong this is a great game. it just has a lot of growing up to do.

However, the development team is EXTREMELY responsive to feedback, releases news about progress and direction weekly, and has MULTIPLE developers including people making their own assets.  Their vision isn't clear yet and the gameplay is going to change drastically.  However, at each step of the way, they want the content they have to be fun and bug free, and they work very hard at that, which is admirable and completely worth your money if you like to support EA games!

First, though the game server is supposedly a PvE server, there are no preventions in players killing players. Additionally, and this might be an issue only on this server, a player who appears to have the ability to crash or reset the server. He will attack us while we are gathering and if we kill him in defense, the server will crash/reset and come back rolled back about 5 minutes.Apart from this, seems to be a fun play.			"

								Great, beautiful, fresh survival game. 10/10Has a fresh view of the popular survival mode type games. What I mean is daytime/nightime are quite different. You will be scared at nightfall if you didn't make good use of your daytime.♥♥♥♥♥♥is like stormship troopers and you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants. Which I personal like that steep progressive learning curve. Each time you play a new game you're trying to see how many days you can make it this time with a new base design.Pros:-Great alpha game it feels very complete. No annoying bugs that I found. The dev's clearly want you to experience this game one complete package at a time.-Weapons feel important. You have to decide do I want to carry more minerals for building or should I carry more ammo so I can kill more nests so they don't swamp my base at night. The energy sword upgrade IS AMAZING. love it. I would totally go for a pole arm of this.-Easy understanding on where stuff comes from and where its located. Could use minor imporvements but for noobs its simple enough to understand and just have at it and you're going.Cons:-Could use more content. I know its alpha, which gets me excited for new kinds of aliens. I would like to see aliens get special abilities or look different signifying that they are harder than the noob enemies you faught a few days before. New structures would also be welcome, more guns, JUST GIVE US MORE! pretty much-Combat feels a little clunky. It feels like Halo 1 and I'm looking for more of a Halo 2 kind of feel. I would suggest giving the player specialized weapons for killing hives. Like explosives or a FLAMETHROWER! YES WHERE'S MY FLAMER?! But combat is expected to only get better.Other thoughts and improvements for the devs:-Perhaps a more intuitive tutorial for what to do after you get your eden kit deployed. Make a mission about building some turrets on some towers or something. And you must include some sort of ""Hey this is daytime, you're suppose to be collecting♥♥♥♥♥♥and you better kill this damn hive over here or you will be butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥come night time""-I would like to some more storage space with the eden kit. Currently 5 stacks max is just not enough. I would like to see some more armor options for more carry space inventory on the player wise.-A module that is a medic kit for you to heal your allies. Something like the healing gun from Dust514 would look awesome all sci fi and♥♥♥♥♥♥-Shotgun and flamethrower are a must. Consider grenades as well or C4 for blowing up nests. Maybe a freeze or foam gun to just freeze the monsters for like 10 seconds so I can stop running around the damn nests like a chicken with its head cut off avoiding the monsters. The kenetic module is awesome, an upgrade to make it a pulse wave that pushes all the monsters back and knocks em on their♥♥♥♥♥would be awesome for team play.-With the current inventory system for the player, you pretty much just choose 1 ammo type. So it makes 2 weapon slots useless. Consider infinite ammo for pistol? Or perhaps another kind of carrying system for just ammo. Like you're bandolier is seperate from mineral pouch and can only hold 5 stacks of ammo choose wisely. Or 2 different bandoliers for each weapon. BUT link it with total weight  so you can't just go crazy.-Come up with a resource dump. After a while i'm sitting on hundreds upon hundreds of fiber and brigdimite with nothing to do with it. I would love to see a utility structure that is a refinery. Convery fiber into something else. like 100 fiber -> 10 cerelium or something. That way plant harvesting doesn't feel handicapping after a while. FIBER BULLETS?! Or something like that! Fiber to make some kevlar armor.-Add visuals to the eden kit itself to show that each level you upgrade has signifigance. Like actually show the EK itself changing and becoming more technologically advanced after each level you upgrade.-Walls that keep enemies out, but turrets can shoot through. Could be the energy walls yes, but I feel like the monsters just go for the pillar part and makes this structure just bait. If energy walls were real and effective it would be better. Or some sort of structure that the montsters could pass through but would Snare them, trap them, slow em, burn em, something. Maybe just modify the laser walls.-After a while it becomes repetative and you can't explore the rest of the map because you can only go so far from your base and you must return to it. Setting up a new one is too straneous and not effictive later in the game. So. Perhaps come up with some way the base can defend itself and when you create a new base with a new eden kit, a bubble that is impenetrable for the first night or two to give the player a head start. This would allow me to move south and explore other Biomes which I really want to do. Perhaps make this kit a template of a base with 2 turrets instead of invulnerability. That would work great. Or hey crazy idea, make a radiation suit upgrade so we can just go balls to the wall at night time and run for our lives on a suicide mission trying to setup a base.-Grappling hook made of fiber and some ironite? Do something with fiber it needs more love. I know its hard to do in a high tech game, but everything feels like mineral based and rocks are in higher demand than fiber. Maybe it can be used in explosives? Like back to the foam gun idea, some sort of high tech fiber that binds the enemies. Great job though I love the game its the best survival game I've played yet and beautiful UE4. These are the dev's that deserve support and you're money. I only hope that as the game goes on it does not become like DayZ where the devs are happy with the money they already got. Just keep working on it, keep the updates complete, and you will be a glorious dev and have my money.Highly recommend to anyone :)			"

Early Access Review
								(sorry for the quality of this review but I don't write reviews often)I bought this game last year (2015) and as you can see by the 3+ hours of game time , I don't play it much. Why would I recommend this game? I think this game is has lots of potential. I know everyone says that about all their games or games they like but the development team is adding things constantly to their early access game. Several times a month as far as I can see. I bought this game after reading up on the Unreal 4 engine, and after a free weekend playing Ark Survival evolved.I’ve always been a fan of Unreal 4 , this game shows it with great looking graphics, runs well for the hardware and small ~2GB game size is probably all due to Unreal 4.Did the game live up to my expectations after playing Ark Survival? No, but I genuienly believe that it will be just as good in the future. The game felt more like Minecraft Tower defense for a while since your base is attacked at night and you can’t venture too far away at first but this summer they started adding food requirements and expanding on actual survival elements. The parkour also feels really good, I enjoy running around and climbing stuff, or running along walls. That said, I haven’t encountered any bugs or glitches, which you’d normally find in an early access game. It’s also possible I just haven’t gotten far enough to see them.Anyway, if you like Sci-fi settings, feeling the pressure of keeping your base safe and of course gathering materials and building stuff  then I think you’ll enjoy this game.

								Ok I wanna say some good thing and maybe some bad things:It Is AWESOME Quality and grafics a beautiful looking game and, I haven't played it alot but It was amazing. The building was simple, but the inventory was a little hard to get used to but when you get used to it, it's awesome. I played with a friend first and It was really funny and scary sometimes, we laughed and got scared really many times, but It was super fun, and the bad thing Is that, sometimes it gets really hard to defend you base if you dont have sentrys or weapons, so I think it's best to play with friends so you can build up your base quicker and gader materials and craft stuff, then it get a little easier. BUT this game is just wonderful and amazing and I really recommend this game for you to buy it!!10/10And dont forget that this game is in early access and maybe even alpha I think... so all the stuff are not in the game yet, but I think this game is gonna have an AMAZING future and it is gonna be a lot of fun.thanks for reading this!!

								The game is really funny in spite of its early stage. Combat is really funny when you grab your enemies and smash them against trees. The missing save and load system isn't that bad because if you die and your eden kit gets destroyed you have to start all over again.Here is a gameplay video and a small wishlist of features which hopefully come into the game.

								Okay, where do I start... This game is fun. Lots of fun! Until you play multiplayer and spend hours upon hours in building a base just to have some jack-hole come and take it from you.. okay.. that's fine. I build another one.. oh no.. the bigger more defended base you built just got taken too.. crap. Okay.. one more base. This time WAAAAAY up on a mountain. Okay done. No freaking WAY anyone is getting into this one... yeah.. no.. they did.. they took it down... oh well. the game that you have played for hours upon hours on for nothing just slammed you in the #$% and BOOM.. time wasted... great. Thanks massive douches that have no regard for playing or other people. Yes, I know it's PvP... but come on... it can't be that easy to take a base... I even tried to take one.. we did it.. but BOOM, next day.. gone.. they took it back. Oh, and if you didn't join some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s clan, they would gun for you and take whatever you have away from you. That isn't cool. All-in-all, it's fun. I love building and creating.. but what I don't like is some amateur player can just take whatever they want. This game has some time before it's better. The mobs are challenging but that's a good thing. It's just the other players that suck. I am recommending this game because, really.. it's fun. In single player mode... and sometimes in Multi, but mostly in Single lol. Last note, the servers suck for Multi. They kept going down and every time that happened, I lost about 15-20 min worth of work and time. It was frustrating.If you like a game like Minecraft on crack, this is the one for you. If you like other people taking whatever the hell they want... this is a game for you. If you want to spend hours upon hours of your precious time that you could be spending on another game just to have all that work and effort taken from you.. this is the game for you!Enjoy team! "

Early Access Review
								I found this game to be fairly entertaining! Listen though, hosting your own multiplayer server can be kind of a headache with out a seperate machine to host the server! I hope they do something to make it easier to host a server in the future.Anyway, the game is a lot like ark survival but with far less dinosaurs and a bit less on the survival side for now. It still early access and they have what appears to be a lot planned for it. Frankly, this is one game I wouldn't mind seeing procedurally generated landscapes. In 2 hours, I was able to learn the landscape off the back of my hand. Theres maybe 8-10 spots where you can make a near impenatrable base on the current map. I think only 4 of them can be achieved with out much thinking involved. Of course, throw enough turrets around your base, you can become impenatrable no matter where you are. My watch tower has so many turrets around it, it lags my game hard core when they fire at the crawlies of the night! The game has one big issue in its current state. Once you build you base and get the gear you want, theres nothing left to do but sit out on your porch and tell those kids to get off your lawn. Watch your turrets mow em down as they refeuse and try to foolishly jump you with nothing but a pistol with 30 shots. Laser fences are great trampolines! They make you jump and kill you at the same time!			"

								Disclaimer: I 'reclaimed' (lets pretend i never said that) my old review and made a new one, now to the point...Devs: The devs might not be actively updating their game like other devs, but they are way more active and unlike quite a few devs (*cough cough* im looking at you tf2) they listen to suggestions. This adds a ton of hope to the game.Pros: Its either me or the game is still super duper small, there arent really many pros, but just being able to walk around and flinging enemies up into the air and impaling them into the ground is fun, or using the big explody spores to just harm those annoying turkey... alien... things? Its just fun.Cons: (there are cons but with the active devs these most likely will be fixed) Like everyone has said, imbalance of flyers and ground creatures, even i reported this but i managed to get glory out of it, its like watching fireworks with the number of flyers appearing out of portals and missiles going off, its fun to watch. Ive heard of the 'boss' (Juggernaut) imbalances. The last one is just that you sort of have to repair more after an attack than gather to build more.Summary: Good devs, I would wait to see how the new biomes update works out before spending some money(I cant wait for that update!!!!!!!!).

								If you looking for sci fi survival games this will be it. It has better character design which has the feeling of playing halo but also surviving. Of  course not to forget the tower defence as you will be attacked every night with bugs. Aerial and ground unit, from little agile splintermites to the massive juggernaut which make you also feel like you are with the federation mobile infantry in starship troopers.The developer is also very active for early access with awesome sneak peak and update deployment policy is top notch.

								I backed this game way back shortly after the Kickstarter. Almost forgot about it too. So I got my Steam recently and tried it out.Right now there isn't much do and so I woundn't a purchase at this time, however if you want to get in before they add stuff and the price goes up, go for it. So far the game is looking good, just lacking content and reason to play for very long.Right now, you basically just go around and collect resources and upgrade your Eden Kit. Enemies never come and attack, and when I go looking for them, they burrow into the ground. Time would be better spent on another game.			"

								So, yeah, not a half bad game at all given its in the last stages of pre-Alpha. Granted there's not an awful lot to do at this stage but with what I've been reading from the Dev's weekly updates, for all intents and purposes, it is going to be a brand new game. The mechanics are fairly solid, the AI is relatively solid, the framework is all there, and while it might need a bit of ironing out (what pre-Alpha stage game doesn't?) it looks really good and plays quite well. What impressed me is the Developers, more specifically them taking our feedback and actually implementing it and working with the community to give what they all want. That's the beauty of smaller developers; the day you see Electronic Arts doing such a thing will be a cold day in hell for sure. Sure they might be taking their time with this new release, but if it means shipping a release that isn't broken, then I'm happy to wait a little longer. My score? Well I have 66 hours logged on this game so it can't be that bad. I'll score it an 7.5/10 for the pre-Alpha release.			"

								Eden Star is an early access title with substantial promise. Currently it's in its infancy stage so if you're planning on buying it, I'd advise you to hold off for the time being. The gameplay will only keep you occupied for one-two hours due to the limited content. However, that being said, what's currently included is fantastic. The player can harvest resources, build a base, fight monsters, explore and survive to their hearts content. For lack of a better comparison, imagine a sci-fi shooter combined with Terraria and that's more or less what you have here. Everything in the game suggests that the developers have so much more along the way and I can't wait to see how the game looks in twelve months time. It has a lot of potential, but don't invest if you aren't prepared to wait for updates!			"

								Beautiful game for being pre alpha.  I have funded other games who's releases were in way worse shape than this (looking at you Starforg and DF9).Game play is basic but fun.  The lack of a save feature is a bummer but they said its coming.  They do have perma death and a way to save your base if you have the correct mats saved in the correct inventory so, Im not too worried on the save part.These devs don't seem to be making promises that seem overreaching (cough Star Citizen cough) so funding them felt right.  Its worth the $20 as is in my opinion.  Hopefully it only gets better from here.			"

Since the last patch i cant grab and  hold creatures anymore.2. Building from two sides over a crevace is nearly impossible to join the two platforms. Look at maybe making the snap options more grid tied to enable joining of platforms easier. Due to this issue enemies spawn at night at the oposite side then cant get accross making them easy targets and unfair.3. Rotating corners of platforms and floor panels is not possible so you cant finnish off your structure corners if the auto rotate/snap doesnt enable the angle you seek. "

								I had previously written a review found below indicating that I couldn't recommend the game without options to defend against griefing.  The developers noticed right away and were helpful in explaining that with PvE servers my concerns would be resolved.  The developers are actively listening to the community and that speaks volumes about the quality of development.  The game play is quite fun.  This game is a really nice survival game with first person shooting aspects, kind of mixed with tower defence  notions and is worth trying out.  Keep it up devs!Previously:I have played survival games where offline griefing is prominent and this game is setting itself up for that same failure, especially after the new patch where looters can take all your stuff while you're logged offline.  I have over 600+ hrs in ARK, which is a similar concept and when I woke up one day Everything I had spent that entire time building had been destroyed and I logged in dead.  I have no beef fighting online but unless this game removes offline pillaging, I can not and won't recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								As of v0.0.1, Eden Star has a tendency to crash on my system at the frequency of roughly 1 hour into the game, and there is no means to save, so there's no real persistence to my efforts as of yet.   Still, it's a pretty solid start to a really cool take to the whole construction-survival-sim.Core to the coolness of this game is how you are wearing a suit that lets you break down trees and rocks in a realistic fashion, they pop and break as you work, the power of a micro singularity at your fingertips, so you can scoop the matter up in some sort of matter digitizer and take it back to your Eden platform in order to build construction blocks, turrets, and weapons.  This suit can also be upgraded to become a full on grav gun, picking up and throwing enemies and other objects, as well as a rail gun upgrade.  It's a great platform to play with 3D engine physics, although it keeps everything above ground (no digging) and it's mostly just rocks and trees and aliens right now.Making progess involves upgrading your Eden platform by converting resources into energy but, the more energy your Eden platform has, the more attention of the hostile wildlife it attracts.  As there is nothing to do but upgrade your Eden platform, in theory, things will slowly but steadily ramp up from being a leisurely walk to a desperate fight to hold your ground.  In action, it's very barebones right now, the attacking wildlife comes in slowly, sometimes not at all and, just when things are starting to get interesting, the game crashes or locks up (your mileage may vary; my system might be less compatible than yours).  Lacking a means to save the game, I am sent back to the beginning.  But it is certainly a pretty interesting tech demo for as long as it lasts, and I hope the developers see through their vision instead of losing motivation, pocketing the early access money and running as some do.

								This is already a great and slightly addictive game. It does get a little repetitive after a time, but that is only because the game is still being developed. I can see this being an amazing game in the long run, a game that truly does redesign the survival genra as a whole. The dev team is very active, they communicate with the community on many fronts and are willing to take advice, criticism, and new ideas to heart within this game. This has already been shown through going through forum posts on several sites. The fact that the dev team truly does seem to care so much about this game and it's community says alot about the potential of this game. I do not regret this purchase, and I am greatly looking forward to the next update.			"

								Running this on a system that should have absolutly no problem running this, however it keeps locking up and then force quitting. Too bad because this game is bad♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously. PrOS:-movement is smooth.-graphics are great.-parkour, FPS, survival, exploration, and crafting morphed together-very intuitive building controls-awesome physics-great character models-tons of content already-great character improvement systemCons:-Keeps force quitting.-No story (as of yet)-Lacks interactive tutorial-Graphics need polishing-Small variety of fauna / lifeformsYes I realize this game is in early development and it will only get better. However to be fair, the cons reflect what is missing already and if not addressed will affect the playability of this game. On the other hand, this game is so awesome, and the idea is so bad♥♥♥♥♥ and you can tell the devs have worked their asses off for this game so I am recommending this game. This game has the most potential of any of the early releases Ive invested into recently and Im so excited to see what the future hold for us and this game. "

A little bit longer and I knew I'd found my new favourite Steam game. I'm only not in there now because I'm reading the tutorial notes, persuading my friends to get it and writing this review.

								this game is not what i had thought it would turn out to be atleast currently right now it just seems like a futuristic tower defendce game with survival elements tacked on i understand this is meant to feel like a survival and tower defence but most of the time its a constant struggle to survive because of the mass of enemys seen every nightthis game is worth having a look at now and then to see if it has improved any more or had some amazing update but in its current state its not worth unless you really love this genre i'd still say the game is good just not worth the buy unless your a diehard fan or just have leftover moneybut that's my opinion improvements they could make that you should look out for are randomly generated worlds more difficulty settings sandbox/creative mode vehicles and just survival mode (eliminating enemys coming and destroying your base at night) multiplayer and adding beds or a sleep function			"

								Eden Star is this open world first-person shooter sandbox base building game. It has it's perks, challenges, and unique art/style. This game has an enormous amount of potential for future version releases. More enemies, weapons, possibly multiplayer, and vehicles is an example of this potential.The only thing that this game lacks is purpose or a goal so to speak. Survival in modern day games is a common goal and common sense which is no longer unique as a challenge when stranded in unchartered territory.Once you figure out how everything works, the building system and the RMD modules, it gets very boring. After a handful of hours playing the Hardcore mode you have already built the rifle and pistol, a small base with defenses and a couple of maxed out eden kits, and have upgraded just about everything.After this point you've essentially reached the ""end"". The only thing to do at that point is to build a bigger base, which is great and all but when you realize that any other rooms other than the ones for the Eden Kits are useless, building a castle seems less interesting.Overall, I would recommend this game, it is something that unexpectedly caught my attention for a week or so of casual gameplay. I hope to see more new features and additions to this game in the near future!			"

								   Not sure if I've made a review for this yet... And I'm not exactly sure doing this at 6 in the morning, with no sleep at all, is the brightest of choices, but here I go.   What's a good way of describing Eden Star? Well... It's good. Like, really good. How it works is much different than any others like it. In fact, it confused me at first... Instead of knowing about wall running, and taking that first path towards the Eden kit, I went a long way around, and leaped off a cliff to get to it. Can something like minecraft, or the countless other Survival games do that? Maybe. But it more than likely won't make you seem like such a bad-a** while doing so.   Aside from that, there's no terrain deformation. All there is, is the ability to cut down trees, dig into various above-surface ore deposits (Which regenerate over time... Somehting that could be seen as unnerving), and go at the various ""Hives"" around the game area, in order to get the lovely rare as all hell resource that you use to respawn, upgrade equipment, and so on.   Where am I going with this? Not exactly sure, but I'm guessing that I'm doing pretty good so far. Anyways, the combat system is very unique... It's rare for a game to go ""Here. Have fun."" and give you access to an item that lets you throw things around like rag dolls. Sure, the targeting is a bit off... Making it hard to actually hit things that are close to you... But it's a fun and unique part of the game that adds that much more charm to it all.   And on the topic of charm... The design of the map is beautiful. And with the ability to run up and along walls for short distances makes it that much better. I can't tell you how long I spent climbing a single mountain, to ""save some time"", while exploring. Spoiler warning: It didn't. And I was attacked about halfway up. Without a gun. Fun, right?   But yeah, I haven't played the game lately, as... Even with all its charm, I have to admit, it can get a bit old after a while, in the stage it was at. But I would play this game over any other, any day of the week. Because really, it's fun, and I enjoy how different it is compared to other games. Sure, there are people out there who could play ""Call of duty advanced Z nuke strike"" and call it innovative in its rinse-wash-repeat design, and good on them. They found a game they like. But I'm thinking that they wouldn't enjoy this game too much... It'll just be too complicated for them. But yeah, you may like this game, or you may not. This is just my opinion on it, and if you don't like it, leave.			"

Early Access Review
								So to start of. For a pre-alpha game it's very impressive.Concept: The concept is very interesting. At times feels like a fpswith some satisfying weapons (currently pistol, SMG, Rifle, Sniper, Baton, Energy Baton)and then feels like a 3D mine craft.The build system is very similar to fallout 4 in terms of snapping objects etc..but atm, as it is pre-alpha, doesnt have content (basic structural components, 3 types of turret and a few utilities, power gen etc..)FPS: FPS wise it's pretty solid having been built with Unreal Engine 4.Weapons have satisfying models and sounds and the enemies are varied enough torequire different tactics not just spamming rifle. You can also upgrade youmining tool to project kinetic blasts for knock back and through upgradesadd furhter knock-back, damage, projected laser etc.. to make combat muchmore varied. Feels sort of like a fantasy RPS with both guns and magicks.Enemies: There are a select few differnt types of enemies that spawn at certain sites, destroying the hive while enemies attack is challanging and rewarding (rare ore telirium?)On a night they attack your base and if you don't take care of the hive the attacksbecome worse, sustaining damage to walls,defenses and your EDEN kit.Movement: I really like the parkour in this game. Very satisfying to be acble to scale rock faces with the ability to actually reach ledges significatly higher than you.Mining: Mining is cool. Holding the right mouse strips ore deposits and trees with a nice context menu telling u the compisition of different minearls.THe mining can also be upgraded to either be faster, reach futher or enhance combat by paralysing enemies and then throwing them etc..Graphics: Very nice graphics as expected form unreal engine 4. Lighting is a bitodd for me (could just be me) but the light and dark areas can be too high contrast at times.However as pre-alpha this isn't something I would hold against the DEVS.Mulitplayer: Not done multiplayer yet but the devs have some pretty good looking guides for setting up a server. Upgrading and construction: The upgrades and construction require certain minerals/oresas a base cost and some allow you to choose the aditional ore/mineral. This allows you to play stategically in what ores/minerals you have to spare etc..basic structures like walls etc. can be made using a select few, some way more common than othersbut the rarer minerals/ores add bonuses / debuffs to HP heat resistance etc... which is a nicetouch. Equipment wise upgrades for your mining tool, kinetic force, repair tools requires both specific minerals/oresand additional. Ammo is made at the Eden Kit so you have to work for your ammo, again a nice touch.Development: The devs seem very pasionate about this game and what they've promisedto include looks like this game could become very popular. Future prospects: Once more content is added, simple structures, utilties, defenses etc and more upgrades I think this game could be a real hit. I can forsee large multiplayer servers with factions etc..in a PVE environment. Differnt builds such as Heavy hitters, expert miners, expert navigators etc, crowd controllers..Bosses should be an interesting feature in terms of reward etc..Here are some of the features in dev at the time of this review:16km island, should be very interestingBoss like enemiesExplosive weapons - will like to see how much the ammo drains ur resourcesMore buildablesCreature creation - should be funVehicles - Yes please!and some features planned:more melee - would be cool to see upgrades upgradeable armour - very nice, shield upgrades? regen, damage etc...More utilities - not just power generatorscaves - would be awesome builing in a cave with a heavly fortified frontrobotic allies - customisable would be awesomeMy thoughts: Been a space age open world builder, I would like to see some advance structures andthe ability to change fine details etc.. no doubt someone will try and build a death star. Things like teleport stations so u can set up microbases in distant locations.Jump pads to cross chasms, surveying tools, maybe bots that go out to survey where goodsources of minerals are.Storage boxes are needed.More upgrade trees that allow characters to focus on one aspect. such as enhancing the fps elemnt,enhancing the ""magic"" elements, enhancing the melee elements. This could make boss battlessimilar to MMOs where each class can have a differnt input that complents others.Armour upgrades trees that can favor sotrage, defense, speed, parkour etc..Large muliplayer servers not just private ones (64 player+ ?)More trees etc...Game music etc..More minerals/ore types.Also with a game like this you need some way of keeping people interested. If I build everything why do I keep playing?By defeating bosses can I get new upgrades? Super rare ores to allow new upgrades? Prehaps require minerals/ores for a power source. Have a constant drain on the bae to encouragestocking more / upgrading eficieny.Overall I feel this game has real potential, based on what is already in this build. By buying pre-alpha you put money into something and the reward could be huge.p.s. wrote this article in a notepad editor and my spell check was giving me jip. Expect mistakes.			"

								The graphics and gameplay are amazing especially for an early access game.  The only two problems I have with this game is that there's not a whole lot to build.  Once you build the armory box and generators there's not too much more to build except defense.  The second issue I have is that the game is very repetitive.  Once you get your base built and up and running everyday in the game is pretty much the same.  That being said I understand the game is still being developed and I can't wait to see the new additions the dev's put into the game...			"

What I like most of the game ist alle the Stuff you can do its feels like an nice mixture of an Survival-RPG-Egoshooter-Portal Game with a hell lot of particel effects. The look and feel is amazing and i can highly recommend the game.The only bad part about it is that when you played it for about 12 hours there is absolutly nothing new to discover.The following recommandations for the great team behind this game.PLS let us upgrade the eden kit even further. I need so much more slots for Turrets. how about some hard wired points for upgrading the denen kit like if you hit lvl 5 shield upgrade you can develop the base into a new state wich also looks different?

								Just bought this game on a whim. I have to say, I am impressed greatly with the game. The biggest problem with games of this type is the fact that they don't run well. Thankfully that doesn't seem to be the case here. Eden Star is really stable as far as early access games go. However, it is far from perfect. My major gripe is that the game is simply TOO DARK. Even in daylight, I find it difficult to navigate without the flashlight on at all times. I do love where the game is going, and hope that the devs keep up the good work.			"

								Eden Star Offers a brand new expericence into surviving as you step out of your drop pod to find yourself in a uncolonized world where your job is to colonize it, one step at a time. you only have 20 mins to get everything ready and when night hits, it gets pretty tough when enemies start bogging you down, and that is where the core gameplay mechanics shine. Right now its early access, but the developers are constantly communicating with the players, and that where Eden Star  starts to get better and better every week. They always listen to the player suggestions and consider thier ideas' and implement those suggestions into development and try to see where it goes from there. if it makes it, great! if not, well at least they listened.

								Based off of the time I've played and experience.The game looks amazing.  It's very smooth and seems bug free for an early access.  I don't like how there's a 20 minute timer for you to build a base and protect yourself from attackers.  It's  agreat idea but 45 minutes sounds a bit better or even 40 minutes.  The reason why I say this is because resource required to build stuff is very very high compared to most survival games.  It's not just one resource you need to gather but two different kind.  The experimental fixed the rocks.  Before that, there were never any rocks to gather.  Luckily, there is plenty to go around.  Again, the resource needed to gather and build is too high.  Needs to be lowered.  Overall the game plays really well.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer is dead.  Not sure who the Devs are making this game for.  The 8-10 people that play it? I hate games that are multiplayer with no player base.  In all honesty.  There are way too many survival games and everyone is spread out.  Will this game get a huge fan base?  Not really.  The worse survival game has most of the fan base and that's ARK.  Blows my mind why people think that game is good.  If you ask me, Eden Star is better than ARK.  Eden Star is worth a try.  Don't expect to play with others since nobody is around in multiplayer.			"

								This game, in a nutshell, in my opinion, is great.But, It has it one problem I find EVERY game this year has. The inability to disable grass. MANY people have FPS problems due to this simple little thing, adding up to take every frame you have and esentually throw it into the garbage.There is ALOT of grass, and it ends up bogging down the frame rate alot. I understand that alot of people don't mind it, and infact there are some that prefer it. But there are people like my self, that would be able to run the game so much better if we were simply able to click a box that says ""Disable/Reduce grass"".I may not how much time put into this game thusfar, but I can say for certan, this game will only get better than it already is.

								o3o First thought, was it worth the 20$... I wander around the world for a bit, make my base. Everything is all calm and im making a seemingly invincible fortress. First few days, nothing attacks so i figured maybe i was just too far from the hives. Nope. Eventually they started coming in huge swarms outta no where and the turrets held them off pretty well and my base was pretty well armored. Then I right clicked while looking at one and noticed the flinging stuff wasnt just for the trailer. You can literally pick up one and throw it around and do whatever you want. Throw it sky high then slam it down into a crowd of enemies, grab one and slam it into another and watch them explode, or just grab one and slam it into trees and rocks until its dead. 11/10 slamming bugs all night. So worth 20$ and totally can't wait for new stuff. :D			"

								Excellent Graphics brilliant gameplay  ------BUTturrets need an update constantly shooting dead enemys is really annoying.so i set up enough turrets to deal with any problems with my help BUT a hive is able to spawn directly next to my Eden kit :(NOT COOL!!!also the kinetic ability is awesome and really adds to this games fun factor BUT would love to be able to throw enemy straight back aswell the pulse just doesnt cut it XD Possibly add the ability to upgrade your suit to include an upgradable jet pack that you have to build to jump to floating islands or get to those hard to reach places ;) In short Love the game it really is a game that i enjoy i even convinced my friends to buy it (we are hoping that you do progress to multiplayer!!!)  I will update on any more bugs or fixes i think need development besides the obvious like being able to repair structures building a tower with a turret if your bottom block is destroyed the entire tower is destroyed :( ANYWAYS BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!

								Let Me Get This Out Before You Purchase This Game. This Is NOT A Sandbox Game. This Is A Wave Tower Defender Type Game With Crafting And Rescources. Now This Does Not Mean its A Bad Game But it Does Mean I Did Not Recieve The Game I Thought I Was Buying. Here Are My Cons And Pros Of This Game.Cons:-The World Is The Same Every TIme. Thats RIght There Is No Randomly Generated Or Select A Premade World, Its The Exact Same Thing Everytime. It Gets Boring Ater 3 Times of Play or So.-The World Is Not Big. It Will Take About 10-20 Minutes To Explore The Entire World In This Game. 10 Minutes If You Run Fastly Around And 20 If You Take Everything In And Just Laze Around. Too Me This is The BIGGEST Dissapointment. Because Its The Same Exact World Everytime This Is Just A Major Letdown. Its A Rather Small World And Is Amazingly Annoying That You Can Die By Falling Off The World.-The Game Decievingly Looks Finished. This game Is FAR From Finished. Its Visuals Are There, Its Main Game Mechanic Is There, But Everything Else Is Not.-This Game Is Not Worth 20 Dollars. Do Not Buy This Game At All Unless You Want To Support The Game Itself, 15 Would Be The Best price But 20 Just Feelse Like A Lot For A Small World That is The Same Everytime. Of Course This Will be Changed In The Future, But For Now Just Hold Off Until it Lowers, Or Is Expanded.Pros:-Unique Gameplay. This is An Amazingly Unique Game. Very Fun And Amazing-VISUALS. OH MY GOD. Where Do i Start?! The Visuals Are AMAZING, When You Destroy The Root Of A Tree And It Falls, Or When You Suck The Rescourses Out Of A Rock, it Looks great! The Pieces Fly At You, And Absorb Into Your Suit! It Looks Amazing! And So Does Climbing And The Enviroment!-The Wave Defense is Great! I Really Enjoyed It! It Was Very Challenging And Fun! If You Like Wave based Defense Games I Would Totally Purchase this now!Overall Eden Star Has Good Pros And Bad Cons. But In The End I Would Hold Off Unless You love Wave TowerDefense Games! Good Luck Fighting Off the Alien Invaders ;)			"

								Sci-Fi Minecraft, which is great, and if the problems I am going to mention are eliminate, then this is a must have, but so far I think its a neutral with great potential. Mind you this is still in early access, so I can forgive the devs for some of the problems.The game features a pre designed world with multiple biomes fill with neutral and aggressive creatures. You need to build a base to survive the night, because during night, the atmosphere turns toxic and you are only protected from the toxicitity by your base. During day time you can gather materials and use it to build floors and walls, defence turrents, generators, or use it to craft upgrades, weapons, and ammo. The world is huge, but generic, which is disappointing, but never the less, still great.There are some crucial problems though - motion sickness. For a survival base-building game, it is a killer problem to have motion sickness, and although motion sickness may not apply to everyone, from my experience, it hurts my brain. In a survival base-building game, you expect players to grind and run all around the place for a long duration, and so motion sickness will accumulate and just hurt the player physically, which is just terrible. A suggestion from me will be adjust the audio, and also make sure when gathering materials, the debris don't fly into the camera. Soften the colorful effects for material gathering, the bright color flashing around hurts the eye.Pros:-Great survival building game, challenging, but not too punishing-Like Minecraft, has great potential in the building aspect-More combat than Minecraft-Turrets :)-Still just Early Access, and already amazing-Decent graphicsCons:-Minor bugs-Generic environment-Motion sickness (for me at least)-Expensive?-Would be better to have materials scattered after death, rather than have the player lose all their materials. The Minecraft approach would be nice hereOverall:Give it a go if you have the bucks, keep an eye on this bad♥♥♥♥♥though, can be the next big thing :)			"

								Even though I do not have lots of hours in this game yet I can say it has come on a long way since the last major release. I really like the new custom config options from how long days are to how many times creatures spawn etc. This to me makes the game, as you are then able to make the game how you like. For example I have it set so I dont get so thirsty and hungry as it is by default.If you are thinking about this game or Osirus which are to me presonally the same type of game I would get this one for now. After having played Osirus and its fixed buildings and some strange mechanics I think it has potential but needs time to mature. Eden star however has had this time to mature and get a lot of the things ironed out and hopefully will only get better.I have not played this in multiplayer so I am not able to comment what it is like or what the community is like but single player if you like to build, Bash, mine and kill things then this is a good game for that.

								The first two hours left me with this: MY GOODNESS THE COMBAT IS GODLY I LOVE BEING ABLE TO THROW MY ENEMIES AGAINST THE FLOOR AND THEN THE MOUNTAIN AND BACK TO THE GROUND THEN SEND THEM TO HEAVEN! I LOVE IT! *Squee* However, I noticed, as the end of the nightfall timer counts down, I get OVERWHELMED with THOUSANDS of the crawling burrowing crab creatures. (Don't know the names of them.) I can't count how many times I've died on the first day because of this, and I can't retreat to my ""base"" because they just break thru and surround me again. I think a charge-up option in combat to lift up all mobs, within a certain radius, with the kinetic force then throw them in the direction of the mouse would make the hoard of enemies a lot more bareable. Also, there should be tiered upgrades in a kind-of tech tree when you go to upgrade your abilities in the Eden Kit. That way it starts out cheap and gets further more expensive as you get further along. I feel like the current upgrades are too expensive and only can be received when you finally find that rare resource on the exact opposite side of the map! *Heaving and breathing heavily* Annnyyyy way. It's a good game. I like it for it's concept. It could use some optimization I spend a lot of time in 40 FPS and very little time in 60. I know this is already out, repairing the eden kit, but REALLY? the upgrade is still rather expensive bc of how rare some of the ingredients are... :(I like this game's building, but if it takes time to dismantle something it should take time to build it up. Also I hate it when people compare building games to minecraft, I get it, there aren't very many games that are comparable other than minecraft, but minecraft is it's own creature and it's not this game. This game is a beautiful piece of art combat wise that other games like The Witcher 3 and Shadow of Morridor wish they could be.  Graphics wise, I understand that there are limitations at the office in terms of computers when it comes to upgrading the graphics capability in this game, but look to GTA V PLEASE when it comes to the brightness of the game. This game looks like the textures were shaded ahead of time and they look dark sometimes not giving the game that... foreign planet beauty. If at all possible with the unreal engine, please just let the game shade the textures. If anything at all, it needs a brightness sider. I didn't see the gamma slider... nevermind about that, the game is beautiful.NO NVIDIA SHADOWPLAY SUPPORT?PLEASE GET Nvidia to add this to their list of supported games. If that happens five stars, but for right now, all I can give it is four and a half.			"

								10/10, 2 thumbs up, and 5 stars. for being an early access game this is incredible. These guys really have some great potential to create an amazing game. And it already is amazing, i cant wait to see how it continues to develop. I love the gathering and crafting. the combat is smooth and the building is great. All that really need to happen is fill in all the gaps, add more bugs, weapons, materials, buildings, and make a story. All you know is that you walk out of a pod on a strange planet, it would be cool to have a story behind it and a motive to survive. There does need to be more variaty in the bugs (only one so far). mabye some that fly or are super strong. there could be ""brude mothers"" that guard a large hive that spawns bugs. So much could happen that could make this game above and beyond. Again after playing it i am very excited to see where this game goes. But if there are going to be more bugs there has to be a REPAIR feature. That is a must. Also, whenever i build my base near a mountain the bugs spawn on top and just rain down explosives and I cant do a thing about it cause I cant climb up there nor can I see them. So that could use some work. A radar that shows where the bugs are would be very helpfull. Even if you only have the radar when in proximity to your base. Im also having some issues with sound. The only sound I get is when I hurl bugs around, which is my favorite part. There is just something about throwing bugs everywhere that is very satisfying. But other than that its a silent game. That might just be my issue but I thought id mention it. The amount of time between night and day could be lengthened or the ability to upgrade how fast you collect resources. I feel that I dont have enough time to get the resources I need in the time that is provided. Well all in all I would recomend this game to anyone looking for a solid survival gathering building game. If your on the fence just get it, its worth it. I could see this game going for 30$+ as it is so get it while its cheap. Good job Devs, I'll be looking forward to the future updates.			"

								Woooooo Ahhhhhhhhhhhh pew pew pew bzzzzzzz rooooarrr argggghhhh pew pew pew100% buy itOk so I brought this game a few weeks ago and I havent played it much because it is early access - however it is looking like areally impressive game so far and today when i logged in i got totally freaked by the new enemies that have been promised. Graphically the game runs really well although you will need a nice PC to run it. The player controls well and the games crafting tree is very easy to understand so far. The building aspect of the game is also cool and there seems to be little limit as to how big you make your base. It does have afew bugsa obviously and the full SP canpaign isn't there yet but this is deffo going to be one of the big games in the near future as long as the devs don't do a No Man's Lie.......and the devs delivered big time - the recent updates really put this game into whole new league. storyline etc - THIS FEELS LIKE A GAME NOW - awesome job on a great game thats actually come together nicely.

								There is a slight problem with the two-legged land creatures AI (please tell me the name of them, they look like birds kind of, just please tell me what they are so I dont look like an idiot, thanks). They have a tendancy to become statues and stop moving (including idle animations) like they are in a museum (yes, like Night at the Museum). This looks pretty weird because there can be a whole group of them and they could be standing there motionless and be STARING INTO YOUR SOUL (sorry I was being over dramatic but you get the point its weird). Please fix this and if you have any awnsers please head to my thread ""AI problems"" to update me on the problem and if anybody else is experienceing this, thanks. Now seince im writing a review I might as well talk about the game and to sum it up in one word THIS GAME IS GREAT (dang it, four words, I know that attempt at humor was bad but what ever moving on....). This game has alot of potential as a great FPS/sanbox game that has great graphics I mean LOOK AT IT JUST LOOK AT THE FOUNDATIONS ON YOUR BASE, LOOK AT IT, they look beautiful (and no, I dont have an weird attachment with base foundations) but also look at the walls they look stunning and so does everything else. This game has alot of potential but I have a sugestion....VEHICLES (ok Im using to many caps to emphasize my point). Vehicles would be cool and interesting to have such as ships, tanks etc. Anyway this game is great 10/10 ign (no, im not ign and its probobly a 9/10 but you get the point I dont have to explain myself).

								This is Steam's fault I've written more reviews in the last day then I have in afew years. Really it's the products they carry but regaardless when you have found a treasure you want to share the news. This game is a diamond and its NOT at all in the rough. Its the apatity of both Creation and Destruction in one wave of a Hand. Its takes a very minimum amount of time even on a low end rig to get the graphics to perfection. It entertains and test your  brain creativity with every keystroke. Listen heres a deal buy this game at its current price believe me its worth more...not only are you getting a great concept but one thats being updated and improved and expanded on indefinately. If its this good already your only coming out way ahead. Brillient motor fascinating enviroment Beautiful Job.			"

								I wanted to wait till I played a few hours before giving a review but I just wanted to say that for a pre-Alpha release game, this is quite amazing. I won't say anything about the final product since it's no where near done yet. But for where it is at right now it is very well made. It has very few bugs (none that I've encountered), it's smooth and nothing seems too clunky. The other problem right now is that there isn't much going on, but it's much more then I expected. I plays smoother then many of the releases I've played and it is well designed. The gameplay so far, while not anything revolutinoary is well put together. For someone looking for a complete game, this is not for them (it's not even in Alpha yet) but as someone looking to try it out, I would recommend it. I would recommend people to try it out and support the developer, they have very quick feedback and listen well to the community. So far they've done well, but I'll leave the final judgement for the final product.			"

Pioneer Survival Guide - Eden Star v0.2.4 
A Guide for Eden Star :: Destroy - Build - Protect
By: Kittiedragon

			Thank you for viewing this guide. As Eden Star is in Early Access, this guide will serve as the tutorial as it is much easier for us to update it as we progress.		


 for some good information to get started.  Experiment with what you see and keep harvesting plant life to keep your power up!  It's a hoot tossing critters off of cliffs.  Not so much when you miss a jump yourself around those same cliffs.You may have some trouble finding certain materials, but if you explore around in the different biomes, you will get a feel for that odd outcropping being a material that you have not found before.

								After playing for sometime, the game is alot of fun. now you can adjust the world settings when starting a new world I.E. - toggling enemies and fuana - How much damage you take inside and outside the shield dome- how many resources you can get from mining - Whether you starve to death or die of dehydrationSo, this allows players to have more control of if they want a PVE server or a PVP server. I do hope at some point the Developers will allow players to make their own servers. and give us tools to create video content (Might be a stretch but it would be cool) Now of course the game is stil far from finished, and if the map gets bigger which i assume it will, we would need some form of transportation. wheather this be a rover or a V-TOl. Now also it can feel over whelming when you throw down an eden kit as you get attacked by large waves of Bugs. Also you can practically make what ever gun you want now too, so more Pew pews for everyone.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE 8. October 2015: Still gonna give my thumbs up for this game, the new additions (more upgrades, a new biome, heavily improved building UI including new buildings, new enemy AI including perception and improved pathing, new foliage system that improves performance and makes forests more dense) make sense and the game still runs way too smooth for an alpha. No major crashes or freezes on my system, in all of my playtime the game crashed around 7 times through all updates. The development process is as transparent as ever (devs uploading designs and plans for basically everything except lore). My experience has been nothing but positive until now.Multiplayer is soon going to be added too, I am going to further update my review by then.game: 8.5/10 (not too much to do, but it's an alpha dammit), graphics 9/10, potential 17/10------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eden Star is an early-access game with a sci-fi setting. It belongs to the genres of sandbox, ego-shooter and has roleplay elements. So, first off, this game is in a very early early state and most of the gameplay is not implemented, this review is based on the 0.04 pre-alpha update.I can only speak positive of this game so far, the stability is frightening for a game in a this early state, I only encountered 4 crashes so far and the FPS are stable (i7, 760gtx), the game runs on Unreal Engine 4. The graphics are really good, feel well composed and the art-style is appealing(imo).Now let's come to the gameplay aspect: Some upgrades are already in, 3 weapons and basic construction. Most of it feels well implemented, it just seems that the devs know exactly what they want, this is not some project of some unorganized garage-devs(*huh*starforge*huhhuhu*). Shooting is still a bit inaccurate. The cool thing is the power of UE4, resource mining feels really awesome and the world is really immersive. The fighting is based on shooting and using your tools like lifting enemies and samshing them into the ground, all paired with parcours elements and wallrunning.So, EDEN STAR has a lot of potential, but we still have to see how it will become but it definitely has better chances of becoming something. The devs are also very responsive and explain why they implement what.			"

								Think of this game, as Rust, with a futuristic sci-fi twist.Better Graphics, better architecture, More challenging. --Will update as I further explore this game----EDIT--So as far as this game goes it still has allot of work to be done to it.It uses the Unreal Engine and it LOOKS AMAZING, it plays amazing, the parkour system is grand.There really isn't much I can say about it because there's not much to it yet, you build your base, you go out and mine for materials, and you protect your base every night. I believe I've explored most of the island that the game takes place on, there's only 2 types of mobs I've seen so far in my time of play. There is a laser turrest and a missile turret, and in one of their descriptions it says ""Meant for taking down larger threats"", and seeing as how I've only seen 2 of the mobs and with how open the space is. I'm very curious and afraid to find out what exactly a larger mob will be. If you think this game looks nice and sounds nice, and it peeks your interest. Then support this games development so that it can become greater.			"

								Good game and cool setting, with something hard to handle so will cost you some time to get to pass the first few nights.But Still have two ideas for the dev team to think about it.1.Even I tried few times to find a ""safer"" loc to set the kit, at my 5th or 6th night the flying aliens still too many to defend.   If it's a small map TD game like now, the setting is pretty OK.    But you shall give the player another ""minecraft mode"" with fewer aliens inbound in the future, let player have a chance to leave the kit farer to explorer the larger map coming.   Maybe the distance to the hive do have some diffrence to the inbound number, but the gap is too small now.2.you need to improve the turrents AI, just like you need to improve the alien AI.   Or it's meaningless to collect some much ore just for ""an impossible to hold xth night"" for the sandbox game player like me to enjoy it.   Maybe the alien AI is not good enough is why you put in tons of them night by night, but it's not fun in the end.I will still say it's a great game for the pre- stage, and the FPS part is excellent.Hope you can keep on the good job.

								Definitely as a pre-alpha this game offers a lot of content and you will definitely enjoy it until... the game crashes the first... second and third time.There is no auto-safe option, so if you don't save often manually you find yourself frustrated.  It takes some time to get your base where it should be so if you lose it  the 2nd time in a row... what can I say. I will definitely get back to this game in a while... but for the sake of my sanity I need to uninstall it until this is fixed.If I were you I would wait before buying this game. Wait for Alpha or full version... add it to your wish list. Anything but save yourself from pointless swearing at the screen.			"

								For a game in Early Access, you wouldn't normally expect to be able to do much. This game is hugely playable as it is, and the fact that the devs keep adding loads of content and general improvments to it on a regular basis makes it a winner in my book. If that was not enough, consider the amount of time that the dev team spends communicating with it's community - incredible is the right word for that. These devs are not sitting in their ivory tower looking down upon us mere mortals. They *are* us, i.e real people, listening to our views and suggestions, and they're using these imputs to fuel further improvements. It makes me feel like I *own* a real stake in the game, and I should feel that everything in me wants to see it succeed. And it's true, I do.			"

								great start to a good survial game, i did notice that after a while it because kind of boring... kind of... i think if night was a little longer and more enemies came with special bosses that would push you to keep building up your base. and i have a request for you to add a healing turret either aoe or single target heals or eden upgrade to slowly heal everything in your shield. i like the updated textures, i really look forward to this game when its done. idea!! maybe add automated robot to mine not necessary but cool, other idea is a multiplayer mode that has so many people building and so many people as enemy creatures with a extra health and upgrades to be able to keep up builders and hopefully beat the builders. that would be the goal anyways. or a survial mode with a endless night, hordes of enemies after 20 mins or so and special events in the world that would almost completely destroy you base.  and im sure you have some end game content in the works. its fun. you could add bosses during the day and a group of fps players could try and kill it for set resources, and a randomly generated world with hostile enemy bots with there own base. thus adding raiding vs ai.

								This is a very good game with a mix of tower defense (sorta) fps and survival/gather. You begin stranded on a alien planet with nothing but your wits and whats known as a ""Eden Kit"" the eden kit is your spawnpoint and storage point, Protect it at all costs! During the nights aleins come and attack your base. Things start getting hairy during your second night as you pray that your turrets work and you dont run out of pistol ammo. The only thing I feel like that could be improved is the  amount of enemies. The difficulty is fine but I hope that enemies will be spaced out a bit more. If the developers wish the aliens to be hivelike i recommend that they make the base aleins a little weaker as by the third almost everything youve built is destroyed and your cowering behind your half destroyed walls.Overall a great game and I'm looking forward to further updates			"

								One of the more polished games I've seen, let alone a pre-alpha.  I greatly enjoyed the Minecraft Aspects coupled with the physics based combat, reminiscent of Mass Effect.  With a pre-alpha, you usually expect bugs, sometimes major ones, but not here, only a couple small bugs as of when I write this, enemies occasionally shooting through terrain, and once in a while the hand/gun will vanish, but jumping/crouching will fix that, and moving away will get the enemies into sight range, allowing you to smash or shoot them.  Flix Interactive has got something special here, looking forward to seeing where they take it.  9.9/10			"

								Very good game and is much better in multiplayer than singleplayer.(In my oppinion) Very well made, but I would like a third person mode, but that's just a suggestion. Has good graphics, polished gameplay, and you have wall run which I don't really use BUT it is super awesome. It is early access but it seems to good to be there still.			"

								Honestly I would give a neutral thumb if there was such a thing. At the moment, 20 EUR (or $) seems a bit too much, as you get through the content pretty fast. But in general, this game looks very promising. I'm not a big fan of early access but from what I read it seems there are regular updates. I just hope the developers focus on the important stuff and don't start adding random things just to have new content or the community demanded it. Don't get me wrong, it's good if developers work with the community but I think too much focus on what different people say can get out of hand fast and if you look at other, similar games of that genre, some of them didn't got anywhere over years, because they are busy adding random stuff instead of focussing on the main issues, like a story or progress in general. We'll see in which way this game goes but for now, it's the game with the coolest mining ever ;) I want such a glove in real life.			"

								You need this game. There really isn't anything else that can be said you just need to play it even at this stage it is amazing and I cannot stop playing it everyday. I already have a base I don't even need to worry about defending and all the weapons and gear but I can't stop going back to roam the map more and the slamming enemies into trees or over the edge doesn't hurt either.

								Will update later as the updates continue to flow in!One of the rare early access games I have purchased that has continued to impress. Started out as a very basic resource gathering game with minor elements of defense/combat and base building. As the game grows and develops those aspects are being enhanced, if a bit slowly, to become really impressive and well thought out elements of what I consider to be the game I'm most excited about heading into 2017. Hopefully more updates to come with additions to building blocks and craftable tech but all in all a very playable and enjoyable experience thus far.Keep up the good work.			"

								This game perhaps has the most ambitious and gifted development team working on this beautiful, exciting adventure. This game is pre-Alpha but already has solid construction mechanics, awesome UI, and an environment that captures the imagination. With the constant work released, one can watch the growth of this game as each month passes by. With a world of unlimited direction this has the freedom to make its own science fiction adventure.Edit 1 year later:The updates have been steady from the developers, Good show!There is also a new larger multiplayer map that has been released.They only need to start working on content that can extend the play hours. As it stands, the gameplay needs a bit of a boost in long-term engagement. Some of this can be provided through a multiplayer experience, but it still needs more. They remain in early access, yet I look forward to what they will build from here.			"

								Really interesting game. UPDATED TO REFLECT MY OPINION ON THE NEW UPDATE! EDEN STAR is a early access survival game on Steam priced at 19.99 USD.You start off crash landed in a pod-thingy with some interesting things flying down from the sky. Moving on from the boring blah blah blah stuffPROSUpdated to add a small piece of the (soon to come) storyUnique survival gameReally transparent devsConstant updates (updated insanely often)Unique enemies and animalsCool defencesUnique building system I seriously used unique alot... THE ONLY EARLY ACCESS SURVIVAL THAT ACTUALLY GETS UPDATED AND WORKED ON!F*cking awesome graphicsCONSGameplay gets boring overtimeAgain the over used futuristic theme OTHER STUFF Survival game with crafting in it, might want to avoid if you dislike those types of gamesAnd thats about it. 8/10.If you liked my short review, be sure to leave a thumbs up.

								After my first 4 hours of playing Eden Star I come off slightly immpressed. Yes this game is still in its fledgling stages at 0.0.4 so it does lack content. But the core of the game is great. At its current build it lacks purpose as the only objective is to defend the base, there arn't many ""functional"" things you can build yet other that basic shapes, and when you do find the other Eden kits that have landed they dont snap together so building a congealed base is rather difficult but, they got it right, this game when you first turn it on gets it right. The ability to not have to depend on guns or mele for combat is novel and appealing. I really look forward to seeing what this game matures into.P.S. and grabing those little f'in ankle bitters ands slinging them into big♥♥♥♥♥rocks is fun as hell!!!!!!			"

								Although I love this game and me and a group of my friends love to play it. when we play on a PVE we dont expect players who have no house nor do they have anything else but when they spawn in from normal spawns then has guns and stuff. not only that but he seems to have admin like powers in which I do have a recording of. As much as id say to people to play the game on multi player its just not worth the grief when you play a pve server and constantly getting a guy shooting at your building who has everything apart from anything. If devs or actual admins wanna check this guy out hes called lifelike and then when he got told we were recording him then some new guys appeared witht he name arcade doing exactly the same thing coincidence much? but apart from the greifers in the game the asthtetics and the actual game play is great. Will be good when more upgrade get put in and also new gear. good game so far!			"

								Not really into the collect and build type games gave this one a shot cause it did actually look pretty interesting, great game. as it says early access so granted there is hopefully a lot more to come. As most people have said in the reviews with the resource gathering could be improved, the monster spawning is really annoying spawning in the middle of your base even with foundations down (kinda reminded me of starship troopers) is really frustrating considering there is no repair option and to rebuild an eden kit is way too costly considering the effort required in gather its required resources. probably wont be playing the game again until some more updates but definitely look forward to where this is going, I'm not a fan of multi-player games but see this as been very fun in co-op.

Early Access Review
								Starts out gathering resources, Looses base. Figures out I have a way of finding my base, goes out to explore and almost dies. Forgets I have a way to find base, wanders and gets lost, returns to base - night one begins. One enemy... I think this game is to ez pez. Night two, Army of xenos comes and I get rekt. 20/10 epic game, great building system so far and so much potentialUpdated Review 2/28/2016Now-  serious part of the review. (MANY MANY run on sentences)Seeing as, I don't have so many hours in this game - That doesn't make someone bad whatsoever. Eden-Star is that type of game where you arent judged by how good you are in hours put into the game, The game is relativley very easy to pick up, where the hours would only mean how large someones base could possibly be. In four hours, I have achieved most things (Some things i dont like to unlock) - this is not including weapons. This game is very free-to-do on your own basis, as in it has no meta.I'll break it down with some points on how free you are from many things.Combat System - With the combat system, in most games that involve survival, you'd have to use a ""main"" tier of weapon, primarily relying on a gun, or some sort of other system. In Eden-Star, you can obtain the Energy Blade relativley early (Basically a superbuffed version of a wrist baton) ; with the addon of automatic aim for melee, you have the capability of charging air enemies, and in basic, warp jumping and smashing them out of the sky (It's not a one hit kill most of the time). Including, you cant just sweep and expect to kill everything, the melee system is Voxel-Physics based, If i were to hit something they could possibly tumble and slightly damage other enemies around them, the blade slicing from the main enemy into the next one besides it. Not only this, due to the physics/voxel way of the game, you have the capability of shoving things down hills or off cliffs.(A quick note) RMD Modules -Laser hand! Be Iron-man!Use the force to litteraly smash explosive cysts onto your enemies, or smash them into walls, other enemies, throw them in the sky, etc! (Some enemies explode on death, though they have a start up timer to that, you can throw corpses away or into other enemies!)Gauss cannon! Because whatevers in your face is going to die.With guns, The different types of weapons you have in Eden-Star have the capability of using any of them as a main weapon, as they are all realistically powerful; though are able to be played for people with different playstyles, riflemen, bullet spazzing-smg players, or snipers.Building -Since the world is voxel based, If you play Space Engineers you can get a feel for how it all works. Though with that, you can mesh things together (Like in Medieval Engineers) ; If you play Ark Survival Evolved, you may also get this concept. If you place one foundation, you can place walls on all four sides, then on the outer part of those walls, and below into the floor covering the foundation itself (Sometimes you cant, as it runs into voxels which balances it; though for the most part you have very free basis to add even more armor to foundations with this feature). In short, if that confused you, One foundation can hold 12 walls (Which is very cheap) - leaving bases able to be very cheap to create. The game also has a bit of 'structural integrity', platforms only go so far without having a support beam under them (Which can be covered with eight walls on one platform) - as real physics dictates, if that beam breaks, you can be sure whatever ontop of it will go down with it - sadly you wont get the resources from whatever broke. Turrets are automated and for the stages of this game, GREATLY work. They cover a bit of angles, and don't fire directly into your base, or try to fire if somethings inside, breaking your own stuff. Not only this, Since the game is voxel based, you could have turrets wherever you want, they are not limited to platforms, or foundations. You can have half walls out on the fields as well, not limiting it to just platforms/foundations.- The only thing with building is that it can only get a certain extent from your EDEN-Kit (3x3 Square Core you need to protect, loosing this does not end the game) ; This ONLY applies to what i know, solid big mass buildings, you can freely place other foundations/EDEN Kits and whatnot inside/around your EDEN-Kit's bubble (Expandable). Not only this - Buildings, are VERY. VERY. Tough. (Since i use Ironite, very common)			"

								This game has a lot of potential. i I really think it does. Lets start with the pros and consPRO-Great concept-Fun and, some times even challenging-resources are not scarce AT ALL which means that you can freely build almost what ever you want when ever you want-This game is very, VERY beautiful-(just a little thing that i liked) the idea of an arm mounted building/mining tool, and the little beams are a cool add on too-Love the night time. ITS ACTUALLY DARKthats all i can think of off the top of my head with just a few hours of game play.CON-I think that the nigh time should be longer, but i think thats just me-the weapons use ammo very, VERY fast. i would like it if, at least the pistol, the fire rate was decreased and the damage buffed. and the things to make the ammo either more rare or you need more to make them. this way the ammo doesnt go by fast. Which is a good thing for us trigger happy people-maybe lower the sprint speed or maybe in a future update make it so you get winded (and take fall damage) so you cant just go across the land very, very fast-day night cycle is kinda short-right now, there is no multiplayer and i think that would be a nice additionAnd again, thats all i can think of with a few hours under my beltThis game really has potential and i think that the devs should keep up the hard work.

								TRUE STORY:I awoke on a magical planet with floating rocks (very similar to Pandora from the Avatar movie with the blue cat people) and met a strange green deer-like alien that didnt like me very much. I named him Jeffry and proceded to chace him through a glowing alien forest even though he clearly wanted nothing to do with me. I finally got close and wondered if i could pet the pretty green deer. I right-clicked my mouse and to my suprise i captured Jeffry in a glowing blue trance. In my excitement i frantically jerked my mouse to the right, BUT I did not expect what happened next. My mouse jerk caused an animation to play where i aggressively flung Jeffry against a nearby tree, knocking down the tree and turning Jeffry into a pile of meat reffered to as a ""morsel"". I sat there with my mouth hanging open. I was not sure whether to cry or laugh. I have never felt so disturbed and yet, sadistically intrigued at the same time. I cleared my throat, and with an evil twinkle in my eye, I right-clicked the next unfortunate animal within my line of sight.       -10/10 would fling random innocent creatures into trees again.PS. This product was recieved on SALE not for free. I checked the wrong box :3			"

								An Example of Early Access done right. The base game is relatively stable and above all fun to play- a Mine Craft Mass Effect Cross. Basic enemies at the moment and a tutorial could come in handy for people who need there hands held by a game, but the real kicker in making this a recommendation -The comunity and the developers. They give Monthly updates, release updates that actualy have things in them, and above all seem to listen to the comunity that brought the game. A model that every other Developer that releases a game on EA with some pretty concept art and then proceeds to have tantrums on forums about ""Trolls"" who would just like to know where the development is at. Well played Flix interactive, well played.Have fun Pioneers.			"

								For the fews hours i played. This game is a gem in the making.. I went into this game blind, meaning i read no manuel...I died  7 times with in those times, i learn to toss/throw creatures into walls,water,off of cliffs,into trees,rocks,buildings etc,etc..Dam that chit is fun. Whats nice is how you kill the creatures in this game. Either with your hand tools/Guns..Why cut trees with saw/axe?When you have the power in your hands!Same with rocks, metal or anything that this game allows you to break down..I have not yet tried Multiplayer, should be cool to see your friend or enemy fly(PVP)...lol So far the game has its lttle EA Flaws. The first is your loading time.I hope they fixed it in the up coming patch. Also you need a good graphic card, my fans are running like crazy when i run this game and i have AMD R-9 380. Hope they can tune things up on this game. Other than what i played. That is all i found for now.. The game is good it is in EA and it is a Gem in the making..			"

Early Access Review
								I have not played much yet, because I mostly went sandbox mode so I wouldn't get myself killed instantly. Some reviews here complain about the intro, but if you read the discussion forum you learn to switch to the experimental branch and to disable enemy spawn completely. Heck you can even turn damage off entirely, have not seen this many options in terms of AI in a game, means you can suit it exactly to your playstyle. Not to mention being able to change that on the fly while ingame.The game is very pretty and at that still runs quite well. My system of 5 years with an i7 990X and SLI GTX 780 cards had no issues running it at 60fps. So any new i5 and 900 to 1000 series cards will run it just fine.In terms of mechanics the whole pickup/mining takes a bit getting used to, but it is a nice change to pounding rocks with a pickaxe. I can only hope for future updates making resource gathering even easier and maybe automated too. Vehicles would probably also make a nice addition here, trying to get around the large game world can take some time, which is not a negative if you think about it.The base-building system, similar to the mining, takes a bit getting used to get things right where you want them, but it works and once you complete a large base I am sure it will look pretty cool.The fact multiplayer is already built in and continues to be improved is good to see, most games tend to neglect that part. I have not been able to test that yet, because it lacks a linux server version and somebody to play with :)Overall I can recommend this game, I played another space survival game the other day and had to refund that, cringed too hard at the mechanics, this was a refreshingly well made Early Access title and I can definitely see this beating some recently released AAA titles. For the price it already provided a nicer experience than what I have recently played in terms of space survival.			"

								I personally love this game. Sure, it runs like S h i t when I'm not looking at the sky or ground on my laptop (which runs games like WoW at 100+ FPS), but thats the only REAL flaw I can find in this game so far. There's armor that gives different bonuses so you can decide what to go for (I.E. Raw defense, shield, more sprint time/stamina, or a mix of all 3 and more). I can't wait for the ability to find blueprints to make other guns, the shotgun got old after a while. Know what doesn't get old? Sending those little crab ♥♥♥♥♥ 30 feet into the air, yelling ""Pull!"" before doing so, and then shooting them on their way down. Love it. This game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of potential, I can tell it won't be wasted. It's very Mass Effect gone Survival, and thats absolutely amazing. The fact climbing over ledges is actual vaulting is a very nice touch.			"

								The engine is nicely done.  Periodic complete halts in movement for a few seconds here and there.  RIght now, it would be nice to see more game balance.  It's insanely hard to jump in and get what you need to fight off the insect hoards.  Going after a hive is suicide but you need those mineral resources.  It just needs a better ramp up.  Something with a little finesse.  Also, using the, I don't know what you call it...the builder I guess... to grab the bad guys and throw them around, it seems to have very little effect.  I can literally throw them THROUGH a tree trunk DESTROYING the tree and they are only injured.  Einstein is displeased with that physics emulation.  Anyway, it's Alpha and It does look really interesting.  I'll come back in a year to see how things have shaped up.			"

								Ah, Eden Star, the space-age creation game that took a little too much from Rust, and not enough from Minecraft. The goal is simple, protect your world-saving egg thing until you die, which is inevitable, but you can have fun getting there. There are two major things to worry about in ES, first, the spiney crawler drone things that seem to burst from nowhere at every point in the game and try to do horrible, unholy things to you. The second main thing to worry about is falling, and while there seems to be no apparent fall damage, you do however take a minor, itty-bitty, bite sized fatality from falling off the edge. Oh, did I forget to mention the edge? Yes, yes of course I did, as I so dutifully lacked at mentioning, the setting is also placed in an Avatar like sky dimension. And no, unlike avatar, there is no way to get down to the joyful, barbaric blue-monkey people waiting for you down below. In fact, on the note of down below, there also seems to be NO down below, and absolutely no way to get to this nowhere. So, enjoy 20$ of sky-running and trying not to get molested by small insect-like buggers that are keen on literally coming out of every known terrestrial orifice known to man. All in all, a great game. Impossible, but fun to play. Unless you're me. Then, in your attempt to pull off a sweet parkour jump trick, you literally die before the tutorial even kicks in.This was meant to be funny....			"

								Hello everyone,This being my first SERIOUS review, the other one being entirely about goats,i'm just going to make a pros and cons list.-Pros-1. MIND SHATTERING graphics, the developers really did a good job on them.2. Smashing splintermites into rocks is fun ;)3. I really like that you start out with a melee weapon, in other games such as: subnautica, minecraft, etc you don't start out with a weapon, that makes it a lot harder to survive the first night.4. I like the challenge it gives you when a nest spawns next to your house, a splinter destroys a part of your home, etc.5. VERY good devs, they are constantly working on games, have never abandoned a game (To my knowledge), and reply to any forum posts they can find that are asking for help.6. A very low violence FPS, well, it's violent i mean it's an FPS, but barely any blood, gore, and things like that.7. Multiplayer!!!-Cons-1. It takes a LOT of hard drive space, 10 GIGABYTES! (that's a lot, and this is CURRENT development. (march 2016))2. Parents may not approve of the guns, but i guess thats just me, my parents dont like guns '_'3. I STILL CANT SET UP A DEDICATED SERVER!!!4. I cant think of any more cons. (Yes that is a con)5. I wrote a review about goats. (No that is not a con)I like goats.Yep, i have nothing else.And thus was the end of Kingscorpion20.         RIP KINGSCORPION20 DIED OF NO MORE CONS.P.S. this game too perfect for me.P.P.S.

								Revue faite uniquement sur une partie SOLO.Eden Star est un jeu SUPERBE, avec un système de minage original, qui peut aussi servir à fracasser tout ce qui bouge.Le Craft est aussi très bien fait. Tous les paramètres de la partie sont réglables, du plus facile à l'extrême et la carte est quand même assez grande et bien remplie. Il y a même des bases déjà construites qu'on pourra cannibaliser ou carrément conquérir.MALHEUREUSEMENT ça ne cache pas un gros défaut : le manque de contenu. Pas de grenades, très peu d'armes, malgré un système de construction très prometteur.On fait vite le tour des aliens. On regrette la disparition du compagnon dès le début. Et l'absence d'IA hostile. Ou de BOT.Il n'y a pas de véhicule, ni même de tourelle manuelle.Pas non plus d'histoire, alors qu'il y a tout le potentiel. Bref une fois que la base est faite, il s'agit juste d'attendre la nuit pour buter de l'alien.Reste à tester le multi.Alors pour une pré alpha c'est quand même génial, mais elle dure depuis longtemps.... très longtemps.

								It seems like im spending all day mining for materials to build turrets and ammo and then im spending all night losing them. the turrets focus on the little creep things until they have dissapeared which is like 10 seconds after they die so more creeps just walk past the turrets. There needs to be a way to actually defend your base. By the 3rd night there are too many creeps to actually defend against. if they get too close they just blow up and then you've lost everything you just spent 3 days building and mining for. I had a raised box set upwith 8 turrets. Should be easy to defend, in fact it should defend itself, the creeps would walk up and stand just outside the turret range and then burrow right up next to the turrets and blow up, lost it all in one night. Please fix the turrets or nerf the creeps. i would not recommend until the game is actually playable. Also it would be nice if you could repair your structures, if you put turrets on a cube and then the cube is gone then you lose ALL turrets on that cube. Once the game is playable past night 4 or 5 i would highly recommend.			"

								Not worth the $20 I paid for the existing content.For $5, sure, its not a bad early access, but as it is there isnt near enough for me to feel like I didnt just waste my money.Maybe over the next year it will earn its price tag.What they have so far is in some ways solid. The graphics are decent enough and the effects look nice. Combat feels right. Traversing the landscape is fast and fun without the worries of many survival games such as eating, stamina, or realistic fall damage. The first thing I noticed that felt incomplete was a general lack of sound. No music, very little movement sound effects, and this crazy glowing thing on your hand that rips trees down and pulls boulders apart makes almost no sound at all. You only only hear the actual target getting shredded. Speaking of the harvesting/collecting, at its core it is fun. You can take out the bottom of a tree and watch it fall in various ways with nice physics and such.I know this is early access, so missing sounds and the only 2 extremely generic enemies I saw is understandable, but once you get the hang of the build system (took me about 20 minutes) you are just gathering, building a base with very limited options, watching/helping your turrets kill the 2 bad guy types, then rinse and repeat. The difficulty ramps up each night as you improve your base. You can save and try different approaces to getting through a night, and you can respawn if you have a certain ore on your base gained by destroying enemy nests. Die without any ore, game over, reload last save.I got base built up and had about all the fun there was to have in about 3 hours, and I can't say that fun was real exciting or special. This is another early access where I would wait and see whet the devs have in store for it instead of paying too much for a general draft of the game's basics. I do see potential though.			"

								The concept of the game is good, but older hardware may struggle a little. It's not very forgiving early on due to the lifeforms on the planet take offense to your presence pretty damn quickly.That being said, there was an issue when trying to get a refund which has since been rectified thanks to the devs.Btw, Najeeb likes to suck my toes.

								I'd recommend this game to someone who has time to play this game its in alpha but has huge potential, considering how their is no real story yet you can clearly see a story forming from the second video to the way our character is dress as if he is not from this planet he fights at night builds what looks like a space station type building. i love how far this game has come I've own it for little under a year i may not have many hours but i plan on have a bunch more. I would like to see a way to travel and for more crafting at the moment i feel all i do is build a base make great strong and amazing guns then defenses but really what after you get everything i guess you could go raiding id really like something more i cant really put my finger on what it could use.

								Eden Star has potential and will be a great game when its complete, but not yet.  I've only spent 4 hrs in the game, however, this was really all the time I needed to master it :/  The game is really limited and really repetitive at this stage and map is not randomly generated each time. The engine and graphics are solid and I cant fault them, but just the content for asking price is shocking.  If you want to build stuff in space and shoot at things go and play space engineers in an online lobby.Verdict:  Keep it on a wishlist and hold on to your cash for now.			"

								While this game is polished (it's very pretty and quite polished) there's just not a lot to it. Once you have followed the prompting of the game and put down your base and built some defences... there's just nothing else to do. You could build some of the additional tech, or expand your base, but there's no reason to. The base building isn't very interesting (there's no decorations, not even any lighting), and exploring is interesting except that you have to get back to your base every night (with a pretty short time to be outdoors).Will re-visit once the devs add more for the player to do.

I can't say all the things on how good this game really is! There is so much to do, secrets in the game, building, creating a eden base, and even killing hostile monsters that are trying to destroy your base! I'm happy to support this game to the fullest I never had so much fun in a game as much as I did now. The game is a mix between Dead Space, and Minecraft. It is just amazing. If you have a extra $20.00 laying around I would buy this trust me! And the graphics are splended. :)If you are not sure about this game watch some Youtube video's of let's play!			"

								Collect resourcers and build during the day, defend or go hunting at night. It takes a few mins load a saved game.Not much enemy content and so far the game is easy. No real threats. You can escape all combat and/or pick up and throw nearly any enemy. Resources are abundant so you don't have to worry about food and water. Lots to explore with no real danger. Only time I died was when I grabbed a flying plant looking creature out of the air, threw him to the ground next to me which casued him to explode which perpelled me off a mountain. Has great potential. Since I like collecting resources and building. I'll come back every week to see if content changes and update my review accordingly.			"

								I would have rather selected ""maybe"" as an option as to whether or not I would recommend this game. I've only played it for a few minutes but my first impressions leave me a little dissatisfied with some of the design choices. My main gripe is with the performance, which is very poor at high resolutions even with other settings set to low. The performance increases significantly with lower resolutions which I find odd for a modern game. Even when you do run at a high resolution it feels like it's in a lower resolution, like when you're watching a low resolution video and scale it up to full.The graphics are pretty good but it feels like your graphics card isn't getting what it's paying for. In truth, the game really feels like what it's supposed to be at this stage; early alpha. A lot of optimization needs to be added to make it playable on low to mid-range machines. I'm sure I'll enjoy it once a few more months worth of patches make their way in but it's going to be sitting untouched in my library for a while. I just hope it doesn't go the way of so many other early access games and have a bandaid slapped on it for a full release. But I've been watching it for a few months and there's been regular updates so I'm optimistic. At this stage I'm not recommending Eden Star unless you just want to help support the developers while they work on it which is fine.			"

Early Access Review
								7/10 for this EA Survival game [multiplayer, coop & single-player].Against the back-drop of several half-baked Early Access Survival games that aren't worth the asking price (except Dont Starve, Ark and Wurm Unlimited), this game certainly has a very unique and fresh spin on the genre, and it is very very actively supported by the devs, while it runs very smoothly.So, It feels to me like an open-world sci-fi survival game with a uniqe environmental tower-defence element to it.  Like Don't Starve, you take advantage of the day cycle to mine, scrounge, explore for resources, and build and adventure.  While at night, you defend your expanding base in a hostile environment that is also toxic at night, being a key component to the survival element.There is quite a ways to go with the content (redundancy of game-play and lack of wiki-game play development) , but having passed on other survival games, I have read, watched and feel this one is something special; at least can be more-so as necessary content is added.Again, my biggest con, which is understandable is content needs to be pushed into the game so it has more to offer than just repetitive building and base improving, such as more to explore, travel and value in defeating mobs.  For example, I just logged because of lack of wiki content while looking for material information that provides info on game-play content & mechanics was just irritating me too much.			"

I recommend waiting until there's a major update, adding a ton more content, but until then i just can't recommend it.			"

So far there is only one creature type that I have seen in the world.  I built my base on top of a cliff that I had to climb up.  As long as your eden kit is out of reach of the critters, there is really no rush to build a base.  Getting materials is definitely a long boring grind.  There isn't much interesting content yet; however, I am very excited to see this development continue.			"

Early Access Review
								A bare bones and flawed game on a solid concept and design foundation. I've only spent on hour in the game so far on the day of initial E.A. release.  The controls are great as are the graphics.  But, right now, it doesn't really feel like a game per se.  You have about 6 minutes of daylight to run around and zap trees and rocks, then about 6 minutes of night to zap bugs.  The bugs seem to just warp in under my feet as well.  The daytime doesn't seem to be long enough to really dig into any kind of building or exploring and nighttime is a tower defense mini game.Some suggestions to what's currently in game (not additional features):Harvesting trees makes visual sense.  I can see the tree fall and break into pieces.  And they take a comfortable amount of time to do so.  Harvesting rocks is a visual mess and takes far longer.  Perhaps tightening up the visual clues of what's left in a rock to harvest or something to clue me into the progress would be helpful.  Also, since I only have abou 6 solid minutes of daylight, spending 2 of them on a rock is extremely limiting.The bug alien critters seem to just pop out of nowhere.  I'm not sure if that's a bug (no pun intended) or that's how they work.  It was odd to be turning around looking for these things and they just pop in under my feet.  Perhaps if they originated from their little dens or mounds and skittered toward me.They day/night cycle time is very rushed.  Right now, I feel like the game can't decide if it wants to be a exploration/construction game or a tower defense.  It has aspects of both, but they are hampered.  And one major way is the short time windows.  Let me explore and harvest a little longer and actually have some time to build something and maybe have some kind of build up at night, the pacing and number of bugs attacking increases or comes in waves instead of the static two pop in at a time in exact intervals.Overall, I think the presentation of the game is solid.  The help pop ups are clear and understandable.  The graphics are nice and the art direction has its own identity.  I think there's more foundation in this game than many E.A. games in terms of setting, design, and concept.  It certainly has a long way to go, and I'm excited to follow it as it develops.			"

								Compared to so many games... it certainly has potential but it is very shallow in the end, a few walls, a ceiling and flooring, a few turrets and a few buildings, map is small enough to walk around the whole thing in 10 minutes. IF it just had more content, its a decent game with a fun concept that i feel has yet to be fully realized by any game quite yet.This is one of those, is it really worth the money? .... It depends on how much you like these types of games, it was entertaining for an hour			"

								Performs horribly on my decently geared PC. Tried trouble shooting and reading tweak recommendations on all of the forums and just can't get it to run higher than 10 frames a second making it pretty darn unplayable. It is in pre-release though and it shows a lot of promise. I love the concept and even the resource gathering\crafting system and mechanics of construction are very cool. It just needs a great deal of optimisation done. I suppose it could be an issue with the Unreal 4 Engine, but everything else using Unreal 4 engine runs beautifully on the same PC. I don't get it. I'll check back closer to release and hope things have been improved. As of now, I cannot recommend this game... mostly because I can barely play it.			"

								This is one of thee most lagfilled games I've ever played.  If you want this game don't expect the multiplayer to work. I joined a server that reported 43ms  and rubberbands like crazy!  this game is in it's very infant stages, not even worth the price tag at the discount.  You've a $3 game at best right now.			"

								No, looks fun and sounds like something I would enjoy but. Not worth the price. Dull game play. More complicated than it should be. Crafting is terrible. Normally in these games you can set down what you want to build and then collect the resources you need. I ran out of room to collect resources but couldnt build anything yet.  I don't even understand the creatures on this alien world. Some of them are robots? Combat is dull. Can't host your own games yet. Just no from me.			"

								At the moment ..... it is a Survival game.... takes a second to get used to the controls... but i did find a lack of resources before nightfall..... if they incorperated nightfall a little better instead of getting only 32 bullets and w flinging/slam ability that uses energy.... i would be happier, but for those looking for multiplayer i dont see that happening yet.... it still has a ton of tweaks before hand.July2015 revised reviewSo i came back to the game and amazinglyit has been fixed in a toooooooon of areas since i wrote the last review. there are more creatures to deal with yes... but its not like they swarm you like they did back in february and march...lol... never the less, i found that the mechanics are still on point and it is cool... i just wish i could feel more or less like a true multiplayer survival ...or at least incorperate it ..... for example... i drop in the world ... and then there are a few more people that have managed to make it with me ..... i buil;d we fight at night defending what we can ....so on and so forth.... just an idea.... but this game is definitely a really beautiful and captivating game that people should try.

								""Fast paced"" indeed. At this point it is of course an early access game, but it actually takes longer to reload a game than it does to die. I kind of need some compelling reason to want to hang on through the extra-extra-long loading times to make me want to play. And it's just not there yet. I like the concept but the execution is way, way too early in the development stage to justify actually releasing this. If you are curious suggest waiting until they are farther down the road. Otherwise, I hope you have some constructive things to do while your screen presents the word ""Loading"" to you.  "

								Great concept but not a very good game. I've had this game for a while and I see updates come out all the time but every time I go back on every 2 or 3 months NOTHING CHANGED and I still always have the same problem, it won't even let you exit out of the freaking build screen to walk around. Also the graphics are very bad and it lags all the time, not smooth movement at all but that may just be my computer i don't know.If this game becomes more polished with a better tutorial (because its very ""hey ur on a weird planet HAVE FUN"") and a little more to it then it can be a very good game.Lots of potential, just not seeing it yet.

								The game seems interesting enough but it's hard to get into something when you die 10 seconds from loading.  That wouldn't even be so much of an issue if it didn't take 3-5 minutes to reload and then another 2-3 minutes to get through the revive cut-scene.   Almost 0 tutorial and you're kinda left fending for yourself and hoping youcan figure out what to do.  About 3o minutes in and I'm frustrated.  I might have to Google-fu it to figure out how to live past the first 10 minutes.  I like the chllenge of the game but there has to be some reward to the risk. Improve loading times there is NO REASON it should take so long with a new gaming rig.			"

								It's pretty but thats about all it has going for it. The game takes ages to load anything, even changing menu options can make it lock up for a minute while it tries to change. It also has a ""tutorial"" that consists of dropping you in the middle of the zerg swarm and expecting you to learn how to play while being eaten alive from enemies coming at you from all sides.I picked this up after seeing a few videos of it, and it's pretty clear the new updates have caused it to regress immensely, the game looked way better before, and right now feels incredibly restricted and limited. Crafting a base is boring and tedious with the limited materials you can make, and half your game time is spent cowering in your hovel hoping your turrets hold out until daylight since the player weapons are laughably weak and your health pool is abysmal.If you are really, really REALLY into survival/builder games and like sci-fi settings you may enjoy this, but I'd say pass it for now.

								In its current state as of 9/2/15. It's in an Early Access state where it really isn't a game yet. It's just a collection of mechanics with no point or purpose.Pros:It's pretty.The UDK snapping meshes work well when building.No bugs/crashes while I was playing.Cons:No real purpose (Not even for a sandbox explore/craft/gather type game)Gathering materials consists of mindlesly 'shooting' rocks with your Miroku like Wind Tunnel making sure you suck up the shards that fly everywhere.Crafting menu looks pretty light stillTutorial missingMost of the standard EA gripes you should understand before buying an EA game.Yes, I know it's an EA game. This is an EA review of it in its current state. I'm not saying it wont evolve or add the currently missing features. The main reason I don't really want to give it more time is the mindless harvesting and lack of purpose. The game doesn't make me want to live in it like say, Ark, another EA game.			"

Early Access Review
								i played this over the xmas period and whilst i think it is a incredibly well polished game that is lacking in bugs,  the game as it stands right now is not worth the pricetag being asked. The game world is quite small with only a small number of different enemies. To put it bluntly there currently isnt enough to do (at the moment) With patches and time i guess this game could become a lot better. But if a games developer is going to ask £14.99 for a open world game they had better be delivering the same sort of content that other open world games like ark survival evolved does because this is the same sort of price as ark survival evolved (when its on sale) also when comparing this title to rust , 7 days to die and hurtworld ALL those games have lots more content and filler gameplay wise for the same sort of price being asked or less. So as a customer you have to ask the question's Will this game eventually deliver what it promises ? Will the devs provide constant updates and will the content roll out be fast or slow ? Will development continue ? or will this game fizzle out ? Only two official North American servers at the moment worldwide ? worrying or not ? If you want to roll the dice and chance it that the devs are going to eventually deliver with this game and play in a barren gameworld for a few hours with what is currently in game , which isnt a lot. Then pay your money. I myself would suggest fellow possible purchasers to delay pulling the trigger on this right now and either wait for a hell of a lot of new content / patches to see if this is heading in the right direction or wait for a lower sale price. I personally dont understand why people are being asked to pay premium price for a quarter of a game ? But then i am a old school gamer and i have been burnt to many times by EA to want to roll the dice when i spend my hard earnt cash. To conclude good game > but right now realise youre buying into a game / idea that hopefully delivers what its promising.  Look at the other reviewers gameplay played time. You dont have to take my word for it those figures should tell you all you need to know regarding how much content is currently available.			"

								Like most of the negative reviews, it is lacking in content, although they will make an update to try and fix that, i feel that you should wait until it is in alpha atleast. and they have to fix the resource cost/management, why do i have to find rocks placed in the enviroment, that gives different kind of minerals, but i cant combine them, if i want to build a turret which i definetly need to survive the night. i have to collect 40 units of one mineral... doesn't matter if i have 20 units of mineral A, 34 in B, and 10 in C. I can only make a turret comprised solemly out of one mineral, but not by combining mineral A, B and C. Which is not that clever, or at least make it so that you could build them of tree fibres. They need to better their tutorial, and please set the player in a context atleast. Didn't make it further than the first night, after i died two times and both of them was because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cost of the buildingmaterials, runnin' around for 20 min and trying to find rocks, found two, was  not nearly enough for A turret. I had 40 units if you combined them, but only about ten of each mineral.			"

								I don't like how it takes forever to get the resources to build blocks. I was expecting more freedom to build. defending the base is difficult too. It needs more turrets or something else to defend your base.I also had a suprising amount of lag and I consider my computre to be fair at running games. I can play games that have 2x as much going on and have 30 fps but this game averages to about 10 fps. This really makes it hard to properly aim at enemies and just ruins the experience all together.			"

								A crappy game... Even EA - Pre Alpha - Alpha - Whatever....... to make the game this hard by taking away the tools you need to survive is not fun .. I play games to have fun Not work and get aggravated by stupid game play decisions made by the devs.You no longer start with force or whatever it's called to help you survive even the 1st night. Your pistol has enough ammo to kill 1 little bug monster Yaaaayyy  !! BUT what good is that when you have Swarms Attacking you. None.If you are like me and watched Videos on youtube about this game to see if it were any good ? then you probably like I did -  thought -- This looks pretty good and it does look good , It's just not fun since they removed the tool you need to survive the 1st night guaranteed, unless you want to spend the whole time running around in the dark. yaaayyy.No thanks.... It's a shame the DEVS refuse to listen to what people say about the game being so hard and to please Tone down the aggressive monster attacks At-least until you had a little time to get yourself together.good riddance.

								This game was one of the first games I saw using Unreal Engine 4. It was visually impressive and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.""But it's an extremely early version"" I said to myself. ""I don't want to get burned again by unfinished games"" (e.g. Starforge)And here we are. A couple years later, and the game thinks it's a good idea to swarm me with (literally) hundreds of insects that drop a handful of explosive needles upon death DURING THE FIRST NIGHT.I don't know if there were any advances, if the game was abandoned, or if everyone who has been playing it decided that it wasn't HARDCORE enough, but the lack of a difficulty setting (except starting with or without a pistol with 24 rounds of ammo) and the resource starvation within that limited map makes me wonder what the hell were they thinking.This game is frustrating in its every aspect.

The environment is boring to look at, the graphics and texture work leave much to be desired, there is no music to keep me company, the ambiance is awful, resource gathering is monotonous and isn't made interesting or entertaining in any way (and that's what you're going to find yourself doing most of the time), You spend all day running around gathering resources in the most boring way imaginable, then spend those resources to make turrets only to have everything you built destroyed in the night by an impossible number of mobs. This isn't a game. I can't recommend this to anyone, it's far from being an enjoyable use of my time. That's half an hour I'll never get back.			"

								***  Dissclaimer ***  The opinion you are about to read is souly based upon the game in its current state. Being fair this is still ... Alpha i guess ... Steam should add a third vote button for neutral as opposed to yes or no recommendations. The short time i did spend playing about on the servers lead me to this conclussion:NPCs did not seem very challenging, as well as their behaviours were quite predictable. Crafting was quite easy as were the materials to obtain. Most servers were only 4 or 8 man i think. Joined a server with others online and did not see a single player on map or in chat.I may have been a bit harsh in judgement, however Steam does not give much time to mess around if you are thinking about a refund. >>> *** I may repurchase this game at a later date as i can see lots of potential here. The open world survival genre in gaming be it zombies, dinosaurs, aliens, or just out in the woods has always struck a chord with me. Unfortunately with the survival genre, many of the games flop in the end. DayZ, ARK, Rust etc .. I will be watching your patches and Dev blogs for new updates as such. Needs A LOT of work. not worth the $21 CAN in its current state unless you are willing to help them test with constant feedback.			"

								I play the game around aug 22, 2016 for about a few day.  I acknowlege this game is still in early developement.  However my biggest issue is how the game resources are utalize.  For example, I was using ironite for my turrets because of the abudance but ironite is also use to make bullets.  And every night i had to replace about 3 turrets which left me with no ironite.  It also left me with a ton fiber and other materials i couldn't do any thing with because they were not use in defense purpose.I thought the bullet cost was tooo expensive and mining in general was too time consuming.  I couldn't do much of anything else. Maybe make repairing cheaper.As it is, I'm giving it a negative review because i can't give it a netural or hopeful review.			"

								I have modern hardware and satisfy the system requirements. Yet the game was running at a ridiculously low framerate, to the point of being unplayable. To annoy me even more, Steam doesn't offer refunds. I just wasted my money and am really angry.			"

								I wish I could give this game a recommendation but do to the horrible load times I'm afraid I can't. This has been an issue for some time with no fix in sight. Most people give up playing the game because they think the game has frozen up. Takes me about 5-7 minutes of waiting everytime it loads. No excuse for this being a problem for so long.			"

								Very upset, my playtime isn't actually reflected of whats shown. It was actually only like 10 min, i left the game open. But I can't make a server to play with my girlfriend. We both bought the game to play together. Apperently you have to go through some port forwarding thing to make a server & the guide they have is very confusing. I tried doing it six or so times before i finally just gave up. My only other options are to either play single player or too play on a server with my gf where I constistantly have a ping above 100 causing lag. Even though my internet isn't bad at all. Its frustrating that you have to go through so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to play with someone on your own server or even through LAN. I haven't played a single pc game so far that has made me do this other than this one.			"

								I played for 17 minutes and it crashed twice. I wasn't willing to waste anymore of my time past that. With what I experienced. ProsThe movement system was a nice breath of fresh air. It needs a little adjusting as it still feels a little clunky to me.Amazing graphics.ConsThe static Island you start on is small(they're working on a much larger map). A big downside for me is that the map isn't procedurally generated. It becomes a race to find the meta. The best place to build and find resources and defend a base. Reduceing dynamic interaction with the environment.The build UI was incredibly overwhelming with no description I could find of what things did. All I was able to do was place the Eden kit. I gathered what felt like an abundance of resources but yet everything was only 5% ironite and it appeared to be the thing I needed the most.ConclusionAt first it looked like the game I could waste my life on. A dream game. A lot of this can be resolved during the Early Access and it remains a potential pick for me in the future. They have a lot of neat things in development. I'm in shock that this game has been worked on since Jan of 2015 and got an award then.At its current state I would pay 10 bucks and struggle to play it no matter how it performed and not feel bad about what I spent but 20 bucks for crashing every 8 minutes. No thanks.My Specs.AMD FX 8350 3.5 GHzGTX 980TiWindows 1024GBs of DDR3 at 2133 MHz			"

								There is really not much to do at this point in time. Just go around collecting some minerals and rarely get attacked. Not much of a challenge.

As of right now I still do not recommend this game but keep a watchful eye on it as new updates are released.			"

								It is a bit basic and just starting out can be frustrating as it is so easy to die and that can discourage  new players. Getting killed and losing everything you have collected is so frustrating.

								First experience - liked it for an early access game and hope to see a lot more development. So recommended as it is playable to a point even at this early stage.Obviously there's still plenty to get done. Incredibly short day/night cycles annoyed me immensely and i hope this is something that can be adjusted later on. Losing all of my inventory on death was frustrating too. Spending time gathering and then becoming swamped by a nest was down to my own fault as I wasn't paying much attention as to where i was going (lost inv was still annoying regardless).Overall though I wish I had waited a while longer before buying but I can see this game being one worth buying.

								As of 0.0.3, this game has limitless potential. Most of the mechanics work pretty good and the game is very much playable. I found myself becomming disinterested mostly because the mobs don't spawn fairly (seems around the third night they just come at you faster than you can take them down. Frame rate issues also make this harder), and you can't take down defenses once they are put up; you have to wait for them to be destroyed. I'm sure that will be fixed later. If you really enjoy farming for supplies and stick around to play a game after getting a good idea of what the game is about, then you'll enjoy this. I look forward to coming back in a month and seeing what has changed.P.S- $20 is a bit heavy for the game at this point. If you have a small gaming budget I would wait a little while and pick up something more complete.			"

								Revised :I dont know what happen to this game. it takes like 10mins to load and you die within 5mins of game. Dev, why on earth do you start the game at night!!!? serious i don't recognize this game anymore... i wont recommend this game just because you will get frustrated really really quickly. it take ages to load and when you die you go back to the same loading screen that takes ten minutes load...::old review ::I'm trying really hard to like this game but it's hard to be fair it's early access and pre-alpha.  I got hooked with sandbox survival game like 7 days to die. in fact, it was my first survival game.THE GOOD:1. if you like strategy game (tower defense) , survival game and sandbox environment then this game is made just for you. it has the benefit of the three worlds. 2. the graphics are absolutely beautiful ... stunning graphics .you feel engage with the mundane task of harvesting and it makes it fun to explore.3. the developers are awesome. they are very very engage with their gamers and the patches being release are in very very good quality. THE BAD:1. The User interface needs some work. you have press a bunch of buttons and use your mouse scroller to do some crafting. at first you dont mind ... coz your learning BUT after being press in time because of the pending nightfall or after doing it several times... it get really really really annoying really quick.  if your use to the easy crafting of 7 days to die then you will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off playing this game coz it ain't easy trust me. it looks ""cool"" but that's it. the blocks icons are color coded the same way so it's hard to make a distinction from one to the other.  2. You do a lot of walking in game. normally i don't mind exploring if you have something will doing it ...games like skyrim or 7 days to die. In 7 days to die... every block in that game can be harvested so your engage to your environment also you can predict where the resources are. wood = trees, rock = boulders , iron = mining . Eden Star doesn't give you that pattern. 3. bad guys walk like flash ...seriously! they are incredibly fast. hopefully that will change. 4. Unnecessary complication = crafting is so complicated! two sets of material ""Required"" and ""base"" component. you can choose different option for base material and you have to meet the required material.  the UI that display this information is old shool! old School. think of  web page with a table with columns and the submit bottom is a tiny buttons ate the bottom of the screen. more option doesn't always equate to a good experience. ""Developers"" if you reading this...please simplify your crafting system because gamers will be spending half of their time in this UI. For the developers:1. Improve your icon that it make sense or rename the harvested material to make it more familiar with the user. ""Ironite""?? seriously? call it ""iron"", Briganite... call it rock lol.  fider ... call it wood lol. change the icon so it make sense. place the harvested materials in location that make sense. 2. your Crafting UI is really hard to use... this is because you guys made crafting too complicated and it doesn't fit in a simple UI design haha. the gamer will spending more time in the crafting system and makei it easy to use helps them out specially when they have 2mins till nightfall. Conclusion:the developers are awesome they are very friendly and they the quality of the patches are top notch. i can see the game being polish in no time. this game is more stable than most pre-alpha game i played. but i have to say the UI is too corky, if you can go pass the crafting system then i say go for it buy it.  if your coming from games like 7 days to die ... you might wanna wait a little bit until the simplify the hot mess crafting system.
