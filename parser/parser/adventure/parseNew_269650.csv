												I spent the evening playing the game. It is good. I initially thought that the game had buggy edge detection for grabbing ledges, but it turned out that I had just missed that you have to press the up key as well to grab on.The game is difficult. Two enemies with guns can kill you easily. A gun + melee combo can also be a challenge. Towards the end of my session I came across a warehouse filled with enemies and turrets that seemed impossible to take on. I spent all my skill points unlocking persuasion and lockpicking, so I guess this was the game punishing me for not investing in aggressive hacking or combat skills. In this regard the game reminded me more of Alpha Protocol than Deus Ex - it takes your skill choices quite seriously and will gladly border stuff off if you come unprepared. There is also no quicksaving to manipulate conversations, although you can back up checkpoints as you enter new areas (just like AP).The story has been okay so far. It is typical cyberpunk fare with hacking, ais, megacorporations, human augmentation and so on. After the short introduction, the main story seems to be on the backburner, leaving you to explore the city and do sidequests.I recommend the game. Fans of Deus Ex, Alpha Protocol and VtM:Bloodlines will probably have a good time with the game.			"

												I really want to like it. The world is immersive and large. There's a lot to do, lots of quests and dialogue, and the setting is cyberpunk at it's finest. The world really holds true to it's cyberpunk roots, and that's what drew me in initially. However, the game itself though is just too buggy.First of all, saving the game doesn't save all of the information you'd assume it would, so you end up losing progress every time you re-load the game. Apparently there's a forum post on how the saving system works, but that just proves my point. Overall, the save system makes you feel unassured that your progress is safe, which was enough to drive me away from playing any more.To add to that, there have been multiple instances where I've been in combat and entered a cinematic, but combat went on behind the cinematic and I died, while the cinematic was playing. There were also some abilities that I was able to activate, but I couldn't pinpoint how I was activating them. I later learned that these abilities were only supposed to be available after upgrading your stats upon level-up, which proved that the upgrade system was bugged and broken. Too many bugs.Edit: I didn't realize so many people would be reading this review, so I've elaborated a bit!Edit 2: I'll update the review once I've play the latest version.			"

												This game is a bit tricky to rate; If I could give it a ""thumbs sideways"" verdict, I would. It has a lot going for it, but the execution is far, far from polished and even the first hour of the game is more an exercise in frustration than pleasure.First, the good:1. The writing is very good. It's clear that someone with a lot of talent put a lot of heart into the script. Bad writing is one of the perennial, almost universal hallmarks of video games, but this game deftly avoids that pitfall.2. The voice acting is phenomenal. Just like the writer(s), the voice actors portray their characters with passion and fluidity, and their performances are convincing, rather than ""video game voice acting"". There are AAA games with worse voice acting than this game.3. The visual aesthetic, while nothing exceptional, is solid and convincing. The game looks good in screenshots.4. The concept underpinning the game--2D action RPG brawler--gets my blood pumping. One of my favorite genres, and one that I think is underserved.5. The game is fairly forgiving of mistakes and death. You always have the option of restarting from the beginning of the screen you died in, although this turns out to be a double-edged sword as well (see below).And now for the bad:1. Remember when I said ""the game looks good in screenshots""? It does, but it looks awful in motion. The animations are stiff, with few to no transitional frames between sprites, which gives combat a jerky, unfinished quality that looks like it's still in the conceptual stage. Even simple movement gives the impression that the characters are skating or gliding rather than walking or running, as animations are not precisely keyed to movement speeds of characters.The game also has almost no visual feedback for events, even ostensibly important ones. For instance, during the opening tutorial-like sequence, you are instructed to perform a task in AR to seal a door against men coming to kill you. Visually, the entire sequence is greatly underwhelming, almost no animations accompanied the task (destroying a firewall around the door controls), and initially I did not even know I had accomplished the task because there was no visual indicator that it had been finished aside from a portion of the AR node disappearing (not fading, not fizzling, not exploding, just pop, gone).2. The audio is almost non-existent. What music there is is good, but there isn't much of it. There are very few audio cues for actions or events, which combined with the lack of visual feedback makes playing the game feel like you're an incorporeal ghost floating through the world. Walking through a jet of superheated steam inflicts damage to your character, but does not so much as elicit a hiss from the game. Enemies don't make noise as you fight them, and impacts in combat lack any sort of punch or weight because there is next to no audio feedback when they land. When you die, you fall over soundlessly.3. It's a good thing that the game is forgiving of death, because the game punishes you severely for making even minor mistakes. There are many bottomless pits promising instant death, and I guarantee that you will fall into them sooner rather than later, because they are poorly demarcated and there is no good way to distinguish ""pit that I'm not supposed to jump into"" from ""pit that I'm supposed to jump into"". Environmental hazards are savage and even a few seconds in one is good enough to kill you in many cases. This would be more palatable if those same hazards were more clearly visually identified: steam jets are easy to see, but toxic gas is mostly identified by the fact that your character suddenly starts taking rapid damage.4. But it's not all great that the game is forgiving of death. It's not only possible but very easy to place yourself into a situation where you die or take damage immediately upon entering a room, and if you die in that room, guess where you restart? That's right: at the beginning of the same room. I hope you had an earlier save. What's worse is that the game loads you from the beginning of the area (essentially loading an autosave), it doesn't keep track of environmental variables. That trap puzzle that you worked through to get to where you are? Turns out that's a one-way trip and you don't have a way back except to take massive damage. Oh, is your health too low? Hope you had an earlier save.The last item in particular is what made me stop playing the game and what will probably prevent me from continuing to play it. I want to like the game, but it's clear that for all of the loving care placed into the script and acting, the game's GAME parts are untested and ill-conceived, leading to pretty egregious death loops and lost progress. Which might even be excusable if the combat had more weight and punch to it. As it is, the gameplay feels thin and hollow because the game makes it look and sound thin and hollow.It's a good start, and I expect that the developers will be able to produce a sequel or remastered version that have more punch and more well-considered level design in due time. But I'll be waiting for that version instead of playing this one.			"

Review: Dex Wake up Dex! The complex is after you! My name is Raycast, I hacked into your network to give you some guidance. What you see outside is Harbor Prime, a dystopian mega town, covered with darkness and smoke. But there is no time for you, use the cyberspace to disable the door and make your way out of there. Sneak through the sewers, get into Fixers Hope and find a man called Decker, he will surely help you. If my introduction made you feel like Matrix met V for Vendetta and the main theme of the Shinra Corp. makes it’s way back into your head, you are in the right mood for this game. As you already noticed, Dex is your name and survival is your aim. A hacker called Raycast makes your sweet neckplate-wearing body move, right into the arms of some retired hacker and his over-cautious friend. They present you a story about a powerful AI, named Kether, that got created by The Complex, a Megacorp,  in order to reach control of every network ever created. That may sound like a fairytale but doesn’t explain exactly why you were chased and what the famous hacker Raycast wants from you.This is how you will get started in Dex, a Sidescrolling Steampunk Cyber RPG, presented with 2D-Graphics, that mixes Metroidvanian-platforming and open world experience with some heavy plot influences of Deus Ex. Let`s see whether developer Dreadlocks succeeded in combining this cocktail or left you getting lost in cyberspace. First, graphics are nice, with hand-drawn locations and 90`s style animations. It feels a bit like crossing old Beat em up stages if you move from one district to another. Characters are well drawn too but animations of enemies tend to look a bit clunky sometimes. A big city like Harbor Prime needs music and sounds to paint the illusion of a living and breathing environment but Dex could use a bit of improvement here. The music is great and every district has it’s unique style like Chinatown, which got heavily influenced by traditional Asian instruments whereas the rich and industrial Highrise has a cold, more mechanical touch. You can hear some cars or even hot fat that boils in a frying pan when entering a restaurant. What is missing are the people. It feels like they are all quietly moving along. No beggar shouts for money, no hooker praises her legs, no child laughs..or cries. What makes Dex shine are the dialogues. Every NPC you can interact with has a voice and well written dialogue. May it be an old sailor or a drug dealing kid on the streets, it feels like the developers invested a lot of time into the game’s story. And talking about story, we slowly approach the core of the game. You can strictly follow the main plot but doing so means you will miss lots of interesting side quests. Dex wants to be open-world and thus allows you to explore the whole city on your own. Have in mind that you might encounter situations or enemies you aren’t ready for, like a jump passage you can’t pass yet. You will die. You will curse this game. But you will come back for its great stories. There is much more in Harbor Prime than just The Complex. Digging under the surface allows a look in a society where hackers are gods, corporations fight each other in dirty ways and people who haven’t implemented a mechanical part into their body are considered outsiders.All you need to know is how to solve and to survive. Every quest earns EXP and maybe Gold or other usefull stuff. Use EXP to level up Dex, unlock and upgrade skills, varying from Melee to Hacking and even Charisma, altering your playstyle and how you want to finish quests. Up for satisfying close combat? Become a Melee Expert! Talking your way out of trouble or get secrets while examining Others? Charisma may become your best friend. Gold is important to get medicine or weapons, even more important to get augmentations to make yourself a true cyber warrior with the ability to cloak yourself or get immunity against toxic gas. Cyberspace, the last one on my checklist. Hacking and entering the network will save your life and provide you with necessary information. Dex can hack cameras, turrets and even other people to harm, kill or at least stun them. She can also enter the network and fight her way through it, offering you a game inside the game. Doing so you fight against viruses, trojans and firewalls, hopefully finding some useful e-mails or passwords to provide yourself with EXP, Gold and Satisfaction. Big Text, Quick Facts: Pro:Retrolook Steampunk RPG with a heavy touch of 90`s gamesDex is great - blue hair, black humour, Beautiful BackgroundsMusic sounds good and fits the settingInteresting plot and Side-QuestsWell written dialogues and credible NPCsSkill system: Find your own way of solving a problem - fighting, talking, hackingImplement augmentations and upgrade Dex - jump higher, hit harder, act tougherCon:Trial and error gets hard sometimes - Open-World-ProblemsSaves work like checkpoints - leave the district if you want to save your progress!Description of items is too smallStrange Keybindings (like Guard on Shift but Dodge on Q) - can be reassigned Quiet townfolk Summary:Dex earned many bad reviews after it got released too early. It suffered from game breaking bugs, corrupted save files and many other things that made it nearly unplayable right after the start. But the latest updates fixed most of the problems people were arguing about and I did not encounter any bug myself while playing. That said the community still rages about the save system that uses checkpoints instead of a real savefile. All I can say about that is: once you get used to it, you will be fine. It took me some time to find into the game but right now, it totally satisfies. Once you got used to the controls, the town, the dying, you will start exploring and find quests, that offer great dialogues and a lot to think about in the “not so bright” future. It’s not like Dex is a perfect game but the cocktail tastes good and I definitely recommend this brew to steampunk lovers and RPG-fans, who like their Deus Ex turned into a sidescrolling 2D experience. Personal Verdict: 8,5/10			"

												To start off my review, I want to say that Dex is a really fun game and I would most certainly recommend it. However, there are a number of bugs and gameplay issues that can hinder the overall experience, and although I enjoyed the game, I can't help but to feel some disappointment in the final execution. To put it short, if you want a casual experience just to enjoy the story, this game might not be for you.Now to break everything down. Dex takes place in a really cool cyberpunk setting. As a fan of sci-fi and cyberpunk, I think the game captures the cyberpunk feel perfectly. The art is truly superb. The character sprites look great, and the environments are very colourful and beautifully done. Dex proves to us that you don't need a game to be all grey and brown to show a gritty setting. This is complemented by a lovely musical score. Music playing in every area was fitting to the setting and memorable. Most notable one is the main theme, which has become one of my personal favourite main themes in gaming.The story has its good points, but overall it's a pretty standard cyberpunk story. Hackers, gangsters, evil corporations, secret experiments - all this stuff makes an appearance. To me most issues come in the gameplay.The gameplay consists of a mix of stealth, combat, and hacking in cyberspace. Hand-to-hand combat was really well done. The fighting was smooth and each impact was felt. By contrast, gun combat was done rather badly. For some odd reason, it's not possible to walk with your gun out. If you want to shoot, you have to stand absolutely still. If you make so much as a step, the character automatically holsters the gun. This can become extremely annoying during fight sequences, where each second can mean a difference between shooting the enemy and them taking off half of your healthbar.The platforming aspects such as jumping and climbing were fine enough, although at times it was very hard to tell where you could jump onto and where you couldn't. At times it seemed like you could jump onto something, only to see your character fall through it and to their death. And because you cannot save when you want, this becomes annoying.Hacking... ugh. I just didn't like it at all. It was nothing more than a basic pixel shooter and your sole job is to click, click, and click. What annoyed me more than the hacking mini-game itself is the fact how often the game forced you to play it. Most times there were no alternatives. Play the darn hacking mini-game or make no progress. I signed up for a cyberpunk sidescroller, not a cyberspace pixel shooter.The game also had some balance issues. Like for example, there was no permanent cheap/free heal anywhere in the city. So if you were out of money and low on health, there's probably nothing you can do about it. Likewise, there was never any place where I could grind for money and/or experience.The game had plenty of sidequests. Most were pretty interesting and I attempted to solve each one of them. However, quite a few of them I never managed to solve due to things not being clear. Maybe I just needed to do more exploration or simply to get lucky, but I think a bit more direction would've been nice. What was nice though is how some main quests and sidequests had nice multi-branched paths to accomplishing your goal and at times you had to make important decisions.Finally to round it off, the ending was extremely disappointing and felt rushed. Without giving any spoilers, the game forces you to do your ""final fight"" in cyberspace. That's right. Hacking again. And the ending cutscene lasted a total of 10 seconds. I really wish there was more to the ending than what I've experienced.I know this is a tonne of criticism, but I am glad to have played through this game, and it is a promising game. It's just, it's currently riddled with too many small issues, which pile up and hinder the enjoyment.			"

												Dex is a 2D science fiction action roleplaying game that might seem linear at the first glance but is full of surprises and will eventually make you consider your choices, once you face the consequences. Needless to say, from the Storytelling perspective, it will punish you for mistaking this game as a sidescroller. It is, in fact, a roleplaying game and a proper one, I might add. - Oh boy, I have no idea where to start. This might take a while and a bit reading.Dex combines many elements from different genres together and does it quite well. At least this is my opinion, since I've felt exactly like I'm playing a damn good, well put together, professionally written RPG. Therefore you get a set of interesting approaches to playing the game; while the character progression will allow you to improve your abilities, and they will actually improve how you play the game as you progress on different skills, your interaction with the environment will heavily be affected by the choices you made - not to mention that the implants you're going to get will seem optional but the game will continuously itch the urge to upgrade your augmentations and/or install new ones in order to avoid various obstacles that are not necessarily mandatory for the main progression. Yet you will run around for more quests, more experience and more money to get implants, buy softwares and progress on side stories, because you will be having your fun.The main story, however, is relatively short. This is true if you take the side quests as optional activities. But, believe me, they are not. The progression you will have on side activities will greatly help on your main course and will actually affect the future steps of your progression. - For example, before going on a main mission, completing side activities and talking to people who you have done jobs for in the past and learning about your main quest will end up in several side quests that will not only make your main quest relatively easier, it will also end up with more experience and more money you earn in return. - This approach alone should tell you that Dex is not just another attempt to recreate what has been done in the past, but a product of the good perspective what we call ""if it ain't broken, break it and build something better"" - it is exactly what has been done in this project.Now, it is to be expected from a cyberpunk theme that hacking should exist in such games. Dex's hacking is a minigame that is affected by your character progression. As you progress on your hacking skills, your minigame will become easier -of course, the damn black holes are there to torture our bloody souls- but there's always side progression to it; software upgrades can be bought and there are also usable items while in Augmented Reality. - This also is a huge help while in hand-in-hand combat, because you can just go into AR and hack into your enemies' implants and stun them for a while, which is also a part of the stealth system. - and, oh yeah, there is stealth. You can takedown your enemies from behind, you can get into cover, get invisible for a while. But there's also using enemy turrets against them and letting the tools do your dirty work.Implants are a bit dull, unfortunately. Nothing actually that interesting there. But who cares, you can jump higher, regenerate health, become invisible, change your field of view, detect enemies etc. - Fun little things. They do greatly affect the gameplay, however. So It wouldn't be wise to say they aren't mandatory, but aside from the jumping the rest is pretty much optional; Things like an inhaler and immunity to electricity are quite the quality of life improvements.Before getting into the story and the characters, I have to point out some notes. - There are some sound design flaws. Character Voices and Background Music sound levels have certain problems. However, I played the game on GNU/Linux, which shouldn't be a problem at all, but after experiencing some launch issues on almost every DE and hearing sounds overlapping, I had to guess that there are problems somewhere between ALSA drivers working poorly with the engine and unpolished state of the game. - Now, I have to point out the elephant in the room, Dex is an unpolished game. No, it is not an unfinished game, it is an unpolished game. I don't know why this is the case, but you will encounter some ugliness. But will this affect your gameplay? No. Not at all. In fact, you will easily forget about the problems like words overflowing the dialog screen, or pretty much every menu content running over the menu textures and things like inconsistent scrolling.Again, these are minor problems. Doesn't affect the game in a great way. So, they didn't really bug me at all.Voiceacting is outstanding. Actors did gave life to every single one of these characters - a professional approach of narrative. Infused with lovely, extremely good animated cutscenes and the well written lines describing the heavy atmosphere and the reactions of characters, the quality of the production does speak for itself. There's nothing more to say about this, really. I loved every bit of it. I listened every bit that characters had to offer and loved every line. Dex, truly is not a wasted potential. In fact, it's a perfect begining for an independent team.Of course, you might not be into such artstyle. Which is completely understandable.Karel Antonin did an amazing job with the Soundtrack. - and Dex's Soundtrack Album became one of the Soundtracks that I wanted badly. A good friend of mine acted way before me and gifted me the album, for that I am really, really thankful. Because make no mistakes folk, this is an extraordinary work for an Independent Game - actually, forget about the Independent label, Dex's Soundtrack is an artistically accurate approach to this game and I salute the people who put the time and effort to compose and release this piece of artwork. And, you know what, if anything; I highly recommend buying the soundtrack. It does worth the price. I, kid you, not.Now the hard part, the Storyline. - Well, Dex takes place within a futuristic society and you play as Dex, a woman you hardly know anything about. Has absolutely no skills whatsoever, just trying to stay alive. At this point the narrative is so strong that while you're running away, the music, the background the jumps you have to make, in the very first ten minutes, the game makes you feel like you're living these moments from her perspective and you literally live for her. - and then, you find yourself on an elevator, going down, you see the logo with a beatifully composed theme. You are living in the movie, you are experiencing the game. - and believe me, as someone who has experience in the industry, this art direction, this story driven introduction is pure professionalism; it is idealism. For that, I very much so in love with everyone who's involved with this project.From that point forward, Dex has to meet with a couple of others who has been driven into this corporate level series of conspiracies and she has to make vital decisions, with consequences. - Her character is in your very hands.Dex is one of those well-written hidden gems with great design decisions and a product of sincere endeavour. If you are into science fiction; if you love cyberpunk theme, this piece of art is here, waiting in the shadows, glowing. All you need to do is to take a look. You will see the potential and you will see the artistic effort. - Support these people. Believe me, they will deliver more and they will deliver better.Note - I wrote this review at 4 in the morning. So, I'm terribly sorry about the typos.			"

												I'm really torn.At one point, this was easily my favorite game I'd purchased on Steam, period. It was my go-to game when I just wanted to play something fun. Being the non-hardcore type, I of course played on Casual, and the difficulty was just about perfect for me.Then came the Enhanced Edition update. Basically the update that turned the game I loved to ****. (You can figure out what I would have typed there, I'm sure.)Even on Casual difficulty, the combat became much more brutal. Not fun. Especially early on when money is tight and healing options are more limited. It also made most of the combat upgrades obsolete. What's the point of having a 3rd or 4th hit to your combos when even hitting twice -- again, on CASUAL -- is already a rarilty?The hacking system was a lot of fun, too. It basically put you in a twin-stick shooter mode. There was an external hacking mode that let you turn off security cameras and turrets and stuff, and there was an internal hacking mode that was like a whole little mini-game unto itself. Both really fun. And both rewarded you taking your time and planning ahead. They ruined it -- they ruined it so bad with the ""Enhanced"" Edition update. Everything about it became tougher, and your energy stopped recharging on its own past a point(originally 10%, but last I checked 34%), where before if you had the patience it'd get all the way back to 100%.It really does have a good story. And I wish you guys could experience it in its pre-Enhanced state, because it really was amazing. But in its current state, no, I can't recommend it at all. It's garbage. Casual is now frustrating at best, and I don't even want to imagine how hard the regular difficulty is.Would it have really been so hard to implement a new difficulty mode instead of inflicting these horrible changes on everyone? Would it?So there you have it. I really want to recommend it because it used to be awesome. But it's garbage now.			"

												Dex is quite an ambitious indie game, and one that clearly had a lot of care put into it. It was in Early Access for quite a while, and I'd say the full release turned out something definitely worth looking at. That said, it has some flaws, even if they weren't a complete deal breaker for me.You play as the titular character, who is awakened one night by a mysterious informant who warns here she is about to be attacked by a squad of military toughs. He helps her escape and reach an acquaintance of his; your mission is to find out why whoever was behind this, and why they seem to want you dead. It's a cyberpunk story, so suffice to say the answer isn't so simple.After the tutorial, which covers the game's main mechanics pretty well, you're left to roam the streets of Harbor Prime. It's open world, but on a smaller scale: the city is about ten screens wide, although there's plenty to see in each - stuff to unlock, rooms to ransack, and of course quests to take. These range from dealing with gang activity, to corporate espionage, to general good deeds. All the NPCs you meet are voiced, and while they're not the best the actors inject a lot of character into their roles.The actual gameplay of Dex mixes up genres quite a bit. You move around the city on a 2D plane, and there's platforming, both mandatory and to reach optional goodies. When fighting enemies, you can either go hand to hand, which functions like a simple beat-em-up, or pull out your guns, also the latter doesn't work so well when most enemies charge for you. I found just punching them worked fine. A lot of the time you'll have to jump into cyber space, where the game shifts to a twin stick shooter as you penetrate a system's defenses. When talking to people there are also some opportunities for a charisma check, ala Fallout.It's nice the game wanted to mix things up, but although there's variety none of it really excels. By the later parts of the game I found myself running past enemies unless they were seriously in my way or I had to kill them. If you're half-decent at twin-stick games I doubt the hacking will give you much trouble, and even if you die in them all that happens is a bit of health taken off Dex, while your progress in the computer is usually saved. The whole game in general is quite easy by the time you get access to the augments and later parts of the skill tree, actually: by the end I was a juggernaut with almost twice my starting health, able to take out most enemies in a few combos. If you wanted to challenge yourself you could probably get away with ignoring all the side quests. But I can't say feeling superhuman in a game where transhumanism is a major theme is really a bad thing.Overall I have to say I liked Dex despite these issues, since while it's not a perfect game it definitely has soul. It also doesn't overstay its welcome, and looks great (some other reviews say the animations are bad, but I never really thought so). Pick it up if you want a cyberpunk game while waiting for 2077.

												The game tries to do a lot of things but doesn't really have much content.Tries to be like Deus Ex but doesn't give enough utility to stealth or charisma and doesn't allow for nonlethal takedowns.  Weapons are limited.Tries to be a metroidvania, but has limited exploration.The story is *incredibly* short for an RPG and very generic.Looks pretty and handles well.  I like how combat works for the most part.  Would prefer a way to upgrade takedowns though.			"

												Are you one of those people who don't want to read a ♥♥♥♥-ton of text describing the mechanics  of the game? Then i'll keep it simple.Dex is great game that is hard to recommend despite it being so good.It has so many issues, as well as some baffling basic design oversights, that it would easily turn off so many people from the very start.However if you dig through the dirt, mud and other various amounts of filth, you'll find something that truly shines with a LOT of potential, especially in comparison to what's currently on Steam as of late.The melee combat and shooting all packs a punch and is very enjoyable. The RPG mechanics are varied, robust and are tailored to how YOU want to play, as well as the story and world the devs created being extremely interesting and a unique take on the genre.Thing is you'll have to dig a through a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥to fully enjoy it. Dex is a bit like Alpha Protocol in that regard. Lot of potential, but is so bugged up the fudge hole that a person suffering from Crabs would cringe. It all depends on how much you can suffer through.For those wanting a proper review there's more after the break...//////////////Alright, time to go balls deep into Dex.If i had to describe what Dex is to someone i'd say this:Dex is a third-person, side scrolling RPG that has a large emphasis on a unique hacking premise with some shooting and brawling and even some basic stealth mixed in for good measure. The game is set in a original cyberpunk world where augmentations are all the rage and hacking is a good way to rack up some cash, this is all drawn and animated in astounding detail which creates a very interesting aesthetic.It's a little like if the original Deus Ex got drunk one night and knocked up Shantae & The Pirate's Curse, nine months later this red headed, freckle faced mix of both games pops out as an indie game available on Steam for twenty bucks.That Deus Ex comparison isn't unwarranted either. Dex is a full blown RPG with action elements, instead of an action RPG like Deus Ex Human Revolution. You suck at everything until you level that skill up, or get a specific augmentation to enhance it.For example: Do you want to carry shotguns and SMGs into battle and fire them with pinpoint accuracy?Better save up your skill points then!Want to be able to lock pick almost every single locked door in the game not problem?Grind your exp and then level the ♥♥♥♥ up!Want to be able to coerce pimps into lending you their fanciest male hookers for a kinky bang-time at a discount?Level up your charisma, pick the right choice during dialogue, and have fun you perverted freak!Speaking of which, yes there's a dialogue system in Dex! Even if you have maxed out charisma you need to pick the way way of coercing someone at the time. Some people respond to threats, others respond to bribes, and others respond to flattery. Pick the wrong one, and you'd best reload a save and try again buddy! It works well, and always keeps conversations tense as you need to always pay attention to what they say. The writing itself is very well done and descriptive, kinda reminds me of the old cRPGs of yesteryear. The dialogue is also voice acted and...... here's where Dex starts to fall apart.The voice actors aren't bad at all and always suit the character and role their playing, but the actual voice direction itself leaves something to be desired. It always seems like they took only one take for each line and it can sound extremely amateurish and awkward at times. You can turn voices off in the option screen of the main menu if you wish, but then during cutscenes they'll be completely silent except for the bombastic (and rather nice i might add) score blasting over stock still images.While we're on the bad side of this i'll also add that some sound effects in general just seem to be completely ♥♥♥♥ing missing or non-existent! For example during the game you can sneak up on some unaware thugs and choke them to death, giving the same amount of exp for little to no effort as well as avoiding any possible injuries, but they make no sound! The chick you play as just dry humps them for a moment and they fall dead, again with absolutely no noise to accompany it, not even when the body falls down.If i sneak up on someone and snap their bloody neck in a video game, i expect to hear a sickening *CRACK* to go along with the action, it's just plain unnerving when it doesn't.Another thing wrong is the control scheme for both the controller and the keyboard and mouse. Some keys are just in a weird unnatural spot! 'Q' to dodge during melee??? Who was the pants on head retard who chose THAT brilliant key placement?And i have never played a game, that had these few actual commands to input, that has forced me to use the '~' key.Also the jumping has some weird form of gravity that drops if you don't hold in spacebar until you fully finish the jump. If you let go too earlier be prepared to drop like a sack of bricks.The devs have patched the game so that you can rebind keys, so props to them, but this should have been thought out more clearly from the start.There are also a few visual glitches here and there, and some that really hinder the gameplay like the journal getting confused and ♥♥♥♥ing up. I guess it sounds like i really hate the game, but it's the opposite. There is a brilliant game here buried underneath some confusing design choices.While stealth is aggravatingly basic (walk behind someone and press a button to insta-kill) the actual melee combat is simple but satisfying and deep, with a basic one two punch combo, dodging, blocking, and special moves unlocked the more points you put into the fighting skill.Plus if you don't feel like getting your hands dirty you can always pull out a great big ♥♥♥♥ing magnum revolver and empty it into someones cranium as fast as you can pull the trigger. Skill points in the guns skill also unlock more weapons that you able to use, as well as reducing accuracy, recoil and stuff like that.Like previously mentioned there are other skills you can upgrade such as:EnduranceHackingLockpickingCharismaand a few moreHacking plays a key role in the story of Dex, and as such, has it's own mini-game dedicated to it. Without going into it too much it's fun, encourages thoroughness and skill, and never gets tedious or unwelcome.There is also an abundance of side-quests and the most that i have encountered are well done, with good writing, always worth the effort for the cash ( or other bonuses reward ), as well as having some various options of how exactly to complete them.I won't go into the story as i generally believe that the story in a game can fall apart if you know too much beforehand. Believe me when i say it IS worth your time.All in all, Dex is worth the time of any patient RPG fan. Especially those with a massive throbbing hard-on for cyberpunk such as myself, and ESPECIALLY those who are looking for something akin to the original Deus Ex. Even with all the problems i mentioned.Is it perfect? No, Mia Khalifa isn't perfect either but you can bet that if she was willing i'd jump her bones like a starving hound!Worth every penny.			"

								This game is worth to buy it.It's an early alpha#1 build - and i don't expect to much from this.now at first to the bad things:- serveral bugs  (gun reload bug, gun won't shoot bug, items dissappear in inventory)- no main story line- the quests implemented are cool to play, should be side quest - the abandoned chemical factory: there is a place where i can't jump further - i always die (it's really tough) [need some screenshots?] UPDATE: this wasn't a bug - it was because of a my character which wasn't build enough to survive the place!!!)to the good things:- really nicely crafted animations and graphics- music is great- i like the settingMaybe the ""bad things"" list is bigger then the good things; but just keep read the summary!Summary:Dex feels for me like an Deus Ex : Human Revolution with mixed part from the game ""Flashback"". I really love those two games and Dex re-defines those two genres. I like it!I'm looking forward to the progress of this game.Hopefully with a story line (main quest) and the possibility to talk to ""useless/other"" NPCs - with some infos to the story, or even just chickchat - like an RPG ;-)			"

												15 minutes in: I've run into several bugs, some graphical, some audio, and a gameplay bug or two. Also, combat and stealth are just... not explained.Okay, okay, I like it... mostly. It's a spiritual successor to Deus Ex in _every_ way, both good and bad. Yes, you can do anything. Yes, there's a variety of upgrades. Yes, you can sequence break quests and then leave yourself confused. Stealth is confusing and hard to use.You will get shot to pieces.What am I really supposed to DO with AR?Why do none of the ""convince"" options actually _convince_ someone.However. It is a cyberpunk game with choices, flexibility, a non-linear path, and OPEN ALL THE DOORS. In my book... worth it. Ish.			"

												Alright, this one is done and dusted. My playtime shows tobe right at 15 hours. I'd say that is probably a little off. My own counter is closer to 12 hours.Anyway, I thought this was an excellent game. What would happen if The Matrix, the Deus Ex series, and Shadowrun had a 2D, open world metroidvania-ish RPG baby? Dex.The story was pretty engaging with various twists and turns. The side quests all had reasons for doing them beyond the typical go here do that type deal. They had their own nicely encapsulated stories where they werent tied to the main storyline.The gameplay was reasonably seamless. I noticed a little lag on occasion, but nothing that would close to crashing the game. However, the game did freeze and crash occasionally (unrelated to the lag issue). Since there is both manual saving and automatic saves when you enter new game areas, this wasnt a big deal.The combat was decent. For melee, it was essentially a brawler with a couple cool moves that could be unlocked as you level up. Ranged combat was handled as twin stick shooting.The upgrade system was easy to use and efficient. You had a few primary ability categories and a coupe secondary ability categories. All were useful and allow you to really choose how you want to play Dex, be it more stealth oriented, run and gun, kick♥♥♥♥♥ charismatic talker, and what have you. Of course, combat is obligatory in a lot of situations, but how you handle it fairly well correlates with how you handled your upgrades as you leveled up. There is a lot of dialogue, so the social upgrades find equal relevance in the game, and at some points, even allow you to avoid some difficult battles or at least give you another advantage once the battle begins.The graphics looked very nice. Classic cyberpunk world. There is fast travel accessed via the menu as well.The platforming, such as it is, more or less consists of reasonably precise jumping and climbing.Also, augments....so in addition to the skill upgrading via leveling up, you also can buy augments. The amount of slots you have available relates to how you spend your skill upgrades, but even if you dont increase that at all, you can still have a few augments, which range in power from immunity to toxins, electricity, combat boosts, damage reduction, xray vision, and so on. Anyway, as I said in the intro, I thought this was an excellent game and highly recommend it.8 clones unknowingly released into the general population out of 10 possible (or more.....bwahahahahaha)			"

								By far this seems to be a good game, especially for cyberpunk fans. Works good on Linux (a big advantage for me). The graphic is great, and so is the music. I cannot wait for the main storyline and other features (like hacking and armors).As for feedback, it would be really nice if a character could shoot and run at the same time (would really help in battle). Also, when you browse your augmentations, you should see a number of slots left/available (currently you can only see it while buying augmentations).			"

												I just loved the aesthetic of this game. Dex proves that you don't need a game to be all grey and brown to show a gritty setting. Once I understood the mechanics of the gameplay (combat and hacking) it was tons of fun and very satisfying. This game reminded me a lot of Deus Ex Human Revolution - not only by the cyberpunk theme, but also the way you can complete missions (through combat, hacking, stealth or talking). I think the game captures the cyberpunk feel perfectly. The art, oh man, the art is truly superb. The character sprites look great, and the environments are very colorful and beautifully done. A must buy in my gaming books.

												I want to like this game.  I tried to like this game.   Truth be told, I don't *dislike* it but, I also don't really like it either. ""Thumb sideways"" is a good way to describe my feelings.  Since that's not an option, I give it a thumbs down because on balance I do rather regret the purchase.   I'm too broke to buy games that I can't return and don't enjoy.The main story is fine, the side quests are playable (or you can forget about them without penalty), the world is believable, the graphics are....well you get what you pay for.  The problem is that the game play itself is almost a grind right out of the gate.  Your base fighting options are limited in the extreme (punch, shoot).  Your weapon choices are equally limited -- five guns and a taser.  You can't walk and shoot.  You can't even turn and shoot.  You have to stand and shoot.  There is no option to run and hide either.  Once the enemy spots you, you're spotted until you're dead or he's dead (the enemies are uniformly male).  As for the hacking, it is -- if anything -- even more limited. The whole thing reminded me a game from the 80s.   There is a grand total of ONE puzzle.  The very thing that drew me to the game ended up being the thing I liked least of all.Not that there aren't good points.  Far and away the strongest point is the dialogue.  The scripts are well written and at least 75% of the time the actors don't sound like they are acting.  Instead they sound like people.  There are also moments where the ""right"" course of action wasn't clear and times where it wasn't desirable either.  For someone (me) who naturally gravitates towards the simon-pure ""good"" side of the good/evil continuum playing a game where I was A-OK with wanting to do something ""evil"" was a novel experience.  YMMV.			"

Early Access Review
								As of v1.0.0.2:Dex is a 2d RPG in a cyberpunk setting.It has an amazing style, aesthetics, design, world, soundtrack and any other audio-visual aspect you can name.It feels like a 2d Deus Ex, and that's pretty awesome.The problem is that at the moment combat mechanics are pretty horrible - melee combat is a mess if you have to fight more than one enemy, shooting is nigh to impossible unless you stop and wait for a few second to get your gun out. Running with a gun out? Nope, too complex!But, well, it's alpha released only after ~half a year of development. It'll most likely be fixed.TL;DR It does looks extremely promising. but it is has very raw mechanics at the moment.More detailed overview in the video:

												Dex is a good example of what an ""open-world RPG"" should be. It really shines at the most important aspects and avoids typical pitfalls of the genre.It needs to be said though that the game is somewhat short: completing the main story and almost all of side quests (I think I missed a couple), plus some general screwing around took me about 12 hours. Well, that's what you get when you have a small dev team, but they did their best to maximize the amount of unique content in the game.First of all, the game's world is well developed. It includes a fair amount of areas with a distinct look and feel: everything is carefully drawn, there're lots of interesting - sometimes funny, sometimes grim - details, and almost everything is unique and rarely gets reused in other locations. This world is really open - you can go anywhere right after the intro sequence, except for a couple of plot-important areas, which are located quite far from the main map - no invisible walls here. Of course, some paths are blocked by environment, like poisonous gas or high walls or electric hazards. You'll need implants to pass them, and you can get them pretty early in the game.This world is filled with lots of NPCs, each with a unique portrait, sprite, and voice, and most of them have some problems you can help them with. These side quests vary in difficulty, and most of them rely on exploration of the city and asking around; even if there's no visible connection of a character to the story, they still can know something.Another aspect of an RPG is money and items. I like the balance of Dex in regards to these: if you go for real lengths in getting every available penny using any means necessary, you still won't get filthy rich and you won't be able to buy out every shop. However, a reasonable amount of time spent on side quests and exploration will net you enough money to buy all the necessities and buff Dex with powerful items and implants for comfortable gameplay. There's no need to grind, and no real possibility to do so, too, as there're no respawning enemies and repeatable quests.There are a lot of implants of sorts to modify your character, but the tricky part is that amount of implant slots is limited and you can't uninstall or swap them. Choose carefully.Combat. Well, it stays more or less the same throughout the whole game. You can learn some tricks that make brawls more lively as you level up your melee skill, but there are no weapons besides starting inventory of gun shop owners and a couple of special pistols tied to the plot. Sadly, you won't get those huge and stylish guns that are drawn on the gun shop walls.Still, the combat system provides you a good and interesting challenge for the bigger part of the game: almost always you're outgunned, and your enemies are not cannon fodder. So you need to plan your encounters, and sometimes even get stealthy to avoid dangerous fights. And if you really max out your combat prowess with skills and implants, you'll get a satisfying experience of being a Terminator incarnate, able to kick around even the toughest enemies with impunity.You'll also have to fight in cyberspace, as a part of hacking various systems. It's portrayed as a shooting mini-game, and there's enough different threats that require you to make decisions quickly, especially if you didn't invest a lot in hacking. Don't forget that you can always find a machine that replenishes your Focus somewhere near your target.The role-playing system of Dex is not sophisticated: there are no obscure skills of questionable importance like tailoring or agriculture or shaman rites or what have you, and every investment is described in detail, so your character's development can be planned. You don't need to grind to get enough experience for natural progress, and you can buy XP and skill points from NPCs if you're really in a pinch.Charisma and lockpicking skills are unusual: there're really only two steps at their respective bars. There's no catch, six points - and you have them both maxed out, and for this small investment you can pick any pickable lock and convince any convincable character in the game. It's strange in comparison to a lot of other RPGs, where making a proficient thief or a smooth talker would require a lot of points, potentially crippling your other abilities. Maybe that's for good, because lockpicking and persuasion can be very useful right at the start of the game, depending on the order you take side quests, so you can easily pick them - or don't pick at all and look for other solutions, if you wish so.It's still worth mentioning that maxed out charisma is not a cruise control for success as you'll still have to pick your words right for each case.As for the plot and the music... Well, they're there. The game's story is a usual one, where freedom-loving hackers and runners fight oppressive corporations. No plot holes, no surprising twists. The retrowave music goes well with the atmosphere, but is not very memorable.Putting the pieces back together, we get a game which can be described as ""condensed"": while not big, it's densely packed with content, and overall effort and quality make for a really good product. Dex is well worth its price, and for some reason it went under the radar, so only about 50k people have bought it as of today. P.S. For more hidden gems, follow the steam CRIMINALLY Low Sales curator.			"

												It's my obligation to inform you that I have received a review code for this game, now that we have that out of the way, let's get to it.This turned out to be a much bigger wall of text then I expected, there's a ""tl;dr"" at the bottom.Dex is a 2D Cyberpunk RPG made in Unity, by a studio that doesn't have my chistory in gaming, in fact their only other game is a Mobile game released a while back. But when you see Dex, you'd say the studio must have a larger history because the game is just so well done. It has its flaws too, it's by no means a perfect game but personlay I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs.The setting is done right, the music, your surroundings everything is true to the cyberpunk theme. You'll be going through several locations including the sewers, the ""heart"" of the city, outside parts of the city and you'll be able to explore several buildings you'll come across. All these locations ahve very well done backgrounds and foregrounds that do not ""get in the way"" so to say. The city streets feel alive as you're running by many civilians and the ocasionall dog here and there. Music is where you'd expect it to be, it is well made and fits right into the game. If you have ever played Deus Ex, you know what to expect.The combat is simple in its core but it still can get very interesting. There's not that much you can do excep click like a maniac to perform your fightning combo, this combo never changes, only certain elements gets added to it as you level up and put some skill points into close range combat. You can also learn ""air kick"" and the old ""I'll spin around on the floor and make you fall"" move. You can sneak up to your oponent and choke him. That's about it for close range combat. You also have ranged weapons, at first you can only use your standard 9mm gun, if you want to give some of the better machinery a try, you'll have to spend some of your skill points to ranged weapons. Ranged weapons can be used effectively but there are situations where you just don't want to use one, let's say you're surrounded, in this situation you're going to have a hard time gunning your oponents down, you'll have to have a distance, that's where you can start shooting. I never used weapons much, I find close combat more exciting so I never got to try any other weapons except for the standard 9mm gun. And there's third mechanic when it comes to combat - hacking. You can criple, damage and paralize your oponets by hacking if you have the required skill. While hacking, time freezes so use that to your advantage! Combine all this and imagine that you are going agains a team of four enemies, one has a ranged gun, the other has a chain, one is a slow big guy that punches hard and your standard sized fella that will kick you if you come close, now this is where it gets interesting. You will feel challanged and it's damn fun! Later on, almost at the end of the game, the challange is not that much there anymore as you have all sorts of crazy augmentations, you feel like you could take on an army but I believe that was intentional, you're slowly becoming a ""super human"" and as the doctor said, you simply kick♥♥♥♥♥harder!That all is nice and dandy but what about the AI? That part is honestly week, enemies can't jump over obstackles so you can hide from the easily and even tho they should know where you are, they will not go after you, they don't know how. Or another example where enemies are standing above you, they know you're below them, they shoot into the groud, but are they going to go after you when right in front of them is a drop down where they could get you? no... no that won't happen. I have also encountered a strange bug where sometimes when I would re-enter a location with enemies or simply run away a bit and come back, the enemies would just stand there, doing nothing and I could kill them with no trouble. That happened twice to me and once on a boss fight, made the boss a laugh as you can imagine. But these bugs weren't frequent and I have no clue what causes them.Mentioned hacking didn't we, well outside of humans, you can destroy cameras and turrets with hacking too, makes going through a heavily guarded location easier. Hacking is very simple, you shoot the shield long enough untill it goes away, you get close to the target and click the action you want to do and wait while ""viruses"" will try and approach you. If too many are going to get to you, you're going to lose focus too quickly and droping to 0 will cause you to lose 50 HP and you'll have to re-do the hacking. but it's really easy and the viruses are not smart. they will get ""stuck"" behind the objeck you're hacking and there's no escape for them, they just blindly follow your direction. Again the AI is kinda sucky. And you have computer hacking where you'll get to read personal e-mails, steal some savings and get EXP. That's a whole new mini-game and I though I wouldn't like it much but I did. It's fun hacking into a computer.The story is pretty good! And it kept me going untill the end, you're going to uncover many secrets about some organizations and about yourself as well. There are more endings too, I am not quite sure how many, I want to say there are 4 of them as you have to make some decisions towards the end that will affect it. But there might be a bit more, aside from that there's not that many reasons to re-play the game, I didn't notice any ""new game+"" you simply have to start over, there are no ""rendom events"" that I am aware of that would make the game more interesting. Maybe chosing a higher difficulty would give it some spice again. Side quests are here and there's quite a few of them. All of them have their own stories that are surprisingly interesting as well. You're going to find an old man on the street that might seem crazy to you, talking about a plan to save the world and he needs some pils to make the voices go away. YOu get him his pils and he's going to tell you to hack 5 machines... cola dispenser and the like, so he can get a ""cut"" from all purchases. You do that and later on you're going to notice he's not at his usuall spot on the street anymore, you can later find his shop that he opened, you helped the man get off the street and do something for himself. You'll have to find out for yourself what happened to the plan to save the world *wink wink*. All the side quests have some story like this and I loved them!Some mechanical flaws... You can't save the game yourself, insted it saves automaticly when you enter a different area. That's in place so you can't ""cheat"" your way through dialogue trees when the game gives you 3 options to try and convince someone, only one of them is right. You could simply save and load to get it right. Problem is, you can still do that... It's just less convenient and not being able to save yourself can cause you to lose some progress. Not too much progress but still. Let's say you fought your way to a boss but you don't feel like going after him right now and will do it tommorow. You exit the game and the next time you load in, you'll find yourself at the enterance to the area again. Can be a bit frustrating.The voiceover is phenomenal, the characters really feel alive. The only voiced character who I didn't like was this asian lady, it's crystal clear that someone who isn't asian at all is trying hard to sound like one, but it isn't working out. But that's one voiced character out of many. Really the voiceovers are awesome +1 for that!All in all, the game has its flaws but there are many many more good things abut this game, that I can overlook it. I don't like scoring but I'd put the game at 7/10, still above average but not quite at the top yet. Is it worth your time? Totaly! If you're not put off by the setting of this game, you'll love it. I wish there were more games like this.			"

												It's a full-blooded cRPG in the shell of a side-scrolling platformer, which is set in a cyberpunk dystopian universe. You play as a fragment of artificial intelligence in the body of a young woman. The plot may be associated for example with Blade Runner, GITS and Neuromancer, so - as you can imagine - among the main topics you will find: society controlled by corporations, hacking and transhumanism. The majority of quests can be completed in many ways and some of them have an impact on the other. Progression of our protagonist allows both fight stealthy as well as with Rambo’s style shooting and of course everything in between. You can read in many articles that the whole combat mechanics in this game is poorly made, but it's b u l l s h i t, although it seems to me that the aiming guns is cumbersome sometimes.This Dreadlocks Ltd. production has got interesting dialogues and stories sewn into e-mails, fantastic voice-acting, great soundtrack and brilliant atmosphere. I think that only difficulty curve is a huge problem, because at the beginning everything is extremely demanding, but after we install implants and so on, the game gets much easier (fortunately, the story becomes better with our progression). Dex has been rated as average by many reviewers, but in my opinion, it is a true gem that shouldn't be missed by h+ narrative fans.			"

												Dex is an interesting game, and on a fairly short list of side-scroller platforming RPGs. For that alone, I feel it's worth recommending for people who are interested in exploring open-world 2D RPG design as a concept. Dex has a traditional open-world RPG quest structure, but in a 2D package, so that's interesting.It is also a well executed cyberpunk story, so cyberpunk fans should play Dex. It has a few interesting characters, a couple of needless tropes, but breaks convention enough so that it doesn't feel like a string of cliches. Note I didn't really feel this way until the last 25% of the game (I retained my skepticism until then), but that's when everything really comes to a head. If you start the game and feel skeptical about the storytelling, I'd say stick with it.The RPG and action gameplay systems are fairly shallow. Like most action/exploration games with unlock systems, the unlockables which provide unique methods of access are your highest priority. I don't consider this a spoiler. It's just gamer logic. Anything that can be overcome with skill is low priority. Anything that cannot be overcome with skill is high priority. For this reason, all the 2-point abilities are really the most impactful in the game. Once you have these, you can really experience all the game's content and level up your preferred playstyle.That leads to my next point - this game is really not about playstyle. It's not that kind of RPG where your character build changes how you play. You'll always need combat and hacking. You can neglect melee or ranged weapons, but really you'd just be shorting yourself, not really exploring a unique playstyle IMO.On ""Classic"" difficulty, I found the game to be pretty darn easy after getting some of the game's more powerful cyber augments, and it never really stepped up the challenge to a threatening level again.  If you are expecting to make difficult combat choices, Dex does not deliver, and can be tedious there. The hacking minigame is a twin-stick shooter, and you should know that, because it's required. If you hate that idea, then you have been warned. I like twin-stick shooters so while it wasn't the best abstraction of ""hacking"" that I've ever seen, it was fine with me.Based on gameplay alone, I could see why people would not recommend Dex. It's just fundamentally shallow in the gameplay / skill department. But I think the exploration, art, voice acting, music and story makes up for it.Anyway, the best compliment I can give to Dex is that one of its story choices was so difficult that I quit the game for the night and came back the next day before I could decide. I evaluated my own values (as a HUMAN) to make my decision, and ultimately knew my conclusion was personal and subjective. Most games' writing are not nuanced enough for that, so hats off to Dex.Beaten in about 24 hours, all sidequests complete.			"

												Dex is a game that I had heard nothing about. Yet oddly is one of the best damn Cyberpunk style games I have seen in the last couple of years. Everything feels alive and detailed in this side-scrolling, open-world cyberpunk RPG.  The story is simple enough with familiar tones. Huge mega corporations wants you for some nefarious reason. Along the way you meet all sorts of different characters. What I love about Dex is that each of these character has so much detail to them. They feel like they have lived in this city their entire lives. The art of Dex is something that drew my eyes and I couldn't look away. Grand spectacles like the signs of the Aphrodite club. To the zoomed in details of a flickering sign. All of this and more has an extreme attention to detail. The combat/leveling aspects to Dex are not as robust as something like Shadowrun. It still manages to give you a feeling of customization to Dex. Picking up Lockpicking instead of combat skills or Hacking over health all can affect your style of play and how you move through a mission. Speaking of missions they are EVERYWHERE in this game. I seemingly found something or someone who had a job for me behind every nit and cranny. So rather your blasting your way through the doors or talking your way in. Dex is a game with many paths. To top off the cake that is Dex. You have full controller support, voice acting, hacking, and more! Honestly if your a fan of Cyberpunk, Open world games, or love pixel art. Get Dex. It will be worth your time and money.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												This game came as a bit of disappointment to me.  In short, Dex is a 2D cyberpunk game that tries to take a page from Deus Ex (D.EX? doho) but fails in execution for both story and gameplay.-Story-The story consists of the protagonist waking up in her apartment, mysterious cyber figure contacts you and tells you to run from the incoming super soldier hit squad, and in her escape falls into cahoots with some hacker buddies to overthrow the superpower organization controlling everything in the gritty dystopian cyber future.  It felt too rushed and escalated far too quickly, going almost directly to the evil-super-controller-group that you have to stop for impending doom reasons.  A lot of the side quests are kind of set aside from this and deal with criminal gangs and corporate meddling and helping out the little guy.  I didn't feel like any of the characters you meet are all that likeable, including the protagonist.  Her voice acting is lacking in the few scenes its voiced.  I think it makes sense why they excluded it as it works the same as in Bethesda RPGs, but that plus the very weak action noises from the VA make the main character seem fairly vapid.  Her dialogue and that of everyone else in the game just doesn't feel right.  Its hard to say why, being neither a voice-person nor a writer myself, but they lacked punch.  Characters express distress without evoking sympathy, curse appropriately but don't feel convincing, get angry but don't seem honest when they drop their temper a second later, and so on.  Sometimes a great story can help carry less entertaining gameplay, but that is not the case here.-Gamplay-The gameplay here suffers from a lack of refinement, and there's no getting around that.  Despite the similarities in presentation, this game has none of the refinement of a 2D Castelvania game in either action or platforming.  There's just enough feeling of clunk in platforming to feel unsatisfying, from things like headbumping on ceilings to missed jumps.  Combat is completely lacking, and is also is a significant factor in the problem of poor game balance that Dex suffers from.  I'll discuss that in the next paragraph.  Hacking is presented as a fairly simple and uninteresting shmup minigame that is never rewarding.  All encounters in it are cheesable and lack any depth.  The world you play in is fairly small as well, giving you barely more than a few screens to play about in any area, and there aren't any interesting puzzles or paths to be found either, but with the lack of refinement in this title adding more length would not have helped much I think.Now down to the nitty gritty - the game balance.  Its poor, and there's a lot of examples of this so I'll go off ranting about a few.Enemies come in a few varieties, and only one is a difficulty.  There's melee gangs members, gun gangers, and giant gang members.  Then, business suit variants of the same.  Lastly, there's armored soldiers.  Every enemy in this game except the giant and the armored one can be disabled by a takedown from behind or while stunned.  You have an ability to pause the action and 'hack' (stun) an enemy at any time while presumably playing a shmup minigame that in actuality has no meaningful resource cost and almost can't be failed even with no hacking upgrades if you possess any modicum of skill at video games.  Thus the easiest strategy is to run at every enemy (almost always encountered looking away from you) mashing the takedown button, and then stunning each nearby enemy one by one and repeating.  The giant ganger poses no threat due to poor AI and bad hitboxes on his attacks leading to easy stunlocks from your basic no-upgrade 2 hit combo and walking through his sprite.  Just take him out last when in groups.  The armored soldier is easy to stunlock as they don't shoot their gun in melee range and melee attacks in this game can be blocked.  Thus they are only a problem if there's more than one, because they can't be 1-hit-takedowned and chain-stunning is somewhat impractical.  The other problem enemy is gun turrets.  Hacking them off spawns two moderate HP enemies in the shmup minigame that aren't trivial to tackle, but a 3 skill point investment that halves hacking time solves that completely as one of the enemies doesn't even reach you in time before the hack completes.  That is the only situation in the game where any enemy is a problem.  There are some robot drones but they are in a 30 second escape sequence and as such you shouldn't really be fighting them anyway, and they never appear after that.  Hacking to stun an enemy costs no meaningful resource but the player's time as in any instanced encounter apart from the main city there will be a free Focus refill (aka Hacking HP), and in the city there is one that can and should be fast traveled to rather than wasting money on consumables as all the trip to the refill costs is a bit of time.  This ties into the upgrade / level up system.  All these above I describe was with no upgrades.  At a point in the game I was floating 21 skill points because I found nothing worth investing them in after putting 3 into lockpicking and charisma each to max them as they add accessibility options for character interaction and the environment.  At the end of the game I began to dump them en masse into combat (never needed), endurance (HP was irrelevant) and a bit into hacking for ease of life by adding an extra shot to your ship in the shmup minigame.  You can also upgrade yourself with implants, and the game recommends that you should plan ahead because you wont have enough slots for all of them.  Its a bit of a throwback to Deus Ex, but ultimately its clear which ones are worthless and which ones are indispensible.  Hi-jump for platforming, gas immunity because the game requires it for a quest anyway, and HP regen because otherwise you have to fast travel back to the doctor over and over again which unlike the Focus refills actually does cost money.  This is a convenience feature as HP restoring items are a bit of a hassle to meaningfully use in action and end up costing a fair amount.  So does the HP regen implant but then you don't have to menu dive or fast travel anymore and can just get on with the game while your HP ticks back to full.  There's no gun customization, but really you never need to use it anyway.  There's a consumable stealth item, but enemies aren't a threat and its too short of a duration.  There's no impetus to play other character archetypes when they cost resources and are more of a hassle to play than  doing hack-takedowns. -Performance-The game ran fine on my PC (i5 6600, GTX 970, 16gb mem), had an enemy slowly fall through the floor once but otherwise there were no bugs.  I played with KBM, and controls are not rebindable though which is an annoyance as some of the bindings are oh-so-slightly clunky.   There's some graphic settings, but this is a pixel art game.  The effects and art in this game aren't high quality enough to warrant meaningful graphics adjustments and the game is not especially pretty to look at anyway.  The game runs about 9 hours of playtime for a first playthrough, doing most side quests.-Conclusion-In summary, this game seemed to try to take a big page from Deus Ex and failed to make something either deep in story or fun to play.  As such I can't recommend it, even on sale.  It just never felt fun or like I wanted to hear what would come next.  Just pass on it, your time would be better spent on something else.			"

												A 2D platformer/RPG hybrid... essentially a sidescroller take on Deus Ex with some Metroidvania elements thrown into the mix.Unfortunately, the game's main failing is being neither truly exceptional nor memorably bad: to take a phrase from TV Tropes, it's ""so okay, it's average"".Dex is unquestionably a well-crafted game... and yet, somehow it failed to really capture my attention fully. Finishing it didn't quite feel satisfying, as if something was missing.As someone who adores classic CRPGs, metroidvania mechanics and cyberpunk genre, I'd say that Dex is worth a try - but your mileage may vary.

												Dex has a pretty great atmosphere, a good story and I like the graphics, but it wasn't the game for me.Pro'sCool cyberpunk theme which sets a great toneGood main storyline with multiple endingsGood soundtrack and voice actingDifficulty level is quite high, there's no hand-holding. It's pretty hard to get into in the beginning and the quests make you use your brainNice looking graphicsCons Combat played out pretty poor. In melee when you strike/kick, you move forward a little so you can ""pass through"" an enemy and suddenly not be hitting them anymore. Also when you stun them they get an invulnerability window. So okay, it's not melee friendly. So I tried ranged combat. The aiming system was responding very badly, and as a result you either aim too high or too low. I used a controller so maybe it's different with a keyboard/mouse combination, but it essentially came down to both melee and ranged being worthless for their own reasons. The hacking minigame isn't actually a minigame in the sense that it's mandatory to use often, but is yet designed as a minigame so it's really simple in its nature. After hacking a few times it just got boring.The game seemed like a really vast world, but I was done with the game in less than 8 hours. I even went back to check if I missed things but it didn't seem like it.This game's trailer really points out all the great assets the game has to offer. And it's really not that bad at all. But if you're expecting there's more than what you see in the trailer you'll be dissapointed. It was an okay game, but not so great that I would recommend it to others.			"

												Dex wears its roots pretty openly on its sleeve: this is a fantastic 2D interpretation of Deus Ex.Perhaps one of the most brillaint aspects of Dex is how it naturally gates its content through very simple means: as you start off with nothing, enemies with guns are terrifyingly lethal. Even after acquiring a simple weapon, you're vastly outnumbered many times, and your profficiency with weapons is probably low.But this changes - you get better weapons, more ammo (so you can use the weapon more readily), you learn to sneak better, and the real game changer: you get augmented. Still, I played nearly half the game (this is including optional side quests) before getting augmented, so you can spend a good chunk of time navigating the world and challenges without super powers to help you.The world itself is also a joy to navigate, as it is a concise, yet densly packed urban sprawl. You can quickly navigate between areas by quick traveling to nearly any visited area (there are about three exceptions, between the sewers, a side quest area, and a main story area), making it simple to go from one objective to the next, even if they're on opposite ends of the map. This is something lots of 3D games struggle with, as you have large maps, but vast expanses of map that serve only to make you spend time traveling, and wind up being fairly sparse on content.Combat is engaging and fairly straightforward: I found myself using melee in most situations, with guns being a decisive way to quickly end a fight; money and ammo is plentiful enough that it would be possible to focus more on ranged combat, however. Weapon handling is more complex than simply pointing and clicking, as further distances reduce your accuracy, and you have to sacrifice speed in order to use a gun. For me, this created a fun, yet tense combat environment, especially as you tried to contend with multiple enemies.To round everything off, Dex features a fantastic, eccentric cast of fully voiced characters (something I wasn't expecting), and each of them plays a part in some part of the game.Overall, Dex offers a rich 2D cyber-distopian RPG, all within 15 - 20 hours (a timespan I can definitely appreciate with ever dwindling free time).

												Wow.  What a fantastic game this is.  I thoroughly enjoyed every little bit of it - explored every little nook and cranny that I could conceivably think to find, and it looks like I might've still missed a thing or two.This game is a really well written game.  It performs well, it has just the right amount of humor and intrigue, never takes itself entirely seriously, and definitely doesn't overstay its welcome.The only negative is that the combat isn't the best.  It could use some refinement, especially in the later levels, but a thorough player will find themselves able to power through just about everything in the game.  I enjoyed it, and I think you would too.			"

Early Access Review
								As a Kickstarter backer I'm pleased how the first alpha turned out. There are some issues though, such as inventory bugs when using weapons (sometimes they work, sometimes they don't) and some control related issues. Certainly, this game is meant to be played on a gamepad, but there should be options for alternative controls as well. I tried to play it on a keyboard on my MacBook Pro and I can't say I liked the experience when it comes to controls... actually there are lots of things to gripe about, but again, this is an early alpha.It does show promise and it really is reminiscent of Blackthorne in many ways (except BT was more natural to play on a keyboard). The atmosphere is definitely what I've would have wished for when it comes to gloominess and music, but in many ways many elements of the game (such as lockpicking) feel like placeholders for true mechanics - which is ok at this stage.The game does have potential, but it's still far from a decent beta stage.

												There is a lot of references to bugs, and I've made a few myself, but as of the last patch, the PC version is working perfectly well for me. The only niggling problem is that it uses a savepoint system.The game itself is very, very nice. I like it a lot. Good characters, good stories (BioFarm's subplot was quite well made - especially for the bit where I started thinking 'hey, they're the good guys here... that can't be right.'.). One of my doubts about the game was because it looked a bit like an arcade platformer. It's not. It's definitely an RPG in a 2D side scrolling world, with a few platforms.This sort of game often has a lot of issues because of its very non-linear approach to mission playing and solving. I've run into surprisingly few of those. Sure, it's not perfect, it is sometimes confusing, but it also lets you go (almost) anywhere from the start. I like that a lot. It feels more like a world than a game (once you're let loose in it, that is.).I've had a lot of fun with the game, thanks Dreads. :)			"

												I've just finished it.My character was lvl 17 in the end (I didn't buy all +XP items ). Everything was maxed out except for barter (0/2) and range (2/6). I found & bought some +1 skill points items though17 hours total gameplay (I think it's actually less than that coz I was afk several times and left the game running, so more likely ~15-16 hours. And I play games kinda slow.2 quests were still not finished ( antique antics & the bugged one - chemicals and stimpacks)Singularity ending (the one I chose) has a lame cutscene and it looks rushed as if it was made just for the sake of having a second ending.Ranged combat is atrocious. =))Some minor bugs here and here, nothing major afaik.Great cyberpunk  setting and atmosphere. I wish locations were larger ,they are really small.A very good voice over  and writing. Fantastic  soundtrack.The story is engaging and compelling.Anyway, great game not without some flaws.			"

								Greate game, esspecialy for early access. I'll start out with the positives.+The few missions there are turn out to be fun and engaging+Combat is fun and difficult, which puts more emphisis on stealth.+Stealth system is greate+Movement is fun and fluid+Wonderful stylized graphics+Very smooth animationNow the negatives-In areas with lots of people or particle effects the game slows down a bit (May just be my pc)-Even if you zoom out(Scrollwheel) Enemies can see you at a greater difference than you can see them-Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish things from foreground to background-Not any story, and barley any missions.-World is pretty smallOverall, it's a greate game, and totaly worth the money even in this state. With the difficulty level it'll take you at least a few hours, and with a planned release at the end of 2014, I'm sure the world will be expanding shortly, as well as graphics options  in case you have a terrible computer like me.

												I found this game very strange. The combat is not that interesting, its actually pretty basic. Upgrades and progression are kind of interesting but not that much. Hacking is entertaining but nothing ground breaking.Why I said the game is strange is because the game was amazing BECAUSE of those things. It felt very retro and captured the old game feel so incredibly well. I enjoyed this game a whole lot and felt so very immersed, I enjoyed all the characters and wanted to know more about them, I enjoyed exploring dangerous areas and going there way before I was supposed to, I enjoyed upgrading and buying equipment, and most of all I enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of the story.

												Do I recommend? Short answer: Yes. A few years ago, for Aprils Fools, Square Enix teased a 2D demake of deus ex: human revolution. And like many people, I didn't actually think it would be the worst idea ever. Dex comes close to being that game. The area you explore is probably not as big as a deus ex game but it's loaded with points of interest and side quests. Play the augments right and you'll have full access to pretty much everywhere long before the game ends and there is plenty to discover as you go along. The plot line is pretty standard cyber-punk, man-or-machine fare and the twists aren't too suprising, but I think the voice acting and writing do a good job of carrying the game. So overall, I'd say that if you like RPG, cyberpunk, and free form gameplay and aren't hung up on having only the shiniest graphics, then you're not going to be sad spending money on this.The free DLC they released also adds some pretty cool tech, so be sure to add that to your account, if you buy the game.

												With absolutely no hyperbole or exaggeration, I consider this game to be amongst the pinnacle of both cyberpunk and 2D scrollers. I fell in love with the art style and the gameplay ideals way back during the Kickstarter and when a friend let me test his pre-release demo, I was utterly hooked and then the full game launched and dialled everything right up. The music, the visual style, the expansive maps, the combat and even the Matrix/cyberspace segments were all incredibly well realised, I loved the characters and I loved the world. It's not a perfect game, it really isn't, sometimes poor animations, no clear indication of foreground and background separation and with pre and post release bugs that really put a dampener on the overall experience.. though the developers stepped up every time and worked their damnedest to fix them. The save system though, that truly is a mess and it took a long time with a truly confusing and nonfunctional part of it to just be flat out removed instead. Once you get to grips with the terrible save system (and this is a Unity game so saves are stored in registry too, so bad) and the foreground/background issues, you can find a true gem here.What the devs have crafted is now, and will remain always, a benchmark to me for 2D RPGs and cyberpunk worlds and I'm absolutely gutted that this is such an underutilised scenario.. there are just so few, if any, 2D scrolling RPGs like this and even fewer scifi/cyber ones, all I can hope is that the success of this encourages more developers to release games like this.... and it has to be said, the cyberspace implementation in this felt more intuitive and engrossing and enjoyable, than any I'd seen so far - outside of the Shadowrun SNES/MD versions. Even the, frankly magnificent, Shadowrun Returns series has incredibly lacklustre cyberspace segments in comparison. This is how it's done guys, really!			"

												TLDR - Great cyberpunk game, be sure to use the free DLC. Dex is definitely my kinda game. I saw it at GDC Next 2014 at The MIX booth, where I got a review key for a broadcast on my channels. I don't think it was completely finished at that point, so I had my fun with it but put it on the shelf. I finally came back to it recently, and played through the full ~10 hours of gameplay offered in the span of a week, picking at it here and there when I could, often sitting and playing more than I really intended in any given sitting.I like Cyberpunk and there's a damn good reason - dystopian near-future where we are relying on modern technology while still struggling like the working class of really any era. Instead of cell phones and internet, it takes things a step up to cybernetic implants for medical aid, augmentation, pure aesthetics, and direct access to networks with a datajack in your brain. Even more, corporations have gotten so powerful that they have no qualms about overriding police and local laws to do whatever they want. All of this is represented quite well in Dex, and stays completely true to the style in every way.For story, single play-through 10/10, and there's the option to save frequently in different slots so you can replay each branching decision as desired. There are a lot of NPCs giving quests, but instead of feeling like a stupid grind, you really have a feeling of wanting to help these folks and engage in the intrigue related to their request. Gameplay gets 8/10. Some stiffness, some awkwardness, but I really like the perpetual AR layer and the hacking sections. I also liked that enemies never respawn unless an area is being repopulated, which is extremely rare. It means getting lost is no biggie because you are still making progress (even grabbing clues for later quests), and it also means that enemies aren't able to be farmed to pursue max level. I also didn't know there was a free DLC with 3 extra suits that have bonuses, which I easily would have gotten through gameplay if I'd included the DLC when I started. Combat itself mainly resorted to AR hacking enemies and using takedown for an instant kill, and for the two enemies that doesn't work on I either punch-and-roll or pull out the shotgun or SMG and close in for heavy damage. There are many ways to play the game, but I found a particular way to be rather effective. Also, all NPC interactions are considered in a box rather than a rectangle, so it is easy to exploit left and right screen edges but top and bottom are clipped relative to AI interactions. Melee weapons would have been nice, too. Art gets 9.5/10 - its beautiful, I just wish there were a few more frames for many of the animations to help smooth out some of the stiffness. Everything looks grimy and run-down, even in the nice areas, just as I'd expect for the style. Audio gets 8/10. The voice actingis great, and everything sounds the part, but the fidelity and overall quality of the sounds wasn't particularly memorable to me. I wish there was more of this game, or more in this environment. Very fun, very cyberpunk, definitely kept me playing. I also would have hoped for a bit more agency and choices mattering, as it seemed like many of my choices had the same result plus or minus a transaction or some extra experience. But that would have made it a much larger project - it would potentially still be in the works!And a little bit more, if you are interested.... but it is definitely spoilerish.Lockpick 2 gets you into 90% of the game. I got that and Charisma up to level 2 ASAP, followed by AR. I dunno how much Charisma 2 actually helped me. Afterwards I went endurance for max implants, but I feel like the only purchased implants I needed were jump, gas resist, elec resist, and health regeneration, and the rest were just filler. AR 2 is key though, it lets you safely hack all cameras, sentry turrets, and enemies, with extremely low chance of sustaining focus damage. AR early, AR often, you technically don't ever need to take any damage from anything after AR 2 is unlocked.Crash's safe code is a pile of crap to solve. Its a very obscure code and clue - just look it up when you get to that point in the game. I never found Mr. Finch's safe code or clues either that I'm aware of, but I doubt what he had was important. When you get the final gun in the glass chamber, feel free to use it on all your non-takedown adversaries, as you'll find 5-6 magazines for it and likely not need every shot. The final battle really is as easy as it seems, just don't get bored and you'll eventualy get through it.  "

												The closest comparison I can draw Dex to is the Shadowrun game on SNES, if it were played from a 2D-platformer perspective instead of isometrically. There's almost nothing not to like here. Dex is a great heroine, the combat is solid, the world-building is complete and fluid... There may not be anything particularly thought-provoking or mind-blowing in regards to the plot, but everything Dreadlocks attempts to do with Dex, they do effectively and the result is a near-masterpiece. Highly recommended.			"

												I started playing again post October patch and I have encountered no savegame errors. The game is now stable as any other. This game expectedly takes you to the 90s and makes you realize how good gaming can get. Things I like about it:+ The fluid gameplay that comes out of simplicity, no unnecessarily complex objectives,+ The characters; this game teaches you characters don't have to be 3D to come alive,+ The fast travel system runs so smoothly, glad it is here,+ The artwork for Dex and all other characters, scenery, etc. is lovely except for some areas/models which lack polish,+ The combat systemThings that would make it better:* A longer game with more areas to explore (maybe more cities and a few places outside the city limits) and more NPCs,* A difficulty setting* More melee moves,* A larger collection of implants/augments, * More guns, * More detailed dialogue trees and speech options,* Darker colors to have a noir feel, * Weather - especially rain.After the patch this game got a lot better and made me happy to have supported it.

OVERVIEWDex is a two-dimensional game played from a side-on point of view, mixing elements of platformers, action beat-em-ups, adventure, and role-playing games, all founded in a great original cyberpunk setting.It's the not-too-distant future. You play the titular Dex, a young woman thrust into an underground world of cyberspace hackers, violence, and retribution. Sounds good, hey?GraphicsThe graphics in Dex are, by and large, very good. From dank sewers, to dingy gang hideouts, to the apartment and bar interiors, the graphics do a great job of creating atmosphere. Busy locations are populated and areas are animated, so there's always something going on. The graphics really do portray the world well.Characters are mostly well drawn and animated. Strangely, I found Dex herself to be the most disappointing character, graphically speaking, as some of her animations and animation blending just seem a bit wooden. There are a few other animation blending issues as well, such as when a rolling enemy is stunned and then one-hit killed by Dex, the animations don't finish properly, but these are very minor.Graphic performance was very good on my five-year-old gaming laptop, with a predictable 2-3 second freeze when entering AR the first time, every time I played, as if the game was loading in resources. After that the game ran smoothly.SoundDEX is fully professionally voiced, with all interactions being both written and spoken. Most of the voices are very well done, too.Music is good, if somewhat forgettable, and sound effects are mostly very good, too. I found Dex's jumping sound effect a bit loud and grating, though, which was a shame considering how often jumping was required.GameplayAt its core, Dex is a 2D action platformer. You control Dex directly, running, jumping, ducking, hiding, and fighting your way from being a hip girl without a clue to eventually becoming an augmented hacker bad♥♥♥♥♥with an attitude.Where Dex comes into a league of its own, though, is by the addition of a great, if mostly linear, plot, a number of well-realised NPCs, and the addition of a number of role-playing game elements, such as character statistics and levels, experience points, inventory management, and a large number of side quests. The developers have elegantly ties all of this into the action platformer mould to create a game that's not quite like anything else I've played.It has full controller support, and I'd recommend using a controller, since it's much easier than the keyboard controls. That said, the right stick control being used to roll I found very hard to get used to, and would have much preferred to use left-stick + B instead. I couldn't see a way to configure this. Thankfully, the combat was easy enough throughout the game that even forgetting the controls on a regular basis didn't stop me from completing the game.After the introductory section, once the pace slows a little and your immediate goals become more complex than just ""run away"", the game falls into a rhythm of exploration, conversation, searching, combat, and completing side quests, as you build up your abilities and cash reserves, and eventually become augmented with cyberwear. After that point, although I continued to enjoy the story, I found that the game lost cohesion a bit: cyberspace became too easy and combat both too easy and rather tedious. But there was still definitely enough enjoyment to keep me going to the end.Steam tells me I've played Dex for 15 hours, which sounds about right. I've completed all side quests except for one missable collectible (and thus an achievement that I'll never bother to get), and I've had a ball. I won't bother playing it again, though, as the story is essentially linear, I've completed all of the side quests, and I can't be bothered going back through it all again just to get that one annoyingly missable achievement. And I guess that's the saddest thing about Dex: it doesn't quite have the replayability that comes with a good role-playing game; rather it's a game that you experience once, and move on.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Great atmosphere, setting, and story+ Very good writing+ Very good graphics+ Mostly very good voice actingCons:- Cyberspace and combat are rather repetitive, especially in the second half of the game- Basically no replayability, and missable Steam Achievements that make that extra frustrating- A few small bugs remain (e.g. animation blending issues, text not fitting in the text window during NPC interactions)- Game controls are not customisable enough, and I never got used to the default controller layoutCONCLUSIONDex is a great action / adventure / platformer game with role-playing elements, and it simply oozes the cyberpunk atmosphere that I love. It has a few faults, but I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves a good Cyberpunk story.I may not recommend it at full price, but it's regularly 50% and even 75% off, so pick it up on special and enjoy!8/10 "

												Dex is a Platformer, Action RPG, ""Open-World"", based on a Cyberpunk world.Dex have two gameplay styles, one as Dex(the platformer) and one while hacking stuff(Twin-Stick Shooter).I Strongly recommend for everybody who loves Flashback, Neuromancer and Deus-EX.One of best indie video games i ever played.The story is very solid, the gameplay is fine(i used a PS3 controller), and the musical textures sent you directly through the screen as you play.Great game, awesome moments.

												So Now I have just finished this game. Let me change something... And yes, there is only one place that I cannot find a way to access, and there is no game breaking bugs. This game just need a better in-game guide to make sure that the player knows what he/she is doing, and yes, in-game quest hints. The combat system is OK, and the story is not that bad, though I hope the developers can add some more things into the game, and make the storyline clearer. The main reason now I recommend this game is that, after finish the game, I feel I want more of it, which means the game is pretty fun and enjoyable. It is a good game that worth my time and money afterall. There might be some struggles in certain period in the game, but overall, after come through so many obstacles, I find myself some happiness. Sorry for the earlier review, though, didnt understant the game back then. Now I understand that it is not ""there is a bug"" it is just ""nobody tells me to hack that stupid computer in the drug store"". The developers promised to fix this issue, so I think I will be able to recommend this game to my friends afterwards. After all this game is worth playing, some problems in the beginning of this game is quite frustrating though, remember to check to steam discussion board when you face these problems, I have make some posts about these, and most of the problems can be solved easily.

												I've played this game like, maybe 10 times? That's how much fun it is. Nice sandbox, laid back, beat 'em up (the guns aren't well implemented; use your fists), cyberpunk, COOL. Like Metroid, Double Dragon and Deus Ex had a threesome and someone got pregnant.The problems that some had with this game I can only somewhat speak to: as far as I know any bugs have been fixed (elevators no longer kill you and I never had to deal with dying as soon as I entered a room as some have said to have). Guns though, well to be honest the guns in the game aren't very good. Even with your skill fully upgraded they don't work out that well. At any rate it's just easier to beat people up. But that's still fun. Also cyberspace is just a simple top down shooter, but that doesn't mean it's not fun!I'd say the game's trailer video speaks for it pretty well. If it looks like your kinda style, then it probably is.			"

								Its really got potential, but missing some things atm.Pro:Nice Art, interesting atmosphere, good musik (As far as i noticed), But:-When alarm goes off it stayes even with leaving the map, and appears on other maps.When you where in the redlight district triggered alarm and are in the slums ans the alarm reappears its quite nerving.-Combat is a bit ... difficult and very fast, you will die quiet often, first implant is without doupt the +200 HP implant.-The is no main storyline implemented (a shame but hopefully incoming)-When you sell things, they diappear when you close the merchant. So when you sell someting that is important for a quest ... its gone (you got 100$ ...aaaand its gone ....).-I don't know if an illegal doc is okay with an police officer standing right befor his clinic... just sayin'-there is no discription what which item is gonna do when you want to use is. didn't know that E-Drinks, Stims and food is healing the charakter so .... surprise D:-When you shoot into the air or in the crowd everybody duck an' cover but no one is screaming, no police is incoming so ... yeah ....Okay suma sumarumIts fun to play, difficult in combat, interface is dificult, it's got fast travel, implants, Because i like Shadowrun (The P&P RPG and the PC RPG) and different cyberpunks games this game gets bonus points, if anybody is wondering why i like it. its just hitting my taste.

												Deus Ex in two dimensional form is the easiest way to explain what this game's about.You explore a huge 2D city in a cyberpunk world, trying to solve a corporate conspiracy and finding all sorts of related sidequests along the way. The setting is rather inspired and well executed, with a proper sense of mystery and decay that'll be very familiar to pretty much anyone who already played, read or watched something in the cyberpunk genre.The gameplay is quite simplistic, offering constant combat that's mostly melee oriented, with some gunplay throw into the mix. It's possible to use different strategies as you go through the game, like taking enemies down through stealth, hacking skills or straight down shooting at everything you can see. The shooting is probably the weakest aspect of the game, but it's not a problem per se.There's a wide array of customization options available through cybernetic implants that give you stat boosts, as well as useful skills that complement stealth gameplay. You can also level your character up, which allows the player to spec their character in the way they find most useful (and fun!), and it gives that satisfying sense of progression that people so enjoy while playing RPGs or metroidvanias.Dex is an enjoyable experience that does everything it sets out to do competently. The combat has a few rough spots (and I almost forgot to mention that there's a hacking minigame that's sorta crap and will be forced on you quite a few times), so it's not a perfect game by any means, but it's a pretty good one still.

								Dex creates an incredibly vivid cyberpunk atmosphere to those seeking a nostalgic, oldschool gaming experience. Dex is a 2D sidescrolling RPG beat 'em up with an incredibly appealing artstyle. There is a lot of attention to detail, which enhances the immersive feel of the game. The Early Alpha Build of the game is not without its issues, but from what I have seen, I am sure to invest a great amount of time into it. If you like a cyberpunk atmosphere similar to Deus Ex and Shadowrun, be sure to pick up Dex.			"

Early Access Review
								As a big fan of classic 80's/90's cyberpunk I was really sold on this one from the aesthetic alone. There's a lot of potential in the design but as it stands Dex is still a way off from being the immersive experience it promises. The best aspect of the game currently is the environments; juxtaposing grime and gloom against neon and advanced  technology in the manner genre aficionados will know and love. It's a style which has become curiously nostalgic but it's thrilling nonetheless to see it realised so effectively in the side-scrolling format. There's plenty to explore, climb or break into even with much of the city still closed off and the main story/quest absent at present.Sadly the general gameplay doesn't fare so well; as many have noted gunplay is severely imbalanced at present, with off-screen enemies chipping away at your health bar often making more challenging combat encounters frustrating and unfair. Hand to hand fighting is much better but is still hampered by the imbalances and the fixed control scheme. It should also be mentioned that the experience is frequently marred by the plethora of current bugs. I was stopped from exploring one building completely as I got stuck in the doorway, while I've also had guns disappearing or requiring reloads in-spite of a full clips. Dialogue could use some polish too being riddled with grammatical errors and bizarre wording, it's a small gripe but another area where I find my immersion being broken. If the game is to deliver on its story heavy focus the delivery is key.The bottom line; as an early access title none of this should be particularly surprising. What's in place is looking very good and I'm sure the rough edges will be tidied up in ensuing updates.  I'd recommend it on this promise alone but with the caution that at present much remains to be delivered and that frustration is still a little too frequent for this build to be enjoyable. Regardless,  cyberpunk enthusiasts should keep an eye on this one. I'm sure the support will be well worth it in the long run.  "

												I haven't written many reviews but I decided to with this game. I jumpped on late development because I really wanted a more action oriented cyberpunk game and stumbled upon this one. I have yet to run into any bug that has diminished my expirience and find this game very good in it's creation. One bug though that I encountered is the save bug where if I save in an area and I load some progress in the story did not seem to be saved but it was not like it was hours lost, just a single conversation or so but personally I expected something because this is an indie game. Overall I think it's fantastic and will continue playing it. If you read through the forums you'll find out what bugs people are talking about, as for me I still think this game is worth it and as for those that don't like how the quests are handled. IMHO just shows how sad gamers have gotten with the ""held by the hand"" RPGS I remember a time where you had to go around to find out what to do, that was the whole fun about RPGs, paying attention to the story and dialogue and then remembering where to find the next clue. not being told exactly what to do is what makes an RPG an RPG and makes you think. If you can get over the slight bugs and the fact this game does not hold you by the hand on quests I say pick it up.			"

												Story and Art look great. Movement feels awfully rigid and there aren't animations between different movements.  Jumping feels really terrible, you stop suddenly, jump, land and then stop suddenly, no slide or roll or short run to slow down.  There's not really that many visual or aural cues in the game, it's difficult to tell where toxic gas starts and ends and sometimes steam hits you when it looks like it shouldn't be hitting you.  Saving saves the game from the point when you entered the zone from what i can tell, not up to the point where you currently are which is a major pain.  If the devs made movement more fluid, added more visual and aural cues and sorted the save system i reckon i'd be able to reccomend it to others but as it stands... i almost wish i could get a refund.

												Dex is an open-world 2D platformer focused on exploration, and it does what it aims to do very well. It falls a little short on the combat and stealth aspects, but those do get better with level. About the mechanics:Melee - Melee combat is all about figuering out which moves your enemy has. Block when he attacks, attack when he stops blocking. The combat becomes a bit of a dance that you just do over and over until the enemy dies. Not very hard, not very exciting. If you fight several enemies at the same time, they will attack you 1 by 1 (unless one of them has a gun).Ranged - Ranged combat is probably the least developed. You basically just stand there and shoot. Headshots do more damage. You can't move while shooting, you can't get in cover (for the most part), all you do is stand there and shoot. I pretty much gave up on this option completely.Stealth - There are some ""hiding spots"" where enemies can't see you, stealth takedowns and an invisibilty upgrade eventually. Enemies are pretty stupid so taking them out stealthily is pretty easy. If you're detected, you can just run away and wait for them to forget you.Hacking - Probably the most useful skill you have. Hacking cameras is crucial for stealth, hacking turrets makes them attack your enemies and hacking computers is necessary for many quests. As for the mechanic itself, it's kind of a bullet-hell thing where you travel around ""cyberspace"" and shoot viruses or something. It's nice but gets repetitive fast.The story is pretty good, but the main questline is so short that you don't have enough time to get attached to the main characters, making the whole thing lack impact. Still, the idea itself is neat and the characters are well written and acted.As for the open-world exploration aspect, it was really fun. Lots of places to go and things to find.Character advancement is also very satisfying, with implants and outfits (free DLC required) making a real difference to gameplay. Last but not least, the graphics are very cool hand drawn art. There's a lot of attention to detail and some unexpectedly cool animations.Overall, I very much recommend it when on sale. It would be worth full price, but it's a little too short imo			"

												TL/DR Version: a poor man's deus ex, but a good one. Get this gem when it's on sale ! The game has some issues, but none are gamebreaking.Long Version:I guess you've watched the trailers and screenshots so you know what this game looks like...so rather talk about the rest.- the music is excellent, reminds me of the first deus ex ambient music. Each district has his own ambient music which fit's the theme. This is really good for immersion and makes this game stand out.- there are 3 endings, depending on your choices. Sadly the game offers no replay value other than trying a second playthrough with a different skilltree and some different choices. Protip: finish the game on melee, then redo it ranged style (it's more difficult). The campaign with all sidequests is about 15 hours.- the hacking minigame is nice and spices up the game a bit.- each dialogue is voiced (!!!)- the combat is a bit bland at first, but becomes better later on, as you invest in skills and learn new tricks.- speaking of implants, the augmentation system is nice, but really simple. 3 augs are necessary for the game and can be used without investing in the skill...but you can add more implants, for example to see the viewcones of the enemies (if you want to go stealthy). Speaking of stealth, most enemies can be stealth killed so it's definetely worth to go stealth.- from a pure gameplay aspect, the game is not impressive, but the combination of story, voice acting, music and ambiance makes this a small little gem if you like the cyberpunk genre.

												I enjoyed my experience with Dex.  It has a nice Cyberpunk 2d old school feel.  For $5 this game was definitely worth it.  The gameplay did not get boring at all and the side quests were enjoyable.  A lot of picking up certain items but they were grouped well and I never found that I had to go too far out of the way to complete one.  It has light Metroid exploration type  gameplay with a mix of NES Double Dragon thrown in.  The story wasn't anything too special but it wasn't bad and did a good job of moving things along.  The mini game (hacking) was pretty good also and broke up the 2d segments nicely.  Overall I would recommend this game if you enjoyed any of the games that I mentioned or enjoy a good Cyberpunk storyline.			"

Early Access Review
								For those that played Another World and Flashback back in the day can really appriciate the feel this game has, those that enjoyed Shadowrunner on Snes and as a Pen and paper RPG will also enjoy it.I loved this, and cannot wait for it to become a finished product, the only flaws that I can really complain about is the Firearms and how they work. Reload while running would be nice, and perhaps a toggle function on X for the firearm draw function.but I am sure that such things will be fixed before the game is finished. Also a Stealth skill and augmentations would be cool. I know that there are some that reduces noice made and the two innate implants to see sound waves you make and where the enemy is looking, but I would like some improvement to stealth. Skills that reduces noice production, and perhaps something from Alpha Protocol that makes it so that once you are seen you become invisibile for a few seconds to give you time to hide again. Those kind of things would I really enjoy to see, and if camo augments get added the camo augment could improve that ability.Regardless, this game is a true cyberpunk game and I cannot wait for it to be finished.

												After playing through the main story of Dex, I felt relieved. I don't know if it was because of the ending, or the game itself. Let's just start with the gameplay. The gameplay handles as well as you would expect an Action-RPG Sidescroller, but then it can shift into some BULLET-HELL STUFF WHERE YOU'RE IN THE NETWORK. Whenever the game shifted into the bullet-hell gameplay, I felt the game was slowing down. I was bored and it was tedious. Thankfully, during the main story it isn't required all too often. The controls however, were a little clunky. If you try to aim straight down below you, the screen would just make a teleportation maneuver and bring you to the side of the screen. Your cursor would stay where it was.The graphics are pixelated, so think Metal Slug, but with a lot more pixels. The cutscenes are still images that are like a slide show. With a bit of animation.The story at the end was a bit confusing, but the game does give a bit of a twist, so hey there's that at the end.So all in all, was this game good?YesIs it worth 19.99 USD full price?Sadly, no. Maybe get it when the price lowers?			"

												One of the best games i have played. Read what the game is about and you should not be disappointed. Not sure why people thumb this game down because of the graphics and animation? if you take two seconds to look at the store page and can go beyond the graphics an amazing story and a very enjoyable game await you.Might be for the more mature gamer.

												I wasn't sure what to think about this game when I first discovered it. The preview videos showed what looked like a very exciting game, one that caters to my interests, but the reviews were highly mixed. I chalk it up to two possible reasons. One, people might have been playing a buggier, early version, and two I think this game caters to a certain demographic.I played the post-May 22nd version, 2.0.2.4, I believe. While it still has some bugs, they weren't anything too distracting, showing up in only a couple of spots.As for the demographics, I grew up on games like Flashback on the original Playstation. When I saw this game, that was the first game to come to mind. I highly enjoyed Flashback; it's one of the few games that I played through on each difficulty level. For those who like Flashback, I highly recommend this game. It has much of the same mechanics and feel, as a side-scrolling sci-fi with a compelling story line.This game also conjurs up memories of Abuse. The game's choice to shoot with the mouse and move with the keyboard mimics Abuse, but only in cyberspace can you do both at the same time.And, finally, there's Beneath A Steel Sky. These games share themes, and perhaps quantity of dialog.Speaking of dialog, this game's hired top notch voice actors. The woman who voiced Miranda is incredible, in my opinion. Though, there are certain points where the actors didn't know how to pronounce some of the words, and I don't think that was intentional.The graphics are fantastic, if you like this style. It fits right at home with the aformentioned games in that regard. Dex's animations are very fluid. The music is great, and was never annoying. The muisc would change as you got into a combat situation ala Flashback. Probably the thing I least liked about this game was the ending. But, I had enjoyed playing so much that I can't dock it too many points. It wasn't the goal, but the journey that I liked, and that is as much as anything the mark of a good game.			"

												Dex is a very good game.The world seems small for a metroidvania, but does not suffer for it's size.As far as the RPG aspect of it, Dex does pretty well. There are multiple outcomes to quests, which affect things in both the short & long term. & the story is fairly compelling.Combat takes a little getting used to, but isn't terrible. I had a couple issues with it overall. It seems like skilling up mele is the only way to go. And until you get used to mele combat & where hitboxes are. You're going to be throwing a lot of wiffs at your enemies. I could be entirely wrong about the shooting side of combat. I didn't have the courage to level it up for 2 reasons. Steam controller is terrible with aiming in general & using the gun with no points added to the skill, was already horrible. For example - Dex would aim at 11 o'clock. I'd barely move my thumb to adjust the aim & now she's aiming at 8 o'clock. There was hardly ever a middle ground. To compensate I aimed as close to where I wanted as possible & then just walked into position. Again, I may be wrong & throwing some points into the skill could correct the accuracy, but I didn't try & the controller's failings steered me further away from trying.I enjoyed the hell out of this one.

												Overall, the game was fun. Really surprised at some of the voice acting in the side missions. There was some emotional range and dialogue that was beautfilly human and just damn good. Combat was wonky. Difficulty felt uneven at times and then mostly evaporated by the end, save for a really frustrating bit or two at the very end.Unfortunately, the ending(s) are horrifically bad and completely unsatisfying. It feels like the team just didn't know where the story was going and just gave up. If you're one of those people that can have games ruined by bad endings, probably stay away from this one. I am one of those people and it's pretty much soured the game for me at this point.			"

												Oh man. This has been in my library forever, and I'm really sad it took me this long to get to it. It's sooo good. Heads up, mild spoilers (and I mean super mild).Imagine a 2d platform-ish Deus Ex? You with me? Throw in a V.A.T.S. like system of pausing the action to interact with everything in cyberspace. Still following? Now add a really kinda interesting story about mankind evolving into network connected beings. Still with me? Why? Why are you not currently in the process of buying this game?All joking aside I had a really good time. There's enough flexibility here that you can do everything like a stealth hacking game, or a straight action RPG or a bit in between (though to be honest if you don't pick up at least a bit of hacking you're going to have a rough time). Plenty of content for a modern indie game (think 20 hours if you do all the things) which is pretty decently written and voiced. I started playing with my steam controller, but honestly there isn't enough real platforming to justify it, and the hacking is way easier with a mouse. Oh, and do make sure you pick up the free DLC there, it does add an interesting bit of content and further character specialization.My biggest complaint? The main character's jump sound is terrible. And you're going to hear it constantly. I think I've finally gone numb to it though. ^_^			"

												Yeah, i definitely love that game. I´m a great fan the deus ex series back to part 1.This game creates an atmosphere that comes very close to my favourite cyberpunk game series.Of course it´s not top-notch-frying-your-graphics-card special fx spectacle. It´s more like an animated  comic with really stylish artwork.But what´s most important, besides the great atmosphere, it has a very interesting story, maybe not perfect but it certainly gives you some food for thought. I like the developers love for detail. Sometime you accidently stumble over some, you would have easily overlooked otherwise.Like the NEW receptionist at biofarm tech after having ended a certain quest.C´mon folks, give it a try. Support the small studios. It´s definitely worth it.Finally let me give you a word of advice: Read the quest log thoroughly or you´ll miss to end some quest if you leave the area too early pursuing a major quest.Take care, see you in cyberspace...

												TL;DR:Dex is a great game.The gameplay is great with the main part being a side scroller with a rpg perk system and the hacking segments a top down shooter similar to bullet hells. You are required to make long term decisions by not being able to upgrade every skill or buy every augment in the game, however, I do advise you to upgrade your hacking skill to the maximum because the late game hacking is very tough. As a whole it is very enjoyable and I never found myself getting stuck for too long or raging at the difficulty.The visuals were instructing, with the style obviously being retro graphics with art panels as cut scenes. I personally loved the portraits that would be displayed when you you talked to a character.The soundtrack and voice acting were superb. My only complaint resides with the sound during hacking segments mainly the weapon sounds, they sounded like a soft lazier.The story was good with its twists and surprises, but there are only three endings, a well placed save game lets you see all of them.The game is about 18-19 hours long.I do recommend Dex to anyone who is interested in it and I rate it a 8\10.

												When I first played this, it felt a little janky. That is, there were certain quality of life aspects that were missing. Now, with the Enhanced Edition, most, if not all of those issues have been fixed.Long story short, Dex is basically Castlevania: Symphony of the Night combined with Deus Ex, or Shadowrun. They definitely use a lot of Runner lingo.Combat is... interesting. My playthrough, I went almost entirely melee, as the guns felt a little clunky. Something about the way it seems to read input for my controller, probably. Also, drawing a gun in combat is incredibly slow compared to the pace of regular combat, and it just doesn't feel very natural.That said, melee combat is a bit different than other games. In other side-scrolling platform-y type games, combat is very fast, in the sense that you're trying to get as many hits as you can at once. In Dex, melee combat rewards patience and attention. Blocking is essential, as is being able to lure guys away or hack them so you can stealth kill them.I found hacking to be extremely difficult at first, until I realized how important upgrading it is. Also, because there's a Focus cost to just open up the hacking in augmented reality, I found it difficult to decide when the best time would be to use it. After all, you use the same pool for hacking in AR and your health in cyberspace. I eventually just gave up on worrying about it too much and just started using it whenever.Sometimes, the quests were not precisely clear on where to go, and that's a good thing. Journal updates typically involve stating the current state of things, and the problem you're trying to solve. Sometimes it will provide suggestions; other times, you're left to discover things on your own. That was actually one of my favorite aspects of the game, actually. Often, I would be working on one particular task, but then would come across a lead for another task, which would then lead to something else, and so on. And occasionally, a quest that you had performed previously affects a quest that you may be working on now.The dialogue is written well. The voice acting for some characters is spot on. The pharmicist in particular is pretty great. At times it gets a little heavy with the tech-talk, and begins to get navel gaze-y at the end, over all, I liked it.So yeah, overall, definitely worth the experience / money.For what it's worth, my play time reflects playing the entire game through and doing most quests. I missed a collectible or two.			"

Posted: May 12, 2016
												So, I've had a few people asking about Dex. I've played it a bit, and here's a review.Dex is a side scrolling, open-world action RPG in an open-world, cyberpunk setting. It calls to mind the classic MetroidVania style of play, while still reminiscent of the higher-quality flash games you might have enjoyed on NewGrounds.The PlotAs Dex, a blue-haired woman in the megaplex of Harbor Prime, you wake up to a voice on the phone warning you of an imminent, seemingly-unprovoked attack by a corporate security team. You use abilities you never knew you had to escape, beginning a journey to the depths of the city's labrynthine underworld to it's dizzying heights of corporate corruption.How It PlaysThe graphics are splendid. Zooming in and out can reveal the detail given to every sprite or the scope of the cityscape, which calls to mind the urban decay of Blade Runner and the alien opulence of Gibson. Animations are smooth. The cutscenes are stylized scenes instead of actual animations, but given the scope of the game, it's not unreasonable, and still easy to look at.The sound is good. Ambients, a great OST, it holds up to spec and surpasses necessity more often than not.The controls are simple. I can imagine using an SNES controller with no difficulty to play this. I use a keyboard and had no difficulties.Leveling up is intuitive and simple. XP lets you improve four major skill branches (Endurance, Melee, Firearms, Hacking) and four minor ones (Lockpicking, Social, Barter, and AR). Credits, gear, inventory system (You'll never run out of room or hit a weight limit, which is nice), and after a quest, cybernetic upgrades.Most of the game is played from the meatspace perspective of a 2D side-scroller. Many areas cannot be explored until the appropriate Lockpicking skill or cybernetic upgrade is installed (toxin filter, super-jumps, electricity immunity, etc), but it never impedes game progress if you don't explore these nooks and crannies. You'll want to, though.The other end of the game is a kind of hacking minigame in cyberspace, much like an old Asteroids space shooter. You can upgrade your hacking abilities in a number of ways, along with stealing cash and data, opening doors, and discovering more of the plot.In between these is AR, manipulating the net in meatspace, which you and only you can do (One reason you're so damn special). A little trickier, but worth it.ComplaintsThe inability to make your own hero is more of a personal complaint, and is mitigated by Dex being an interesting and good-looking character.The VO isn't is the best. Some characters like Decker are well voiced, but many of the actors sound like they are reading words they don't know how to pronounce, or different people will pronounce the same name differently.Where these two meet is the fact that Dex is, herself, only voiced in cutscenes. If they're going to pigeonhole us into one character, why give her a voice so rarely? Given the long stretches between cutscenes, I began to feel detached from Dex. She was just the instrument of my will, and not a character I was following or investing in.A small complaint, but why does the electrical immunity implant give me immunity to environmental electricity, but not electrical attacks?Considering the sheer amazement and import AR seems to have with your character, I'm quite surprised how rarely it came up as a play mechanic.The VerdictI couldn't put it down for three days. It's not super-duper long, but it was a very entertaining ride. I've paid $20 for less fun by far, and I'm sure I'll play it again with a new build. Some of the side missions aren't always winnable, and I'd like to see if I could have gotten a happier ending. Let's say, 8.5/10.			"

												When I first played this game I gave it a bad review, because I died in the first fight and got a little upset.  However, it turns out that playing other games, which only require a player to roll their face along the keyboard to win, may actually dampen reaction speeds and general video game skills.After playing Dex a bit longer, and getting gud, it turns out this is a very fun game with a rewarding combat system.  You can’t just run in and hammer the attack button. Well, you can, but you’ll probably die. It’s important in Dex to read your opponents, then block, dodge and attack appropriately.  Added to this even after choosing the melee combat route guns do not feel unessential, as they still play a crucial part in thinning down opponents as they run towards you to prevent you from being overwhelmed. Mix in some stealth takedowns and the combat system becomes simple yet very rewarding.This is mixed into a Dues Ex type body modification system, and layered with good voice acting and an engaging plot in a 2D environment.I’m having a lot of fun. I’d highly recommend this game.			"

												I had to review this because Dex is pure awesome! I think this game needs to get more attention. I found this game by accident! Do keep in mind, I played the Enhanced edition with all the bug fixes so my experience was very stable. Some are writing about the save game bugs that are fixed at this point.Pros:- Great gameplay mechanics that fits and works very well together.- The theme and universe are very strong and right up my alley. I love cyberpunk so if you do too, get this game!- Dex has better rpg elements than many other modern AAA rpg games. You have to make difficult choises and live with the consequences.- Surprisingly good voice acting. Biggest surprise for me. Every character is voice acted, and they did a great job!- Almost no bugs in Enhanced version, not even one crash for me.- Long enough to get immersed. If you do all the side quests, it's about 20h or so.Cons:- There are a few quests that are not very clear what you need to do or where to go to get them done. I ended up having 2-3 side quests in my log that I just didn't know how to finish. I may have just missed some door, ladder or an item that was needed. Not a big problem.- Hacking is very difficult at the beginning. Some balancing would fix it maybe... You absolutely have to put skill points in it and buy shields etc. AR seemed so hard the few times I tried it that I just gave up and just blasted my way through.- I felt the ending was a bit anti-climatic. The choises and reasons behind it all were not explained well enough.Go buy it and start playing!			"

												A story driven cyberpunk romp through a desolate urban sprawl that rewards you for bearing with the game's excentricities by giving you a hearty dose of great quest design, good writing and an art style that's both charming and fitting to the game's overall theme.The developer is dedicated to supporting and patching this game quickly and has managed to iron out most of the kinks that stuck around after the game left Early Access on May 7th. It's still somewhat unpolished and might challenge your Triple A sensibilities but it's a fantastic indie title that is well worth your time.If you're interested in a bit of first hand gameplay, I uploaded the first half hour of gameplay to the Tubes of You. WARNING: Does contain commentary, so if you're not into that, don't say I didn't warn ya!

Dex2D side-scrolling RPG in cyberpunk setting.There is a bit of everything thrown in to this game, platforming, stealth, brawling, RPG. Story is well written and keeps you playing to the end. Beside the main quest you have many side quest that can usually be completed in different ways. Opponents can be taken out using guns, fists or just sneaking around.I heard a lot of bad things about this one from the games early stages, but every issue seems to been fixed and I didn't had any problems with it. Default keybinding were bit wonky, but you can easily change them.This was truly an enjoyable gaming experience. A big thumbs up from me.Pros: - Well written story - Different ways to go through quests - Artwork looks beautiful - Great musicCons: - Bit short (probably always con when playing enjoyable game) - Quite easy.

												Before I played Dex, I never would have thought that cyberpunk would go well with a Metroidvania (I really don't like that word) kind of game.  This game taught me otherwise.  A lot of other reviews compare it to Deus Ex.  It reminds me more of Shadowrun.  I suppose there isn't a huge difference between the 2, but it's there.  Anyways...  The AR hacking is a nice touch.  It's convenient that the actions “pauses” while you hack, making it a useful tactical option.  Combat works well for the most part.  Several times enemies decided to do laps around me while I beat up their friends.  It's always someone armed with a gun, like they're trying to get to a safe shooting range and have a hard time of it. Hmm...  this feels like a crappy review.  Oh well, may as well post it.  The game is much better than this review.  Give Dex a try!			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter out of a whim and didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised when I finally tried it out. What surprised me most was how well the NPCs are written, most of them are some kind of crazy and convincingly at that. Gameplaywise it's Deus Ex 2D - almost every area has several ways to get through and invites to explore. Depending on how you choose your skills and augments, this game may become a shooter, brawler or stealth game, but its focus lies on story so don't expect unending action. The amount of content seemed just enough to not get stale, took me about 20h for a thorough playthrough.The game was quite bug ridden (including a game breaking savegame bug) but the worst of them were fixed recently, so maybe give it a second chance, I certainly didn't regret a second.

												While Dex looks like it could be the 2D answer to Deus Ex, an absolutally frustraiting hacking mini game and terrible battle system really pull this game down. The hacking is pretty much futile until you've spent enough time to level your character up about halfway and the battle is so dull it's like it was an after thought. Also, the story just gets bogged down in its own self importance. Avoid this one!			"

								i have been playing Dex a little over the last day and I can say it's beautiful, really cool world, nice atmosphere.  But...It is WAY too hard, I am no stranger to hard games, I grew up with a Spectrum 48k, but you cannot survive for more than a few seconds against basic 'gun goons'.  This will need to be rebalanced at some point.However, this is a great alpha, just wandering the streets is cool, woudl love to see the concept art for this game.Right, off to watch Blade Runner....

												This game is out of early access but it's still needs a lot of work.  It's a very inaccesible game with poor controls, a clunky interface and a confusing mission system.  There are several bugs still causing problems with combat and quest progression.  Combat itself will be very confusing at first - not so much a complex melee combo system as a weird cyberpunk game of tag.  It looks dumb and does a huge disservice to the amazing pixel art and animations this game presents.			"

Early Access Review
								An excellent 2D Cyberpunk Action RPG. The first Early Access game I paid for. I am currently playing through the Release Candidate version of the game. This is a vast improvement over the initial sandbox version. While that version was fun it was more of a sneak peak at what was to come. Now there is a full story that has several voiced lines.  Dive kicks, while a powerful tool, are not as good as they used to be. The AI has improved and the combat is more satisfying. This game is very high quality and I feel like I got more than what I paid for. I will further update my review once the game is fully released and I have finished it. This will take a bit longer than the betas and I am very happy about that.			"

												+Cyberpunk+Metroid style gameplay+Bullet-hell gameplay (Hacking)+Good amount of side quests+Choices have consequences-Short gameVery good game, well worth a purchase, has a good cyberpunk settings which immediately makes you feel like its inspired from Deus Ex, which Search Results definitely is not a bad thing, brief summary would be technology has advanced rapidly, people are now having implants and cybernetic augmentations, and are able to ""Jack in"" into cyberspace which is AR (Augmented Reality) aswell as computer hacking, what makes your character special is you dont need a jack at all, and are able to enter and manipulate cyberspace freely.Which of course puts you on everyone's hit list and from the get go you are being gunned down only to be saved by a group of hackers who ultimately will show you how to navigate cyberspace.Either way its great fun to play, multiple ways to execute your missions from being stealthy, gung-ho or hacking everything to turn against your enemies which is always fun.For the price its well worth a go even if your only slightly interested, I had it sat in my library for a long time, started it on a whim and played it til completion, very enjoyable game.

This is an A+ game.Or at least it would be if not for the following:1) cutscenes stuttered and fluttered worse than my grandma's parkinson hand.2) the periodic game-breaking bug in the hacking minigames where the avatar (and, more frequently and less game-breakingly, the enemies) turboed so hard into the wall it clipped through and became lodged in the vast unplayable space.3) the one 90s RPG thing they should have left in the 90s... the $@C%ing awful ending. I understand there's more than one, but I honestly doubt the others wrap things up any better.On the plus side, it was nigh-literary and you do have the option to climb on top of a tall building and fling yourself into the abyss.

												This game is one I wish was better.  The writing and atmosphere have been interesting so far.  I like the world but the problems with the game are a bit too much for me to want to continue with it. I would definitely watch the game as if the issues could get fixed it seems it could be a lot of fun.The save system is incredibly frustrating.  The amount of progress I have lost in this game even only playing for an hour has been more than I want to put up with.  I've died a few times to places where I thought I could jump because of the art but turns out what I thought was a ledge wasn't or I miss calculated how far I could jump.  Normally this would be fine but with the save system I go back really far.  I will sometimes have whole quests to go back through.  This by itself is enough that I can't imagine trying to stick with the game until there are some changes (if that is even possible).Also the combat feels a little not quite right.  When I jump over enemies they seem confused on what to do.  Early on at least the fighting just doesn't feel great.  The controls have also not seemed intutive with me having to switch from my controller over to my mouse for a few things like equipping items to my quick item slots (although I'm guessing there may be a way to do this it wasn't obvious how).  EDIT: I tried a new play through with a keyboard mouse set up.  For the most part this felt much better except for I had trouble interacting when using the virtual reality ability in the real world.  For some reason I couldn't use the interact button and had to use the Y button on my controller instead.  Otherwise keyboard/mouse felt better by far for the control scheme.  Things like aiming your gun feel better with a mouse and it was much easier to use quick item slots.			"

												TL;DR: It's pretty good. The cyberpunk theme is great, the characters are interesting and the narrative is not poorly-written, the soundtrack is lovely and very remiscent of old-school cyberpunk, and the combat, while a bit clunky, isn't expressly awful. If you're into action-RPGs and platformers and dig cyberpunk settings, check it out.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's difficult to look at Dex and not think of other, well-established examples of cyberpunk fiction. Harkening back to the old '80s and '90s aesthetic, the Blade Runner and Deus Ex inspirations are almost immediately apparent in both the visual style and gameplay progression that Dex takes and, when it it adheres to its inspirations, it is all the stronger because of that.Dex is a 2D action-RPG with platforming elements and a heavy emphasis on freedom of choice. While not nearly as open as the aforementioned Deus Ex, Dex should feel familiar to veterans in more ways than simply by name. Punching, shooting, stealthing, hacking, and sometimes even talking are all viable solutions to the problems that the player is presented with throughout the course of the game, and in the style of older RPGs Dex takes a hard line at encouraging players to be the master of a single aspect or two rather than a Jack of all trades. While it wouldn't be impossible to play the game trying to evenly level your stats, there's high potential for making things more complicated than they need to be by doing so.The game features both melee and ranged combat, though neither are as refined as they possibly could be. Punching feels stiff and limited as it roots Dex, the player character, to the ground for the duration of the attacking animation. It's fairly easy and smooth to transition into a dodge roll (by using the right analog stick; as I didn't use mouse & keyboard controls I unfortunately won't be able to inform on them) or blocking, but the complete lack of control combined with an auto-step that Dex does while punching makes melee combat take a while to get used to. Ranged combat, at least with a controller, doesn't fare much better, as aiming guns with the analog sticks is an exercise in extreme frustration. It's not something I would recommend trying while in the middle of a pitched fight, ironically, though I have the sneaking suspicion that it would be much easier to do with the mouse & keyboard controls.Hacking is also a central gameplay mechanic. Dex can enter Cyberspace at any time by clicking down the left analog stick on the controller, or into mission-specific networks by finding computers around the game world. While in Cyberspace, the game changes into something of a twin-stick shooter, and unfortunately the control here isn't amazing either. You get a health bar, called Focus, and an Energy bar that is utilized for moving faster or using special attack software that you can find and use throughout the game, not unlike spell books in a fantasy RPG. But, unlike most twin-stick shooters I've played on the PC, Dex doesn't automatically fire while aiming in Cyberspace, and instead you need to hold a trigger button in addition. This doesn't sound like much of an inconvenience, but what seemed to be something like input or reception lag between turning and the fire rate while in Cyberspace made the entire experience feel incredibly grating and tiring. Leveling the hacking stat and discovering the Pulsewave software (switching through different software abilities can be done by pressing Left or Right on the controller D-Pad after you have multiple abilities) were boons for my playthrough and made it much more tolerable, though it also made me wish the hacking had simply been balanced more like that from the very beginning.I won't touch much on the story. It's nothing too new, but it does take a few interesting turns and it was compelling enough for me to follow it through without feeling bored. The characters are all fairly well-realized and given distinct personalities, and near enough every character you can interact with is one who is important for a side-quest. It's worth noting that the game has a large number of side-quests, most of which can be finished as soon as you're set loose on the city or ignored completely in favor of simply going through the (comparitively short) main quest. A few of the side-quests seemingly end without any hard conclusion upon completion, but the game actually accounts for that with something of a time-shift that occurs before the player starts the final ""chapter"", during which time the player can see new incidental environmental effects or follow up on what happened with specific characters. It's a nice touch, and one I wasn't personally expecting.The soundtrack is also worth noting. As with the rest of the game, it pulls a lot of inspiration from older cyberpunk fiction. It's the type of familiar that is just different enough to evoke nostalgic feelings without being something old itself, and it fits the thematic setting phenomenally. Unfortunately there isn't anything particularly memorable, but for the size of the development team it's still an impressive accomplishment (a sentiment I extend to the game as a whole).			"

												Dex is a 2D-open-world-point-and-click-adventure-platformer-hybrid with some rpg elements, moderately recommended for fans of cyberpunk storytelling.I feel the hybrid nature of this game is its biggest draw. On the adventure side, the world of Dex is simply stunning. Every character and set piece is beautifully hand-drawn making RPG staples, like the weapon and item shops, ambient and memorable. There are a lot of really creative visual tricks used to make the city feel alive and populated. This alone is almost worth the price of admission. On the action side, the combat borrows from classic beat-em-ups during the Sega Genesis era. You'll use a variety of kicks and punches and a light assortment of weapons to take care of various baddies. It's not particularly mind-blowing, nor is it the main focus of the game, but I enjoyed after leveling to faceroll status and unlocking a few stat enhancing outfits. Alas, the hybridity of Dex also creates numerous challenges the game fails to tackle. The combat is inimical to the rest of the game. It's difficult and repetitive at the start. Like a Zen master who makes potential students wait for days on the stairs of the dojo before allowing them to train, Dex demands sacrifice before unfolding itself. After learning a few tricks, combat becomes so easy it is irrelevant, making the end of the game a drag. Moreover, the open world design betrays the adventure aspects. Often one will run into a random piece of equipment and add it to the inventory with no comment. Eventually you'll talk to a npc who will say something like, ""Oh I wish I could go running if I just had shoes!"" and your character will reply, ""Oh good thing I picked up these dusty old running sneakers two maps ago!"" As if completing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are perfectly square, upon discovering a part, one sort of shrugs and goes ""I guess this will fit in somewhere."" I quickly found myself disengaged from the story and relentlessly smashing the interact button upon every npc encounter. Not to say the characters that make up the world of Dex are not engaging. They all have unique personalities and the game features a cast of more than twenty voice actors. What draws away from them is the banality of the story. I found the plot to be cliched, although it may be appealing to those experiencing the cyberpunk genre for the first time. Poor story telling is not always bad as long as it's sealed off from the gameplay, but I found the lack of innovation in the tale-telling to be infectious. Going the extra mile for secret intel should be rewarding, but most of the private information found through the hacking mini-game are email messages along the line of ""Dear Boss: The SECRET PLAN is going according to schedule, and by the way, I killed all those INNOCENT PEOPLE you asked me to. Regards, John Henchmann"" Story elements and some of the sprites are reused carelessly. It becomes insulting when you enter a base of anti-technology fanatics that is filled with the same cyborg toughs from every other stage, or have to reunite estranged family members for the third time.One thing that is wholly unique in the cliched world of Dex is what I would explain as a genuine female lead. When I speak about a genuine female lead I want to draw a contrast between the major publishers' idea, which entails giving Super Soldier X an optional pair of breasts at character creation. Dex's gender is integral to the story. You'll meet a protective older man, male escorts who are obsessed with their enhanced members, and a pervy doctor who relishes the chance to have an unconscious babe on which to install cybernetic mods. These encounters made me uncomfortable as a male, but are assuredly archetypes of the everyday female experience. The empathy I experienced in these moments, though sadly not gained from the plot as a whole, is something rarely gleaned from the video game medium.  If you are looking for a solid adventure game with some combat wedged in, pick up Dex. If you are looking for a competent action sidescroller with a story, look elsewhere.  "

												Just finished the game, so kinda not gonna be going for very objective review. Dex is a cyberpunk sidecrolling actiony rpg with platforming and stealth elements. With not too bad artsyle it strikes the aesthetic of rundown cyberpunk world pretty well. Even though animations from time to time look janky, they're practical in what they shot. Music is not annoying and feels ""techish"" enough to pass in the game. Story isn't bad and actually quite interesting. Probably will do another playthrough later on just to go through it again with more confidence on my side. On bright side, it didn't seem that you can really ♥♥♥♥ up your playthrough. Gameplay wise. Combat feels janky at the start, but it comes to it's own as it's an RPG you do get feeling of progression, but it still requires your input, so it's not all numbers. Hacking is ok, it's interactive TUTORIAL SPOILERS and since it's kinda central theme of the game SPOILERS OVER  it's understandable why it's mechanically a bit richer than usual hacking minigames. All in all pretty solid game that I can't really nitpick from one playthrough and it was pretty fun one at that. Characters not too bad, some humour, some dark and light undertones and great experience allround.			"

												Really cool cyberpunk game, although a bit short and ""static"" (as in limited) in its gameplay. The world feels small and some features lack (as in where do we have to go on the map to advance in a quest). Fast travel is a nice addition. Ending is nice and kinda not expected.			"

												A sci-fi-noir cyberpunk jewel of a game, if a little rough around some edges.Very nice game with a retro-2D-style. I realy liked the story, even though it has some foreseeable / cliché twists. The graphics are practical, but charming, the sound (music and ambient) is sublime, the voiceover is very nice (with some exceptions). The gameplay is fun with challenging combat and / or sneaking, there is an interesting hacking system.For everyone who liked Deus Ex, System Shock etc. and can do with a platformer-style gameplay.I liked it so much I bought the soundtrack just to support the developers, even if i have little means of listening to it when I'm off my PC.

												A nice cyberpunk adventure game. The story is solid enough you won't be questioning the plot and the character cast is unique. The voice acting is appreciated but since there is little animation in the dialogues; reading it seemed faster and more enjoyable.I would categorically place this into an adventure game much more than an action game because the combat is not quite engaging. You will find that hacking is way too overpowered in this game and the combat is a bit exploitable (take down, trip to gun execution op). Mechanics aside, the quests will be what keep you going, definitely not the action. It’s not all a bunch of fetch quests either, and there are typically multiply ways to complete each quest. Overall, if you like the polish of indie games, this one has got some charm to it.			"

												After release of Enhanced Edition that fixes savegame problems, improves UI and reworks ""virtual reality"" mode, I enjoyed play this game and can recommend it:it's an awesome non-linear open-city cyberpunk metroidvania with enormous amount of hand-drawn characters, animations, and locations. Character progression, story line and side quests with multiple solutions included, it allow to use different playstyles and do moral choices, it have hidden places and paths that gave good oldschool exploration pleasure. 4 endings. Surprisingly, it feels like real RPG, even more: looks like it's a real RPG indeed, didn't seen those for years.  Full voice acting, nice electronic music, controller support (still need a fix after Enhanced version update: Unity 5 clearly have a trouble with it). Around 15-18 (it was 28 for me, completionist's run with revisiting all locations with search for hidden stuff) hours to complete.Game have some rough edges though and require some time to full sinking: arcade style melee/shoot combat (melee goes much more interesting with skill progression), crimsonland-alike ""augmented reality"" and ""cyberspace"" modes lacks of hints: 1, 2 and 3 on keyboard selects different software, I accidentally found it when had ~70% of game finished. Some mechanics a bit obscure before you get a proper augment, like the way how enemy vision works. Pacifist playstyle hardly possible, there's several places where you can't avoid killing at all. Nothing gamebreaking or anything that you can't learn if you like game though.To activate free extra clothes DLC you need to run it from DLC's store page first (it's play-style flavored hidden hi-tech suits to retrieve in game, DLC also expand some locations a bit). P.S. game video and screenshots on store page still shows old ""augmented reality"", ""cyberspace"" and UI.			"

												First of all, a lot of negative reviews are related to bugs. I'll be the first to admit that you might still occasionally run into them - for example, every seller I interacted with stole whichever item I had in the first slot of my inventory. I just put a quest object with no value in that slot and played on, but it did cost me a couple of expensive things until I figured it out. Apart from that, there are no game-breaking bugs anymore, and the gameplay itself is very logical and smooth.The atmosphere is the best thing about the game. The voice acting brings every NPC to life, and it's really good, top-quality voice-acting that you don't often get in any game, leave alone a retro 2D RPG. Open world claims are absolutely valid - I wouldn't say the map is too big, but it feels rather realistic, multi-layered, with a number of hidden quests and locations, a lot of connected stories and feuds you can dig into, and you can explore it in any way you like. I haven't tried a 100% non-lethal playthrough, but it seems possible, as is focusing on diplomacy and stealth, or hacking and guns (guns - not recommended, as many have said before me, but you might need them to break security systems a couple of times, so keep one just in case). The main plot is, as it often happens, a little less engrossing than the city and its inhabitants with the side quests, but it's a decent big cyberpunk story. Don't come here looking for something extremely original - it's more of a love letter to the genre, but well-executed, throught through and with characters you do (sometimes, unfortunately) care about.All in all, very much recommended. I got it with a discount, but felt that I've gotten enough content for my money at the third hour of playthrough, and it took me 19 hours to carefully explore everything the game had to offer.			"

												Sidescoller cyberpunk rpg.  In 2015?  Credit for audacious anachronism, if nothing else.  IF this game had been made in the mid 90's, it would likely have been successful.  20 years later... I still had a great time.  There will inevitably be comparisons to Deus Ex, and with a certain amount of validity.  Being cyberpunk, Dex shares a lot of plot and thematic similarites.  Even in how the game is played shares a lot in common -- missions have mutliple approaches, character traits can can be customized per playstyle, and missions and story elements branch depending on player choices.  But in the 90's, that's how we played games.  Especially anything wanting to call itself an RPG.  It wasn't just a matter of picking which color you want at the end game.  If you wanted, you could go back and pick different branches and see what outcomes were offered.  To that end, Dex succeeds quite well.  I felt like I was back in my parents' den poking around on the 486.  Fortunately, no Dos4GW or Gravis TSR's to fight with.The graphics and music and voice acting are quite well done.  The writing is better than a lot of games, as well.  As a sidescroller or action game, Dex doesn't really stand out.  But as a story driven rpg, and especially if you're nostalgic for the days when cyberpunk was the future, or if you're curious to what the previous generation of gamers grew up with, it's definitely worth a shot.

												Excellent game. Much as others have said, this is like a Deus Ex in 2-D.  The graphics, though pixelated are very good. The combat system, while a tad awkard at first to master, leaves you feeling like a ninja at the end when you insanely powered up. (Invest in your xp and mods!) The music is good, memorable and comparable to Deus Ex. The background and story is fairly rich, but could use more I feel. A few things that drove me nuts: Dex's cutscene face/self was gorgeous as was her voice acting.. But your character's pixel self you play as.. All I could see was a man's face. I know, it's a peeve really, and it doesn't take away from gameplay but its one of those things that annoyed me. Some blue lips on the pixel character like the cutscene face would have fixed this. If not, you get to hide her face with the DLC costumes you can get. The quests were fairly engagin and not uber repetitive.. at least as story involved with them, They werent generic. However, there is one quest that the way they set it up made me (and a number of others I found) wonder if it was a broken quest by a bug. It's not. I will simply say you need to go back wayyyyy to the beginning to finish it. Good luck on that one.  Lastly, and this annoyed me to no end: One of the DLC costumes you get renders you invisible. I'm not sure if it was this or something else, but when I came out of invisibility, I was unable to physically interact (beat the sh!z) out of the enemies... but they could beat me down. I could only fix this by saving my game and exiting to the main menu. I have a fast PC so i was able to do this quickly but it was just annoying. These are my only gripes. This was an amazingly fun game for its look and price. I'm considering giving it another run with my 'skills' i developed handling my character and building up again. :D 9/10			"

The side missions have multiple ways they can be completed and will keep you busy. The only fault with the game is the cyberspace hacking I found these sections the most frustrating.

												Dex is a indie Deus Ex wannabe in 2d graphics. That already checks quite a few boxes for being unique. Like it's inspiration, it shares action gameplay in the form of melee, ranged and some minor stealth with RPG elements. It also features a hacking minigame in the form of a twinstick shooter, and some minor platforming. You level up and can spend your points to raise your offensive and defensive capabilities and also some utility stuff like picking locks or convincing people of your ideas. You can freely explore most of the world and there are many great sidequests which are all voiced and often offer a multitude of outcomes.Now, you can see that this game is ambitious as ♥♥♥♥! Just from what I said it sounds like the Deus Ex 2D, and it comes pretty close to it actually. Sadly, which is the biggest gripe I have with the game, it lacks a lot of polish. Levels are sometimes too dull, ranged combat feels not very rewarding, the skills could need more balancing, the stealth is poorly implemented and enemies can be tricked out in various ways. Melee combat gets messy all around and AR is too much of a hassle to use. The hacking gets dull very quickly and feels often too forced, enemies can see you as soon as you enter a room if you are unlucky, the saving system is partially punishing. There are bugs, the animations often look pretty lackluster, the art quality is fluctuating sometimes, some musicpieces get dull or repeat badly, the sfx got way too few work and sounds painful, the special effects are miniscule or unfulfilling, the main protagonist lacks charater throughout the whole game being between a completely silent character or a quirky, smack♥♥♥♥♥girl, the main storyline lacks cohesion and the major plotpoints lack power.It has many issues, and you can see that the game was just way too ambitious for such a small indie studio, and therefore is a very rough experience all around. But, in the end, it IS THE 2D DEUS EX of games, or comes as far to it as no other game before. It could have been an all around amazing game with a lot more polish and reworking of some gameplay-systems and lines, but it would have probably never seen the light of day if it tried. But one can see what it tries to do, and finds in between the rough edges an extremely promising game, that realizes what many other games or developers are too scared of, which is too far away from mainstream to find large publicity, but which has the insight and background to create a experience for people willing to delve into it and see the shining spots.So, ye, basically if you like 2D-action games with story, rpg-elements and a cyberpunk scenario, and the many small quirks don't hinder you to enjoy the better parts, I can wholeheartedly recommend to you.

												Dex is a dialogue driven, Combat RPG from the side view perspective (think 2-dimensional platformer like prince of persia). It's a rare game that embraces a purist William Gibson cyberpunk universe semi-direct from the 1980's. It uses a simple RPG system. It has no character creation, and a mildly inconsequential character leveling system. And unfortunately it's lacking in some of the better qualities of a platformer as well. Combat feels overly chaotic when using firearms and overly scripted when fighting hand to hand. However, it still succeeds in presenting a very entertaining cyberpunk RPG title.Dex wastes no time in getting you into the action and lets you know exactly what kind of cyberpunk game this is going to be. Its an RPG with lots of reading, it's a corps vs hackers vs new gods known as AI science fiction story, and it's not going to guide you through solving each of it's numerous puzzle-like quests. After introducing the player to an intriguing main plot Dex then throws the player into the grimy crime riddled city of Harbor Prime, with barely a direction to go. So it does well to give you numerous side quests to perform while you search for answers and explore the extensive city. WIth it's endearingly homegrown voice overs and corny dialogue.The city, Harbor Prime, needs a mention, because it's one of the highlights of this game and a great joy to see done so well. Dex uses 2 dimensional side view areas in a 3 dimensional city scape and it makes it feel natural. It's hard to explain in vague terms, but when you are in the Chinese Quarter district and you see the entrance for Taijo as a lit street market extending beyond the backdrop of a level, and then you see it represented in the top down view of the city map it makes perfect sense and it makes the city that much richer to explore.Dex is lacking in a few prized elements of an RPG, such as class and gender open character creation. It also possesses platform game controls that are sometimes itself the challenge rather than the platform levels and enemies. Specifically combat becomes un-fun when you can't run and aim a firearm simultaneously. These shortcomings aren't enough to make me stop enjoying it, though. I really am enjoying Dex.			"

Like they took that old game, gave it a pretty face and stuffed it up with more content. Additionally, the combat is much better.All those, wo give bad reviews just played the game for short time. (I played it for over 12h now and just had my first run through.) I did not encounter any of the mentioned bugs, saving was no problem as long as you understand that you have to change the area to save.. it's not that hard. For me one of the best cyberpunk games by now. Comes directly after Deus Ex.			"

												While the story and dialogue are pretty good, the combat feels really clunky. It's incredibly hard, too; you die very easily, especially against soldiers later on. You have to spam med-kits and other healing items to stay alive, gunplay feels awkward and spammy (you go through ammunition extremely fast) and stealth isn't really an option later on since a lot of enemies are immune to stealth take-downs. The hacking minigame is very simple but gets the job done, it's not fun though. My biggest gripe however is the unfair checkpoints. You can lose a lot of progress, but more importantly progress that was annoying to make.You might want to trudge through the bad gameplay to experience the decent story, but I wouldn't recommend it. Which is why this gets a thumbs down from me. I won't finish it. Too bad.			"

												Excellent game. Much as others have said, this is like a Deus Ex in 2-D.  The graphics, though pixelated are very good. The combat system, while a tad awkard at first to master, leaves you feeling like a ninja at the end when you insanely powered up. (Invest in your xp and mods!) The music is good, memorable and comparable to Deus Ex. The background and story is fairly rich, but could use more I feel. A few things that drove me nuts: Dex's cutscene face/self was gorgeous as was her voice acting.. But your character's pixel self you play as.. All I could see was a man's face. I know, it's a peeve really, and it doesn't take away from gameplay but its one of those things that annoyed me. Some blue lips on the pixel character like the cutscene face would have fixed this. If not, you get to hide her face with the DLC costumes you can get. The quests were fairly engagin and not uber repetitive.. at least as story involved with them, They werent generic. However, there is one quest that the way they set it up made me (and a number of others I found) wonder if it was a broken quest by a bug. It's not. I will simply say you need to go back wayyyyy to the beginning to finish it. Good luck on that one.  Lastly, and this annoyed me to no end: One of the DLC costumes you get renders you invisible. I'm not sure if it was this or something else, but when I came out of invisibility, I was unable to physically interact (beat the sh!z) out of the enemies... but they could beat me down. I could only fix this by saving my game and exiting to the main menu. I have a fast PC so i was able to do this quickly but it was just annoying. These are my only gripes. This was an amazingly fun game for its look and price. I'm considering giving it another run with my 'skills' i developed handling my character and building up again. :D 9/10			"

												Dex is a 2d sidescrolling metroidvania set in a futuristic cyberpunk world where corporations secretly rule over the impoverished masses. Set in a location known as Harbor City, you play the hero Dex, a young woman with latent and mysterious cybernetic powers who is caught in a conspiracy involving various shadow organizations scheming to control the world.The majority of your time in this game will be spent in one of two worlds: meatspace, where you run around on foot and battle with various enemies, and cyberspace, where you move around an avatar and break various defenses in order to hack systems. The meatspace parts of Dex are fairly simple and straightforward and also offer a kind of “hacking” via augmented reality, allowing you to disable opponents and cameras or hack turrets so they fire on enemies instead of you. Combat can be resolved by either gunplay or melee, and both methods are equally effective when done properly. In cyberspace, you have a variety of obstacles to negotiate and 3 special types of attack, each suited for different kinds of enemies (along with a few one-use items that can do things like clear the screen or shield you).Besides combat, you will have to interact with many different kinds of people as you unravel mysteries and complete quests, and the game gives you a multitude of different ways of dealing with each encounter. You can opt for the more diplomatic route (charisma) and convince people that your way is the best way, or just put a gun to their face or use some form of deception to get what you want. Each choice you make will have actual consequences later on in the story and sometimes even immediately afterwards. Exploration has the same level of variety, with different avenues depending on your skill-set such as a door that can be lockpicked or a vent to crawl through.Graphically, the game is kind of a treat with the way it pulls off the whole retro-aesthetic. At first you might feel that it’s kind of deliberately ugly but after a few hours of play it sort of grows on you and becomes pretty in its own unique way. The devs were also not afraid of portraying a believable cyberpunk universe in all its grime, blood, and general unsavoriness. The musical score is catchy enough and the sounds reminiscent of what one would expect from a title in this genre (little bleeps and boops in cyberspace for example). Dex is incredibly well rounded for what it’s worth, I only felt that maybe it could have possibly been two games as the last portion of the game seems almost like it could have been its own adventure. Additionally the sound could use some normalization for the cyberspace sequences, which are way louder than the rest of the game and forced me to reach for my volume dial each time. Overall though, I had no real problems with the game itself and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the cyberpunk genre, especially if you liked (D)eus (Ex).			"

												TL;DR: I don't really want to give this game a thumbs down, but I can't give it a thumbs up. It's a fun little story set in a nice cyberpunk setting, but when it comes to the wire the game just isn't that fun.The good:The setting is interesting (if not terribly unique). Cyberpunk city with huge corporations taking over everything and a heavy handed government that hates internet porn and Stephen Colbert. There are a ton of quests to do, and from what I could tell there were usually multiple ways to finish them. The skill tree caters to different play styles, and you'll be rewarded for what you choose. Hacking provides a very real challenge, and when it is done well (because there are times when it definitely was not) you feel like you've actually accomplished something.The bad:The melee combat is simplistic and boring, which is disappointing because the ranged combat is so badly optimized I feel it had to be intentional. You're supposed to rely on stealth, which means you wait for someone to turn around, run after them and press T to do an instant takedown. Also, sometimes you'll be doing a stealth run and you'll walk through a door to a guard staring you in the face. This game also has KOTOR syndrome to the absolute maximum, where each quest giver will talk your ear off with inconsequential dialogue, and the important information will be lost in a sea of exposition. I love story based games, but half the game is you listening to people talk. The hacking (which is supposed to be a main part of the game) is just a top down shoot-em-up, and anyone who plays shoot-em-ups knows that mobility is the key to survival, right? Then why does this game throw endless waves of enemies at you and expect you to sit still in one area long enough to hack something?The okay:The animation isn't very good, but it's got its charm. The run cycle is particularly annoying, as Dex raises her fists each time she stops moving. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about but its good enough not to be irritating.			"

												This is an underated game that should of been respectivly rated better.  I would love to see an Dex 2 someday; This is a to be contiuned review ,because i am only 2 hours into it, the voice acting, combat, slill tree, weapons, and the game play is excellent, there is augmentation skills, and the music is awesome and it matters that the music is good with the graphics that are very good!!  I love the story its awesome; Your main character Dex, is a well thought of devloped characther, and this story reminds me of a back story character that would be in a movie setting like Blade Runner. What I find annouying and frusterating is where to find places i have to go, that are not targeted on the world map. The Adult Humour in the game can be alittle over the top allot of it does not need to be there ,but an Awesome game. I  think Metacrtic should of given an 80 percent rating for this game; I think 62 is underated for a game like this, 62 percent is not an accurate rating for this game that is only exlest than a year old. I will do a final review when I have finshed the game. thanks devlopers, and please be positive always:)			"

												Not a big fan of indie or platform games, but this one's outstanding. I've played non-stop during the weekend and thought of calling in sick to continue the adventure on Monday, felt back like a 8 years old child felling into a sci-fi book/movie. Story starts in an obvious way (being the Chosen One? Not knowing why? Ring any bells?), but the atmosphere, the music, the palette, the dialogues with NPC accents and styles so different from each other, and each contributing to the whole. Story combines elements from Matrix/Metropolis/Johnny Mnemonic, but it doesn't feel banal of worn out. Tons of secondary quests (and I'm sure I missed few) and an easy way to jump 'zones' so that one doesn't feel having to 'commute' hundreds of times on the same scenarios. Didn't find any bug worth, only one side quest seemed frozen but googling it up I realized it was my mistake.I've read few negative comments, most of them from 2015 complaining about bugs and faulty auto-saving mechanism, which I did not experience. Had to save and reload (frustrating a little, yes) quite few times at the beginning, but just because I took on secondary quests from the very beginning, which were way over the initial skill-set.Can't compare it to Deus Ex (it's a 2d platform indie game, not a FPS series with 10 years long history!) and didn't use a controller.I'd buy again, and I'll play again once I'm finished!EDIT:I've played ~18 hours and haven't yet finished the game.Ps: the Augmented Reality in-game are actually very nice to break up the gameplay, and to easy up the fights. Can be frustrating at the beginning, especially if you take up fights over your level or you don't know how to 'fight' and switch between the 2ndary weapon			"

												Dex is an enjoyable retro side-scrolling RPG-lite with good voice acting and a decent story.  The game boasts a large, Blade Runner-esque city.  Sections of the city, once visited once, can be returned to via fast travel from almost anywhere, and city sections are just the right size, so there's never the vexation of having to run from one side of the game world to the other.  Locations are nicely varied and appropriate: sketchy drug stores; street-side noodle shops and ritzy nightclubs; high-tech luxury apartments towering over impovershed slums.It's not a long game, 17 hours for me, and I did every side quest and explored all the nooks and crannies.  I wouldn't have minded if the game was say...oh...twice as long.  Which is a good thing.  A couple of tips if you play the game:  1)  Maxing out the hacking skill = better quality of life.  2) There is only one augment vendor and what you see is what's available, so don't run around saving empty augment slots for a rainy day that isn't coming.To the devs, thanks for the nice little helping of Blade Runner meets Deus Ex meets Matrix meets Double Dragon.  It was a lot of fun.			"

												Cyberunk ala Shadowrun, tbh. you could think this game came straight from the Shadowrun IP...which is a good thing.Dex offeres an interesting Cyberpunkish plot, mixed with the typical Bladerunner and social commentary and lots of quite surprisingly good voice-acting; you get the typical rpg-mechanics and skills, like ""hacking"" or ""lockpicking"" and ofcourse combat skills, etc. . what truly sets Dex apart from the usual rpg-crowd is the fact that you got beat`em up elements and jumping, aswell as metroidvania mixed in. tunnel filled with toxic gas -> get an augment which makes you immune to breathable hazardsmelee combat and skills remind you of game like Streets of Rage and co. , but if you want the classical gun-wielding approach it just works aswell.""hacking"" takes quite a big part in Dex and sports a whole own mini-game; you can basicaly hack everything, enemies (to stun em), turrets (to help you out) and lots of terminals or security cameras (for quests or cash/exp/item-gains). this all is presented in a lovely drawn Cyberpunk world, which sports quite a large map, which can be explored at your leisure. if you like Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Bladerunner and co. or/and you action-rpgs, metroide-like games...or got some nostalgia for Streets of Rage this is a save purchase. with the enhanced edition (was a free update) most bugs, glitches, etc. were fixed and a manual save-feature was added in. great game, very unique and hopefuly just the start of a new series.

												I saw some negative reviews of this game and I think they pertain to an earlier version of this. I'm writing this review based on the recently released ""Enhanced Edition"" of Dex, which seems to have fixed or addressed all the complaints I've read about the game.This may not be the best indie game ever made, but it comes close in quite a few regards. Dex is a very worthy example of the ""metroidvania"" sub-genre, and I'd recommend it just on that basis. But it's also a nice addition to the cyberpunk genre as well. The story and characters aren't the most original—chances are, if you're a fan of the genre you've quite likely seen a few of its tropes before. However, it builds to four different endings with some interesting choices to be made heading there, and it was good enough to feature some twists that did genuinely surprise me and keep me excited for the ending all the way through.This is supported by dialogue and even side-quests that are well-written and interesting, and to round that off, the voice acting is good, even all the way to the most tangential NPCs that have nothing to do with the main plot. The environments are really nice to look at, and the game mechanics are fluid and invite you to explore. I found myself sometimes backtracking just to listen to the background music or look at the loving attention to detail in the environments, even though there is a good fast-travel option.The combat was sufficiently challenging, but I was disappointed that there's no extra difficulty above the normal, only an easier one. On the other hand, I was impressed by how the quests don't always hold your hand and point you where to go and what to do, leaving it to you to figure things out or explore more; something I've sorely missed in RPGs in the recent past.The game has two noteworthy issues. One: it's a bit rough around the edges when it comes to explaining some game mechanics, and I had to look up in the options menu to figure out the controls of certain actions—not a terrible shortcoming, but a bit unusual in this day and age. The other issue is that, as of writing this review, the controller support is going to be hit and miss due to an update in the Unity engine that blindsided the developers and broke controller support of this game. The game devs are working on a fix, but right now, it's a matter of luck if you can use your controller or not, and that even includes the normally trustworthy XBOX360 gamepad. (I can say though that I played through the entire game with the keyboard and mouse controls, which were surprisingly good for a game in this genre.)The length is good too: it will take you about 12 hours to see one ending, and easily around 20 if you want to see all of the endings, complete every side-quest, try out everything else, and hunt down every achievement.This is an easily overlooked gem, and if you're itching for a good metroidvania or cyberpunk game, I recommend it. If both of those things sound like they'd appeal to you, I'd highly recommend it.			"

Posted: August 21, 2016
												A gripping cyberpunk story of post-human transcendence with a dark, mature and occasionally humourus tone, backed by solid gameplay and a worth-listening-to soundtrack. Though, in the end it leaves you wondering about the ultimate consequences of your choices.Being pleasantly reminded of Deus Ex and the Shadowrun Franchise I just had to play this in one go. It kept me constantly in the loop and wanting for more with most quests offering you different ways to finish them as well as different outcomes based on your choices or chosen skills, hidden areas, secrets and a few smart logic puzzles scattered through the game. Lots of ethical dilemmas where ""good"" or ""bad"" is not so easily distinguishable just like many games with similar settings have them. The story is told by a mixed bag of very skillfull voice actors and some not quite as much as well as bits and pieces of PDAs, emails, notes and a few hand-drawn cutscenes.The 2D platforming feels tight and responsive which, unfortunately, you can't really say about the combat. While the animations are smooth, there seems to be just that slight input delay with melee attacks and blocks. It's solid enough for an RPG sidescroller but it's definitely not a fighting game. The 2D nature of Dex also limits stealthy approaches. However the right combination of zapping multiple opponents via augmented reality and hand-to-hand combat can make for some very satisfying moments.Which leads me to the second biggest core gameplay mechanic - hacking, which plays much like a twinstick shooter and while visually rather dull and samey really helps to shake up the core gameplay loop in a fun and challenging way. It's not just a simple mini game like so often but a full grown part of the game itself. It's not punishingly difficult but if you really struggle with twin stick shooters this game might not be for you, as some hacking parts are necessary for the main story to progress or even the sole content of some missions.In the end I can happily declare this a must have for fans of the cyberpunk genre even if 2D sidescrollers might not be your cup of tea.And if you happen to be waiting for the new Deus Ex to hit the shelves and just finished every other... mentionable game in the series this the perfect timesink for some relaxed 12-16h of relishing in dystopian future fantasies and pandering the nitty-grit of human nature.

Posted: December 22, 2016
												I'm about halfway through my third playthrough (second full playthrough) so I think I've had enough time to build a solid opinion on this game.The developers obviously intended this game to be played at least twice, as this game has three endings and a small number of sub-plot diversions. So you'll get your moneys worth. But you would be well advised to save at key points in the game if you want to experience all of it but not have to repeat too much of the slow dialogue. Even if you do want to go through the story again, and it is easily a good enough story to want to do that. You would be well advised to make a save after the unskipable credits sequence.The combat takes a little getting used to, but feels quite natural on a controller. Be sure to block often. Using keyboard/mouse is ill-advised, but if you must then you'll probably want to map punch, block and shoot to the mouse buttons. Guns seemed ridiculously under-powered, prehaps the gamedevs felt it made the game easier, as the low damage means you can handle having a sub-machine gun unloaded into your♥♥♥♥♥♥a few times. Or prehaps they wanted you to engage in melee combat more often. But it shouldn't take multiple headshots with a magnum or shotgun to bring down an ordinary man.About half the game involves a simple twin-stick shooter set in cyberspace, where you are a circle shooting at other circles, squares, blobs and dots. Being good at this is pretty vital to winning the game and you would be well advised to level this power up as much as possible. It kinda feels like they had a really good $0.99 shoot-em-up and made a platform adventure to compliment it. It doesn't feel anything like any data network that I've ever used though and can feel a little tacked on to the plot. But then it is quite good, so I'll forgive it.The main graphics are absolutely beautifully hand drawn. The cutscenes have the apperance of scanned paintings. The main character can prehaps move a bit stiffly, but I didn't notice it really.One thing which really bugged me, is the pace at which the voice actors talked. Is it just me or do most of them talk 10-20% slower than natural? And pauses for commas and periods in the script seemed a bit too dramatic. I often found I had read a short paragraph of dialogue and considered one of several responses while the voice actor was catching their breath halfway through the first or second sentence. Otherwise the voice acting is quite good, there are lots of different accents in the city and none of them struck me as particularly cheesy/hammy as can often be a problem when using accents.Another thing which dissapointed me was all the stuff in the city I couldn't interact with. There was at least one notable shop facade and numerous doors (which sometimes look virtually identical to doors which can be interacted with) which are just for show. At times it can feel more like playing in front of a pretty painting than inside a bustling metropolis. And at one point in the plot, when propositioned by a lady of the night for what one can only assume, a brief moment of hot lesbian action. And I accepted, all I got was a fade to black and teleported to her house! What, did she slip me a roofie? Firstly, I'm not the most street-smart guy, but if I were a sex-worker there's no way in hell I'd be bringing a client I just met back to mine. And I definitely wouldn't leave her there alone while I go back to work! But seriously, a fade to black! When the game is not shy to throw beautifully drawn pictures around during the rest of the plot. I'm not expecting porn, but at least a picture of the hooker-jane waling back to her's hand in hand or something. And I didn't bother having sex with the gigolo later on, but I assume it would be the same blackout and wake up a small time later deal if I did.All in all a great game let down my multiple but minor annoyances like the keyboard/mouse controls (default configuration is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), slow talking actors, and you'll die without warning once or twice and maybe need to start again because you made the wrong choice leveling up or conversing. And minor detail ommisions which spoil the plot imersion.Apparently save games only work properly when changing scenes, so I wouldn't advise saving halfway though an important problem. But I didn't really find this to be a problem at all really. One thing I did have a problem with was the way the game seems to want you to level up your skills in a certain way. For example to win you really need the four-way shot in cyberspace. It's is doable without it, I did, and I'm proud because it's nigh on impossible.Despite all the bad things I've mentiond I really must emphasise just how exceptionally good this game is. Easily a better game than the classic game Flashback which this game first reminded me of (Platform adventure where you start the game on the run from the authorities with no idea what's going on). Although that's a rather crude comparison when the older one is a single screen rotoscoped (flashback had smoother animation) linear adventure and the other is a complex RPG adventure with shoot-em-up, beat-em-up and platform elements.8.6/10 add .3 if using a controller.oh, and all the badge rewards were pretty cool too, although I'm not considering that in my rating.

												Playing this game makes me feel like I'm playing a side-scrolling version of ""System Shock 2"". It's themes and RPG system are roughly similar to it, and that's what draws me in.Love the 2-dimensional side-scrolling aspect. Love the cyberpunk theme. Love the top-down shooter hacking interface. Love the easy stealth/take-down aspect.If you love these things as well, you really need to give ""DEX"" a try.Just be wary of some things:1) Playing the game with the Xbox 360 controller is fine for the general gameplay. But when making the transition from general gameplay to the Cyberspace/AR interface, make sure you have a trusty keyboard nearby.2) The gunplay function can be your friend or your enemy. Train yourself with the controls, particularly when using a controller. You may even find that your fists work more efficiently over any gun you come across.3) Be wary of your surroundings. Everything with a health bar or blinking light could, and probably will, kill you.4) Mature content. Expect ANYTHING a back alley would normally have.Other than that, I recommend this game to all.

												Dex is a retro-style platform RPG with a strong cyberpunk theme. By retro I don't mean NES/8-bit era, which I essentially think is overhyped and generally pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the more stronger part of the 16-bit era with parallax scrolling, strong beautiful pixel graphics (which utilizes 256+ colors) and animation. Dex suffers from a few obvious issues, the control scheme being one; controlling the protagonist is often frustrating to dumb, and the animations, while decent sometimes work to your disadvantage (ie. slower animations than your reaction time) making it feel a bit clunky at times. On top of that the game suffers from a broken savegame-mechanic where you find yourself having to do some pretty annoying ""avoid drops of certain death""-levels, dying at the end of them and having to do it all over to some pretty non-user friendly skill systems, it isn't always crystal clear how and what you are supposed to do, and the quest log isn't always helpful.With that said, the backstory, the level design, and the atmosphere and characters in the game make it stand out as a title, if you like cyberpunk games, this is a surprisingly enjyable title with several subquests and opportunities to delve into the world. If you can get over some of the indie-clunkiness you have a strong RPG-gem here. Game takes 8-14 hours to complete.			"

												Picked this up on Steam to kill some time while waiting on the next AAA release Witcher 3. I also got Wolfenstein Old Blood to pass time until Witcher 3 comes out, but so far all i have been wanting to do is play DEX. The mix of fighting genre, old school rpg, with a dash of cyber is just such a cool concept and i had never seen or played anything like it before.If you are a fan of old school rpg and also Deus Ex, you will love this game. It definately has some bugs, but devs appear to be working through them, so don't let that hold you back. And expect to get frustrated at the level of difficulty, The game is not easy, especially in the beginning, and nothing is spoon fed to you. So no  quest markers are glittering trails to follow objectives etc.			"

												2D cRPG, mixed with platform and arcade elements. Very nice visuals, great soundtrack and voice acting, solid cyberpunk story. If you enjoyed games like Shadowrun and Deus Ex, you should get this one as well.			"

												Best Cyberpunk game I've played so far. It's atmosphere is amazing, the story is interesting and absorbing, and the gameplay is simple and easy to understand yet tight.It's a platformer, not an open-world game, which is a point to be considered.			"

												Dex is a sidescrolling cyberpunk adventure. For most of the way through I was thinking Shadowrun by way of Castlevania, but it's more Deus Ex than Shadowrun. No matter how you look at it, Dex hewes pretty closely to cyberpunk tropes: from the rain-soaked neon-lit city in the intro, to the machinations of shadowy megacorps and the threat of globe-spanning AIs. Dex wears its influnces proudly. Case in point: Your mentor through the game is a ""retired"" hacker by the name of Decker, which hearkens back to the ""deckers"" of Shadowrun and Rick Deckard of Blade Runner.So, is it any good? Yes, and no. Let's start with the good. The writing, while not phenomenal, manages to be entertaining throughout. It's full of cliches, sure. It does put together a memorable cast of characters, though. Some of the quests are groan-inducingly standard (help, a gang stole some of my stuff), but others are more memorable (ie. the singer and her superfan). There are e-mails and notes to read scattered throughout the game, but thankfully not an overwhelming amount, and they do a good job of sketching out a city full of people just doing what they must to get by.The art is both good and bad. The cinematics and character dialog portraits are quite good, as are the environments. The character models, though... ugh. Dex is flat-out ugly, as are most people you meet. The character artist seems to have trouble with faces. Well, not just faces. The human body in general; try not to shudder when you see the ""sexy"" dancers on display at Afterlight. Animations are also pretty stilted.The combat system is best described as awkward. It's also hard as balls, until you get a few upgrades under your belt. I probably save-scummed my way through the first 20-30% of the game, until I had enough skills to ""hack"" enemies with relative ease and and rely mostly on stealth takedowns of all but the strongest enemies. When it's down to just one-on-one, it's pretty easy to cheese out a hand-to-hand combat victory without taking any damage at all.Ranged combat is an option, and a terrible one, as far as I could tell. There's only like 4 different guns in the whole game, and no way to block or dodge enemy fire. I found it best to get up close and personal, at which point the gunslingers would just try to kick and punch you, which was each to block or dodge. I ended up putting all my upgrade points into the non-combat options (hacking/lockpicking/conversation) which I think served me much better. That is, until a couple of sequences at the very end where gunplay was completely unavoidable. Really, was nothing learned from Deus Ex: Human Revolution?Oh, and I haven't mentioned hacking yet. Do you like arena-shooters? Your answer to that question will determine how much you enjoy ""hacking"". Like the regular combat, it's ridiculously hard until you get a few upgrades about 25% of the way through, at which point it changes into a cakewalk.Pros:+ Story & Characters+ Art (cutscenes, portraits, environments)+ Pretty much all the cyberpunk tropes you can imagineCons:- Combat- Art (characters, animations)- Pretty much all the cyberpunk tropes you can imagineMeh:= Hacking			"

												That was a great experience. This game plays like a sort of Choose Your Own Adventure mashup of Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥s work, Neuromancer, The Lawnmower Man, Blade Runner, and a couple more major inspirations. If you like these works, and like cyberpunk-type games, you'll enjoy this one.100%-ed in around 20 hours. I _might_ replay again and choose a different path (I went charisma, lockpicking, hacking, AR, melee), but I doubt it. Not because it's not good, but because the game doesn't lend itself well to replay. BUT, as I've said, I thoroughly enjoyed the twenty hours I got out of the game.			"

												Im Vegan and had Tofu at a Chinese Restaurant to restore health lol!First impressions are its a really good 2-D game that is much more than the typical hack-and-slash and jump over obstacles. Lots of conversations-networking, open world missions, some strategy and a bit of stealth.  I am a big fan of Deus Ex-Human Revolution and this is a good 2-D take on that! Good price, good gameplay, good graphics. My only issue is that you have to backtrack so much and repeatedly bypass the same areas (i guess metroid like) after gaining access or needing to speak with someone. While the locations in the ""open world"" are not long or too big to pass through it can get dull in that regard with so much running around for tasks.9.5/10 - based on price and indie game standards!

Status: 100% completedThe original version didn't have a manual save system, but Enhanced Edition fixed that. This game is hard to put down, but the decent save system is extremely important in such games and EE delivers just that you would expect in that department. PresentationThe character art is as great as in Shadowrun trilogy. The animation of talking heads may seem funny to some, but you get used to it and I was more listening and reading most of the time anyway.The style of everything else (character sprites, enemies, environments, etc.) probably wouldn't be to everyone's taste. It reminds me of Residue, maybe it's the same artist. Overall the art is definitely not bad and there is an incredible amount of details, but it has that “dirty” look, so, I how said, it wouldn't be to everyone's taste. It's still better than Residue, though. The animations could use more frames, but they're also fine the way they are.Sound / MusicALL voice actors did a great job portraying their characters, 100% fit. Well, maybe except Holm, but there's a reason why he talks that way. Still, it feels like the actor didn't understand how his character should talk like.I always was waiting for actors finish their lines (except Holm). The voice acting is really, really good.The music stays with you even if you're not in the game. The tunes are memorable and fit whatever is happening in the game perfectly. It's worth noting that they used the real orchestra to record the soundtrack.The main theme strongly reminds me of the main theme in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I'm kinda sure Dex theme was inspired by it.The in-game sounds are fine and do the job. Although Dex could use a bit more sounds for jumping, she only has two of these “uh-oh” and it may get tiresome or funny when you jump a lot on your way to somewhere.StoryCan't say that something original was brought to the table, you will see most cyberpunk tropes you could see in a cyberpunk media.What's important, is that HOW the story is told, and the storytelling is absolutely brilliant here, especially the dialogues. Each character is unique and talks and behaves accordingly to who they are, be it an Irish sailor or a fat nerd who spends all his time in the Internet. They all feel alive. Everything, from journal logs and item descriptions has the same quality of writing.Considering it's a game from Czech company, it's a huge achievement, because it doesn't feel like the game was made by non-Native speakers. No mistakes, no typos, not even a little one.GameplayThe game design here reminds me a lot about Deus Ex, well, as if it was mixed with some metroidvania (because the game is 2D). Many hidden spots and ways to approach the target, invest points in skills to be a trained melee fighter or a great gunner. However, hacking is a something you can't skip in this game, so be sure to invest in that skill as it would be really hard without upgrading it, especially the last boss. Speaking of hacking, unlike many other cyberpunk games, it's made the way the arcade games in 80s were made, and it's great. You control a small spaceship-like sprite and shoot your way through the cyberspace. In my opinion, it's much fun than node hacking in Deus Ex: HR.The choices you do throughout the game really matter, sometimes they even change the locations around you (besides BioTech scandal you can also bomb some locations twice in the game, which will change them forever).There are three main endings, two of them depend entirely on what you did at the some point of the game.Now, the battle system. Another thing which won't be to everyone's taste. You get used to it though. The enemies have their own patterns which you quickly learn and react accordingly, it's all about reacting most of the time.I like screwing around enemies, jumping and running around, spamming that hit button to see if I hit anything this time. The Takedown ability (silent kill from behind) is extremely important, it changes a lot the way you approach the enemies – learn their walking patterns, hack all cameras in the area and then take them  down one by one without a fight.So does the evade rolling. If an enemy has a gun and you don't, you can quickly roll to him, land a jump kick which will make him fall down and then proceed with a series of punch combos).It's a must play for fans of cyberpunk RPG games and it's quickly became one of my favourite games. It's the game where you want to find every secret, see all quest outcomes and main endings. Absolutely recommended.The review copy provided by the developer.Sasha Darko for Game Obscura "

												Fantastic but flawed.At it's high points the writing and storytelling are top of the line, side-quests are interesting, and the gameplay has some genuinely great experiences. It does a great job of combining your physical actions with hacking and crafts a unique experience. As a cyberpunk fan, this game was one of the best I've played.It does have a slow and frustrating start. Combat is clunky, guns are deadly, and a very awkward save sytem.  But the gameplay  opens up once you have a few skills and cyberware options. It still has it's moments, but overall I enjoyed the hell out of it.But, it really isn't balanced for mutliple styles of play. Certain skills are required to continue in the game and certain skills are borderline useless. Even worse, one path pretty much turns Dex into a freaking Goddess that breaks the game. There was no longer combat only slaughter.   Don't get me wrong, it felt good to be a living cheat code for a while, but it was waaaay overpowered.I tend to pay games for short periods and move on, but Dex wasn't one of them. I got busy and moved on but I couldn't stop thinking about it until I finished it. Even now, I'm contemplating trying some challenge runs for the heck of it.			"

So if you're uncertain (like me before buying/playing the game) to buy because of the moderate metascore of that game don't falter if youre into:+ jump and runs+ cyberpunk+ story rich games (with great story and some twists)+ RPG's+ moral choices+ nice Art and fitting music+ good atmosphere+ voice acting (most dialogues)+ no bugs (i didn't experience any)+ replayability+ beat em ups (only if youre playing a melee-built)+ stealth games (playstyle dependent)things that are neutral/negative:o well i can't imagine playing this game with gamepad (i didn't try either)- sometimes (i mean rarely) exits or doors collide with dropped items so you try to interact with the item but go trough the door (yeah i know its nothing ...) just for the info: I played: a melee-cyborg-hacker			"

The story is also one of this game's strong points. While it borrows the building blocks of many other stories in the field, part Blade Runner, part Neuromancer/Johnny Mnemomic, even part Matrix, it does so aptly and in my opinion uses these blocks diversely enough to be its own story.I have just beaten it and do not rue the purchase one bit.

												Dex is overflowing with cyberpunk, which is a good thing if you like the genre. It's not a great game by any means, and I encountered few bugs here and there - nothing gamebreaking though - but it is a great fun for someone who loved Neuromancer. It is similar to Shadowrun Returns, the difference is its 2d presentation and more action oriented combat. The atmosphere is very similar, but as I prefer my cyberpunk unmagical Dex was a wee bit better for me. All in all if you like cyberpunk definetely give it a try. Game is not that long, took me ca. 11 hrs with almost all the sidequests done, but it was fun 11 hrs.

												I just beat the game and came to give my own review. First of all: this game is WAY too short. I don't mean that in a ""not worth the money, you pay for only a little teaser"" sense. I mean that by the time you finish the game you're very, very much wanting more. More plot, more story, more action... ""leave them wanting more,"" and this game does that.Excellent musical score, interesting stylized graphics, and the gameplay is extremely retro - evocative of the 16 bit era. Except that unlike so many other games, ""retro"" doesn't mean ""uninspired attempt to appeal to nostalgia to get away with a lackluster product,"" but rather ""everything that was good in games like Blackthorne and Shadowrun, but refined by advances made since the days of the Genesis and SNES."" I hope to see more of this game series, or from this studio, in the future.			"

												Dex is terrific little sci-fi action adventure. The controls are side-on, and you platform around like Another World or Flashback, but the gameplay is modernized with some stealth possibilities and lots of different ways to develop your character. I love that you can solve certain missions with dialog options if you choose; outside of graphic adventures this is quite rare. As usual for me, i found the shooting a little tedious (in particular the bullet hell hacking minigame), so it may be a little too twitchy for a pure adventure fan. But despite that, and although the main storyline isn't going to win any originality awards, the characters are so charming and the world is so well-developed that the city is delight to explore. There's more going on here than i would expect from an indie game. Very nice surprise.			"

												Perfectly decent game that had just enough charm and personality to make up for poor combat controls and somewhat awkward exploration mechanic. Hacking in this game feels and looks like playing asteroids on my T-9 calculator back in middle school. For those of you too young or unaquainted with that comparision it is not a flattering one. Still the game has some good things going for and I enjoyed the atmosphere story enough to say it's worthy installment to a video game library on sale.I'd say it's 5/10 and maybe a slight bump for fans of cyberpunk.

												Dex is a side scrolling action oriented RPG that focuses on a non linear progression, basically you have a couple story missions and alot of side quests very metroidvania in nature but more optional content than find weapon x to go to zone y.OK now that we got that out of the way let me break it down much betterGameplay-Very simplistic you have attack, block, use item, hack, jump, draw and fire weapon etc. which are pretty standard at the beginning of the game i felt the actual gameplay was slow and the controls very sluggish however after I grew to be accustomed to the timing my problems with this and actively thinking they were sluggish diminished. hacking the mini game is basically an old school 8 way shooter the rest of the game plays akin to a side scrolling action game with potential for stealth elements.Sound-The music soundtrack is great and the sound fx are well done as well, all character with any dialogue are fully voiced minus dex who is only voiced at specific points but not during all conversation options and believe it or not the VA is actually rather good.Graphics-The game art is absolutely beautiful the environments all have alot of character as well as the sprites the world around you truly feels vibrant and lively.Controls-I played on a xbox controller which functioned very well i assume KB/mouse would work even better for narrow aim windows but the game iself isnt very demanding on twitch reflex so either option is fine no issues but very rudimentary and basic.RPG mechanics-Now Dex does something I liked alot in this area, the skill progression is very generic and not overwhelmingly amazing stick to a few things to spend your points in get good at them and gradually as you get more skills and levels the game gets easier but there is a catch, everything in dex is finite from the ammount of exp you can earn money you can earn bullets you can buy etc. Take out a thug he's gone forever so you get a feel like your actions do matter in this grandiose game world.Story-Kinda cliched and not entirely original however its executed well and fits the genre so I can't complain about it, there are also alot of references to the cyberpunk genre as well as other games hidden about within the world and dialogue.Closing comments-Gameplay wise dex is average at best and tries to combine alot of elements of other games into one highly stylized amalgam, however the presentation that the game delivers combined with these base mechanics wraps it all up into something special as each piece delivers sub par but mixxed together it creates something that was truly enjoyable for me to play.To buy or not to buy that is the question-Delivering roughly 12-15 hours of gameplay if you are a fan of the cyberpunk genre and metroidvania while on sale the game is a definate purchase, if not on sale i highly reccomend it still.

												I'm loving this game for many reasons. The only issues are about missing cloud steam support for savegames (it's really a pity, considering how easy would be to support it) and the lacking of a decent support for xbox controller on mac os system. Due to that I was unable to play it on my macbook and I was forced to play it only on my windows based desktop.The gameplay is interesting and the possibility to use different approaches (fight or hacking) it's working for me. I've read a lot of bad reviews related to bugs and save system ecc. but they're surely related to old version of the game. I'm almost finished the game without any real blocking bug or similar... "

												Fans of cyberpunk rejoice as this game is clearly for us cyberpunk fans. I normally do not like side scrolling games but I have thoroughly enjoyed this one. The gameplay is fun and gives you freedom playing in different play styles and approach the situation from more than one angle that you will build up to by allocating skill points in a classic RPG manner. It matters where and when you spend your skill points as you will not be able to max out everything. The game is also plot driven and you will be hooked until the end. It’s not too long (I beat it in about 20 or so hours in two sessions) which for me is a plus because I don't like it when games drag on forever just to take your time for no reason, so it never feels like a grind and I was hooked from start to the end. Finally the artwork just works: the colors convey the cyberpunk mood perfectly, so does the music. The animations are fluid and beautiful. The voice acting is spectacular: all the characters are voiced by different voice actors and they all did an amazing job.So all in all it’s an amazing game, that won't take your life away and will leave you wanting more. I will be looking forward for Dex 2.			"

												I originally gave a bad review due to numerous gamepad issues. Thankfully, the enhanced version fixed most of those, so I'm happy to change my review to a glowingly positive one, now that I have completed the game! It ended up being the best gaming experience in a long while.What an awesome and innovative approach to both platformers and RPGs! I've never seen anything like it. Gorgeous visuals, refreshing and original art style. True cyberpunk experience, with a well executed storyline, immersive atmosphere (!) and insanely good voice acting. Surprisingly smart and challenging level design with non-linear flow, too. There's really not much left to ask for. Maybe only for smarter enemies that have more combat manoeuvres.All in all, a wonderful game more than worth its full price. Will keep an eye on this studio.			"

												Excellent game. The art is amazing. Nailed the cyberpunk setting. The city feels alive with inhabitants and even animals coming and going.The story is good, the characters are great, and the voice acting is AWESOME. I can't stress it enough, I couldn't skip any dialogue, as it was really good, and to hear the voices.Lot's of stuff to do, and some choices in quests that have effect in the world.And upgrades - you feel the character becoming stronger. The firearms could be more useful, as I went through the game firing really little, and mostly at cameras and ceiling turrets.I love games which mix playing styles/modes, and this one has a great cyberspace which is integral to the game. It's well built, fun, albeit it could get more utilities.Enemies could be more varied, real world and cyberspace.Really hoping for a Dex 2, and/or more games like this.			"

												Dex is an action RPG set in a cyberpunk world. Woken from sleep one night by an mysterious figure called Raycast and told to run for it, Dex is thrust into an underworld of hackers and criminals as she seeks to figure out why one of the mysterious corporations who run the world want her dead.The game is a side scroller with action combat that includes both melee and gunplay. You earn experience to level your character up by completing quests and winning battles, putting points into various skills like hacking, lockpicking and combat to improve Dex's abilities as the game goes on. You can also purchase cybernetic upgrades to further boost your abilities. The game also includes a cyberspace hacking mode which plays out a lot like a bullet hell shooter only not as frantic.The plot is quite good and there a lot of quests to complete, often with multiple ways to finish them. It is engaging and there are a few plot twists to be had along the way. The writing is solid though I personally found the ending a little abrupt.Overall Dex is a fun game and if you like cyberpunk settings or action RPG's you should enjoy yourself. I found the combat a little weak but by the end of the game you are can wade through it so it becomes less of a drag. The game is quite polished with good graphics and some pretty solid voice acting from the main cast. The music is worth mentioning too as it really helps aid the atmosphere.7 out of 10			"

												So you think the game is over. Then it's not. You realize, ""Ah, THIS must be the end!"" It's not. Still more is throw at you. For a $20 game, Dex has surprising depth and is well worth the money. If you buy it on some sort of sale, it's a steal. In short, buy it, play it, love it. For more detail oriented gamers, a more fleshed out review is below.Plot: 4/5   Typical futuristic cyberpunk fare with a dash of transcendental philosophy, it was still fun and engaging. The characters were well developed, quests are standard but create the intriguing story, and (unless you save a lot) your actions and dialogue have real consequences. (A couple NPCs may or may not have died by my action/inaction. I take the 5th.) The pacing is quick, and the story resolves itself before the gameplay gets boring or feels like a grind.Controls: 4/5   I played with K&M, no gamepad. For the most part, controls function well. The only hiccups came more with the 2-D enviroment, navigating stairs and such. In Augmented Reality (AR), the mouse really shined and the strict NSEW format was tailored for the keyboard.Voice Acting: 5/5   I was really surprised by the voice acting. All dialogue (that I recall) is acted, and most is REALLY well done. The characters are brought to life and they will annoy you, inspire you, and make you laugh.Graphics: 5/5   Yes, I'm giving visuals a 5/5. You can see screenshots to know what to expect and it doesn't match up to a 3D rendered world of a AAA title. However, for what they are, the visuals are fantastic. The world is detailed (""This is NOT subliminal messaging.""),  and the setting flows from scene to scene. The still frame cutscenes convey emotion and give the world grit. Overall: 5/5    Again, I was surprised by the depth and overall quality of Dex. I don't write many reviews, but felt that this was a worthy title. Buy it, full price or on sale, and you won't be disappointed.			"

												A delightful cyberpunk romp. The setting is decent; they do a reasonable job of making it seem like this is still a bustling city, even with the limitations of what areas they were able to put in. The art direction is top notch; the art itself also good. The voice acting is pretty damned good. Decent effort from all involved, and it seems like quite a cast. Gameplay is fun, if perhaps a bit easy at times.I think I would have liked to see a bit more of the actual interaction from the main character. She seems to be the only one in the game who mostly doesn't have a personality, aside from a few small cut scenes. I don't think it'd have much in the way of replay value, so keep that in mind when making a purchase decision. I'm not sure exactly how much playtime I got out of it. Steam's telling me 27 hours, but I'm pretty sure a significant chunk of that was paused. I don't think I'd pay full price, but I'm reasonably satisfied with what I got for what I did pay (CDN$ 5.49).Controlled support was good, and I'd say highly recommended.			"

												Worth buying. Rather good in pretty much every aspect, exceptional in a few. This game is a bit like a 2D indie sidescrolling Deus Ex game, albeit not so convoluted and nobody says the word ""Illuminati"" in it. It takes about 10 to 20 hours to play through.Technical issues:but will they come when you do call their subroutine?No problems. I enountered very few bugs and none were severe. No inopportune framerate drops, no crashes, no corrupt savegames. This game does not need a new or fast PC to run.Pictures and sounds:full of sound and fury, signifying lasersEverything is interesting to look at. Things which are supposed to be pretty are pretty. Things which aren't supposed to be pretty are grotesque. A couple of animations look a tiny bit weird but not egregiously so. All the areas in the game look visually distinct and each has its own character. The visuals are always easy to parse. There are no functional defects like enemies or important objects blending into the background, nor are there any scenes that are too visually noisy to pick the important parts out of.The music is uniformly good and always fits into the scenes it is used in. There are one or two places where it's a little loud relative to foreground sounds, but not in any important scenes and it never obscures sounds that are important for gameplay. It is quite akin to contemporary film music, designed to underscore each scene rather than steal the show. There isn't anywhere in this game like the nightclubs in ""Bloodlines"" where I'd go stand around just to listen to the music. Only in a couple of tracks, such as the title/menu music, does the composer (Karel Antonin) get to go off the leash and record something grand and inspirational.Almost every line of dialogue in the game is voiced, well. There are a few odd pronunciations and deliveries but nothing grating. The only character whose lines are not voiced (except in cutscenes) is Dex herself. I'm not sure if that's a stylistic choice or just a matter of practicality. She does have a ton of lines, after all.Words, plot and stage directions:exit, pursued by a cyborgThe writing is neat. It's genre cyberpunk, complete with corporate conspiracies, people plugging their brains into computers and (not too much) technobabble. There are nifty plot twists, layers upon layers of lies and the occasional moral quandary.Pretty much every character comes up with a different nickname for the protagonist, most referencing her bright blue hair. My favourite is that the singer, Barbara, will start calling Dex ""Blueberry Pie"" if you fix Barbara's life for her.There characters have varied and interesting motivations. Each is written as a person with their own thing going on, instead of having everyone's lives mysteriously revolving around Dex, a random stranger. There are characters who will lie to you and still feel worth forgiving, characters with trivial but embarrassing secrets, characters whom you will likely hate but might coöperate with anyway, smart characters, stupid characters and characters who are completely detached from consensus reality, all of whom you get to talk to, negotiate with and in some cases kill.The characters in this game are pleasingly diverse. They have varied backgrounds, accents, mindsets, priorities, ethnicities, ages and gender expressions. There isn't anything in this game that I would describe as ""creepy fanservice"". Some of the characters in this game are sexualised, which fits the genre, but only characters for whom that actually makes sense. There's a roughly equal amount of objectification of men and women going on inside this story, but the game itself doesn't really objectify any of them. Even characters who choose to be deliberately salacious are written as human beings with their own goals, problems and social ties.The way that charisma checks work in this game is really cool. Every time the game presents you with an opportunity to use charisma to convince an NPC, you have to pick between 3 arguments that Dex can make. One is always terrible and will never work; one is excellent and will always work, and one more is mediocre and will only work if you max out Dex's charisma stat. You have to work out for yourself which is which based on what you know about each character's personality and desires.The writing pays proper attention to causality; doing certain things in different orders can get characters you'll care about killed or save their lives; some quests are worth doing early on because they will make people do favours for you for free later.A nifty aspect of the writing in this game is that all the item descriptions and quest diary entries in the game are written from Dex's in-universe perspective. They're often a little sardonic and sometimes humorous. I'd like more games to do this because it gives a lot of little glimpses into how Dex thinks about her world.Gameplay:if you prick us, do we not leak electrolyte?I'm not sure if it is possible to do a pacifist or no-kill run of this game. I didn't try it myself. Very few of the side quests explicitly require you to hurt anyone. There is one scene at the end of ""Destroy GSV-2"" where I think fighting is mandatory ☹ but it's possible I might be wrong and there might be a non-violent way to get through that scene.Sneaking is a little awkward at first because there is not often very much cover and it can be awkward to spot guards without being spotted first. It gets much better later on once you can use AR to reconnoitre ahead (in most places, though doorways can be a problem) and to stun guards by hacking their brains (with which you can pull off rather dastardly feats). ""Takedown"" kills are incredibly useful and I found myself avoiding using them sometimes just because they make some fights almost too much easier.The hacking minigame is fun and operates a bit like an abstract twin-stick shooter (albeit you can just play it with WASD + a mouse). Some of the things you can do using it are amusing. For example, there is at least one level full of heavily-armed enemies that you can completely clear without stepping into, just by hacking everything on the level and turning the turrets on the guards.Meleé combat in this game is fun and engaging. I get the impression that the designers kind of wanted it to be your primary way of taking down enemies. It can be frustrating at the very start of the game when you haven't learned all the various enemies' attack patterns and tells, but that doesn't take long. Once you do it's great. It's much more about blocking, watching for openings and dodging attacks than about raining down flurries of blows.Ranged combat is a little awkward and it's oddly weak, even if you max out the skill for it. Dex's movements while using firearms are quite slow. There isn't really any such thing as a one-shot-kill in this game and the game doesn't really give you any way to reliably win a firefight without getting winged, even when you get the drop on an enemy. Ammo is a tad scarce. All that said, ranged combat is not broken in this game and it's certainly possible to afford enough bullets to shoot almost every enemy, but it isn't as much fun or effective as beating dudes up or sneaking up on them.Conclusionbut soft! what neon glow through yonder window breaks?All told, I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone who freebases zyme; burns chrome; wears mirrorshades at night; illustrates primers for young ladies; puts "", Jr"" at the end of their pen name; might be psychic; spells ""Tokyo"" with an extra 'n', 'e' and 'o'; once accidentally became wholly bald; gets unexpected phone calls from electronic lobsters and needs to take neuropozyne constantly to prevent their giant robotic arm from going haywire and punching the nearest netrunner in the face.

												I was happy to find this game, much by chance as it was. I've only some time playing the game, but the experience has been great so far. Graphics are very good all things considered; it's not one of those copy-cat isometric want-to be a classic RPG games. This is a good game, with good dialogues, good pacing, intuitive controls, an interesting world, fair character building features. The player has some agency, but not much, as far as I can tell. The story is interesting, and I am enjoying it so far. It takes place in a dystopian future dominated by a rather obscure Complex, which apparently is some sort of futuristic conglomerate of a powerful few. A classic theme, yet presented naturally. The game features also an interesting sub-system like the cyber-reality mode. It's a light, entertaining game, which stands out as a solid crpg with classic themes. I was bored sorting through a huge catalogue of games, so this one came as a ''I finally found something I can have a good time with"". I hardly think I am going to fall in love with it, but I am demanding gamer, and this met my criteria for good, fulfilled game, which can provide a great time, better at times than first class big budget craps like Fallo*cough cough, ahm.

												I honestly hardly ever do these reviews as I am now purely a Linux gamer. This game is so much fun it's ridiculous. I've enjoyed every ounce of the three hours that I have poored into this game and will continue to do so in the future. The only thing I have to say about this game is be vary if you have an Intel HD Graphics in your machine if your running Linux Mint. I would suggest Ubuntu as the preference choice of gaming OS on Linux to be precise. But I haven't had this much fun in an rpg in a while! Especially with the lack of titles coming out of Cyberpunk it's nice to see the genre isn't completely dead and hinging on the success of Deus Ex.			"

												In short? A smaller version of Deus Ex in 2D.Long version? A good cyberpunk RPG. And as far as I know it contains everything related to cyberpunk:- hacking? check- cyborgs? check- combat? check- stealth? check- conspiracy? check- corporations? checkAnd, it's a true RPG. You have choices, both plot related and how to approach obstacles. You can hack them, silently take them down, convince them, bribe them, punch them or shot them. Yes, I know, no everything can be solved in every way, but still, this feels and plays like Deus Ex.Graphics? Good 2D backgrounds. good 2D characters.Sounds/voice - good sound design. Music is nice, feets the game. All NPCs are voiced, you character is not (Fallout 1-New Vegas style).Controls - simple, but you will to get used to combat. Can be difficult at the begging of the game when you are fighting multiple enemies. But hey, you don't have to fight, you can dodge/sneak.Hacking - simple visually but very nice twin stick shooter. Like a mini game.Overall, I can't find anything bad with this game. For me, this felt like a good Deus Ex style game, with branching paths, side quest.			"

												This is only my second review so be a little patient with me okay? Dex is an excellent game as far as it goes, the lack of a true save system is annoying, but other than that it seems now to be an excellent game that is going to get better very soon. I would defenitely recommend this game for anyone, unless you are vociferacely opposed to nudity, as there is a little.			"

												Very nice cyberpunk RPG. I really liked both the story and the mechanics, I would really like more games to use graphics, controls and conventions like in Dex. Especially more cyberpunk games. :)I found the game world to amazing. Visuals are nice and the soundtrack is just awesome - it's not only providing a deep immersion into the world of the game, but I would actually like to listen to some of its tracks even outside of the game.11/10, would really like to see sequel (with separate disconnected story).

												Combine the old school Prince of Persia platformer and Deus Ex together and you end up with Dex.  This is a short cyberpunk story where the atmosphere is executed perfectly.  This game has the immersion and will easily pull you in.  Every single level has specific details that make them unique and rememberable.  You have an inventory, quests, a map, augmentations, multi-choice and well voiced dialogs, skills, experience points, and hacking.  There are a few cons to get over but overall the game is definitely worth your money and time.Some minor cons to expect:- Enemies can sometimes be deadlocked in unarmed combat.  A well experiecned player can get away with hacking, using their hands as a weapon, and not use a single bullet.- You have to spend skill points first to even be able to equip and use a machine gun or shotgun.- The AR hacking is basically a mini-game that becomes real mundane and excessive over time.- Saving is only done entering a stage.  If you die you start back at that stage.  This is actually old school gaming but it can test your patience.People who down vote on these cons alone do not know or understand what a decent game looks like.  The good clearly outweighs the negative here.			"

												The pros:- Great cyberpunk story- Interesting characters with good voice acting- Very cool merger of RPG and sidescrolling elements- Beautiful environments. The areas in the game simply do look gorgeous. Overall the game is really really pretty.- Good value for money. It took me about 12 hours to finish the game (I think I didnt miss too much) and for the asking price that is a good value of Money/Hour in my book.The cons:- I did encounter a few bugs, though nothing gamebreaking. The most annoying one was a bit of screen tearing that the Vsync option that the game provides you with sadly didn't fix.- It isnt always easy to figure out where the level ends and the background begins. I jumped to my death multiple times simply because I thought a piece of background was actually a platform that one could land on.Overall, is the game worth picking up?:If you love Cyberpunk and if you love RPGs then you dont want to miss out on this game. I would recommend it without hesitation.			"

												An amazing Cyberpunk experience. It's seems like a Playstation 1 release (graphics/ voices), but the more I play this game, the more I want to spend time in it's world. After winning the game several times, let me tell you don't waste time with firearms in this game (only thing they are good for is shooting cameras, and even then you have to upgrade to not suck at that). Even the shotgun is like trying to beat someone to death with a wiffle bat. If you sell all of your guns/ ammo, you're going to be a happier cyberpunk.Ramping up your hacker ability to the maximum is a good investment.The fact that the DLC (costumes) are built into the game is an amazing plus, and I salute the developer for not being greedy asshats!If they release another cyberpunk-style game, I'll grab it release day!

												As a big deus ex series and cyberpunk fan, I must say - this game is the REAL gem! I enjoyed every bit of it: dark and creepy atmosphere of the slums and alleyways, cozy neon lit streets of chinatown and lot more interesting places. Every piece of this 2D masterpiece is well painted in kinda old-school retro style - damn I felt so old. Great electronic ambient motives - I really want them in my audio player as standalone. Every single dialog in the game are fully voiced and fun to listen to, without skipping. Characters are quite memorizable and stand out. Gameplay has a lot to offer: lotta skills, implants, items, weapons, backtracking with fast travel, hacking, secrets etc - just for your every need and taste, ma'am! Combat system require you to pay attention to every move, whether it yours or enemy's and react fast - this way you can even beat a big armored soldier with bare hands. No skill just proper timing. If anything goes wrong you can load your saved game second before the bad encounter and try again. Gameplay also allows you to go stealthy but theres a lot situations where you cannot just snap a big guy's neck or pass through without standart beating. When you realize that almost every punk gives a lot of EXP upon death you will be surpised how persistent you can be. Game offers decent amount of choices to be made which has its own consequences, so choose wisely!8/10 unspent condoms			"

												Dex is worth buying if you're looking for a 2D version of Deus Ex, but the combat needs a lot of work and there are a good amount of bugs in a ""final"" release. The game will last you about 10 hours and that includes exploring everywhere and completing all of the side content. Even if the bugs never get fixed, it would still be worth buying during a sale sometime.Follow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/ "

												The first game in a long time to keep me playing until past 3 AM. Kept doing one quest after the other!The graphics are pretty in a retro-kind of way but without resorting to pixel art. The music is epic, and most importantly the writing is super-immersive. Dark, dangerous and brimming with ethical dilemmas. This game is cyberpunk done right!As for the mechanics, the real-time combat is difficult, but in a fun way. I found the levelling system simple but with just enough depth. There's a bit of Metroid in there. The hacking mini-game is an interesting take. Nothing exceptional, but surprisingly functional. The game has a couple of puzzles, only one of which really had me resorting to Google.The cutscenes are few and far in between, but the in-game dialogue system tells the story so well that there hardly seems a need for them. There's some good acting here, too, though as with any game beware of the stinkers (looking at you, Holm).Charming game, do buy!			"

												I think ""ambitious and flawed"" pretty much covers this one. And I would say the ambition just about outweighs the flaws. It comes across like it was developed by a group with a whole lot of talent, vision and enthusiasm, but short on experience and an eye for detail (not to mention time and money). Y'know, like this was only their second game or something...The TL;DR of it is I enjoyed the game in spite of its problems. I'm glad I gave Dreadlocks some cash, and if they make something else I'd definitely give them more just to see what they do next. Given the massive difference from their first game (""Rune Legend"" - thanks Wikipedia) to this one it's clear they had no intention of staying in their comfort zone and I think that justifies some of the mis-steps and certainly deserves some respect. The game has a cubic assload of atmosphere, the world feels cohesive, and of course you get to be a street-fighting, gun-toting cyborg, which has never yet been a bad thing. Well, except Robocop. Being Robocop has always looked like it would suck.The biggest problems for me weren't even those bugs and niggles of a small inexperienced developer, but the ones Dex shares with it's AAA brothers and sisters - not least the ongoing problem of how to make hacking work in a game. Here it's a low-rent shmup, and while it isn't *bad* as a game mechanic it really struggles when it's expected to carry some fairly dramatic moments in the story, especially when (spoiler? ish?) it also has the recent Deus Ex's problem of reducing huge choices about the fate of your character and all of humanity down to a question of which button you push and a quick cut-scene.Add to that the lacklustre and anticlimactic ""boss fight"" with the GSV-2 and Dex is in good company with the likes of Bioshock and-don't-think-I-can't-see-you-skulking-back-there-Half-Life-2-I-don't-care-if-it's-been-over-a-decade-I-will-never-ever-forgive-you. Cough. Luckily Dex still had a fair bit left to go at that point so isn't quite the spanner in the works that it could be. I guess my point is that if I'll let games from experienced developers with buckets of cash off for dropping the ball like that then I'll sure as hell forgive Dex and co when I definitely enjoyed the overall experience.

												Dex is like a 2D brawler mixed with a simplified Deus Ex. It nails the cyberpunk aesthetic and many of the quests have multiple solutions, though the game's fundamentals are somewhat lacking. Melee combat is more of annoyance than a challenge because enemies constantly run away from you while you try to hit them. Hacking is a trivial schmup-like minigame that never really gets interesting and stealth is pretty basic.However, much like Deus Ex, Dex is greater than the sum of its parts. Thanks to solid writing, great atmosphere and open-ended level design that rewards exploration, the game remains compelling throughout its relatively brief playtime.			"

												Excellent game.  I would wait a few months to play it though.  Its very buggy, and some of the bugs can actually impede further progress in the game.  The most serious ones were fixed today, but some still exist.  The game itself is set in a dystopian future with copious amounts of drugs, computer hacking, and corporate abuse of power.  The combat system supports melee, guns, and hacking into opponents implants, and all three options are viable.  This is not a stealth game, but the stealth elements are well done, especially if you buy the implant to see enemies field of view.  My only real complaint other than bugs is that the ending feels railroaded.  I really wanted a story option that wasn't present.Even with all the negatives, I would consider this a must play for the story and setting alone.9/10			"

Also some of the story concepts might remind bit too much of Gibson's Neuromancer, but that is a minor complaint.All in all Dex is a great achievement considering there is a small indie studio behind it.

												Enter the world of a cyberpunk future as a girl named Dex, who in all outward appearance seems like your average person, but the shadow organization that truly rules the world has decided to try to take her out. You will have to use your hacker skills, fend off attackers with hand to hand combat as well as with guns.In Dex, by Dreadlocks Ltd, you will find that through your experiences and how you deal with situations you will be given skill points that you can then distribute to fit your gaming style. Do you like to be a little bit more hardcore when it comes to hacking? Well put your skill points towards that. Do you want to be deadly with your hands and body when it comes to taking on opponents? Well put skill points into Melee. There's also so many more aspects that you can add your points towards. There's also the augmentation of your body with cybernetics to allow you to have more life, recover life over time, jump higher, become immune to electricity or poisonous gas, and much, much more.Graphically I kind of digged the whole vibe of the game it is a side to side scroller, sure there are doors and areas that are in the background that you can enter into, but at all times you are going to be moving left to right in areas. There are load screens for each areas, but I kind of looked the other way because that's how the game saves.Speaking of saving your game, and this is one of my biggest gripes about the game is that you can pull up the control menu and at the top of the screen it shows you want to hit to SAVE, but in reality its has nothing to do with saving, its actually where you would go to load your game. So BE WARNED, you might really♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself off with that one, that I did a couple of times.There are definitely quite a few side-quests that you're going to want to take on, and many of them do fall in the category of go over there and get me this, but to be honest there's enough action going on when you actively take on the quest that I didn't really mind, there was a bit of story to it so it wasn't mindless.One of my biggest issues with games is that when you have voice acting you half♥♥♥♥♥it, with this game, I'm happy to report that they did nothing of the sort. The voice acting definitely brought my closer in to the game, and it definitely enhances the experience. There might have been a little bit of stereotyping with at least one character (cough cough TONY), but other than that I had no issue with how the actors voiced their characters.Now one of the things that is hard to do is to have a RPG that actually changes as you make choices, and there a couple of choices that can change the path of the game, some of the choices have a HUGE impact on how everything plays out, but I don't want to give anything away.In all honesty this is a solid game, would I have like to do more hacking in the game? Absolutely. Would I have like a little bit of a more drawn out ending? Definitely. The thing is the overall game is good, and I enjoyed it. I did get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me a couple of times in areas where the auto turrets became activated, but hey you live and learn. There are secrets in this game if you are willing to look for them, and I have to say that I am more than willing to recommend this game to you. This game gets an 8.5 out of 10.			"

												Dex could have been a nice little cyberpunk adventure game. Could! Some quests with decisions, an RPG level system and some interesting characters. But then there is this awful ""hacking"" mechanic that will get on your nerves the second time you do it. It´s a poorly done twin stick shooter with no fun at all that you have to do over and over again. And the story... Just another one ""save the world from an evil conspiracy""-scenario. I was too uninterested at the half of the game because of that. Nice attempt, but not a game to have fun with after all.			"

												Metroidvania merged with Cyberpunk in a nice graphical style. The game still needs some time, but I presume the team is small and they don't have time-resources to do more things, and the result is more than good. It is a pitty the people doesn't talk more about this game.			"

So, you're DexCan you imagine how a 2D side-scrolling open world action RPG looks like? I couldn't. But we have a blue haired protagonist in a cyberpunk world and I wanted to see it. Probably you should, too.13807001You're playing Dex, a blue haired young girl who wakes up in her bed and finds herself being chased. Apart from the very first section where you have a specified place to reach, you can move freely in the beautifully crafted 2D city of Harbor Prime. The whole city is truly amazing! A great mix of the modern future with the reality of the lowlifers. Sometimes you feel you just have to stop and inspect the ads or the graffities on the walls. And you do all these while listening to the pretty nice music themes associated with each district.Close your eyes, little birdThe game comes with a few localization included. I haven't checked this before purchasing and I was totally surprized that the game even supports Hungarian. And mostly it's a great localization, but at some (not much, only a few) places it was mixed with the original English texts which caused some confusions. I was doing a mission and I had two dialog choices. Unfortunately both of them were the same. The only difference was that one of them was in English, the other one was in Hungarian. Because they were the same otherwise, I could not decide what to choose. Picked one randomly, it turned out I just refused to help that person further. So yeah. And the translation also had some spelling errors in it. Despite of this, it's still a very nice addition to have and I'm grateful for the developers that they were doing this.They are coming for youYou can develop your lovely character by putting points to her abilities when leveling up and you can get augmentations too. Plus, there is a free DLC you should install which provides three special suits to choose from with unique abilities. You can get the one which suits your playstyle.Once you start doing missions, you can fight, shoot, run. And you can also enter the cyberspace to hack vending machines, cctv cameras, enemy turrets and computers. For real-life fights you use your health pool, for cyberspace hacking you use your focus points. Once they are gone you are dropped out from the cyberspace and suffer a little damage too.Spending skillpoints is possible on hacking abilities, weapon mastery, agility, etc. I played through the game by not putting a single point for weapon mastery since I preferred hacking myself through it. So if you want to blast through with weapons, or want to hide and go through vents as much as you can, you can totally do that. That was not my style however, so I rather stunned people by hacking then got close and beat them. To ease this process, I got a health regen augmentation and a suit which regenerated my focus points over time. After getting that, plus the proper skill points, I was just fine with my fists.Tomorrow's a new world, little birdThe artstyle of the game is amazing, the music is fantastic, and while the characters are not exactly high-res models, it's a pleasure to look at them. I experienced some microstuttering in the scrolling when I was running through the districts without stopping, but it wasn't a huge deal. You can save, but it doesn't really saves your actual progression rather it seem to be saving the status of your game when you entered to the area. So if you want to make sure you don't lose any of your progress when saving, you need to go through a loading screen first by going another district or another part of the level and save the progress after that.ProsThe city is beautifully made. Amazing neon lights, beautiful graffities. It's a living city, it feels real.I liked the musicThe story is nice too, despite the fact that you can predict it at some pointThe hacking is fun once you get the upgradesThe controls are responsive and works like expectedGreat voice actingConsSome microstuttering while scrollingYou don't get recommendations on the quest order so it's easy to start doing something you don't have the ability forWhile I loved the story, the ending was a little overcomplicated and you have more questions than answersGet the game if you'd like to play a truly amazing cyberpunk game with nice 2D graphics and story.

												Recommended for you if:(a.) Your potato can't play Deus Ex: Mankind Divided(b.) You loved Deus Ex but always wanted a female character but were not smart enough to mod the game TO have a female character(c.) You need a new Cyberpunk game fix... you addict(d.) You are a fan of 2D metroidvania games with stealth. Are you the type that likes the option to not kill anyone?Interesting world and characters. Obviously aimed toward a more mature audience, plays like you'd imagine a 2D Deus Ex would. Many nods to Deus Ex, Metroid Prime, Watch Dogs and the cult-classic movie called Hackers.The voice-acting is sometimes great, and sometimes questionable. The combat is decent but it's cool you can play with stealth and perform take-downs and hide in the background behind objects (think Mark Of The Ninja). You can get augmentations and hack stuff too. It's an rpg through and through though so you do have a character sheet to level up and improve certain things. Hack bots, computers an security systems to your benefit ;)The animation and art style are really cool, I personally love to just watch how the foregrounds communicate with the backgrounds, it adds a certain atmosphere to a game.Great control response with an Xbox 360 controller. You can choose between 30fps or 60fps and any resolution. Runs like butter, I do recommend you to go blue and jack yourself into this Harbor Prime! -Oh wait...			"

												This is definitely a very enjoyable game.  If you like cyberpunk, 2D gaming with an incredible art style, and RPGs, definitely check this out. I'm already on my second playthrough, the first coming in at around 18 hours I think, and while it does have a few flaws, I highly recommend this game.The Pros:- Great, engaging story with an awesome female protagonist- Overall the combat is fun, especially melee- The characters are great- Exploring the world is a lot of fun too- Good length, left me feeling with a wanting more feeling, but I prefer that to overstaying their welcomeThe Cons- While the melee is great, it would be cool to be able to use weapons, and though you can upgrade your fists, it would still be cool to have some cool cyberpunk style weapons,especially since the enemies have them too.- The gunplay is pretty awkward, especially if you're using a controller- Be cool to also customize your character a bit, or buy different outfits for her, but that's slightly nitpicking, and Dex still looks very awesome.Overall I would easily give this game a 9.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and am looking forward to my more stealth-style second run through.			"

												Dex is a nice game, sure it isn't long but instead very compact, every place feels like it could really be in a real city and has its own feeling to it where other 2D games get repetitive after a while and I really like that. The Cyberpunk-atmosphere is really good and additionally I liked the combat-system (melee, guns are just not as interesting), especially the part at the beginning where you literally are just a normal person to which every single enemy is a threat. And the story, well that is something I think everyone should decide for themselves.Two additional things more:-If you don't know to go melee or ranged, go melee it really gets used more and is more interresting (imo)-Download the Extra-Outfit-DLC, it's gratis but it doesn't get downloaded automatically (nice little addition)			"

												The game is short, I finished it in 13.9 hours. That's only 82% achievement completed, but I would consider going back to play through again for the decisions I didn't make. You can read a lot of reviews for ""what it's like and what it draws from"", so I'll just talk about the game ""briefly"" and not give spoilers.It's a steampunk environment with a story and world that drew me in and left me wanting more. It took me to a time where it was difficult to take breaks, because I was wondering what the hell was going on. Who were these people? Why are they interested in me? Why do bad things happen to good people?Combat is not really fluid, but was still enjoyable. I think I died like 15 times before finally understanding my limitations as a character. I focused mostly on melee because it was just the most readily available. There are only a few guns in the game, but this isn't COD or BF. You don't need to have a huge selection of guns. Rapid fire, shotty, pistol, taseresque, and a laser beam. If the laser beam was on the head of a shark, that'd really be the cherry on the whipped cream that was this game. Would I buy the game again? Absolutely. Would I spend full price on it? Iffy, but I would certainly get it on a sale again. If there was a Dex 2, would I get that at the right price? You're darn tooten, Tex.			"

												Great game! I've had it since early beta. I thought it sounded interesting so  I picked it up on sale. At that time you could'nt really do much. All that could be done at that time is a little running around in a few areas and maybe two side quests. I was a little disapointed so I just forgot about it till a few days ago. My daughter and I were talking about future tech and what not recently. Somehow this got me to thinking about dex when I was on steam. When I booted up I was plesantly suprised to find a full game! The game itself is kind of like castlevania or metroid with more of a rpg twist. Story has a blade runner deus ex feel to it.The action is pretty good for control except the gun control is a little bad, at least when using a controller.Overall I really like this game a lot and its one of my favorites that I've got off steam since I got my alpha console earlier this year. I strongly recomend this game to anyone that likes castlevania, metroid, deus ex, or just good sci fi in general. To the developers: this would make a great addition to xbox one and ps4.			"

												If you like tags given to the game make you curious, you will undoubtedly enjoy Dex. The city seems large, cyberpunk and alive, there's all plenty of quests to do and they're well enough written to feel interesting one after another. Voice acting is actually a fair bit better than you can hear in the trailer, I have no idea why the devs chose those lines to represent their game as they're crappier than average. My only gripe is the main character's running animation and her jump noises, which both seem goofy at first but you grow used to them soon enough. One portion of the update screen also requires meticulous placing of your cursor to keep the skill description showing, but that's only a minor nuisance.Some of the reviews still on may mention bugs but the game was patched several times in the weeks after its release, and I haven't yet ran into anything myself.TL;DR: You like the setting and the genre, get it and enjoy it!

												The game is visually stunning. The world seems alive, the colouring and atmosphere is intense and it feels like you're actually in this world. For the platforming, it's actually really solid, something that I'll admit, didn't expect at all.Lots of people compare this to Deus Ex with good reason. There are choices and consequences that help or upset the balance throughout the playthrough. Eventhough I haven't finished it yet, it's deffinatly worth the effort for anyone that likes to have choices, consequences, great visuals and so far, a good storyline.There is, however, one thing that gets on my nerves, simply because the console versions have it and for some reason, the PC version doesn't: A save function.The autosaves are only whenever you enter a 'big' area (or hub) and thus, not smaller ones. I've been doing a whole series of quests, been ported from 1 'big area' to another and it didn't save. I died after 30 minutes of finishing up the quest, then found myself all the way back at another 'big area' and thus losing 30 mins of my game.I went around this 'issue' by walking off the screen so it saves, then get back in. But why is there a save function on the consoles and not on the PC?Other than that, combat seems clunky and takes a lot of getting used to. For some reason, I take way too much damage, from certain enemies, then none at all because the enemy just flees.Still, despite the above mentioned gripes, this is a very solid and atmospheric 2d action/adventure/roleplaying game that's already begging for a second playthrough while not even being done with it yet.Not going to give it a score as those are redundant, but it's definitly high up in the top of 'really nice games'.This is an edit - I'm not going to delete half the comment or use strikethrough.There now IS a safe feature, after the recent update, which is a huge plus.Thanks to the developer to keep supporting the game!

This is long enough to gain a connection with the main character, Dex, and reveal the world in which she lives without being so long as to challenge your attention.

												Update... the game has been updated so imagine my first sentance of the actual review becoming null over time. The recent update is pretty substantial in regards to the mechanics too.You know this game is pretty good, but I just wish it was better. If any one single aspect was done better... it'd be a really amazing game. With that said, its a solid playable title as is, and still pretty enjoyable. It does a good job at everything it does, all the styles it tackles, but good in like a 7 out of 10 kinda way. It's just no system, rpg or combat, is as complex as you would hope. Platforming, trading, hacking, shooting, leveling, all kinda 7 outa 10ish. Level design, story, and everything else, on average 7. Weird thing this 7 outta 10 rule applys to literally everything UI is great, but, guess what, it's slightly broken fullscreen. Still, this game does one thing PERFECTLY, it attempts to make a game I actually want to play and it does it. 20 bucks aint bad for how good the game actually is. I'm giving this game comparisons to something like deus ex, megaman/metroid, idk, legends. So yeah, go for it.... maybe it will encourage people to make more like this.			"

												I'm dissappointed.  I was willing to overlook the cludgie mellee combat system.  Isolate the enemy, get close and slowly punch them to death(too fast and they can fight back). However, the end game 'trials' feel trite at best.  All augmentations earned/bought are stipped away, but ""here's some bonus healing potions"".  I understand the intent, but the impelmentation sucks nuts harder than a squirl-vacuum hybrid.If you want to play this game, do not sell 1 F--king healing 'potion'. <spoiler>The 'trials' at the end negate ALL of your augments/progress.   The only way to counter this is with the varrious healing options.  If you choose to ignore healing options for special regeneration, you will be screwed.  Heck you may be screwed anyway.  But don't count on the healing augment.  It's turned off in the end game. This is your only warning.			"

												i really, really want to like this game. i like the cyberpunk setting, the atmosphere, the voice acting, the choices, the upgrade system, the side missions, the characters,,, its pretty much deus ex in 2D, only with a female protagonist. but the combat is what keeps me from liking the game. its frustrating to defeat an enemy. even when you can dodge, block and roll around, you still get hit. especially hard when you have no firearm and you have to fight off one with an automatic who depletes your health before you can reach him. and even if you have a firearm, you do not much damage to them. more frustrating is when you are surrounded by 3 enemies and one of them has a firearm. you can be stealthy and take down enemies from behind, but the rather taller ones you can not. being stealthy sound good but this does not last for long. once you enter a door, an enemy or even 3 see you right away and attack you at once. you have no chance before that to hide or anything to prevent being spotted.  hacking is also frustrating because you get attacked by a never ending swarm of viruses that its impossible to stay at one spot to complete the hack. deactivating a camera or turret gun turns in to a mission impossible. because of this, upgrading is impossible. defeating enemies and hacking gives you experience and these level up your character that unlock one skill point. you get money as well but you spend your money mostly on health packs that you have no money left to buy upgrades or other useful stuff to help you out. there are healthpacks throughout the levels, but once you have used them, regardless how much health you have, they are permanently depleted.

												Dex is good old-fashioned PC gaming.  I haven't encountered hardly any bugs, and certainly nothing game breaking (Windows 7, 64).  Save system should be better,  UI should be more dynamic on a gamepad (equpping items requires keyboard and mouse), but these are small complaints in what is otherwise an excellent and engaging action-adventure  game.Writing is good.  Spoken dialog is refreshing with actors & actresses, taking their time to inflect accents, and emotions.  Lots of outcomes are determined from choosing various lines of dialog during the game's many conversations.  Cool side missions, that aren't always fetch quests, have multiple phases, and often involve several characters.Game is pretty progressive by virtue of having a female, bi-sexual lead character.  Also the game doesn't shy from the seediness of creating a convincing urban dystopia.  Music, is uniformly great.  Moody, dark, and atmospheric.  Perfect blend of organic and synthetic.  Dirty, gritty, lived-in sort of feel to it all.Upgrades to your character add a 'metroid-vania' aspect to the whole experience.  New abilities mean access to new areas.  The hacking mini-game wont win any awards, but compare to hacking games from AAA titles, and it is clearly more engaging, than the average.    Overall just a great experience that harkens back to old PC Adventure gaming, but with added benefits of tight combat and a dynamic movement system.			"

												I sponsored this game on kickstart, and finally wanted to play it. So far, I like what I've seen, but I've encountered too many bugs - sometimes I need to use my keyboard to attack, sometimes my mouse, it differs from place to place.Saving doesn't seem to do a thing - I always start back at the beginning.I'll play more once the bugs are fixed. Also, a good explanation of how you to use combat, and a decent intro to who you are playing as (ingame) should be added.			"

												THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ABOUT THE LINUX VERSION.This game is poorly optimized: without VSync the screen tearing is unbearable (up to a third of the screen width on a 1920x1200 monitor), and VSync is very performance-demanding (16-20 FPS on a GTX970 is unacceptable for a 2D game).The system specs are AMD 860K / 16 GiB RAM / GTX970 4GiB / 1920x1200@60 / Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.

												OMG I like this game,excellent gameplay,plays great with a Xbox One S controller.I purchased the game with the soundtrack because it's very nice.In short it's a wonderful game that plays & looks outstanding in 4K.However it's not kids friendly there's a lot of adult stuff,that for me it could have easily done without & it would've been a more fun for game for everyone.It has a simple system that works well without making things more hard then they need to be.Worth playing,I'm happy with game & even more happy with the beautiful soundtrack.

												This game is nice game which offers enjoyable gameplay, nice graphics and good soundtrack. But this game could be much more. Seems like developers run out of time or money at the end as the ending cutscenes are pretty short and only very last decisions forms the possible outcomes. The story is not bad in general though.This game suffers from low optimisation (I wouldnt expect laggs in games like this) and low replayability (because it doesnt matter what you do in 95% of the game).

												If you can tolerate some roughness in the UI/controls department and a few glitches here and there, this is a great cyberpunk RPG with a colorful world and a lot of ""choice and consequence"".First let's get the negatives out of the way. The game is rough around the edges and contains a few glitches and even a bug here and there.- There is a game breaking bug regarding saves after a certain point in the game- As of now you cannot rebind some keys- The interface is a bit obtuse. To use guns, drag them to the bottom inventory row, then draw them by pressing the assigned number.- The game saves checkpoints whenever you switch levels. The manual save function only copies the last checkpoint, it doesn't save the current game state. It's ok if you know about it, but the game doesn't explain this and you can thus lose progress.- The game actually contains two games. The overworld and the cyberworld. The cyberworld is a pretty mundane shooter/puzzler.With that out of the way let me explain why I recommend this game.- The writing is pretty good (for a computer game). The world is well thought out, there are some well-written characters, you can read emails and newspaper articles with interesting background information.- The quests contain a surprising amount of choice and consequence. You can miss a lot of quests or outcomes by playing unattentively.- The core game loop of traversing hazardous levels, fighting and hacking is fun- Character attributes are pretty rudimentary but about half of the upgrades unlock new skills or abilities (the other half are percentages/number upgrades)- Apart from upgrading by increasing your attributes, you can also purchase implants. Many implants are meaningful and open up new ways- The level design is well done. It's still a 2D game, but there are secrets that you only uncover by following clues and using the above-mentioned implantsAll in all, the game is simply fun. Once the bugs are patched, this will be a full recommendation. For now I recommend the game with reservations.			"

												Having only played it for an hour, here's my baseline review, before I refund it for various reasons which i'll dictate below.As a game with possibly some of the sleekest 2D art and top-notch voice acting (if not a little forced, at some parts though) and one of the coolest cyber-punk settings we've seen in awhile since deus ex, this game deserves praise. However, my praise pretty much extends solely to it's art style and music choice. If I were basing this game on looks alone it'd pretty much keep it because it really is one of the prettier looking games out there on steam. Since Dex is an action-based cyberpunk platforming/cypberspace 2D shoot'em'up stealth game, It has a lot of parts it has to think of ingenious ways of including. Let's just say for now that they succeeded in some, and failed in others. First let's talk about the actual platforming aspect of the game, which isn't too bad. Some of the animations are a little iffy though (I'm looking at you, crouch-walking. Seriously, who does that?) as well as some of the controls being a little far-fetched for both PC and Controller users in general. Every once and awhile some of the controls are a bit unresponsive (In the tutorial, I found that I was unable to punch back, despite clicking until I advanced to a certain point in the stage) so on, so forth. Next, let's talk about combat which is a central part of this game. As you progress, I'd imagine that your character get's more things, but for now let's just talk about what I unlocked in the first hour. A simple three-hit combo, the ability to dodge, and a jump-kick move that let's you get the drop on some enemies. Combat's pretty solid if we're talking meelee. Now ranged combat is a disaster, and let me tell you why. For some unexplicable reason your character stands still to shoot guns. This is literally their worst decision in the production of this game. In a game where characters with guns are shooting at you and it could cost you potentially half your health in one round, it's a bad game decision at all to make your character stand still. The animations seems a little clunky, and so is the aiming interface in general. Stealth was seldom used for the parts I played, so someone else might elaborate on that further. Voice-acting was top notch though. Tony was my favorite character in the hour I played. Seriously, if only every game put that much effort into making -every- interactable NPC in the world have an actual voice, it just draws you into the game. Characters are easily recognizable/memorable in even just the hour I played the game. Overall though, I can't really recommend it. The combat just felt too clunky, and it felt like the game didn't do that great of a job within a two-hour span of really getting that last tug on me that said ""Keep Me."" so to speak. For all of it's strengths, in far too many area's did it fall short.			"

Early Access Review
								Hi guys - Preview DEX\\\Dreadlocks tried to create something special and that is now in the increased demand, directly, as Manga in Steam. Here only because of VERY early access which is able to frighten off potential buyers, I wouldn't advise to pay to it attention at least a month more! I will explain why … First, to understand a plot, all its artful designs and it is simple not to blunder at a choice of some answer, for example, from you it is required language skills, thus at quite high level! There is a lot of text dialogues that on the one hand can't but please, always there is an option, let and imaginary (for us already all solved), they interesting also tighten, but with another … without even English postscoring it is boring! Really, boringly … Secondly, management! Because in Dex of tinctures is also not present, in general, will be to adjust it under itself to owners of ordinary keyboards incredibly difficult, especially to shoot. Clear business that before us nearly the first working alpha, hotfiksa and which updatings leave with velocity of light, but in a type of misinformation from outside whether the bought critics, whether someone else — people take it in hope to see SOMETHING, and receive … ahem, %5 of the read! For this reason I don't write reviews on games that are at a testing stage, it and is ridiculous and sad …The fighting system quite good, everyone will be able to find itself whether it be in the fighter of near fight, whether it be distant and if go to the technician's branch which to us is promised to enter that in general is excellent! Now even pumping as that isn't present, there are standard brace bits, but this business such — not clearly works it or not, for acquaintance it supposedly with what everything began and where came, but for passing … not its! Potential is, quests, non-standard and though hinting at the Sensuality, but … jumping off at the most inappropriate moment especially were pleasant. Wash to you council, for a start run all over the city, look that to what, collect all tasks, visit the dealer's bench but only after that go beyond his line, without speaking already for skirmishes with enemies! I as terribly curious person, made differently and time two was lost because on me some bandits flew from all directions, forcing down from feet and simply causing a fabulous loss, and after all coming back to management — it still that madness …Generally, game has a future but as truly noticed Dreadlocks — wait for the termination of September but only after that pronounce it a sentence! No training, meanwhile, will exist, we press Esc or F1 and we are brought up to date. Without the same Nostromo, for example, it is necessary to you oh as it is heavy, considering that gamepads also don't work … Already kind month and I can tell game one — advance is felt forward.The visual component in Dex is excellent, a portrayal on 5ku, optimization tightened, a soundtrack unless, still merges with a background because of what it isn't perceived properly. To be trained in all subtleties and to understand that want from us it is possible in the first hour of game! Though stop, to one seems to me, what main ""heroine"" resembles the man who replaced a floor more? For everything that time that I carried out in it at me NEVER there were feelings that I play for the girl, it is rather for some trance …If you love something unusual, with soul and created with love, but in a look there isn't enough budget and to that being in a stage of early access — buy all! Support developers dollar, eventually, you thereby will accelerate its end!<3 I hope you enjoy a preview, thanks.			"

Update: Just finished the game, and I'm not disappointed. Best cyberpunk game I've played in a long time. Well worth your time.Two tips: 1. Quick travel works and is available on the map in the back-button menu, and 2. Scroll all the way down in the inventory to put one of your your guns in the quick slots. Only then will Dex actually use it. I almost finished the game before I found that out. ;_;---The backgrounds and the character sprites really bring the cyberpunk world of Dex to life. For the art alone I'd say it's worth the price.I can't say too much about the Story. I've been too distracted doing side quests instead. It seems alright. The writing is good and really fits the cyberpunk mood of the game.The quests often have multiple solutions and it depends entirely on your character skills how to best go about solving them.The gameplay certainly isn't perfect (bugs, weak combat, weird inventory control). The lack of a quick travel option is a big time waster. The developer could have added an in game taxi service or some form of public transport. Another annoyance is the lack of explanation for how some systems work. I have for example not been able to use my gun at all. .Despite the flaws I have so far enjoyed playing Dex and would recommend to anyone looking for a cyberpunk themed light rpg.			"

								I don't know WHAT the other reviews are talking about. I expected so many obvious bugs I couldn't play. I expected the interface to be completely unintelligible. I got neither. *The Interface is easy. So easy, that if you have trouble you may be over thinking things.*I have yet to encounter one bug. Any bug. Not sure what that was all about, but it runs great for me. *The story is great! It hooks you early and keeps you interested. *The side quests are fun and the combat interface is reasonably simple. *The art is great and the levels and atmosphere are spot-on*The voice acting... meh. Not that great. Not that horrible either. It's far better than 'House of the Dead', but nowhere near as good as say.. The Curse of Monkey Island. *The wording of the script makes me think the author has English as a second language (it's not awful, but it's.... off)Summary: It's a better, more RPG like Flashback. I just like it! It's held my interest for the last 2 hours and I haven't died once or gotten to any illogical/frustrating sections. Final Rating: 8/10			"

												There are plenty of long reviews about the ""broken"" save system and the bugs. So I basically want to make this a short review where I do not focus overly much on those things - there are plenty of bugs, most, if not all, of the game breaking ones are gone by now. I bought the game when it left early access. It didn't take long to finish the game - I have 16 hours on record as I write this. At least 2 hours were spent trying to figure out why 2 quests wouldn't update. Turned out to be because of some bugs. The really great thing about this game is the atmosphere. The world is alive and buzzing with flavor. The voice acting really brings the game to a whole new level.Unfortunately that's the best thing about the game - as of yet. (at least for me)The combat is not fun. It feels more like a chore to get to the next point of interest.It's basically just button mashing. You can go in for the stealth kill, but most of the time it will just break the immersion as you'll, more often that not, see a clunky animation when doing so. You can buy (or find) guns, but personally I didn't care for them.Hacking is a mini-game of it own. I wouldn't say it's fun, but it's there. It's like a 'free roam' Alien Invaders game.I was expecting a lot from the implant system. But sadly it left me feeling hollow. By the time I unlocked the implant system (it's a quest), I had already completed a few side quests. Having some money I was basically able to buy every implant (save for 1 implant - you have a set number of implant slots) right away. It was very unsatisfying. There are a few interesting quests, and they're well written. That being said I didn't really like the quest system. Being a 'explore all' freak, I found that I was collecting things for quests I hadn't even started yet. There were times where I had completed every task of the quest right after receiving it. So all I had to do was talk to the quest giver 1 second later to finish the quest. I'm a fan of free roaming, but maybe the quest items could spawn after being given the quest. As apposed to being there before I even know about the quest.I like parts of the game, but I wouldn't go as far as to say I recommend it. And I find the price (even with 10% off) to be too high. If there was a ""50/50"" button I would hit it. I know some people will feel cheated buying this game.The game has potential - the game-world is there, and it's brimming with cyber punk quality. But the game is lacking in most other regards. It feels rushed with all the bugs. Hopefully they'll continue to develop patches, tweaks, and maybe even a few more quests.To conclude:I can't recommend this game, but I don't want to disencourage people either.If you like cyber punk games, and want to spend a few hours in a beautiful world, this might be a game for you. It has it's let downs, but it also has a lot of soul. I would rate it 5 out of 10.			"

												As much as I enjoyed some of the characters and the story of Dex, I can't recommend this game.The game is essentially a platformer with RPG elements and a hacking mini game.  There is both ranged and melee combat, but melee often felt the wiser choice.  Despite this, melee combat seemed more about memorizing enemy attack patterns than it did recognizing telegraphed attacks and blocking in time.  You can simply hold the block button and tap attack when you know it's safe to do so negating much of the challenge.  Ranged weapons are more useful for disabling security cameras and turrets than shooting people.  You can perform stealth takedowns, but the majority of levels do not have alternate routes for stealth approaches thanks in part to the 2d nature of the game.  This also obviates the need for a couple of the stealth oriented character upgrades.  Toward the end of the game, I had so many medkits accumulated I found myself dodging past enemies just to get things over with.The hacking mini game is absolutely tedious.  You guide a cursor around and shoot pew pew beams at viruses and network defenses.  You can acquire software in the form of upgraded attacks and one time use powers, but upgrading the hacking skill line is the only viable way to make this less painful.  Putting points in this skill is unavoidable in my opinion as hacking is necessary not only at major plot points but in many side quests as well.Most of the characters are interesting and most of the dialogue is well written and voiced.  The story was interesting enough to keep me invested in events and characters, and the endings are reminiscent of Deus Ex.  There are a variety of side quests that you can pursue at your own pace and you have free reign over the city.  The game world is small by big budget standards but it's just right for the length of this game.  I finished the game in under 9 hours having completed most of the side quests.I don't feel there is any need to replay this game unless you are an achievement hunter.  While there are choices and dialogue options you can make which affect the outcome of various side quests and the main story, there isn't enough viable variation in character building or game difficulty to make me come back for more.  I would only recommend this game if you are a cyberpunk or RPG junky.  Even if you are, there are arguably better games to spend your precious time with.			"

												I find the combat unplayably tedious. You just stand there blocking for an age. Then the enemy hits you. Then you hit them. Then you go back to blocking. Wash, rinse, repeat for an eternity.No fun, no joy, no excitement. Just mechanically grinding through boring, copy paste, enemies. It's sad that I'm missing all the story and all the depth of the world, in to which it's obvious a lot of work has gone, just because the core mechanics are muddy and dull. The first rule of game design is that your core gameplay loop has to be good. Would you want to fight an endlessly long string of enemies? If not the combat needs work.			"

												I found myself really wanting to like this game. I love cyberpunk. The graphics are good, the atmosphere is nice and the music is fitting.Beyond that... no. The combat system is too clunky, the controls are abysmal and the game is just too hard, even on the easy setting. To make matters worse, some tactics are explained once, but are not found in any log. Forgot how to do a stealth takedown? Sucks to be you, for it's not found anywhere anymore.The difficulty also affects the hacking. The game does very little to make you find your way in cyberspace in a way that it actually counts. Once you've passed the introductory couple of hours, the diffculty spikes like nothing else. Even hacking a vending machine is an exercise in futility.Cyberspace also gets preciously little explanation. How do I use an item in cyberspace? Do I weather all these red bugs, or do I need to find their source? It took me four hours of playing before I discovered that my right mouse button even had a function.To nail the coffin shut, the voice acting is mediocre at best and frakking annoying at worst. I found myself reading the subtitles because these people talk so incredibly slow.I don't mind having paid some money for this, but can I please have my five hours back?			"

												I have a weakness for all things cyberpunk, but this game suprised me. The world is rather open, with side quests and loot to find. The combat worked well, I didn't find the guns very useful and after getting some cyberupgrades melee seemd to be the way to go. The game took me about 10 hours to complete but I was quite thorough in exploring, the game would probably be a lot shorter if you rushed through the main story.I have reccomended this game to my friends.

												Enjoyed it very much. The story was pretty run of the mill, though. Ending happened fairly abruptly and there are still some things that aren't entirely clear; but maybe I'm just dense. Least favorite parts of the game were the hacking minigames, though. Top-down shooter styled. Required a lot of skillpoints to make it less frustrating, user skill would only go so far. Using firearms was also somewhat disappointing, but I think they were mostly intended as a situational backup item for when you're up against a tough opponent or a group that's hard to deal with by hand.I certainly recommend it at even full price, despite my minor complaints.

												This game has a pretty interesting story and decent voice acting.  The combat and hacking mechanic are nearly impossible until you have upgraded your abilities, however, you are not able to upgrade your abilities until you have completed the combat and hacking mechanics.  Early in the game, the hacking is beyond frustrating to the point that the game is not even fun.  It seems that the game balance wasn't tested much.  I want to recommend this game, but unfortunately I can't due to poor combat/hacking design.			"

												I'm on my second play-through. My first ended after a couple of hours in sheer frustration and I didn't pick it back up again until some months later. To me, this is a very alluring game as I love the cyberpunk theme and I can't think of a game that's set the atmosphere better than this one. As an interactive story, it works. As a game? Not so much.Before I present my negatives I would like to be clear that I've really enjoyed Dex. It'll go down as one of my favorites of all time but I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone but the most hardcore of cyberpunk fans.Here are the biggest challenges you'll face while playing:1. Hand holding - This game doesn't do it, at all, so don't expect a helpful lesson in anything. Ever. Explanation of basic mechanics would have been nice. I avoided hacking until the last couple of hours of playtime. I was never sure if what I was doing was correct or if I was just wasting my time.2. Hacking - Sucks until you're uber powerful.3. Combat - Nothing wrong with a bit of difficulty but the AI will consistently block your punches, kicks and no amount of button pressing or combos will break their block mechanic. Your best bet is to exit the area and return. Repeat that step until you ""roll"" an enemy that isn't perpetually in block mode.4. Stealth - Yeah, whatever. Good luck being stealthy. There's no skill slots or upgrades for this, so it is what it is and that isn't much. It should be striped from the game as it doesn't serve a purpose.5. Bugs - Almost a year out and the game still has some mind boggling big bugs. I have not encountered any game breaking bugs but I've run into one that just completely ruins what little immersion a 2D platformer can have. The best way to describe it without giving too much detail is that you're playing as someone else on screen... you hear their voice, see their headshot in the dialog box but you're still running around as Dex.I don't expect to see much change in the game at this point. I do hope they go on to make another as I would be the ""first in line"" to get it if it were in the same universe.			"

												You WILL ragequit this game.  Multiple times.Enemies hit hard, and health packs are expensive.  Worse, you have TWO health bars to worry about (HP and focus, which is basically HP while hacking).  At the beginning there are a number of quests that require skills you won't have... but you can't get because you can't complete the quests.  Maxing out hacking and lockpicking are NOT optional.The game really, really needs a proper quicksave button.  The standard F5 throws you into the save menu, which is better than nothing, but when you leave you're in the ""Game paused"" menu.  I'd rather something you can just mash and keep playing, because you'll be bruteforcing a lot of stuff.Hacking is far too hard at the beginning (thus why you need to max your hacking skill ASAP).Gamepad input is terrible, but that's apparently a limitation of the Unity engine.  I tried to use my Steam Controller... it was awful.  The gamepad config utility is also awful... it's not able to determine the direction of the right ""stick"" on the SC.  It'll also hang if you try to quit.  Don't even bother... just stick with the mouse and keyboard.There's a fantastic story in this game.  I really want to experience it.  So, I'm hunting for cheats so that I don't need to put up with the gameplay.			"

												While buggy at it's release most of it has been ironed out so I can finally recommend this game.It's a good mix of combat, stealth and roleplaying.The combat is solid but nothing special. Left-click attacks, there is a roll dodge and a block for melee attacks. Quests offer choices and are often multi-layered which is a welcome variation to most standard RPG quests. Sidequests usually outrank the main story in quality and variety but it keeps you interested enough throughout the game.There is a good progression system for your character allowing you to spent skillpoints in 10 or so categories.The environment and music are very atmospheric and do a good job at immersing you into the world. Backgrounds are alright but look better on the screenshots. Animation is a bit clunky.Controls are responsive and I never had a problem like getting stuck or delays of input.There is little replay value so expect 10-15 hours of entertainment.			"

												This actually feels more like a good, old-school, story-driven action RPG than a platformer. The story is not trivial and interesting enough to want you keep playing. A large part of the story is a set of side-quests which you can do in any order (or skip altogether but that will make your game harder as you character needs to develop for main story challenges). I really liked the cyber punk setting for the game, a bit like shadowrun but unique and interesting.Dex is a good game, but it could be better. The combat system feels awkward at the beginning and needs some getting used to. ""Hacking"" is bit tedious and feels repetitive. While the story is quite nice, even surprising at times, the ending is very anti-climatic to the level of being somewhat disappointing.Overall I'd recommend this game, especially if you can pick it up on offer.

												Great story, poor gameplay. Enemies are pretty stupid, platforming can be frustrating when you can't tell what is a platform and what isn't. Depending on how you count, there's 2 or 4 enemy types, and they can generally all be dealt with the same way. Hacking is a chore, with nearly every hack going the same way. But, the story's great, exploration is pretty fun, lore is engaging, and the voice acting's good too.For $5, great choice. $20 is way too much, though, since you'll see most of the game in nine hours or so.

								I absolutely love the look of the game, but the mechanics essentially aren't there. Combat in particular is a complete mess; if there's only one enemy, you can just crouch and punch them in the shins with no danger to yourself, and if there's more than one enemy you're mostly screwed. Definitely has potential, but I can't recommend it until the gameplay undergoes some vast development.			"

												some kind of love-hatethe game is something you could discribe as suman's quest meets deus ex, wich really sounds excellent. it has a wonderful old school artstile with wonderful paintings wich urge the story at the important points, the voice acting is also a highlight. combat system is also very cool and oldschool, with some flaws, but still good. what really annoys me thow are some other bad choices in control and in the overall gmeplay, wich isn't too well balanced yet. the first flaw is that jumping can be delayed, wich more than once end in the death of the character, then, despite of having stealth parts, there is no proper way of eliminating foes with sneeking up to them. especially when there are more than one enemy and worst if both have fire weapons it quickly becomes frustrating. there are more minor faults like taht in the game... but it would still be enjoyable.but now to the real frustrating part: the most stupid savingsystem i've ever seen in a videogame. not only that there's no way of saaving your game by yourself, but only to autosave by changing the location, BUT there is only one gamefile possible and from the other you only can go back to the parts, where you got milestones in the mainstory... not so bad? oh yes, because if you press new game by accident, all achievements that you made since the last milestone are GONE, because the autosave will be overwritten immediately!!!! PLEASE; DEAR DEVELOPERS: FIX THAT BECAUSE IT IS HIGHLY FRUSTRATING!!!!! i really enjoy the story, the nice atmosphere and the cool characters, thow there are some annoying gameplay-mistakes, but i would still give a positive review if that♥♥♥♥♥♥of a saving-system would be fixed, but at this moment, i just can't recommend this game!

												Negative first, positive second.Do not play this game. The game is fairly decent in most respects except for two very key features. The game uses checkpoint saves, which is fine in some cases, when there are actually checkpoints. The game saves at the start of every area you enter and ONLY at the start. Meaning if you die at any point in a map, you HAVE to start again. Once is fine, but if you die multiple times because you simply missed a jump and landed in the wrong place or an enemy sees you the moment you walk through a door and blasts half your health away with a gun at range... it becomes very tedious very very fast.Death and saves brings me to the second reason not to play this game. This reason is only a factor because of the save system, however, yo take fall damage, and quite a decent amount. This is fine. What is not fine, is the fact that the game marks no difference between platforms you can land on and ones you simply pass through. Meaning death. Restart.On a positive note. The art is nice, the voice acting is quite decent, the control mechanics are not perfectly fluid, but are still enjoyable, and the rpg side of things seems fairly well balanced with some small room for replay. The plot is interesting enough to pull you through, and the side quests are quite well done, with multiple different quests intersecting each other, which i found to be a nice touch!75% off this game is fun, but i just cannot recommend anyway buy it until the save system is changed. It will just aggrevate you.			"

												I cannot recommend it until you guys figure out how to create a sensible control mechanism. Seriously, you guys created the most confusing control scheme for gamepad users. You dont give any tutorial to explain how to do simple things like changing weapons, and I have become absolutely irate because I cannot permanently switch weapons during the middle of a firefight. Even when I follow the control scheme, the gun always reverts back to one that I do not need. It was like you designed the system DELIBERATELY to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. Please rethink how to handle the controls, put in some explanation for how things work, etc.  Then I will give the game a good review.			"

												Garbage playability wrapping nice artwork.I really wanted to like this game - but the gameplay is just terrible.  Action sequences involve the following:1) Physical fighting2) Augmented Reality Camera/Drone hacking3) VR hacking2+3 are effectiely identical in how the play out - you control a floating blob that shoots and tries to dodge the 100 or so enemies / homing missiles.  Your base health is high and you can recharge for free once out of AR/VR, making these sequences more chore than anything.1 is... a huge mess.  A) You can sneak up on enemies and drop them with a rear naked choke, which would add a neat stealth element if not for the fact that it's a 2D game and enemies regularly have to be engaged face to face.B) You start with only a 1-2 punch combo and jump kick.  Every enemy in the game can and will block either one, unless you block and then counterpunch.. and you'd better be better than Floyd Mayweather for reasons below.C) When struck by enemy melee attacks, you suffer hitstun.  Enemies are NOT stunned by your attacks.  So combat becomes a slow process.D) Magnum revolver shots to the heart barely damage entry level enemies more than your starting 1-2 punch.  Individual rounds cost $20 per bullet, most enemies drop less than $20.  This makes gun combat effectively impossible as a strategy.E) Your health doesn't regenerate, and enemies don't respawn, creating a negative feedback loop if your skill in melee is low.  More fights = more damage that you must pay to fix = fewer $ left for everything else.F) Saving the game manually - rather than autosaving - can break the scripts on the main quest line, rendering the game impossible to complete.G) You can hack vending machines to get cash, but they never reset, so once hacked, they're turned off for the rest of the game.H) Many of the sidequests are bugged and it's easy to make them impossible to complete if you do ANYTHING out of sequence, such as exploring a location before getting the quest.

												Attack keys keep unbinding and randomly not-working loadfunction rather tends to load autosave almost always despite having a saved point. This game is severely buggy, don't play unless you got a handcontroller, seriously wait for some more patches before you spend money on it! If you play take lockpick as your first 2 picks before going into any combat...			"

												Sluggish, confusing, and boring, this game starts off on the wrong foot right away with an options menu that doesn't even work properly and just gets worse with mindless combat, leap of faith platforming, and a complete lack of direction or clear goals.  And that's just the rooftop sequence at the start!  I couldn't make it past the sewer level (yes really, this game all but starts with a sewer level) because the game kept fighting me the whole way.  There's just nothing HERE.			"

												Very disappointed. The game looks nice and tries to do a lot with the gameplay. Unfortunately, the controls are quite stiff and the combat is awful. There's no real strategy half the time and the enemies take ridiculous amounts of punishment. I'm all for a bit of challenge but fighting in this game is just dull. Also, the first level is a sewer, enough said.			"

												Pros:- Cool Concept and atmosphere- Great Story- Nice Still Graphics- Open worldCons: - Jagged animations- No visual indication of things you can climb down or doors you can walk into vs things you can't- No visual indication of many hazards until you die (maybe missing sprite bug)- Many Game-breaking bugs on Linux make it painfully unplayable:  - Iinvisible text that yout have to guess where it is to click on it  - Invisible enemies, hazards or other sprites  - Saves get corrupted frequently  - Saves don't actually save everything  - Saves just don't work at all sometimes			"

												I quite enjoyed the early sections of the game, and found myself actually chortling with glee as I unlocked some of the cybernetic upgrades for melee combat.  From what happens late game during a segment in which you are forced to rely upon the profoundly broken ranged-combat mechanics, i am forced to conclude that i was only able to enjoy the preceding rest of the game specifically because i ignored the firearms entirely.  Couple this with that the ending to Dex left me disappointed to an extent that even triumphs the sense of being betrayed by the writers that was created in Mass Effect 3, and while I was exceptionally eager for a new cyberpunk RPG to sink my teeth into when I first saw this game, I cannot recommend it as it stands. It is fundamentally broken, and i find myself severely regretting having purchased it.			"

												Overall I'm torn between whether or not I like it. For all of the good things about the game, I find things that are equally frustrating or unpolished. I understand a lot of people enjoy the game and that's great, I'm glad they do, but I guess as a developer myself, I'm a little more critical. Story - So, the premise of the story is ok. Assuredly not bad but nothing I haven't seen before. The character archtypes are standard cut-and-paste, and I can't say I really felt invested in any of them. It became very clear early on that Dex is supposed to be a Jesus type character, the 'Seed of Whatsis' which is an Omniscient superbeing.But my main issue with the story is the fact that it's not until about halfway in that you even get a notion of what the game's about. I had to force myself through to get to the point where (Character) starts going on about Dex being a 'Plot Element Here.' The sidequests honestly interested me a bit more, and I have to give the devs kudos on how they managed to tie so many stories together. For instance you have characters like Mr. (Guy) who shows up in three separate side-quests and slowly you get this picture of what this character was like before -beep-.I do have to say, however, that for an 'Action Platformer' there is a lot of reading. Personally I don't mind reading, but I'd imagine a lot of players skip over the many messages, memos, and emails and miss a lot of those portions of the story. Some of these could have easily been audio-clips.For those of you who do choose to buy this, please let me tell you now. DO NOT choose the 'Singularity' ending. No, it's not because it's 'bad,' I literally say this because if you choose Singularity, there IS no ending. If you feel you have to, just watch the Singularity ending on Youtube, the clip is about 5 seconds.Mechanics - This is the area I had the most issue with. There were so many elements of the mechanics that felt unpolished or wonky. The AR, world hacking, was so frustrating that I prettymuch never used it. The guns were almost equally frustrating, to the point that I used them to shoot turrets if I had to, and then went on to punch enemies in the face. But see, there's a problem there too, because if you're overlapping the enemy at all you can't hit them. Dex has no ability to follow the mouse, so having to physically turn Dex around can break combos and means that the other 5 enemies right there have the perfect shot to beat you down. Overall the combat system felt really finicky.But that wasn't even the worst of the mechanics issues because what aggravated me the absolute most was the fact that you don't get to choose when to save. This wouldn't be an issue, you see, if the game chose to save after important events or conversations. But the game only saves when you zone into an area, so if you spend a lot of time in that area, say, hacking GSV-2's 4 computers only to get killed, you get to do it ALL over again. This would be fine if it were a once-in-a-while thing, but I found myself turning the game off more than once because I just couldn't be bothered to redo a whole area because I'm not allowed to save.Art & Animation - So, I have no complaints about the art. It was pretty good, I have to say. The cutscenes were pretty decent as well. The animations were mostly good, but I did spot some issues here and there. The biggest issue with the animations I saw was when you were having a conversation with someone. There was little effort put into lip-sync and half the time the characters would just freeze halfway through their lip-sync while the audio kept going.Sound & Music - The music was pretty good. Very nice soundtrack, not too distracting and added to the setting of the scenes quite nicely. Sounds became an issue when Dex's little squeaking-moan every time she jumps got on my nerves. I also noticed a major issue in the Docks where the sound of the water lapping was always loud and persisted even when I had ALL game sounds muted from within the game (I had to go into my computer's sound mixer to physically mute the game itself).The 'Hacking' Minigame - An interesting take on hacking I have to say... But like some of the elements of the game it felt a bit unpolished. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't quite feel right at the same time.			"

												Has promise to be an interesting 2D metroidvania with rpg elements within a standard cyberpunk setting, but it also has a lot of game killing bugs. Enough to make me not deal with it and move on until they patch some of the most basic gameplay. -Combat-Melee combat is not fluid and I found that many of my attacks fell short of connecting, even after hitting on the first punch. I'd have to stop my combo to inch forward and hope that my next punch would be within the pitifully small attack range. I defaulted to just jump kicking everyone and rolling away, rather than playing with the block and combo system they have in place. Ranged combat is not intuitive as you have to press (not hold down) the left trigger button to hold your firearm and then aim with a reticule that is made for a mouse, but not translated for a gamepad. Then, you have to press your right shoulder button, and not your right trigger button, in order to fire your weapon (The design choice to keep all the buttons non-contextual hampers the entire game)  You cannot move while having your firearm drawn. I also felt figuring out how to place firearms in your quick item menu in order to even use it was... unnecessary.-Voice acting-The voice acting ranges from serviceable to strained and then falls into annoying. The voices are not what I'm imagining the text to read as in my imagination in the slightest in many cases and the game would have done better saving everyone the trouble of having to turn them off after a few hours of what sounds to be non-English native speaking their lines. I may be wrong about the voice actor's native tongue as many of them seemed to have Western names in the credits (do voice actors need stage names?). There seems to be a great deal of variance between what is spoken and what is written in the text as well. Not enough to change their meaning, but enough to jar me as I read and listened along.-Level Design-I found myself wandering around and killing mofos before I actually needed to enter those areas. Because I could and I wanted to and they happened to be there. This more or less deconstructed the pace of the game for me. I'm sure some may counter argue that I wasn't playing with immersion in mind, but ♥♥♥♥ that. This is a cyberpunk game and that means breaking the rules and doing what you want and ♥♥♥♥ the system! Besides, I used the walk button... which is the block button... and doesn't really offer any context to when it's a walk or when it's block (so maybe I was wrong about the lack of contextual buttons... Well none of them seemed to work which brings me to...)-This is an unfinished game-The bugs are more than a few janky controls or odd holes in the level, they break the game.I can't switch between quick items that are in my quick item menu.I can't save my game, unless I transitioned between areas. I'm taking a break from Dark Souls to play this as a casual game while I clean the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of my pants. I don't need to redo the same bullet hell minigame hacking simulation and jump kick my enemies to death because I walked into a room with poison gas and was already low on health.The enemy AI is nonexistent. They can't jump. They can't climb ladders. The enemies with ranged weapons can only shoot you. They seem to be forced to keep moving away from me whilst I jump kick them to death. Low sweep was unlocked for me at times, which is supposed to be a melee move you unlock through leveling up. The worst for me was how they'd simply forget you killing the dude that was right next to them if you moved a little ways out of their line of sight... ""Huh? Just a box...""(Why the ♥♥♥♥ am I looting porno mags and t-shirts from my dead enemies? I know of only one group of people that would pay money for used porno mags and t-shirts from dead people... 12 year old boys.)To end this, I can tell the designers have a lot of love for the genre (no, kids. Deus Ex isn't what it's based on...), but this is not a full release game as stated int he product description. Other reviewers suggest a few more updates before jumping into this game. That's good advice. "

												The idea is cool, but after playing for a few hours there are some definite frustrations I have with this game. One is the graphics: the environments look good but the character sprites don't quite seem to mesh with them. The physics to with the characters are also a bit sloppy, making for movement and actions that seem out of place. The animation never seems to quite match up with the action, either.Dex was worth trying, but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I would not recommend this game in its current state. After having died several times during the introduction and subsequent areas due to severe lack of information (The area with poison gas looks the same as the area without?), and effectively having to start over after entering a dead-end that I cannot backtrack through without dying (this is within the first 20 minutes of the gameplay as well) I can say that this game doesn't hold your hand - it thrusts you blindfolded and drugged into a room filled with unavoidable bodily harm.I will say that the graphics and music are great but the animations are a little lacking.

												Dissapointing. I expected good RPG with some oldschool graphics, but... This is rather an adventure game. It is not possible to play a role here, you can just follow stupid and straightforward plot made of dozens steam-punk cliches and do some other quest 'helping' people. You do not have any actual choice, It is just or you help someone even though you do not want to (playing this character) or you just loose some XP. These are the only choices you have. To find a person or not to find, to fetch a first aid kit or not. To hack computers you have to play a stupid mini-game, which I hate. I want to play a RPG, not some 8-bit top-down shooter with annoying sounds. And no way it is 'an open world'. Do not make me laugh. There are just a couple of NPCs (1-2 on each level) with exclamation mark above them. You cannot to talk to other people or do anything else. Levels are really small, just few screens wide. I regret that I did not ask for a refund earlier.			"

												For what seemed like such a promising title, when I played Dex it had a distinct feel of a game that wasn't quite finished. That feel that lets the player know that if a little more work was done, then this game would be something great. Melee combat is a bit of a mess because enemies don't stagger so most of a fight is spent chasing after them. Melee upgrades are mostly combo extenders, but those don't help you because you'll busy chasing after someone who just shrugged off being punched in the head. The dodge roll dodges all melee attacks that I found, and you start the game with it. Cybernetic upgrades are also a bit underwhelming when I saw giant dudes full robot arms punching way harder than I was.Quests feel buggy and unfinished. There have been points in the game where I found information on a person while just innocently rooting through their apartment, as cyberpunks are known to do. This is information that I did not need yet, and when I talked to a reporter, they told me the trail had gone cold. I went back to check the info again, and talked to the reporter again, and I still couldn't continue with the quest. When this happened it made me afraid to go off the beaten path, that by finding things out of order I could lose more content.A boss I found was easily the most frustrating experience of the game. Having set myself up for punchy fights, I was told to go punch up some military dudes and their crazy military commander. I ran in to punch them and took a shotgun blast to the teeth. This was no big deal, I wanted to be punchy and the game shouldn't change to fit that. What was a problem was the boss, or rather, the goons that the boss summoned. This goons come from nowhere. I made sure to kill all goons on the way to the bossman, and before fighting him there is a large drop. These goons just walk in from the edge of the screen and start blasting. I couldn't punch out the goons without being shot to death, and if I punched out the boss then the goons would keep shooting while I stood still to talk to him.A minor grip I had was that no matter where I had the camera, Dex always looked blocky. Fully zoomed in I could count the pixels on Dex's face, fully zoomed out I could count the pixels on Dex's head, even on the default setting for the camera, I could still count the pixels on Dex's face.All of this put together means I cannot recommend it, which saddens me. The cyberpunk sounded really nice, the story sounded really nice, the characters sounded really cool, but the execution was lacking.			"

												I know I haven't given this game much chance but the introduction to it was far from friendly or appealing and gives me the distinct impression that I won't like the rest of it, despite the style seeming great.After dropping into the sewers you're immediately thrown into an unbalanced fight with no way out. The enemies with the unblockable kicks that just chain knock you down were tedious and on my first try drained my health enough that the woman with the unblockable whippy chain insta killed me. Next time I just tried to run and noticed a health kit hidden up top of a ladder but couldn't get to it because I got stun locked in a corner. The third time I was sensible enough to kill the two guys, sprint to the ladder and get the health only to find enemies are totally incapable of following you up ladders.So I could just drop down behind the chain woman and mash the attack key whilst taking the damage. I thought I'd get to loot the chain and that would make things easier but no. Then, after drinking six litres of soda and beer to get my health just about back up to half I got yet more of the tedious kickers to fight. I killed them easy enough, went up a ladder and immediately got cut in half by an UZI.I looked through the controls to see if I could use the drone thing to kill him or something and found the roll key and managed to roll past him and spam him to death too sure there would be a nice shiny UZI in it for me to make fighting the rest of the thugs less boring and health consuming. No, I got a roll of toilet paper and a used porn mag for my troubles.The next room I walked into I saw a climb button, hit E and promptly fell into a bottomless pit which there was no conceivable reason for even being an option. So that was five deaths in the space of twenty minutes. The next ten were spent trapped in a small room because I had made the mistake of walking up a staircase and couldn't find a means to walk back down. As it turns out the solution was to stand up against the wall and hold space and the down key which resulted in my character glitching out totally but eventually crawling down the stairs like a doped up sloth... until I released space and they just jumped back into the room... assumedly to look for more toilet paper and soda.I know this might be being too harsh but if the first half hour was this filled with tedium then I can't really be bothered to stick around for the rest of it. The game started on a beautiful image and intriguing premise and then immediately went to generically punching people in a sewer filled with bottomless pits. That also seems like an apt metaphor for my brief experience with it.			"

												I expected 2D Deus Ex and that's mostly what I got. But I did not expect it to be this hard. The game gave me a big ♥♥♥♥ you when I realized that I could not progress the story because I chose the wrong skills to upgrade and could not do the AR hacking mini-game because the difficulty is too damn high!!! I tried to do follow some walkthrough in order to level up and put some skills in AR, but they all told me to use skills that were not upgraded. Most other guides told me ""you ♥♥♥♥ed up, restart""No thank you.			"

												The game has potential but the supposed 'developers' who built this should go and clean toilets as a living, instead of pretending that they can code.Saves do not work - it's a ground breaking feature so it must be difficult to implement, right?I have at least 5 quests that cannot be completed.Interaction with NPCs stops working and you cannot complete quests from them.Interface is bad and combat is even worse.Tutorial is non-existent and you have to check the forum to find out how to do basic things, e.g. use weapons!Shops do not renew their stock so you run out of bullets.Shooting guns is a joke.You run out of money towards the end, especially since you cannot complete quests.Just before the end the game locks you into a 'test' where you lose your inventory items and you are given just a useless EMP gun. You are then supposed to go through many enemies and turrets and survive...Bugs, bugs, bugs and more bugs....I wish I could take my money back but the best I can do is to never buy anything again from Dreadlocks Ltd. I advice you to avoid them like hell and give your money to developers that know what they are doing.			"

												It was... alright, I guess.Uhm. That's really all I have to say-- it was barely enjoyable to the point that I was willing to play it only because there was jackshit else to do. But it certainly wasn't 'fun' enough to warrant it really only having two hours of gameplay, minus the few I have from leaving the game open.Absolutely riddled with bugs, a lot of gameplay mechanics simply poorly designed, the story and characters really not all too interesting. Plot was meh, attempt at a plot twist was meh, final boss was meh. Gameplay is mostly just you clicking rapidly and hoping that the dude falls over before you do.All in all, meh. If you're on the verge of death by boredom, go ahead. Otherwise-- you can find better. Really. "

												Too unpolished for my tastes... It looked very promising (even if the animations are a bit clunky), and the world building is great (I'm a sucker for cyberpunk), but it really doesn't hold up in terms of gameplay compared to other great offerings on Steam...My main complaint is that the combat is very clunky... Defend, defend, wait opening, hit, defend, defend... It feels like turn based combat without the depth...Hopefully, a remaster of this title will appear one of these days with better gameplay... I'd like to see the story as a whole...			"

												Do you like really fun short games with terrible endings? Do you like gaining lots of power ups and then being denied their use right at the end of the game? Do you like annoying NPCs with terrible voice acting? If you answered ""yesh"" to any or all of these questions, then this game is for you.Pros: fun powerups, interesting storyline (when it doesn't drone on), and a great futuristic dystopian atmosphere.Cons: you can't level up each skill all the way, you don't have any notion of which skills will be useful until the end, and the game play actually gets progressively worse! Nerfing my character at the end is the biggest ""NO-NO"" of all time. The most frustrating and annoying ending ever. *spoiler alert* trying to do anything other than running through is a waste of time, then doing anything other than taking cheap long distance shots is a waste of time.The platformer action RPG part of the game is far and away the best. It's VERY fun and just challenging enough. The 2d scrolling shooter aspect of the game is TERRIBLE and so god danm boring! Yet it remains one of the most critical areas tht you should power up.*more spoilers*Don't bother powering up your endurance/melee the whole way, you wont get the chance to use that many implants. Don't bother doing anything with the charisma/conversation option aspect, it's just boring dialog. AR hacking? pointless. Get lockpicking (essential) and hacking skills (yes I know I said I hate that part, that's why you ♥♥♥♥ing need it!) Shooting skills? Pointless, bullets do little damage and take forever to reload. The shotgun has a magazine of 2 and can't one shot anything??GOD there are so many things wrong with this game it is so frustrating!! I am still confused why I found it fun when it just seems like from a game design standpoint, there are so many things wrong. Finally at the very end you see two little data nodes to hack, pick the left one and it's game over (as in win). What's at the top one? I don't know. I couldn't pick it because the game was OVER! OVERALL: A fun game that makes you hate yourself for enjoying and wasting time playing it.Someone shoot me. Oh, out of bullets, I'll wait as you stand perfectly still for a few seconds trying to reload your stupid gun that does insignificant damage.			"

												To put it bluntly, this game disappointed me.What I thought I was buying:A story-driven beat-em-up rpg set in a beautifully presented post-apocalyptic cyberpunk future.What I actually bought:A story-less, role-less beat-em-up set in a blandly presented post-apocalyptic cyberpunk future.In this game, you are this cyborg woman with blue hair.This is the sum of all the knowledge you learn about your character within the first 40 minutes of playing the game. There is no intro or tutorial. You don't have a personality, or any sense of self watsoever...But worst of all, you have no goal. None.Don't get me wrong, there are quests. But there is absolutely no reason that you would take these quests, because your character has no emotion, no voice, and no motive at all. And so neither should you.I spent solid years of my life entertaining my self with free flash games on web, but after 40 minutes of this game, I was disgusted with myself for spending money on it.Spare yourself the disappointment.3/10 "

												Well made cyber punk story. Begining is too harsh and if the game was longer it would have started to be a bit monotonic.  Has that oldschool feeling in it. Cut scenes are nicely done and really add up to the overall atmosphere.I would have hoped that the spiret would have had more detail, no matter that this was the enchanged version.Found couple of clitches in the Linux version *spoiler here* The first biomechanical addon scene acted weridly, takedown animation goes haywire if youäre not in the right position. -> enemy is couple of weets away and you're strangling air (hilarious), third clitch was in... some where in the cut scenes can't really remember anymore.Overall solid 8/10 -> if I must I have to weight it to the no section in the recommended part. :/ *hars*			"

												If the graphics were lower fidelity or the animation was better, I might have enjoyed this... as it was, the graphics are too polished to overlook the bad animation quality, so I couldn't play this like a retro game or like a current... if you dropped the gameplay and story into a more fluid sidescroller like Deadlight, Inside, Limbo, or even back to the original Prince of Persia, I may have really enjoyed  (this game.As it was, I get a little over an hour in before I just decided I wasn't having fun, and was working REALLY hard to try to like it, but it just didn't grab me.If you can get past the poor animation and general game feel, the other reviews seem to imply there's a good game hiding underneath, but I can't say whether that is true or not.  Had I gotten this directly from Steam, I likely would have refunded (which I've never done yet)... there are certainly worse games, though.			"

Un systeme de croissance qui laisse une grande libertee de choix, entre les skills et les augmentations.Un grand nombre de missions qui laisse une certaine latitude de choix dans leur execution/resulat (aider l'extraction de l'employe ou le livrer a son ancienne corpo, voire l abandonner completement...)+ un DLC offert donnant 3 nouveaux equipement qui modifient de maniere agreable le hero.Deux reproches :- L'animation du personnage principal est un peu decevante (surtout la position acroupie)- La fin est un peu courte.Mais au final j'ai beaucoup apprecie ce jeu et je le recommande chaudement aux fans de cyberpunk.

												Dex, a snazzy cyberpunk platformer with a  stellar soundtrack, doesn't take long too complete at all even with all achievements (a couple days), however don't let that be a deterrence; it's refreshing playing a short, sweet title like this.Dex is an old school platformers delight, with Metroidvania-ish gameplay and level layout but with some modern implementations (thankfully)  and a few original ideas. The overall aesthetic and presentation are both up to date, and abilities like all-the-time fast travel prevent a sense of staleness and repeating trudge of back-tracking areas.Needless to say, issues do crop up, and several are notable. Enemies don't respawn, so they are always tough to kill. Many fights require the right approach, or else you'll get you life chopped. The control layout doesn't help either, and you'll frantically press the wrong buttons and doing something silly like jack into cyberspace in the middle of a gun fight. When there are multiple enemies with multiple attacks on screen at once and they know you're there, forget it.Reload the room, and start over. Basically, combat feels out of hand alot of the time, and it's advice to stealth kill you way through the game for the easiest approach.Another things is Dex's strange narrative/gamelay combo... Most of the game is made up of sidequests, not necessarily relating to the arch plot encompassing Dex, Raycast, Decker, and the The Complex. As a result, the missions are interesting, but you don't get as emotionally invested in Dex and her plight as could have been. Its only the game's final missions and locations that really build to deep suspense, uncertainty, intrigue and then just plain out ""What the hell will happen next?!"" kind of moments that leave you floored.Finally, I'm yet to play a videogame where I actually look forward to fun cyberspace sections... Dex tries a fair game with a shooter simulation, but that double shot upgrade ought to be default imo. If you're just starting playing, some advice: upgrade hacking to 6 ASAP.Overall, I recommend Dex to old school platformer/Metroidvania junkies (or people who just like action platformers), and  of course for people who need a regular cyberpunk fix. I'm interested to see what other titles the developers have/will publish in the near future.Nice one Dreadlocks.			"

Highly Recomended TitleA great cyberpunk RPG with plataformer mechanics and beat them up combat. Dex is bound to be liked by oldschool players, as well as cyberpunk fans. The story has everything, evil corporations, secret groups, underground hackers fighting for the good cause, cyber augmentations and three different endings.PRO Great story. Good character design and great voice acting. Old school action, fighting kinda feels like Streets of Rage. Beautiful graphics. Free DLC with 3 new suits and mini quests to find each suit and the machine that bulds them.CONS The hacking minigame is not really exciting and gets boring quickly. As it's a central part of the plot, you end up doing it all the time. Game is short. Gun play is not very exciting. "

												Dex is a 2D sidescrolling action RPG, with a major focus on the RPG part. The game takes place in a cyberpunk environment and you play as a female android named Dex. From the start of the game you are on the run, being chased by some bad dudes in police riot gear. The only thing you are told is you need to meet a guy at some bar and which direction you need to run. FULL REVIEW HERE: http://snerdaperds.com/2017/03/dex/ "

												Dex is an example of when a developer makes an RPG the right way.  So many new developers are focusing on the wrong features like multiplayer, free to play etc... that they forget what makes a good game.  Dex may not have those shiny graphics but it has a lot of heart and is up there with some of the best rpgs.  In Dex you get a large open world to explore filled with interesting characters, meaningful side quests and dangerous enemies and loot.  The Environments are beautiful and dripping with atmosphere.  Its the gritty dark cyberpunk setting you can expect.  Gameplay is fun especially the augmentation feature.  You ll start to become an aug addict very soon wanting the next awesome implant to make yourself a badass cyborg.  The story is great and makes you very invested in the characters struggles.  I have enjoyeed every moment of the 12 hours i put into the game without fail.  In conclusion buy this game.  Its a shining example of RPGS done right and can even be said to be better than some AAA titles.  I only wish there was more to play and cant wait to see what the developers do next.			"

												This game has a nice classical Cyberpunk feel to itself. Something like Flashback if you know it. There might be still some smaller bugs but that should not turn you down from an interesting experience with enjoyable action arcade hacking minigames and a classical CP storyline. Nothing surprising, but if you liked the original Deus Ex, you would like this also.			"

												November 2015, 50+ hrs playedEdit: Uprate to 10/10. Bugs are gone and some minor features added. Good job.9/10 Recommendation givenA nice, athmospheric 2D cyberpunk gem. It has a solid, gripping story mixed with very fitting music and graphics. In addition, the voice acting is pretty good. It was worth it's 10 € (~28ct/hr).As I reviewed other reviews and the discussions, the devs are working to fix remaining bugs and polishing Dex. If the last bugs are gone, I will uprate my recommendation to 10/10.			"

												A very good game. It's like a 2D Deus Ex. Has beautiful graphics and music, story has all the cyberpunk tropes you'd expect, but isn't particurarly innovative: you can skip all the chatting and go directly to the action without missing too much. Important: before playing read the help and check what are the commands! I figured out very late in the play through that I could use some special attacks playing the hacking mini-game.To me it's a 7/10.Maybe an Italian translation could have helped me immerse more into the story, who knows!

												Dex is a game that does a lot of things right. the story is captivating, the quests are fun. and its reminisent of a time when games respected a players intelligence. its not to say that it wont help you out in the beginning, but it doesnt throw up tutorial screens every 3 seconds.my only complaint really is that the controller setup needs a little work. i understand with games of this nature that having a virtual 360 range of motion with a gun weapon requires extra animation, but as it is the controllar setup for a gun is a little wonky. you have to hold a trigger down, aim with the right stick and then push another button to fire. the way i would do it is to push the button as normal to draw your gun then whereever you chose to push the stick, dex fires her weapon in that direction. many games do that with great effect and this game would go from being great to awesome with that change.the netrunning scenes are great as well. but suffer from the same clunkiness from having to aim in a direction without it feeling polished as an analog control should. if the analog controls were reworked to take full advantage of the stick precision, and the gunplay was reworked like i said above. Dex could easily be a game that sets the standard for games within this genre.FInal verdict: Get the game. its worth the 20 dollars and should dreadlocks tweak the controller movement and polish it. it will easily be one of the best games of its type.

There's just enough of a hint about what to do next in the missions without presenting information to you on a silver platter. It's not too long and not too short. I can jump into the missions for a quick run without spending hours on a mission. If you die then you respawn but you have to do some stuff again (but not too much). It's not overly challenging and not overly easy.			"

												Dex, a snazzy cyberpunk platformer with a  stellar soundtrack, doesn't take long too complete at all even with all achievements (a couple days), however don't let that be a deterrence; it's refreshing playing a short, sweet title like this.Dex is an old school platformers delight, with Metroidvania-ish gameplay and level layout but with some modern implementations (thankfully)  and a few original ideas. The overall aesthetic and presentation are both up to date, and abilities like all-the-time fast travel prevent a sense of staleness and repeating trudge of back-tracking areas.Needless to say, issues do crop up, and several are notable. Enemies don't respawn, so they are always tough to kill. Many fights require the right approach, or else you'll get you life chopped. The control layout doesn't help either, and you'll frantically press the wrong buttons and doing something silly like jack into cyberspace in the middle of a gun fight. When there are multiple enemies with multiple attacks on screen at once and they know you're there, forget it.Reload the room, and start over. Basically, combat feels out of hand alot of the time, and it's advice to stealth kill you way through the game for the easiest approach.Another things is Dex's strange narrative/gamelay combo... Most of the game is made up of sidequests, not necessarily relating to the arch plot encompassing Dex, Raycast, Decker, and the The Complex. As a result, the missions are interesting, but you don't get as emotionally invested in Dex and her plight as could have been. Its only the game's final missions and locations that really build to deep suspense, uncertainty, intrigue and then just plain out ""What the hell will happen next?!"" kind of moments that leave you floored.Finally, I'm yet to play a videogame where I actually look forward to fun cyberspace sections... Dex tries a fair game with a shooter simulation, but that double shot upgrade ought to be default imo. If you're just starting playing, some advice: upgrade hacking to 6 ASAP.Overall, I recommend Dex to old school platformer/Metroidvania junkies (or people who just like action platformers), and  of course for people who need a regular cyberpunk fix. I'm interested to see what other titles the developers have/will publish in the near future.Nice one Dreadlocks.			"

												Dex is an example of when a developer makes an RPG the right way.  So many new developers are focusing on the wrong features like multiplayer, free to play etc... that they forget what makes a good game.  Dex may not have those shiny graphics but it has a lot of heart and is up there with some of the best rpgs.  In Dex you get a large open world to explore filled with interesting characters, meaningful side quests and dangerous enemies and loot.  The Environments are beautiful and dripping with atmosphere.  Its the gritty dark cyberpunk setting you can expect.  Gameplay is fun especially the augmentation feature.  You ll start to become an aug addict very soon wanting the next awesome implant to make yourself a badass cyborg.  The story is great and makes you very invested in the characters struggles.  I have enjoyeed every moment of the 12 hours i put into the game without fail.  In conclusion buy this game.  Its a shining example of RPGS done right and can even be said to be better than some AAA titles.  I only wish there was more to play and cant wait to see what the developers do next.			"

												Dex is a 2D sidescrolling action RPG, with a major focus on the RPG part. The game takes place in a cyberpunk environment and you play as a female android named Dex. From the start of the game you are on the run, being chased by some bad dudes in police riot gear. The only thing you are told is you need to meet a guy at some bar and which direction you need to run. FULL REVIEW HERE: http://snerdaperds.com/2017/03/dex/ "

Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this game to any fans of the sci-fi/cyberpunk genre.

												I have played this game from early access to what is now a finshed game, I think the only criticism about the game is that I wish the final release lasted longer because of how much fun it was to play. the game story is a lot like Deus Ex.  the graphics and colour tones work fantasicly to bring the world alive.  combat its a shame that in the final version they took out the ability to punch while crouched but I do understand that it was also a easy way to win fights as enemy AI couldn't counter atack, but over all the finshed combat is challenging and dynamic. I think the game would have been improved with some more missons before being taken to the final map area and the two final missions being more spread out would have been nice but that may have been because I finished all the side quests before doing that mission.

												If you're a fan of cyberpunk and Shadowrun universe type stuff, then Dex is probably going to make you happy.  I didn't really 'get it' at the start of the game, but one recommendation to do some side-quests instead of trying right away for the 'get modded' quest fixed that.I went start to finish with a melee build, never bothered with ranged weapons at all.  You will want to invest in the lockpicking skill (both levels) and the AR skill (both levels) as soon as possible, those are the most important skills in the game.I thought the story was pretty interesting, and kept wanting to play and go further in the game to see what was going to happen.  Gameplay is solid when you get the hang of it.  It's definitely more in the vein of the SNES Shadowrun game where the game mechanics are basic and solid, but the story and character building are the starts of the show.I'd give it a 7/10 for maybe a general audience, but 8.5/10 for people who are into cyberpunk.

												Disclaimer: I am still playing through this game, so I haven't finished it yet. I am also using a steam controller, so my gameplay experience may differ from those using keyboard & mouse or a standard controller. I may edit this review later if I find some of my critique to be modified by gameplay introduced later on.Overal I find this game extremely enjoyable, so my critique is more to help the dev team by giving them some pointers to go by.The Excellent:Graphics are beautifully done, they remind me of space quest and flashback, which is a very good thing.Exploration is great, allowing for you to return to most places you have been later on if you wanted to do further investigationThe Good:Music is passable, nothing spectacular, but the soundtrack fits the mood of the environments in the game.The story is intriguing, however some names are rather cookie cutter - for example ""Decker"" is super stereotypical for a hacker.Voice Acting is ok in places, and in others it is just bad. Credit can be given that for an indie style game the characters are varied, but some of the dialogue is very contrived and some actors are doing accents they aren't particularly good at.The Lackluster:Stealth is very difficult, could use some tweaks here and there. Almost impossible to sneak up on someone because the range of view is so small. Enemies can almost always see you as soon as you see them, preventing you from anticipating and taking cover. I have no stealth augs yet, so this may change, but I doubt it.The AR hacking system seems disjointed from the rest of the game, sure you can interact with the game world via cyberspace, however the 'virus' mechanic isn't particularly fun.

												Oh Dex... Dear Dex. I really wanted to love you.... and You leave me like that. Well, first things first.Dex is a 2D cyberpunk RPG. Looks like a platformer - it really isn't. You do a little platforming from time to time, but it's marginal. The core gameplay is strictly story driven, heavy on dialogue. Also - Dex gives you little ""open-world"" to roam, plenty of side-quests and very neat and satisfying upgrade system.  All drenched in familiar cyberpunk atmosphere, great art design and fitting electronic music. Yes, it all sounds great, but the devil... is in the details. The story is... fairly interesting. Nothing that will shake You, if you're a sci-fi nerd. Especially if brands like Shadowrun or Cyberpunk 2020 are your thing. The main character, named (duh) Dex - could be an interesting protagonist... but unfortunatly, when all characters in the game are voice-acted... Dex is not. Excluding a couple of lines in the few cutscenes the game offers. That is a pity, because Dex as a character is little bland. While the main story is basic, there is some side-quests that'll keep You fairly engaged. Nevertheless, nothing extraordinary. In the other hand - I must complement the variety of possible outcomes. There's always two, sometimes three ways to complete a quest. The ""open world"" looks good, but it feels small when You realize that you can talk only to important characters. No chit-chat. When seeing a exclamation mark over the head of someone - it's a vendor or a quest-giver. Well, that is little dissapointing.   Combat in Dex is ... Well, almost breaks the game. Ammo is scarce and expensive, so most of the time you'll be punching your way through. Melee couldn't be more sluggish, uninspired and tedious. Staggering an enemy is almost impossible, but you'll end up on the floor pretty often. Everything feels slow, unresponsive - i had a feeling that the enemy always has the upper hand. You can run, avoid enemies or perform non-lethel takedowns - but it's not always an option. And.... yes, enemy AI is mostly brain-dead. Combat is just so.... Not fun. One neat element of combat is hacking. The games takes a form of little bullet-hell shooter and your avatar can roam the servers, fighting viruses and firewalls. Nice gimmick, but it feels like a chore in the end of the game. Still, it is entertaining.Overall...  I finished the game in around 10h. I guess you can stretch it to 12h, i know i missed the Extra Outfits DLC content and a few achivements. I had fun, but felt underwhelmed most of the time. Dex is a strong 6/10, being good... but not as good as You would like to. I will recommend it tho. Get it on sale. "

												Simplistic, but solid.This is a neat little sidescroller that is in the cyberpunk world. It contains about 10 or so areas that are neatly decorated with some well done art. Voice acting and creativity are good here. More importantly, the story sucked me in, and kept me interested for the 12 hours that it took me to complete the game, completing most of the side quests. Although there isnt really much to the game other than jumping, punching, kicking,shooting, upgrading, and some hacking minigames, I found the game tasteful, well done, and the perfect length. I would recommending picking it up in the 10-20 dollar pricepoint. Very well done for a new developer. Keep up the good work!			"

												Dex is suitably entertaining, and suitably cyberpunk although sometimes it seems like it cannot decide if it is The Matrix or not.  The game offers a few different playstyle choices, although since hacking and combat will always both be required the variety does not seem significant enough to warrent multiple playthroughs.In-game graphics are a little pixelly, but that's fine.  The voice-overs for the most part are well-done, with Dex and Decker's voices in particular doing a great job.  The hand-painted cutscenes are likewise really good for the most part.Dex was entertaining and engaging enough that I would be interested in seeing more.			"

												Dex, a snazzy cyberpunk platformer with a  stellar soundtrack, doesn't take long too complete at all even with all achievements (a couple days), however don't let that be a deterrence; it's refreshing playing a short, sweet title like this.Dex is an old school platformers delight, with Metroidvania-ish gameplay and level layout but with some modern implementations (thankfully)  and a few original ideas. The overall aesthetic and presentation are both up to date, and abilities like all-the-time fast travel prevent a sense of staleness and repeating trudge of back-tracking areas.Needless to say, issues do crop up, and several are notable. Enemies don't respawn, so they are always tough to kill. Many fights require the right approach, or else you'll get you life chopped. The control layout doesn't help either, and you'll frantically press the wrong buttons and doing something silly like jack into cyberspace in the middle of a gun fight. When there are multiple enemies with multiple attacks on screen at once and they know you're there, forget it.Reload the room, and start over. Basically, combat feels out of hand alot of the time, and it's advice to stealth kill you way through the game for the easiest approach.Another things is Dex's strange narrative/gamelay combo... Most of the game is made up of sidequests, not necessarily relating to the arch plot encompassing Dex, Raycast, Decker, and the The Complex. As a result, the missions are interesting, but you don't get as emotionally invested in Dex and her plight as could have been. Its only the game's final missions and locations that really build to deep suspense, uncertainty, intrigue and then just plain out ""What the hell will happen next?!"" kind of moments that leave you floored.Finally, I'm yet to play a videogame where I actually look forward to fun cyberspace sections... Dex tries a fair game with a shooter simulation, but that double shot upgrade ought to be default imo. If you're just starting playing, some advice: upgrade hacking to 6 ASAP.Overall, I recommend Dex to old school platformer/Metroidvania junkies (or people who just like action platformers), and  of course for people who need a regular cyberpunk fix. I'm interested to see what other titles the developers have/will publish in the near future.Nice one Dreadlocks.			"

												Dex is a 2D sidescrolling action RPG, with a major focus on the RPG part. The game takes place in a cyberpunk environment and you play as a female android named Dex. From the start of the game you are on the run, being chased by some bad dudes in police riot gear. The only thing you are told is you need to meet a guy at some bar and which direction you need to run. FULL REVIEW HERE: http://snerdaperds.com/2017/03/dex/ "

												Dex is an example of when a developer makes an RPG the right way.  So many new developers are focusing on the wrong features like multiplayer, free to play etc... that they forget what makes a good game.  Dex may not have those shiny graphics but it has a lot of heart and is up there with some of the best rpgs.  In Dex you get a large open world to explore filled with interesting characters, meaningful side quests and dangerous enemies and loot.  The Environments are beautiful and dripping with atmosphere.  Its the gritty dark cyberpunk setting you can expect.  Gameplay is fun especially the augmentation feature.  You ll start to become an aug addict very soon wanting the next awesome implant to make yourself a badass cyborg.  The story is great and makes you very invested in the characters struggles.  I have enjoyeed every moment of the 12 hours i put into the game without fail.  In conclusion buy this game.  Its a shining example of RPGS done right and can even be said to be better than some AAA titles.  I only wish there was more to play and cant wait to see what the developers do next.			"

												For me it was a pleasure to play this game.It has a really nice story to tell which i enjoyed and liked to follow.The gameplay is really open to choose, I played it the hacker way, focused on that at first. But it seems that you could go also as melee fighter or ranged warrior first. For each of these you can proceed on an agressive way or sneak round. The most of the quest are free to do, of course if you want to level up it would be wise to do them. You can freely roam the citry, only a few areas are mission related and get unlocked later. In general i found it not to difficult to play but i guess it depends on how you approach is.It has a lot of dialogs, gladly all are with voice, this is defently a plus :)Maybe i play it again just to get the missing achivements :P, once you know the story there is no reason to play it through a second time to find something else. At least that is the feeling i have after the first playthrough.Summary, i liked it and so i recommend it.			"

												Honestly Speaking, I am not fancy to AAA games. Stunning graphics, customized character faces, or complicated storylines, does not interest me. Nowadays people all focus on 3D model buildings but forget to create a good game. A good game is simple, yet deep and intriguing. Dex is the kind of the game. It is deep, it is fun, and it is easy to play. It is the game I wish to see more. And one more thing, it will be great to play this game with a gamepad. Keyboard and mouse does not come handy when you are fighting with groups of badasses. :D "

												Wow, very nice. First impression wasn't great, with slightly clunky controls and a dull sewer section. But once I got to the city the game gripped me. A lot of fun to explore. The writing is also hit or miss, with many worn and kind of outdated cyberpunk cliches and lingo, but it makes up for it with some very original quest stories, of which I actually cared to see the outcome. So far the action parts have been a bit unforgiving on my weak skills, but the world makes up for it and tops almost anything AAA I've played revently.			"

												A 2d jump and shoot and sneak and hack and talk and explore...Blends the feeling of flashback, metroid, adventures and RPG into a modern indie game.And the story is all you could wish from a cyberpunk story! Best 16 gaming hours I had this year.To be fair the controls are hard to get used to and are somewhat clunky (which also reminds me of flashback as well :), the enemies could be smarter and at some point most fights feel too easy. But despite all this, I highly recommend the game because of its athmosphere and story!			"

												My first thought after five minutes was ""oh my, I'm playing a platformer!"" - but it's not. It's a side-slider, which means - two-dimentional graphics, which means - no pathetic 3D-models, but excellent 2D-graphics. I bought the game for its graphics and it did not let me down.So:+ aesthetics (already mentioned before) is done very thoroughly.+ a bunch of side-quests, maybe a bit straightforward, but they are!+ ""slay, steal, speak"" - it's not Fallout, of course - but who is? The means to achieve a goal are not radically different - but they are different, even the ways to fight. There are also choices in the end of most quests, and there are sometimes hidden choices, so — quite non-linear.+ the story, the plot. I cannot say it's striked me, but it is good.+ the hacking system is a well-thought-out mini-game.? the language is somewhat difficult for non-natives (well, it was difficult for me - so, I guess, I've missed some part of plot)? implants - they were good, but I guess I waited a bit more.? the story again. A bit swallowed at the end, or have I missed smth?? there is stealth, but as far as I get it you only obtain XP for quests and kills (and rarely find while hacking) - you lack progress if you sneak without killing.- endings: I'll pass spoilers here, but one of them just states ""ok, the end"" - no result, no epilogue, no ""so, where does it lead?"", other gives a very short epilogue. Ok, some questions that you meet in the very end — admit it, you could not possibly find the answers, but overall it still looks a bit cut-off.==================So, should you play it?YES, if:* you DO LOVE cyberpunk and its atmosphere,* you like story-driven games and don't mind, if you've already heard some its parts,* you prefer not-so-hard fighting systems without much of tactics.NO, if:* you prefer advanced tactical battles with lots of different weapons and fine points,* you don't like dialogues and texts and digging into story at all.

												Rather easy & with a few bugs, but overall a very nice experience to play. The skill system allows for some customization (mostly your combat style: melee, ranged or augement/hack based, the non-combat ones add some flavor), the story / cutscenes / background create a nice Cyberpunk atmosphere. First playthrough took me about 15-18h, subsequent ones 4-7h (worth it, there was some hidden stuff / ending modifiers / choices that I missed the first time around). The only thing that disappointed me is the length, but in a good longing-for-more way.			"

												I have played this game from early access to what is now a finshed game, I think the only criticism about the game is that I wish the final release lasted longer because of how much fun it was to play. the game story is a lot like Deus Ex.  the graphics and colour tones work fantasicly to bring the world alive.  combat its a shame that in the final version they took out the ability to punch while crouched but I do understand that it was also a easy way to win fights as enemy AI couldn't counter atack, but over all the finshed combat is challenging and dynamic. I think the game would have been improved with some more missons before being taken to the final map area and the two final missions being more spread out would have been nice but that may have been because I finished all the side quests before doing that mission.

												Dex has been a very pleasant adventure from start to end so it's with a joyful heart that I am writing this review. I don't intend this to be a full-scale review so I will simply sum up what I liked and what I disliked:+ responsive, fast-paced, fun to play+ well-written scenario and dialogues+ rich background environement, both in texture details as in the narrative+ very successfully rendered atmosphere of the 80s-90s cyberpunk novels or graphic novels, without comprimising to much in favour of tasteless fan-service- don't think you can even begin to appreciate the game if you don't pay thorough attention to the side quests- main character lacks in psychology (OK i get it that you want some template any player can fill in, but the rebel/teenager attitude falls a bit short sometimes)- Cyberspace tasks too easy even with basic hacking abilitiesThis game is a must for any cyberpunk fan/maniac/nostalgicThis game should be given a shot if you'd like an immersive universe and story that seems to have a life of it's own but don't have too much time to play.

I'm surprised I have as few hours on record as Steam tells me because I felt like I played it for quite a long time. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this game to any fans of the sci-fi/cyberpunk genre. It's very immersive, has some great character building/skill tree building elements of an RPG, and has some great 'in the machine/matrix' hacking interfaces that are a lot of fun to explore.			"

												While I've had some difficulty distinguishing platforms in the foreground from the background, leading to some silly and avoidable deaths, the game is both beautiful and stylish. So far the game sticks to its aesthetics, and to the cyberpunk theme, and it's easy to get lost in the rich world. Getting snippets of background info in the shape of mini essays and emails through the hacking minigame shows that the game borrows from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, with the yellow/amber HUD-elements bringing the point home harder still. Deus Ex is not a bad game to borrow from by any means, and the initial clunkiness of the character, having 0 skill points invested, reminds a little of the player character in the original Deus Ex. The player can, however, upgrade themselves through leveling and cybernetic augmantation, and their chosen style of play becomes comparatively easier.Dex is not an easy game on the default difficulty (the difficulty can be lowered), but it feels like that's because to do everything, you need to specialise in everything, which is per definition impossible. You can bulldoze through as a regenerating tank, sneak around under the cover of darkness, or you can hack turrets, alarms and the implants of your enemies to get an edge. If you're unprepared, you can't really bull through without cheese like sniping people offscreen by memory, but getting killed feels more like a rebuke to find another way where this is the case. Some problems come to mind, the platforms not popping enough for example, but I would recommend the game in a heartbeat.			"

The game felt a lot longer than it actually was, which only speaks highly of how enthrilling this game is. If you wear headphones and play in a dark room, you -feel- like a part of DEX.The endings, however?♥♥♥♥♥♥ No offense to the team but after you ""defeat"" the main big baddie, you have a choice of three possible endings. Every single one leads to a 3-second cutscene before the ending credits pop up.That being said, JUST BEFORE the end of the game is beautiful. In fact, the entire game is beautiful!

												I will be honnest here, I am terrible at games like these and while I tried I simple failed to much so I proceeded to play this game with a trainer, though later on things get a bit more manageable when you start to unlock more things and gain more control over the fights. To me however what drew me to this game was a combination of art style and story. The overal main red line of the story is as to be expected one done many times over, it is hard to avoid and frankly the least important factor of the story. Now what made the story great for me are all the little bits, the mistakes you can make without knowing the way you see everything play out and than get that subtle hint that you could have done better. I think now I completed my first playthrough I will certainly do an other as I missed some side quests and I like to see if I can do better with some of the things I did. Overal I would recommend this game if it is up your ally gameplay wise and story wise. I certainly have no regrets and with 10 hour baseline time for a single quick play through which can be 15 hours or a bit more if you go into everything it is an overal enjoyable experience.			"

												Dex is an action platformer set in a cyberpunk dystopian future where mega corporations rule the world with hackers rebelling against them. The setting is a bit reminiscent of the Shadowrun series, although not quite as gritty.There is a good mix of exploration, fighting, leveling, scavenging, story dialog and side quests. While no one element is ground breaking, the varied gameplay keeps the game engaging till the end.There are lots of choices but not much in the way of consequences. Save for some side quests needing to be completed a certain way for some achievements there really isn’t a huge difference in the outcomes of the different dialog choices other than getting slightly different responses and maybe a bit more or less EXP. The game can just be saved and loaded to see all of the different outcomes, I didn’t really see the point of playing through the game twice.-Playtime-A good 16 hours to complete the game with all side quests.-Achievements-Most of the achievements you will get just by progressing through the game normally. There are several for getting the “good” result of many of the side quests. With a guide for these I got 100% on my first play through.Recommended on sale.			"

												A good game you can finish in a weekend but not without its faultsPros:- Great artwork- Very good voice acting (exceptional for an indie game)- Interesting setting and characters- Lots of exploration- Decent RPG elements- Length is just right- Good Xbox controller supportCons- Combat is rather poor- Character animation is frankly bad- Protagonist could have been more developed- Somewhat underwhelming endingThis game is definitely worth checking out if you like platformers and enjoy the cyberpunk futuristic setting. These developers did a phenomenal job with the characters and in particular the voice acting. The pace of the game is just right and never feels grindy or repetitive. If you are looking for something a bit original in story, setting and NPCs and can forgive the game being a bit rough around the edges I would say check it out. If you are just looking for a pure action platformer with tight controls and combat there are much better choices out there.			"

												2D sidescrolling RPG with a cyberpunk setting. Gives me serious Deus Ex vibes.Presentation is top-notch. Whether you're in the busy streets of Chinatown or the red light district, the visuals, camera zoom, and music all come together to immerse you in the world. You'll feel like a tiny person in a huge neon city, or a customer in a dank little munitions shop. Quest and shop NPCs are also fully voice-acted and help to flesh out the city. It's just one city but from rich lawyers to rambling hobos, everyone sounds the part.Gameplay is average. You get melee and guns. Guns are only good for shooting shooting security cameras. Early game, your melee ability is limited to two weak jabs. However, you fight enemies who can block forever and will hit you with crowbars, chains, guns and super armored kicks. Late game is way easier because you unlock unblockable attacks, huge damage buffs and regeneration. Combat actually feels fluid after unlocking all of that, but it takes a while.Content is good. Lots of side quests, different ways to solve things and some plot-influencing choices. Story is linear for the most part, but engaging all the same.Conclusion: Worth it at full price.			"

												If Gunpoint and Deus Ex had a baby, it would look a little like this. :-DSure, it's really easy to compare this to Deus Ex - the cyberpunk theme, the beautiful background music, the transhumanism... But this is a great game on its own.It's not a long game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely worth playing. So if you can't afford it right now, pick it up when it's next on sale. I highly recommend it.PS:- Grab the free outfits dlc, and make sure it's installed before you begin. You'll still have to uncover them in the game to access them, but they're pretty handy - and there's no point waiting until you've almost completed the game to hear about, then go acquire the thing (like I did. :-p )			"

												After having played this game from beginning to end I have to say it more than lived up to what I could have reasonably expected. The setting is excellent the story excellent the inventory and gameplay excellent and then there is the gfx again excellent. I do realise that it may sound like I am gushing praise on this game and if it seems like that it is simply because it eanred it. First the good price value, in todays game envirnment it is good to see a game developer take its time and do it right. The side scrolling gameplay mechanics are very similer to the old school snes and genisis classic Flashback but with a number of enhancments.

If i were to make a critique, i'd say the combat could be improved but definetely it doesn't hinder the game in anything.I'd also support another game in the same universe with caracter creation and more customization because it would be awesome!

												Although I finished the game within 10 hours, But the plot is quite wonderful, The story is quite twisting. There is only 2 endings.What I like about the game is that, there are lots of ways to go through a simple side quest. You can use multiple ways to go through it but mostly are just a simple tasks.Not really difficult even for average platform gamers can get by it easily.			"

												Good naratives, a little short, predictable story line.If you like cyber enhanced human virtual worlds, this one will be a gem to play.  Challenging (early on anyways) ""shooter"" style hacking, with the character progression those hacking sessions become easier and easier and will even play a key role in your platforming and fighting strategies.The game has about 16 hours of content if you do all side quests; which in my books is quite short.   Replaying the game more than once will feel repetitive.  On the other hand, the voice over is nicely done, the music is entertaining and the platforming difficulty in on par with my moderate skills.I recommend picking up while on sale.			"

												For the first part of the game I was literally glued to the screen, enjoying the Semi-Retro 2D Sci-Fi RPG Adventure Cyberpunk gameplay. I couldn't put it down, didn't eat, didn't sleep, well okay I did eat and sleep, but still, I was engrossed.It was like a combination of Impossible Mission, Mission Elevator, Neuromancer and with a bit of Double Dragon sprinkled in.Until the trials, when you suddenly lose all your hard earned upgrades and have to go back to a now unfamiliar style of game play, forcing you to use covert tactics instead of my preferred quake-style game play.That was the meh-moment for me. Maybe I'll finish it some of these days.			"

												Great little side scroller cpunk RPG with all the right ingredients.  Voice acted decently for the most part, a simple yet satisfying combat system, hacking that is a lot more arcade like, and a whole bunch of interesting settings, characters and plots to keep you interested.I found that it was just the right duration of game as well, clocking it at around 12 hours for a 95% complete playthrough (I missed a few achievements, oh well).  Limited replay value due to its genre but its possible to play with different skill point allocations.Only down side was that the outfit DLC (free) didn't work for me. There's a workaround in forums to get it going but I only found that after I'd already completed the game.			"

Also, the levels are made so you can avoid enemies.+ Story is awsome: Its fully voiced with greate disalogue and a good sense of humour+ Sound, graphics are all appealing.- Well, like any good game, it is always too short ;)			"

												I like this game. Combat is really iffy at the start (you have no weapons, everyone else does). Even after you get guns, you can feel they're not the main focus of how the game wants you to deal with enemies. The plot is solid, but does adhere to  a few dystopian-future tropes.A good game. I just can't figure out why I kept finding condoms everywhere. Was I supposed to make a life-raft out of them? For a secret achievement, or something?			"

												This game takes SO much inspiration from Deus Ex. Let me list some of the obvious ways:1. Cyberpunk RPG with heavy emphasis on player choice2. Augmentations (implemented almost exactly like Deus Ex, both mechanically, and with respect to the main character being ""more advanced"" than everyone else)3. ""Hacking"" minigame that takes up huge portion of gameplay.4. Many objectives have multiple pathways to get there with respect to map design and stealth gameplay (i.e. ubiquitous air ducts)5. Supporting characters include disembodied AI figure that looks like a cross between Bob Page and Walton Simons6. ""Conspiracy-Heavy"" plot involving evil BioTech corporation and evil Private Military Corporation (ala Versalife, Tai Yong, Belltower, and MJ12)7. *Spolier Alert* One of the levels has you break out of a cell (with the help of your AI friend) and recover all of your gear/equipment (hrm, I wonder where they got that idea from? *COUGH* MJ12 facility under UNATCO *COUGH*)8. *Spoiler Alert* Final Level takes place in an underwater sea lab, and you escape on a YELLOW SUBMARINE (that looks exactly like the one you used in Deus Ex 1). Even the end-game choices are remarkably similar to those in DX19. THE FREAKING NAME IS ""DEX."" DEus eX. DE-us e-X. DEX. LOLNone of this is meant to suggest that the game is bad. On the contrary, the game is actually really good - it has meaningful player choices, interesting RPG elements/player progression, atmospheric music, good level design, and surprisingly high quality voice acting (honestly, DEX's voice actors are really good, even when the script occassionally falls short). And it does this all using 2D graphics in a side-scroller. Overall, very well done indeed.It may be a tinyyyyy bit too short for the $20 price tag (I got 17 hours out of it), but if you buy it on sale (I got it for only FIVE bucks during the winter sale), it's definitelly worth it. Way better value than any recent Call of Duty game, lol.			"

												Disclaimer: I am still playing through this game, so I haven't finished it yet. I am also using a steam controller, so my gameplay experience may differ from those using keyboard & mouse or a standard controller. I may edit this review later if I find some of my critique to be modified by gameplay introduced later on.Overal I find this game extremely enjoyable, so my critique is more to help the dev team by giving them some pointers to go by.The Excellent:Graphics are beautifully done, they remind me of space quest and flashback, which is a very good thing.Exploration is great, allowing for you to return to most places you have been later on if you wanted to do further investigationThe Good:Music is passable, nothing spectacular, but the soundtrack fits the mood of the environments in the game.The story is intriguing, however some names are rather cookie cutter - for example ""Decker"" is super stereotypical for a hacker.Voice Acting is ok in places, and in others it is just bad. Credit can be given that for an indie style game the characters are varied, but some of the dialogue is very contrived and some actors are doing accents they aren't particularly good at.The Lackluster:Stealth is very difficult, could use some tweaks here and there. Almost impossible to sneak up on someone because the range of view is so small. Enemies can almost always see you as soon as you see them, preventing you from anticipating and taking cover. I have no stealth augs yet, so this may change, but I doubt it.The AR hacking system seems disjointed from the rest of the game, sure you can interact with the game world via cyberspace, however the 'virus' mechanic isn't particularly fun.

												I will be honnest here, I am terrible at games like these and while I tried I simple failed to much so I proceeded to play this game with a trainer, though later on things get a bit more manageable when you start to unlock more things and gain more control over the fights. To me however what drew me to this game was a combination of art style and story. The overal main red line of the story is as to be expected one done many times over, it is hard to avoid and frankly the least important factor of the story. Now what made the story great for me are all the little bits, the mistakes you can make without knowing the way you see everything play out and than get that subtle hint that you could have done better. I think now I completed my first playthrough I will certainly do an other as I missed some side quests and I like to see if I can do better with some of the things I did. Overal I would recommend this game if it is up your ally gameplay wise and story wise. I certainly have no regrets and with 10 hour baseline time for a single quick play through which can be 15 hours or a bit more if you go into everything it is an overal enjoyable experience.			"

												Dex is an action platformer set in a cyberpunk dystopian future where mega corporations rule the world with hackers rebelling against them. The setting is a bit reminiscent of the Shadowrun series, although not quite as gritty.There is a good mix of exploration, fighting, leveling, scavenging, story dialog and side quests. While no one element is ground breaking, the varied gameplay keeps the game engaging till the end.There are lots of choices but not much in the way of consequences. Save for some side quests needing to be completed a certain way for some achievements there really isn’t a huge difference in the outcomes of the different dialog choices other than getting slightly different responses and maybe a bit more or less EXP. The game can just be saved and loaded to see all of the different outcomes, I didn’t really see the point of playing through the game twice.-Playtime-A good 16 hours to complete the game with all side quests.-Achievements-Most of the achievements you will get just by progressing through the game normally. There are several for getting the “good” result of many of the side quests. With a guide for these I got 100% on my first play through.Recommended on sale.			"

The game felt a lot longer than it actually was, which only speaks highly of how enthrilling this game is. If you wear headphones and play in a dark room, you -feel- like a part of DEX.The endings, however?♥♥♥♥♥♥ No offense to the team but after you ""defeat"" the main big baddie, you have a choice of three possible endings. Every single one leads to a 3-second cutscene before the ending credits pop up.That being said, JUST BEFORE the end of the game is beautiful. In fact, the entire game is beautiful! A friend likened it to ""Shadowrun without dice, then?"" when I was playing. I like it. I like this game a lot. Again, not worth the $20 price tag but definitely worth getting for less			"

The skill system allows for some customization (mostly your combat style: melee, ranged or augement/hack based, the non-combat ones add some flavor), the story / cutscenes / background create a nice Cyberpunk atmosphere. First playthrough took me about 15-18h, subsequent ones 4-7h (worth it, there was some hidden stuff / ending modifiers / choices that I missed the first time around). The only thing that disappointed me is the length, but in a good longing-for-more way.			"

												Dex has been a very pleasant adventure from start to end so it's with a joyful heart that I am writing this review. I don't intend this to be a full-scale review so I will simply sum up what I liked and what I disliked:+ responsive, fast-paced, fun to play+ well-written scenario and dialogues+ rich background environement, both in texture details as in the narrative+ very successfully rendered atmosphere of the 80s-90s cyberpunk novels or graphic novels, without comprimising to much in favour of tasteless fan-service- don't think you can even begin to appreciate the game if you don't pay thorough attention to the side quests- main character lacks in psychology (OK i get it that you want some template any player can fill in, but the rebel/teenager attitude falls a bit short sometimes)- Cyberspace tasks too easy even with basic hacking abilitiesThis game is a must for any cyberpunk fan/maniac/nostalgicThis game should be given a shot if you'd like an immersive universe and story that seems to have a life of it's own but don't have too much time to play.

												This game is simply awesome. Sure, it has flaws. The animation is really poor, sends us back to the glorious days of 16-bits consoles. Weapon choice is very limited (and if you're anything like me, you'll go melee most of the time anyway). There are some frustrating moments, especially during some hacking phases.But overall, the non-linear gameplay is outstanding, the characters, if a bit cliché, are well concieved, the story has some twists, the quests can be completed in different manners (it doesn't affect the main story, but it still is a nice touch)... The whole game feels like playing something out of a William Gibbson novel.If this didn't convince you, let me try this way : first time I started the game, I played 5 hours straight, paused to eat something, then 3 more hours. When I finished the game, I started another playthrough immediately to try other quests choices and the other ending (which was disapointingly lacking of details compared to the first one I tried), and even got to beat all the achievements, which is something I usually don't care about.Would I recommend the game ? Hell yes.			"

												My first thought after five minutes was ""oh my, I'm playing a platformer!"" - but it's not. It's a side-slider, which means - two-dimentional graphics, which means - no pathetic 3D-models, but excellent 2D-graphics. I bought the game for its graphics and it did not let me down.So:+ aesthetics (already mentioned before) is done very thoroughly.+ a bunch of side-quests, maybe a bit straightforward, but they are!+ ""slay, steal, speak"" - it's not Fallout, of course - but who is? The means to achieve a goal are not radically different - but they are different, even the ways to fight. There are also choices in the end of most quests, and there are sometimes hidden choices, so — quite non-linear.+ the story, the plot. I cannot say it's striked me, but it is good.+ the hacking system is a well-thought-out mini-game.? the language is somewhat difficult for non-natives (well, it was difficult for me - so, I guess, I've missed some part of plot)? implants - they were good, but I guess I waited a bit more.? the story again. A bit swallowed at the end, or have I missed smth?? there is stealth, but as far as I get it you only obtain XP for quests and kills (and rarely find while hacking) - you lack progress if you sneak without killing.- endings: I'll pass spoilers here, but one of them just states ""ok, the end"" - no result, no epilogue, no ""so, where does it lead?"", other gives a very short epilogue. Ok, some questions that you meet in the very end — admit it, you could not possibly find the answers, but overall it still looks a bit cut-off.==================So, should you play it?YES, if:* you DO LOVE cyberpunk and its atmosphere,* you like story-driven games and don't mind, if you've already heard some its parts,* you prefer not-so-hard fighting systems without much of tactics.NO, if:* you prefer advanced tactical battles with lots of different weapons and fine points,* you don't like dialogues and texts and digging into story at all.

But this is a great game on its own.It's not a long game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely worth playing. So if you can't afford it right now, pick it up when it's next on sale. I highly recommend it.PS:- Grab the free outfits dlc, and make sure it's installed before you begin. You'll still have to uncover them in the game to access them, but they're pretty handy - and there's no point waiting until you've almost completed the game to hear about, then go acquire the thing (like I did. :-p )			"

												When I read some of the reviews before I purchased this game stating that this is one the best RPG games they've played, I was skeptic. After finishing the game in 22 hrs, I can relate to Paul Sweeney's quote: ""You know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend."" And this is definitely not just a 'good' game, it's the best RPG game I've ever played. There, I said it.This game is certainly a William Gibson-esque reliving of the '80s cyberpunk outfit. The action, substance, intrigue-factor, progression, and variation of the story based on the player's choices are in equilibrium -- making this an authentic 'RPG' game, unlike some common so-called RPG games with messed up mechanics and usually follows an inescapable linear story. You may think 'side-quests' are optional on this game -- of course they are. But curiosity strikes iron and you'll end up wanting to finish all. So did I.I also like how they engaged some classic arcade elements and basic cryptography puzzles within a story-rich game. Need to say I recommend this? Okay, I recommend Dex.UPDATE: This game should get an ""I've Lost A Good Friend"" award.			"

												This game is just plain fun in every aspect of it.+ Combat is fun because there are many ways to kills: Melee (has combo to put down enemies, etc), guns, stleath such as takedown, and you can hack them for easy takedown (yes there is a skill that lets you stun enemies by hacking them). Also, the levels are made so you can avoid enemies.+ Story is awsome: Its fully voiced with greate disalogue and a good sense of humour+ Sound, graphics are all appealing.- Well, like any good game, it is always too short ;)			"

												This game is really good, voice acting aside, most of the dialogue and story is very well written, the cyberpunk word is interesting and well designed, the character progression is engaging and the gameplay fun, what else could we ask for?If you liked games like deus ex, this is like a 2d light version of that, been glued to the chair from the beggining.

												Difficult at the beginning, but once you understand the concept and controls, there are no problems with difficulty.Advice: level up your hacking skills first.Overall very nice game and it's way longer than I expected it to be, a pleasant surprise indeed.			"

												I have played this game from early access to what is now a finshed game, I think the only criticism about the game is that I wish the final release lasted longer because of how much fun it was to play. the game story is a lot like Deus Ex.  the graphics and colour tones work fantasicly to bring the world alive.  combat its a shame that in the final version they took out the ability to punch while crouched but I do understand that it was also a easy way to win fights as enemy AI couldn't counter atack, but over all the finshed combat is challenging and dynamic. I think the game would have been improved with some more missons before being taken to the final map area and the two final missions being more spread out would have been nice but that may have been because I finished all the side quests before doing that mission.

												Dex is a 2D sidescrolling action RPG, with a major focus on the RPG part. The game takes place in a cyberpunk environment and you play as a female android named Dex. From the start of the game you are on the run, being chased by some bad dudes in police riot gear. The only thing you are told is you need to meet a guy at some bar and which direction you need to run. FULL REVIEW HERE: http://snerdaperds.com/2017/03/dex/ "

												Dex is an example of when a developer makes an RPG the right way.  So many new developers are focusing on the wrong features like multiplayer, free to play etc... that they forget what makes a good game.  Dex may not have those shiny graphics but it has a lot of heart and is up there with some of the best rpgs.  In Dex you get a large open world to explore filled with interesting characters, meaningful side quests and dangerous enemies and loot.  The Environments are beautiful and dripping with atmosphere.  Its the gritty dark cyberpunk setting you can expect.  Gameplay is fun especially the augmentation feature.  You ll start to become an aug addict very soon wanting the next awesome implant to make yourself a badass cyborg.  The story is great and makes you very invested in the characters struggles.  I have enjoyeed every moment of the 12 hours i put into the game without fail.  In conclusion buy this game.  Its a shining example of RPGS done right and can even be said to be better than some AAA titles.  I only wish there was more to play and cant wait to see what the developers do next.			"

												I love this game. Don't let the 2D style trick you into thinking this isn't a full-fledged game, or that the story, atmosphere, or mechanics will leave you with something to be desired. But, don't also compare this to a game like Deus Ex as if they were the same. Dex brings the cyberpunk elements together in a way that I feel is stronger than it's parts. Each piece fits, even the hacking minigame is fun and engaging, which most cyberpunk games simply fail at.Give this game your money.			"

												Dex is suitably entertaining, and suitably cyberpunk although sometimes it seems like it cannot decide if it is The Matrix or not.  The game offers a few different playstyle choices, although since hacking and combat will always both be required the variety does not seem significant enough to warrent multiple playthroughs.In-game graphics are a little pixelly, but that's fine.  The voice-overs for the most part are well-done, with Dex and Decker's voices in particular doing a great job.  The hand-painted cutscenes are likewise really good for the most part.Dex was entertaining and engaging enough that I would be interested in seeing more.			"

												Dex impresses with a creative combination of roleplay and platformer gameplay, paired with a great story, plenty liberties of choices (with a few consequences in game), wonderful soundtracks, lively environment and appealing 2D art, innovative ideas and a 2 in 1 games feeling. Even the cutscenes were created with a big portion of love.It was surprising to find far less platformer gamestyle than expected and alot more story / RPG elements. The fairly dystopic cyberpunk genre has been interpreted and implemented with rich content elements, not only plenty of notes / ingame e-mails to read.The controls require some accustomization but once the player gets the hang of it, gameplay itself becomes fairly smooth. Map handling and relocation spoil the player some in a good and bad way. Health and Focus are two attributes of the played character. Regaining points in these attributes is treated in a rather unusual way to other games. Once familiar with that, exploring the game world and story becomes a true pleasure for friends of darker settings.Dex and the developers of Dreadlocks gave little to no reason to complain. In my eyes, this game is an underrated masterpiece of the cyberpunk genre and it ignites fun to grab the old character sheets of pen & paper cyberpunk again.			"

												This was great. For you old timers out there, this has a distopian future atmosphere like the Sega Genesis Shadowrun game, Beneath a Steel Sky, or even Neuromancer (old Apple, and other platforms, game). Gameplay wise the game was actually quite fun - if a little rough around the edges.But more than anything, I loved the story here. There is a distinct Act 1 and Act 2 feel here, and you don't see the Act 2 comming (I figured credits were going to roll long before we got to the good stuff), so kudos to the developer for that.If you are a Shadowrun (pencil and paper), Neuromancer (or really just a William Gibson in general) fan, I think you'll be all over this.

												Pretty competent game, nothing groundbreaking though. Not sure why everyone is complaining about the hacking, you can get away with throwing a few points into hacking early on, and once you have the pulsewave and dualshot (you can get them pretty fast) there is nothing difficult about it.Some complaints are the melee combat system being somewhat clunky, enemies have 'kick' moves they chain and it doesn't appear they can be staggerd in their animation. It's basically down to getting them by suprise and mashing X, whilst staying ahead of him. Ranged combat is ok, with the only problem (alteast on controller) being the lack of aiming sensitivity resolution.The soundtrack is pretty good, but the loops are not well implemented. You can clearly hear it looping.The singularity ending was a 5 second clip then credits, rather disappointing...But I enjoyed it, get it if you can. It's a solid 10-15 hours depending how much of a completionist you are.			"

												Dex is a very charming cyberpunk RPG. Not a masterpiece in storytelling nor gameplay, it still stands very well on its own. It has a satisfying wide range of sidequests, skill checks in dialogues, open world, enjoyable combat system and scratched my RPG itch. My only big gripe witht the game that it's only 20 hours long, instead of 40. Close to the end of the game I still wanted to play more and I guess that speaks well of the game I judged to be simply ""okay"" instead of ""amazing"".Even after half a year later I think back to Dex with an not insignificant amount of fondness and frankly absurd amount of longing. I very much hope for a sequel. This game has a lot of promise and I am very curious what the devs can do with the world of Dex.			"

												I agree with another reviewer that you really need to put some time into this game to appreciate its depth before leaving a review.  Almost all melee attacks can be blocked and most of the unblockable attacks can be avoided by evading/rolling.This game has a really indepth story with branching paths and multiple endings.  You can play strictly melee, ranged, stealth or a combination of each.  You hack into computers to gather intelligence and to disable security devices.  You can also hack into individual cameras to disable them and gun turrets to turn them on to your foes.The background artwork, music and voice acting are all outstanding.  I've completed the game twice to grab the achievements that I missed and to see the alternate ending.  Both plays were a blast.The hacking ability is a little tricky at first, but gets much better as you level the skill.  Be sure to grab the free costume add-on and install it before you begin.  One costume grants stealth after 6 seconds of no movement and does not break until you perform an action.  Moving does not break it.  Another allows you to block gun attacks with your normal block and the final costume passively fills your focus meter.I highly recommend this game and I look forward to the next offering from Dreadlocks.

Posted: March 6
												Dex is a nice game by dreadlocks that you would be wrong to think its small and simple but in fact it has a few surprises along the way and results in a positive experience . First and foremost, i have to comment about the general recommendation about this game, wich is ""if you loved flashback (the old game from delphine software) you would love Dex"" well...i have to say, i liked Dex, but i don't think is that much similar to Flashback... it has the sci fy setting allright, and there are data cubes (?) but that's all there is about that, the stories are very different and the game itself, is very very different. For starters, Flashback was an action adventure platformer...and Dex is an action RPG . They are both good games but different.The story for Dex is good...i mean, its ok....well...maybe not perfect, but it does it's job. It starts very classical, then somewhat slows in the middle, with all the side missions and staf, and then by the end, it goes full speed and allthough it develops fully, it does so very fast just in the last few levels. For me story wise, it happened too much at the end (maybe wasn't necessary to be honest) The thing is, there were many ""heavy dialog scenes"" and normally thats allright..but in this game where the characters speak through avatars (like a profile picture, that maybe opens it's mouth, moves a little, and thats it)  the problem is, it doesnt have a great range of expression, so, basically you are stuck just hearing the voice, and that slows down game play a lot (comparing it to others part of the game)Speaking of other parts, the game has great gameplay elements. You have your main character, and the abilities tree, similar to for example mass effect or any other rpg in wich you choose how you want to develop your character... so for example when you progress and make main missions and/or side missions and activities you gain xp points and you choose what you want to develop, your hacking computer skills? your biological implants? (does all kind of things) or just want to be the strongest at fighting? or a professional weapons expert ? maybe a mix of several....So, that part of the game (the gaming part itself) is really well done, and it's fun, and it has some character progression, even though, its not a AAA game, it does a very good job and its pretty well polished.Along with the third person view in wich you encounter friendly characters, and fight enemies, you have cyberspace. In this mode, you enter a computer and have to deal with firewalls and virus and failsafe programs (in shooting style) like a sort of space shooter game, with different powers and settings. This mode is for the most part optional...but...you can use it as an alternative for fighting...because every person in the game has robotic implants, you can hack into their minds, and paralyze them, and you take it down without even fighting. In my case i choosed to  develop all my hacking skills, and none of the fighting ones. So every time i entered a scene, first i hack the security cameras, then i did the same with the torrets, and finally i started going stealth and hacking soldier's brains and paralyze them ...it was great! allthough you can't do that with every one of them, there are some soldiers wich are partially immune to your attacks and you have to take them down classical style (with some stealth and fight).Anyway, because of all this when you reach the end game where there are many heavy dialog scenes, it kinds of slows down a little too much, and it looses momentum and the story really is good but not THAT good that it needs so much turns and surprises at the end... but still...its a nice little game and i recommend it if you don't have anything more important to play, and even better if you like cyber punk sci fy games.

												I just finished the game, and I personally think this game shouldn't be reviewed unless you finished the game, because the strong point of this game is in its story.The fightings isn't masterfully designed but this game isn't really about the fightings. I didn't really struggle as in any situations there is many ways to succeed.For those who struggle with the fighting system, just try those and keep in mind the game isn't about that, try to enjoy the rest : If you're going melee just observe the ennemies pattern, they are quite obvious, although sometimes annoying. If you're going guns, except if you got too much bullets, I'd recommend do a sweep kick or jump kick and shoot them on the floor, critical hits guaranteed.All in all, I had a good time. I recommend it.			"

												I wrote a first review based on the early state of the game. My opinion was that the game was awful, buggy and really not worth our money. I recentely installed it once more, and I found the game to be OK. The pace of the action is not very good, and the game mechanics are not very deep; for instance, there is no real difference in fighting early ennemies and the most powerful ones. The same strategy is applied; you just need more punches. The hacking part is a bit more insteresting, although it will never rival with half-decent shooters... but at least, it offers a variation of gameplay. The quests are fun to do, although you can completely mess up with some of them by doing things far too early.The story is interesting. I have to admit I did not anticipate what happens. However, I hate the endings (plural). For a game that is mostly trying to tell a story (since the other aspects are not so great), I hoped for more narrative endings.Overall, the game is OK to play if you have nothing else to do and a few bucks to spend.

												Really good game. Like an 'indy game' DeusEx with all the regular cyberpunk features.Personally, I liked the art style, but of course it's not a big studio HD-production. It has decent sound acting, though.The game has lots of little side plots to explore, which is nice. Equipment variety is a bit low, but the game still feels big enough. About 10h playtime.			"

												Ooookay, i just finished the game recently and these are my opinion towards Dex:Pros Nice 2D sice scrolling action rpg, the graphic itself is quite nostalgic yet not too flashy The difficulty is ""right"", i'm not a hardcore gamer anymore, so this kind of ""fast-paced"" game is good for white collar worker like me :p So many side quests Hacking mini game, just like space shooter games Good storyCons All the good things aside, WHERE IS THE STEAM CLOUD SUPPORT...I played hours on my office laptop only to realize it doesnt support cloud save... Dev team might need to implement a save point system instead of place-based Overall, it is a hidden gem i found and i am happy with my purchase :0			"

												I agree with another reviewer that you really need to put some time into this game to appreciate its depth before leaving a review.  Almost all melee attacks can be blocked and most of the unblockable attacks can be avoided by evading/rolling.This game has a really indepth story with branching paths and multiple endings.  You can play strictly melee, ranged, stealth or a combination of each.  You hack into computers to gather intelligence and to disable security devices.  You can also hack into individual cameras to disable them and gun turrets to turn them on to your foes.The background artwork, music and voice acting are all outstanding.  I've completed the game twice to grab the achievements that I missed and to see the alternate ending.  Both plays were a blast.The hacking ability is a little tricky at first, but gets much better as you level the skill.  Be sure to grab the free costume add-on and install it before you begin.  One costume grants stealth after 6 seconds of no movement and does not break until you perform an action.  Moving does not break it.  Another allows you to block gun attacks with your normal block and the final costume passively fills your focus meter.I highly recommend this game and I look forward to the next offering from Dreadlocks.

												If you're a fan of the cyberpunk genre, you NEED to check out this title. It's like playing a William Gibson novel. There is Corporate extractions, package couriering, hacking, cyberware mods, software upgrades, plus moral choices around every corner. Cyberpunk is so much more then hacking and cyberware, it’s the emphasis on technology in a class ruled multicultural society and this is what most games do wrong. However Dex with it’s simple 2D simple side scrolling game style, linear storyline and easy controls seems to capture the very essence of futuristic city life.			"

												I voted for this back when this was a humble Steam Greenlight Game. They had me at cyberpunk. I purchased it during its alpha stages back in Early Access to support the developers, but held off on playing till its official release. Happy I did.Gameplay is solid. The difficulty is brutal at times, but never ceases to enjoyable. Indie developer Dreadlocks Ltd. really delivered here. I look forward to future games from them and their publishers Badland Games, and Techland.			"

												I just finished the game, and I personally think this game shouldn't be reviewed unless you finished the game, because the strong point of this game is in its story.The fightings isn't masterfully designed but this game isn't really about the fightings. I didn't really struggle as in any situations there is many ways to succeed.For those who struggle with the fighting system, just try those and keep in mind the game isn't about that, try to enjoy the rest : If you're going melee just observe the ennemies pattern, they are quite obvious, although sometimes annoying. If you're going guns, except if you got too much bullets, I'd recommend do a sweep kick or jump kick and shoot them on the floor, critical hits guaranteed.All in all, I had a good time. I recommend it.			"

												Dex is a free-roaming cyberpunk action-adventure, a bit like Deus Ex in 2D. You take the role of a seemingly average jane living in the urban mess known as Harbor Prime, who like many a cyberpunk protagonist, suddenly finds herself wanted by armed thugs working for mysterious corpro-government interests. Fleeing for her life into the streets, Dex meets an assortment of colorful characters and must aquire various gear and eventually cyborg implants to stay alive and ahead of the game. Flexible character progression allows for melee, gunfighting, hacking, persuasion and cyborg enhancements like super-jumps and cloaking. It's got pretty good music and notably, a free DLC that adds extremely useful alternate outfits, most notably a stealth suit that allows you to stay cloaked indefinately provided you do not reveal yourself by attacking or interacting with objects.

												Decent distraction but a little clunky combat wise. Story ending leaves a lot to be desired.			"

												Fun side scrolling cyberpunk game with great atmosphere.  While it doesn't play like it, the feel of the game reminds me of the SNES Shadowrun game.  The dialogue can be a bit weak at times but overall its a very fun game and worth every cent.			"
