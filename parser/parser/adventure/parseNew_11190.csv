												So BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THIS GAME even though I did want to enjoy it, I need to point out some big problems about it:- Firstly, SAVE OFTEN AND SAVE PLENTY because the game has a bizarre bug that sometimes stops you saving and it has no autosave feature, even though this is a game from 2009.- Secondly, when you have to draw on a map and it tells you to draw an Ellipse, just try to do this exactly - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43253912/map-%2816-9%29.jpg - it is absurdly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t precise and I'm gonna save you a lot of hassle.- Thirdly, if you cannot load up the game for some reason, go to the PhysX folder inside the game's Steam folder and click on PhysX drivers.  Then click ""repair"" and it should work.  If not there is the Steam Community that gave me this advice.Now, the actual review of the game.  The world's most famous fictional detective versus the most infamous serial killer by name have finally come to blows in a strange blend between fantasy and reality in this game, and for what it's worth, the story is very well-composed concerning the killer's trail.As Sherlock and Watson, you must hunt down the murderous Whitechapel Killer following his deadly clues, reliving the famous incidents that granted Whitechapel a most deadly reputation for the next 130 years.  The voice acting could be better, though I do enjoy Watson's VA greatly as well as the odd incidental NPC wandering around.The anatomical gathering of clues and deductions are very fun and remain more or less the same throughout the series with a great precision.  Some of the puzzles are actually really neat, however there are some that are quite frankly badly conceived due to not being great puzzles.And I'm not saying that because I'm stupid, I'm saying that because, there is a puzzle in the game that requires you to know about a specific war.  That is really terrible, and any puzzle that requires outside knowledge, is a bad puzzle.  That's the only example, but there are some other puzzles that are rather unclear as to what to do.Thankfully, this series has gotten a lot better and I do recommend more people to play the much later instalments, especially The Testaments of Sherlock Holmes which is MUCH more well-played than this game frankly.  So TL;DRPros:- Excellent well-composed accuracy concerning the various details and theories of Jack the Ripper- Anatomical deductions are pretty fun to doCons:- The save bug which screwed me out of 6 hours of gameplay- One or two puzzles are either outright unfair in requiring knowledge of certain things, or demand INCREDIBLY specific tasks.Honestly, I want to give this game a Neutral rating as there's a lot to like but also a lot to dislike.  If you REALLY like Sherlock Holmes, try to get it and see what happens.  But for the love of God, save often.			"

												Take literature's most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, and make a crossover with the most feared serial killer of the Victorian London era, Jack the Ripper. Sounds awesome, right? Well, I think so since I'm a geek. For the most part, this was an enjoyable adventure game even with its flaws.+ Seriously, I've always thought this crossover would've been a great idea, glad to see it actually happened.+ The deduction boards were probably the best puzzles, at least in my opinion; they were fun and required some thinking.+ 1st person view addition, I already prefer this over 3rd person view for adventure games.+ Good story, provides some suspense and thrills through out.+ Not too challenging, and not exactly easy either. Progressive difficulty is done right for the most part.+ Analyzing victims is lots of fun lol.+ Dat ending.- Errands, bleh. I'm fine with that in GTA, Skyrim, etc. But here, not exactly the most fun time.- Graphics are crap for a 2009 game.- Every now and then, you'll find grammatical errors in the subtitles. It annoys me.- Voice acting isn't exactly the greatest.- Some puzzles are dumb; for example, why does Sherlock need a ""pivot"" and a stick to move a barrel? Is he weak? lol.- Some puzzles are annoying when it comes to registering your solution, such as the one where you narrow down Jack's ""comfort zone"" and the final deduction.If you're a fan of Sherlock, or interested in Jack the Ripper case, I recommend this. Heck, if you love mysteries, or enjoy solid adventure games, then get this game.			"

												Probably the most exciting Sherlock Holmes adventure ever made in video games.Though the visuals aren't perfect and some puzzles may not be as clear as they should be, the whole picture of the game seems more than satisfying, considering there's a bunch of surprising story twists to discover, and the ambience here is remarkable. Moreover, the gameplay itself also has a couple of aces up its sleeve to get one's attention during the playthrough. Gear up and bring two legends together while leading your own investigation of the case that terrified London in 1888. I strongly recommend you to.			"

												As a few other of the Sherlock series games this one just doesn't want to start properly. It freezes after the 'New Game' button is clicked and fails after you minimize it. Useless! Update! I did find the solution:Originally posted by swenor: Open Find and search for 'PhysXLoader64.dll' , it should be in your C:\...\Nvidia etc. folder. Copy the file and paste it in your game folder, where the .exe is. If you have a 64-bit version of windows, try pasting it in the C:\Program Files folder, since that is the 64-bit folder and the Nvidia folder is in C:\Program Files (x86). Have fun :)			"

												Do you like classic Victorian era Sherlock Holmes?Are you intrigued by the Whitechapel murders of 1888?Then you will love this game!Cleverly the game developers have meshed together these two iconic characters into one very plausible story. You play as Detective Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr John Watson either in first or third person perspective (depending on taste) as you investigate the five canonical victims of Jack the Ripper.While this game suffers from PS2/Xbox era graphics (It looked dated even at its time of release) it does however still manage to conjure up a very detailed, authentic, and atmospheric London of the period. Puzzles can be frustrating at times especially those that do not directly impact the murder cases themselves but overlook this fault and there is plenty to enjoy here. I would recommend this game and I give it a solid 8/10  "

												Without a doubt Frogwares' work is amazing. They unite two good things at least: games and old books.  I love their work SO much.Sherlock versus Jack, the Ripper is fanciful, but the game is good. Some details are not so good as in ""Crimes and Punishments"" because I believe C&P was made after S. vs J., but still is interesting and nice.Sometimes, if you are not aware of the previous dialogues or even if you are aware, you kinda don't know where to go or who to look for. It kinda misses a ""goal"" board, ""what to do next"" at certain parts, specially at Whitechapel area. You kinda have to interact with a lot of people or try to enter in a lot of places until you find your goal exactly. But it's just a minor thing.When you gather enough information to discover Jack's identity, it becomes even more fun.			"

												I think out of all the Sherlock Holmes games this had the darkest theme and story, the puzzles range from medium to a bit hard, but this is nowhere near as hard as awakening or Arsene Lupin VS Sherlock Holmes (Lupin is in my avatar :D) if you want a nice game where you are guessing all the way through who the killer is with decent puzzles this is the game for you, the characters are a bit blend compared to the other games but its still a must play for holmes fans			"

												I'd love to give this game a glowing review because it was great for me, but it is apparent from reading the forums that many people have issues running this game. For this reason, I'll supply my specs, though I cannot certify that this will make the game run for you:Win 7 64 bitRadeon HD 7770AMD quad core 2.94 ghzOn with the game,It's an adventure game with a few twists. First off, you can operate the game from two different perspectives: Third-person for the old school point and click feel, and first person, which I prefer.Besides the collecting items, you will have the opportunity to examine crime scenes and fill out some diagrams that include the clues you've gathered. The game won't let you fail these. Though at first thought that might seem lazy, the game is pretty much packed with detail and it's hard to see the devs making branching paths given the amount of attention and longevity of the game. Along the same lines the game also won't let you leave certain areas without collecting all the items.There are many texts to read in this game and I would say that it is important to read them, as most do divulge important information that is pertinent to your case.The voice acting, aside from one character who is thankfully absent for most of the game, is top notch. You can tell that, even though there was a budget as far as recording goes, the devs spared no expense for finding actors who wanted to portrey their roles well.The music is fitting and includes some great pieces from the Romantic era including one of my personal favs, Schubert's Trio in Eb.While the puzzles can be hit or miss, they mostly hit. They make sense and you should feel like you understand what the game wants from you, though there is one puzzle that involves a map that is somewhat obtuse given to a problem with widescreen resolutions, but it is do-able without much fussing about.Though the graphics aren't the best by today's standards they do the job. The environments are well done and I felt very immersed in the places the game put me in. Hookers, drunks and theives around every corner.All of these things came together for a perfect storm of presentation. Nothing felt out of place and I was enthralled with this title from beginning to end.If you're looking for an adventure title that'll suck you in you should definitely give this title a go, though you should do your research to figure out if it'll run for you.

												This game surprised me, and got me into the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games. I originally played it on Xbox 360 as a rental when it released, the Title caught my interest. Turned out to be a game I loved so much I bought it again on Steam. The PC version is far superior with the exception of the following, but don't let it sway you away, it can be corrected. It's not a broken game any means, just needs help on newer hardware when you first install. Some users (like myself) have an issue with the game mot loading initially: for most people this can be easily corrected by opening the game's folder (""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper\Support\PhysX"") and re-installing the two PhysX installers, and selecting the repair option if asked to by the installer for each one.Now.. about the game. This game has good performance and plays well on a rig that pumps 30 or 60+ FPS. The game looks great too. It may not blow you away graphically, but you can see the developers cared about quality. Little things - like tiny signs pasted to a brick wall are clear and easy to read, the smoke in pubs is realistic, the lighting and shadows are nice and mood-setting: little things like this you will notice as you play. I like this game's style.The game does have a few places where you can tell they were developing on a budget. Some of the NPC characters walking the streets are recycled, and so are their voices. To top that, the NPC townsfolk have some pretty lame voice overs. However, don't let this stray you! If you play the game like a proper Sherlock Holmes would, you'll soon find out these people are of no use to you, and just ignore them and focus on the case. The good news here, is that the NPC characters you have actual dialogue with in the game, all have pretty good voice acting. I actually like this balance, it made me laugh at the cheesy peasants in the streets as I strolled along to talk to my fancy doctor, merchant, and police colleagues and such. This gave me a real feel for the classic Sherlock Holmes arrogance, lol. Also, you get to have a laugh at prudent Wason in a brothel in the middle of the night, if you are into the books and know his character.The story isn't half bad either. I really liked the ending. Sure, if you want to be a real nit-picker or snob you could point out all it's imperfections... but you'd just be robbing yourself of a fun game that really did try to stay true to the source material and history, while providing a unique twist to preserve continuity.Play this game.

												As I have less, and less time to enjoy gaming as I grow older I am slowly gravitating towards a particular style of games. The common elements of these are:1. They must have a competent story.2. They cannot be very long, a 8-12 hours game works perfectly.3. They need to steadily provide me with enjoyment, and feeling I am working towards a goal.4. (optional) It is great to play games with my girlfriend, who enjoys mystery/puzzle games (we had lots of fun playing Professor Layton on a 3DS).So if you are in a similar situation, then this game will be right for you. It is a bit clunky, and you can see budget limitations, but Sherlock Holmes games were never made to be mass-appeal AAA games. The story in this one is fascinating, and there are some great gameplay mechanics, especially those related to deductions and recreations of Jack the Reaper murders.Nothing to say more. Grab it for 10EUR, or wait for Steam Sale to go even cheaper.			"

												WARNING NVIDIA USERS: The game might get stuck on the first loading screen the first time you start playing the game. If this happens, check the forum for fix. Worked for me. Very good game for it's time and on level with the rest of the good part of this series.The voice actors and music are the same as in previous games; decent to good, nothing terrible in voice acting but a few random volume/quality changed from sentence to sentence some times.The story follows Sherlock Holmes as he investigates the brutal murders of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Whatechapel, London. The game is slightly less gory and bloody than other games in the series, mostly because the murder victms you inspect are drawings and dolls, and not 3d-models, which gives a completely different feel; but then again you may not want to see models of women with their guts and organs ripped out and face cut open, so a pretty good design choice. Still not a game safe for children. The game visits both new places and a few places known from other game in the series. The puzzles still give no clues about how they are to be solved, which can be frustrating. There is no failure state in this game, so no real reason to save often (thought there is no autosave, so do save if you plan to closing the game), and the game never crashed for me.The game does not rely as heavily on document-reading as the previous ones and there's no quiz or direct minor questions asked to chekc if you're paying attention. You may have to read up to solve a few of the puzzles though.			"

												I am playing and reviewing Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series in chronological order of the games. Even though this game is the fifth installment this game seems to precede The Awakened & Nemesis in terms of chronological narrative. This is seen in this installment we are introduced to Barnes the book store owner as if for the first time while he was a known character in the last two. Otherwise this game could be played by itself since this deals with the actual events of the Jack the Ripper case instead of many fictional characters in the series. This game was very well presented that checking up on some of the minor details I am surprised how well Frogware presented a plausible answer to the Jack the Ripper mystery.The game isn't completely full of perfect creations. Some of the puzzles are so insanely hard with no real indication of feed back or clear instruction is just guess work. In addition to this, alot of the quests felt like one giant errand run tangent from one person for the next to get some basic clues. The ending ties the fictional resaults of Sherlock Holmes and the real life outcome of the case which was indeed very intresting. If a bit disapointing. Overall this game is good but not great. It definately calls back to the horrific acts done in The Awakened. The ending is more than enough to play though the game to see how it all ties together.			"

												I joined Steam recently and this was one of the first games I purchased. I have since completed the game and I love the depicted Victorian era and British English.Growing up reading Sherlock Holmes novels, his methods of deduction remains elusive to me. This game guides you to solving the mystery from a first-person perspective of Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Watson.I have read reviews lamenting that the game play leans more towards running errands for NPCs. But I think it introduces the player to the NPCs. And running errands build up trust between them, hence the inclination to provide information that they otherwise would not tell the police.In particular, the story is congruous with the alleged crimes by Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel. The ending is great and characteristic of Sherlock Holmes' eccentricity. All in all, the story unfolded at a pace that kept me tether to the screen. Good job, Frogwares!			"

												This is a rather nice adventure game. The puzzles are of adequate difficulty and the items required are most of the time easy to find. I really like the choice between 1st person with keyboard (WASD) movement and 3rd person mouse-driven movement, although I played the entirety of the game in 1st mode. This game in general pays great respect to the source material and succesfully incorporates the story of ""Jack the Ripper"",  employing a variety of elements from the real life events. Furthermore,  with the satisfying duration for this game it feels as if you get your money's worth. The deduction board and timelines really feel like actual detective work without access to modern advances and feel very much in-place with a Holmes game. The Holmes-Watson dynamic is also well utilized in this game to make for this elements of Holmes's stories that attracts such fandom.The game has some minor problems, but nothing that spoils your fun. Some of the NPC voice acting is not good, but this is rare and it is limited to random ""area populating"" NPCs. Some puzzles would really be easier with an explanation, because you are hindered from advancing not due to actual puzzle difficulty but due to not understanding the rules or limitations in interacting with the computer game. There is also a puzzle that requires some encyclopaedic knowledge that cannot be found in-game (US civil war battles).Personally, without spoiling it for you, I found the ending a smart way to compromise between a videogame structure and the actual unfolding of the events. If you engage in ""ripperology"" as a hobby, you might strongly disagree with it, but hey, it is just a game.Overall, if you are a Holmes or Jack the Ripper stories fan, I would recommend this game. Personally, I waited until this game was bundled, but if you are a fan of other Frogware games, this is a solid purchase.			"

Sherlock Holmes Vs Jack The Ripper			* 7/10If ""The Awakened"" was the most disturbing and dark chapter of the saga I have to say this one is the most raw chapter because of the crimes we're called to investigate: Jack the Ripper's victims.This chapter is kind of chilling if compared to the previous ones and poor Dr Watson's stomach or patience is often tested. At a certain point even Sherlock Holmes remains speechless when confronting the last victim corpse. Nothing excessively gruesome is being shown but it's all about Jack the Ripper, a formidable figure of whom nobody knows or saw anything for sure and you must investigate deeply to find the way to the truth behind his identity and nature.Just like the previous chapter this is a point'n'click adventure, originally designed in 1st person View, but now presented with the possibility to play in 3rd person view and obviously with a remastered Graphic. The interface is almost the same as in previous titles but there's few very important innovations in this chapter's gameplay which have quickly become the key moments that best represent a game dedicated to Holmes and Watson adventures: The deduction schemes, reconstructions and experiments. The best inno are simple moments that require you to order your ideas and clues, link them and choose the right conclusions to better understand the next direction for your investigations. Reconstructions involve both Holmes and Watson trying to replicate the murder after a accurate analysis of the crime scene and the corpse. Experiments are exactly what the name says, simulation of situations or reactions to determine the murder weapon or other particular conditions or clues. These innovations are implemented in the classic gameplays elements so there are dialogues, riddles and puzzles, and errands... maybe a bit too many errands, compared to the previous chapters, but I liked the gameplay so much that I simply didn't mind too much.They didn't waste too much effort in music as there are still the classic melodies from the previous chapters and one or two new tracks, but still they fit as they rarely pretend to stand in the gameplay unless the cutscene requires it to better represent the events.The game takes place once again in London but this time we won't see any of the great marvelous buildings so typical of the city, but we'll be wandering back and forth in Whitechapel, the most squallid neighbourhood which is well represented as it's full of life with people and workers wandering on the roads, beggars, streetwalkers (seems like pro stitutes is a censored word... -.-), ill people and whatever. The Remastered engine shows nicely the alleys we'll be visiting (even though it has some heavy loads moments due to and excessive abuse of effects on water and reflections) but we won't be able to admire any particular example of level design except for some occasional office or internal ambients.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. The gameplay always show great interesting riddles and puzzles, but now has been seriously improved with some new mechanics such as the deductions schemes, reconstructions and experiments, and these sections best reflect and represent a Sherlock Holmes adventure. STORY. Well this chapter is about chasing a mysterious figure the likes of Jack the Ripper and while I can't say nothing about it because spoilers I can say that your investigations will show a side of London you haven't seen before: Poverty, prostitution, disease, haunted Jewish community  and so on. ENGINE. The original engine has been remastered and improved and even though it hasn't improved any models it has improved textures and other details such as water reflections.---CONs--- WHAT'S NEXT? Yes, the whole game is guided, it tells you where to go next, who should we speak next and this is fine. The proble is in certain moments where you're trying to reconstruct scenes or examining clues and you need to perform a particular action but there's no explanation about it (and I'm not talking about riddles and puzzles but proper sections or mechanics which are not properly explained or requires a millimetric precision - see maps or Watson with the lantern) HEAVY ENGINE. Well, honestly I've been able to walk around without any issue but the water and reflection effects that are so much improved are almost never seen and still you can feel them as when you're near one of the couple of the barrels in the whole game the frame rate will drastically drop. And no, my video card isn't outdated... "

												Amusing game. The puzzles range from easy to ""Oh my god how is anyone supposed to do this"". It's a silly little game for anyone who's a fan of classic Holmes and the newer BBC series if you're in too deep. Trivial tasks are frequent, but necessary in order to progress in the story. That being said, the game sometimes feels childish but has adult elements. This game isn't for everybody but has charm similar to the ""Nancy Drew"" series.			"

												Despite a lackluster beginning, the burden of silly ""adventure game"" tropes, and one or two unreasonable puzzles, this is an enjoyable story.  Building the case piece by piece is a pleasure, and though progress feels plodding at times, the deduction mechanics are great fun, and it all builds to a satisfying conclusion.  The plot didn't dazzle me with its cleverness, but it did cast a suitably horrifying light on the awful crimes committed by the villain.  A diverting way to spend a few evenings.			"

												I have played my fair share of point and click adventures and this one is one of my most loved. The story is darker then most of the Sherlock games but gives the right feeling for the actual case. After that is said they also rap it up in a pleasing way with full respect for the actual events. The game play is a little clunky for now a days standers and same applies for the graphics, but that dose not take away from the overall experience. its just plain fun.  I would recammend this to anyone looking to play a good adventure game or anyone that is a fan of the famous Sherlock Homes. I hope you enjoy.			"

												The game is intresting as it looks at the past as use a mix of fiction and reality (Easy to guess which is which.) , There are parts which makes you go ""Ah,"" or want to bring up the last thing you ate, ( Maybe it's my weak stomach) But i would say any sherlock fan should play.Sidenote - Slight problem with saving at points however was easily fixed.

												Enjoyable.  A couple of the puzzles are poorly constructed, and one in particular requires out-of-game research into American civil war history.The writers have a really good story to tell, but I feel like they're very limited by the game engine and technology.Play it for the story.  Then play the Cthulhu cross-over game.  That one is MUCH better.			"

												A very atmospheric and challenging game.  The graphics are not the best, but once you are hooked by the story, they are no longer an issue.  The idea of investigating true, historical murder scenes is really chilling.  Whtechapel quickly becomes eerie and claustrophobic.  The game does involve a fair bit of reading, but the texts are well written, on the whole.  I am sure many will go from here to discover more about the Whitechapel Murders!			"

												This game might be more of a detective game than a horror game, but with how bad the 7th victim was, it could definitely pass as one.  One puzzle left me stuck for over 30 minutes, but it was still fun and challenges.  And they came up with a clever way to keep the ending historically accutate.			"

												This is a pretty good adventure game with some major flaws.First, the 3D engine is just hideous. The lighting looks awful and the characters cast no shadows - that looks really bad especially at night. I don't think that was acceptable even in 2009.Second, some mini games are incredibly confusing. It wouldn't hurt to give us some instructions, you know?However the investigation is a lot of fun, dialogues are well written and the story overall is pretty interesting.			"

												Sherlock Holmes may not be the best in Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series, but I definitely think it's the most interesting of the lot. Where most games in the series are based in fiction, Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper is based on actual history, and it sticks to it surprisingly well. Almost every character in the game was an actual person involved in the case, and the game follows a possible interpretation of the events (which, interestingly, actually goes against Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's own theory which speculated that the Ripper could actually be female) pretty closely. The Whitechapel regions are also recreated fairly well, though they do reuse a lot of obvious models from the previous games in order to fill the larger street population.This does cause the potential issue of it not being interesting enough, however; the game is historically accurate enough that it does a pretty effective job of killing the mythological status that Jack has gained through most works of fiction about him, which may or may not disappoint fans of his story - this game is very much a story of the man, rather than the legend. The real-life inspiration also leads to the game being a bit less gorey than previous games like Sherlock Holmes: Awakened, with most of the corpses in this being replaced by slightly tamer drawings to give respect to the real victims - the final victim isn't even shown on screen except in a clay replica back at Holmes's office, due to the extent of damage that the real-life Ripper did to her. Overall, while I can't say this game is my favorite in the series, it's still pretty great, and while its portrayal of the Ripper might not please everyone, I thought it was interesting to see the case from a historic perspective instead of being heavily fictionalized.

												this game is AMAZING :Di probably will not talking about the general gameplay, since i already talk about it on my review of The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, quite the same gamplay, the same point and click mechanic, but i'll review it from story wise,how it progress, and the additional puzzle mechanicwell, we all know about the infamous Jack the Ripper, in this game, Sherlock tried to uncover who is behind the infamous character of Jack the Ripper who terrorize whitechape's area or probably whole city of Londonnot like The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, this game start off quite boring, with typical gameplay and story which is unknown how to unfold yet, now as it progress, the story become complicated, deep and involving multiple character, which is some have relation whith Jack the Ripper and some not, but, it give nice additional side-storynow what i love the most on this game is the investigating stuff and puzzle, in this game you really feel like ""real"" investigating!, you not only have deduction board, but you have a timeline board, which is to help dedeuction based on time, and you can even reenact the crime at the crime scene, with your dear friend John Watson as the victim.and the puzzle, much more better than The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, here the puzzle more variatif and more fun, although theres some puzzle that lack of explanation which is can become quite confusing, the example is the puzzle on lockpick prison door, it actually quite obvious to be honest, but it lack of response to player, thus its not clear wether we doing it right or wrong, just pure luck or trial and errorthe story in this game unfold much more better than The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, here its chronological plot take progress quite slow, but unfold really, really nice, i have no complain about it, i really enjoy it through out my gameplay, even the ending quite ""weird"" i think, but the explanation in the end really satisfyingfrom the graphical wise, this is a quite old game, release on 2009, the graphic is ok, the same with the voice acting, not expecting much anywaythe verdict is, i give this game 9 / 10, am i reccomend this game for you?, ABSOLUTELY YES			"

												After a string of mediocre or downright terrible adventure games, Frogwares inexplicably made one of the best I've ever seen. Sure, you still have some of the now cliched puzzles involving items or sliders, but the focus of the game is DETECTION, because Sherlock Holmes, they realized suddenly, is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed detective. So you put together timelines, draw on maps, organize suspects, steal evidence, go over pages and pages of documents -- it's great, and you really FEEL like you're solving a mystery, unlike most mystery adventure games where you're solving a 15 puzzle. Buy it.			"

												This game crashes on win10 so much that at one point it stopped launching. I cannot play this game at this time. It has some issues about saving system too. Sometimes the game doesn't let you save and if the game crashes all the work you put in will be gone. I played this game approximately 8 hours and almost half of it due to the lost achivements caused by crashing. Plus it has so much unnecessary tasks that makes you forget you're playing a detective game and trying to solve a murder case. This makes gameplay way longer than it should be. In conclusion, if you have a new computer with win10 don't buy it. If you don't like to do irrelevant task all the time, don't buy it.			"

This will not work. Don't bother trying to run the game in compatibility mode either because it also won't work. I am warning you now, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME or any other game from Frogwares. Nothing you try will get this game to run on your machine. This is simply, in the purest sense of the phrase, a WASTE OF MONEY. Take a ten dollar bill out of your wallet and set it on fire. It will provide more action and excitement than you will ever get out of watching the load screen of this game followed by your task manager.			"

After 30 minutes of frustrating over solutions I realized one thing.  The game should not be getting it to run, it should be the god damned game itself.  I can't even return the game.  There isnt even an option!  I would love to play this game, I really would.  But unfortunately with the trouble and lengths I have gone to to fix this piece of crapware I am just too tired to play it anymore!  Screw this!  Total negative.  If the Devs or support want to talk to me to help me fix the problem, fine, but god damn it fix the god damned game so I can play it!For those of you who will ask, I press new game, it goes to the ""load screen"" and then freezes.  And hangs for minutes on end.  I have only once gotten to a point where I can see a newspaper clipping, after that point, nothing.  I am so done with it.			"

												This game is the first one from that Humble Bundle I played. Too bad this game set the bar too high, and made the other Holmes games look less appealing. Especially the older games.Having said that, the game is a fine game, and one which I hope Frogwares continues to build as a standard of quality.Basically, you solve various crimes committed by Jack the Ripper. Each case brings you closer to the killer, to which his methods are ever so questionable. Still, Holmes does need to do his job, and solve this case.Like from ""Holmes: Awakened"" and ""Holmes: Nemesis"", you still have Holmes Vision and teleportation. In this game, you'll be doing a lot of travelling around the town where the deaths occur. And you'll be analysing the scenes to extract clues and what not to help gain much information about the killer.One of the key aspects of the game is the ""development tree"" part, these are parts where, like the quizzes in ""Holmes & the Silver Earring"", you need to connect certain parts of the case together to create new information.Unlike ""Holmes & the Silver Earring"", you're told what you got wrong or right, and for the global ""development tree"" for the case as a whole, you can complete it as you go, or all at the end.Characters are interesting in terms of their roles, ranging from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, to Jewish locals to the town doctor, they all provide some aspect of information relevant to the case. You even get to see Jack the Ripper's scenes prior to his killings, which are from his perspective, which adds more mystery to the case on hand.Interface is still consistent with ""Holmes: Awakened"" and ""Holmes: Nemesis"", though I don't recall if there was an in-game guide, like those games named. You can also switch between first and third person perspectives, which does help find certain clues in the overworld.And running is toggled on and off using Shift (or was it Spacebar?), meaning getting around places is slightly faster tha previous games.Thematically, the game is a mixed bag. I mean, there's a part where you find out about Dr. Tumblety's collection, consisting of female private parts and he shows them off the other men, and another part when you fool the local gang into giving you information. Certainly, a bunch of different themes make this an engaging game, because when you're not analysing crime scenes, you're probably solving an actual puzzle or talking to a drunk reporter.Overall, this would be a solid 9/10. Sure, the ending is fictitious, but at least it made sense.But I'd have to say, finding Jack the Ripper's house has to be the worst puzzle in this game. You know, the one where you have to circle his whereabouts on a map. Yeah, that one.			"

												Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper is a bit of a mixed bag. obviously the game centers around the legendary and and notorious slayings of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in whitechapel,london in 1888 and the famous fictional detective charater sherlock holmes. The game is from 2009 and its a point and click adventure that has its ups and downs. The graphics are ok and sets the atmosphere of victorian london well. The story is gripping as the true events and thats propably what kept me playing this game to the end. The game works pretty well at some points and has a level that is interesting to solve on other times the puzzles seem insanely difficult to solve. i have in the past back in the days (on amiga & mid 90'ies pc) played alot of adventure point and click games like monkey island, dark seed, phantasmagoria and so on. but this one has some practically unsolvable puzzles that in my opinion should have been dumbed down a bit, well its not that they are unsolvable but several 20 numerical codes will take an unreasonable time to solve atleast. well i i wasnt interested in spending hour upon hours on some of those codes so i honestly used a walktrough for some parts of the game and even then these codes was a hazzle to say the least. Besides from some of the puzzles and the mechanics i had problems with the game on different fronts as the game sometimes froze it wouldnt save on regular basis and i played it on a pc from the time of its release so i had to keep saving the game as often i would remember as i forgot it a couple of times and had to replay 2-3 hours of gameplay a couple of times. As i said it has its ups and downs but unless you are really interested in sherlock holmes or jack the ripper or for that sake point and click adventures i would not rcommend this game at all and im sure there's way better point and click adventures at the market. But i had some joy with it but wont rate it higher than 5.5-6/10			"

												Despite what Steam says I have completed 3/4 of SHvJtR ... then SHvJtR crashed taking me back a long way. I tried again taking an hour to replay through all the puzzles I had already solved. Knowing that the game was probably going to crash again I tried to save repeatedly but it turns out the save-function fails past a certain point. SHvJtR crashed again at the same point (at Liz Stride's murder scene). I gave up.Some other points:- inspired by actual history: yay?- The graphics are bad and look even worse with age. - unskippable dialogue- what are you supposed to do most of the time? No clear direction about what you can do.- Voice Acting is OK- puzzles are either OK or bad- Combine the Hammer and Tongs together in your inventory because. You have this and many other stupid inventory puzzles that make almost no sense.- many puzzles are find-the-missing-object-which-is-always-in-the-background-but-not-active-until-after-a-random-conversation-laterSHvJtR is not all bad, it's just that Frogware's latest Sherlock games are much better.  Save yourself the disappointment and buy a recent Sherlock Holmes game instead. I really enjoyed The Testament of Sherlock Holmes.			"

												I want to recommend this came so badly, but I simply can't. After almost 20 hours in, I'm left with a dismal choice: leave the game running constantly because it WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO SAVE or turn it off and lose all the progress I've made since the ONE AND ONLY SAVE POINT IT ALLOWED IN THE ENTIRE TIME  I WAS PLAYING. I chose to lose the progress and turn it off. I'm not going to be going back in to finish it, either. It does not allow you to save. Period. There's no fixing it. If it  happens to you, your choices are thus. Play it at your own discretion and patience.			"

												This Sherlock Holmes adventure game is a step above the previous entry from these Developers, ""The Awakened"" but ultimately it is still frustrating, awkward, and unfun.I love adventure games and Sherlock Holmes, so I was feeling pretty motivated to slog my way through the slow or frustrating parts, but in the end the problems with the game defeated me.Firstly, I had the same problem that I experienced with The Awakened, in that every time to load up the game, I freeze at a black screen for about 5 minutes, though the game plays well after that. I tried all the suggested fixes from the forum, including copying PhysX DLL files to the game's directory, but I was never able to solve this issue.The gameplay itself is alright, but you will find yourself mostly doing petty fetch quests, and solving poorly-explained, awkwardly designed puzzles. There's also the issue that often crops up when games are developed by non-English speakers, as some of the writing is just odd, sounds off, or in some cases just plain don't make sense.Lastly, you can switch between first and third person to navigate the world, which is good, since something about these Frogrwares games gives me immediate nausea in the first-person persepective.I wanted to like this game, I tried to like it, but in the end I had to admit I don't like it very much at all.

												Probably the best Sherlock Holmes video game available as of the present, a must buy for any fan of the world famous detective as this instalment pits him against the most infamous serial killer of the 19th century, Jack the Ripper. The story is a lot more darker and horrific than your usual Sherlock adventure but that's to be expected considering what the content matter is and it will be a roller-coaster ride as you try to figure out who Jack the Ripper is, with twist and turns right up to the amazing ending that I wouldn't have predicted in a million years. Please bear in mind that this game is a point and click adventure so expect puzzles, of which are a mixture of different difficulties, some you be able to solve yourself, others you may need the help of Wikipedia, while others you may need a walk-though.

												Interesting game, but there's a lot of bugs. I just lost 2 hours of gameplay (I assumed autosave was a thing...) due to a major crash of the software. The mouse stutters and lags a lot at certain points. At this time, the mouse failed, I had to swipe the mouse over the pad three to four times to reach the requested marker in the game, and then it crashed.It's a very nice story and I enjoy the enviroment a lot, but it's a ♥♥♥♥ing crash fest. Now I remember why I uninstalled the game in June 2014 (which was my last save, that I had to come back to, since the game crashed...). Do not buy the game, it's not stable.			"

												I enjoy the deduction aspects of this game, but it gets really frustrating often due to bad controls and wonky cues. The controls for walking around are ridiculously clunky. Using items is a hassle as half the time you have to equip an item then click on something to use it, and the other half you can use the item automatically. Some times when you click an item or location, it doesn't even describe what the item is. The game is difficult, but often for the wrong reasons and it's frustrating. I've heard good things about the Sherlock series, and hopefully the other games aren't like this.			"

Luckily there is a image of how do it to be accepted in the community discussions here on steam)- Some puzzles are kinda silly to even exist- Graphics and voice acting are ""meh""A good game, worth the time to play it but low replay value.

												I don't usually write reviews, but I loved this game. It's as close to the ripper murders of 1888 as you will find. The puzzles were a tough challange, but the game was fun. The artwork was outstanding as well as the voice acting and music. I had one problem with my resolution, which through my own investigation was solved. When I got to the second murder scene, I could not click on all of the evidence hot buttons, and could find no answers from the internet discussions and no reply from Frogwares, the developer. If  no resolution is found, you can't proceed. If this happens to you, do the following:Go to your steam games folder under Common/sherlock holmes vs. jack the ripper/Game folder. Scroll down in the Game folder untill you see Render/fixed_aspect_ratio = false    Change the false to true, and save. You should now be able to enjoy the game after restarting. Here is the info again:Steam LibraryCommon sherlock holmes vs. jack the ripperGame   - open with notepad and scroll down to[Render]fixed_aspect_ratio = false            change false to true         and then save.

												As a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, and having played some of Frogware's previous games in the saga, I bought this game on a sale for just $2.49, and if you can get it at that price, I heavily recommend you do.The adventure game focuses on the murders of low-class sex workers in Whitechapel, London, by an individual known by the public as ""Jack the Ripper"". Here, you control (alternatively) Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in order to investigate these murders and catch the person responsable. You can play in either 3rd person, point-and-click manner, or in 1st person. The game presents you with all sorts of puzzles that you must solve in order to progress through the immersive story. I've found many of these puzzles to be rather confusing and certainly difficult, and had to resort to using walkthroughs in order to solve them. And in one occasion, I had to draw an elypsis on a map, which despite having done so many times, the game wouldn't register as correct. So I had to go online an download a save file, or otherwise start all over again.Despite the problems mentioned above, I greatly enjoyed my hours playing this game, and do recommend anyone who is a Sherlock Holmes or adventure games fan, to get it.

												I love the Frogwares game series based on Sherlock Holmes. I am a Sherlock Holmes fan, a Lovecraft fan and deeply interested in Ripper-lore as well, and if I didn't know better I'd think that Frogwares are going out of their way to please me.The games are by no means perfect, and this one is no exception, but if you are as into the protagonist and subject matter as I am, you'll forgive the flaws.The pros:-The voice acting for the characters of Holmes and Watson are very close to how I have always imagined them from the stories-The story is very well researched; the developers have obviously spent a lot of time collecting materials and connecting them with the story as it unfolds. This also means that, like the other Holmes games from Frogwares, there are lots of documents to read. That may be a plus or minus, based on your preference.-It feels like you are actually solving the crime in a good whodunnit-The conclusion is far from the worst take I have seen. And for the most part, I think the game treats the evidence astutely.-The puzzles related to the murders (decuctions, conclusions etc.) are fun, if rather easy.The cons:-The game is very linear and holds your hand a lot of the time. When you need to check out a new location, Holmes will tell you precisely that, whether it was obvious or not. And you can't leave locations until your work there is done (""No, I haven't discovered everything yet""), nor can you go back to locations where your work is already done (""I have no reason to go that way""). It would make the game a lot more challenging - and immersive - if you were allowed to go wherever you pleased. That would make the game a lot harder, of course, and the first play-through would certainly take a lot longer.-The puzzles in this game are for the most part arbitrary and irrelevant to the case (fix a gas leak, fixing an electric winch by connecting wires , fishing out a necklace from between floorboards in a slide puzzle etc.), though challenging and entertaining enough-Some puzzles are just... odd (""Oy vey, I would lend you my mask, but unfortunately it is in that cobra cage for some reason, so you will have to figure out a way to get the snake out first""). Brings a bit of levity to the game, though.-Tedious errands (""I will tell you what I know if you do such and such for me"")-The quality of the voice acting varies.Still, all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, warts and all, and if your interests are at all similar to mine I can definitely recommend it.

												Pitting England's most prolific fictional detective against it's most notorious real life serial killer seems an obvious fit and even more surprising when both Holmesian lore and the actual murder case are done justice. Investigating the crime scenes, gathering clues and discovering the how's and why's of the whodunit are genuinely intriguing, at times even unbearably creepy. When not on your investigation it's a hokey puzzle game full of fetch quests and vague, rigid solutions that at best hold your hand until you answer it correctly. The blame and praise lay solely on it's halfhearted developer Frogwares for not pushing the material past puzzle game fare into adventure territory. Add to this a nonsensical ending and the game's limitations are impossible to overlook. There's this rich Victorian environment to explore, an evocative dichotomy of good and evil in Holmes and The Ripper, but while true to the material and often engaging there's no real cat & mouse in the chase.

However, there's advice on how to do this in the game's forum.2) Saving will occassionally malfunction. In this case I recommend you restart the game right away because the game is likely to crash sooner or later. At least that was the case for me. My advice is to save often to avoid losing lots of progress.3) Ellipses should be wider than needed. You'll understand eventually what that means.			"

Pretty solid story and the way we reach the Ripper's identity is satisfying in that we get to examine a bunch of real suspects that are doing weird and often illegal actions, but aren't actually the perpetrator of the Ripper crimes.The game was able to give me a real sense of the brutality of the murders near the end and the investigation parts were better than the other two games I mention. I also liked the puzzles.I also liked the end sequence with the Ripper as a concept, but it lacked a bit in execution.I had a couple of issues:- the ellipse needs to be wider- don't switch accounts or to Desktop because the save might stop functioning after a while "

												I've played Nemesis, Awakened, Silver Earring (although never finished that one...), even the Mummy and the Persian Carpet. Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper is most definitely the best one out of all of them. The developers learned a lot along the way and it shows. Thumbs up!			"

												Well, this game is an engaging investigation so I gladly recommend it even if I encountered a couple of annoying bugs. Twice I just couldn't pick up the objects needed to complete a puzzle or an investigation (even if they were highlighted by pressing the space key) so -at the end of my rope- I have been forced to use downloaded saved games to override those points. These bugs seem to be related somehow to widescreen video resolutions so be aware of that before buying (or just grab saved games from the internet and enjoy the game).			"

												Quality of writing very high on this game.Difficulty of puzzles varies wildly, needed walkthough in a few spots.Dated appearance but still very worth the ride for such a good story.			"

												This game was amazing to play! There are some good facts, as well as lots of fiction. It took me 8 hours to complete the game, and I did have to use a walkthrough for some puzzle solutions! I believe some of the gore may have been removed from this release, but generally this game takes you through the mind of derranged serial killer, and doesn't hold back on the details!			"

												Overall a good game, fun and decently challenging without becoming frustrating.+ Some puzzles (deduction, analysing the scene) are very funny+ Good difficulty, never frustrating (except the yellow ellipse in the puzzle of deducting Jack ""comfort zone"" cause the map on widescreen create some problem for Sherlock to accept your work. Luckily there is a image of how do it to be accepted in the community discussions here on steam)- Some puzzles are kinda silly to even exist- Graphics and voice acting are ""meh""A good game, worth the time to play it but low replay value. You could probably prefer to buy it when on discount.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but I loved this game. It's as close to the ripper murders of 1888 as you will find. The puzzles were a tough challange, but the game was fun. The artwork was outstanding as well as the voice acting and music. I had one problem with my resolution, which through my own investigation was solved. When I got to the second murder scene, I could not click on all of the evidence hot buttons, and could find no answers from the internet discussions and no reply from Frogwares, the developer. If  no resolution is found, you can't proceed. If this happens to you, do the following:Go to your steam games folder under Common/sherlock holmes vs. jack the ripper/Game folder. Scroll down in the Game folder untill you see Render/fixed_aspect_ratio = false    Change the false to true, and save. You should now be able to enjoy the game after restarting. Here is the info again:Steam LibraryCommon sherlock holmes vs. jack the ripperGame   - open with notepad and scroll down to[Render]fixed_aspect_ratio = false            change false to true         and then save. You are good to go. Cheers!			"

												a real nice little gem of a point and click mystery adventure.not only manages the game to perfectly recreate the atmosphere of the london slums from the 19th century, it also is one of the few games i know in which you actually do detectiv work, instead of just clicking senselessly around.you have to investigate crime scences, interview witnesses, make murder profiles, conclude plans and combine clues.you can also change between a ""classic"" point & click movement to a w-a-s-d movement.story and voice actors (at least german ones) are great too.the game is allready an old one, so mind the poor grafics and a few bugs, but nothing game braking. the most annoying thing i encountered is, when you have to draw a cirlce on a map to encicrle the area of murders, and the walktrough only show you the solution for low resolution desktops. so you will have to draw the circle a bit bigger on modern desktops (see steam forum for this).otherwise, really great game.

												As a lover of point and click adventures, I'm ashamed to say that I'd never played a Sherlock Holmes game before. So in an effort to correct this, I started playing Versus Ripper without much pre-knowledge of what the gameplay or quality of the game was actually like. Oh boy, was I in for a surprise?I loved this game. Although some of the production values may now be rather dated, I feel that they added to the charm. The puzzles weren't difficult, but just hard enough to make you feel that you actually had something to solve. While the voice acting over all was nothing compared to a AAA nowadays, the characterizations of Holmes & Watson perfectly fit into everything you could wish for. The Ripper story itself took a fascinating perspective on the historical events.Apparently this is one of the best of the Sherlock games, so it's all downhill for me from here (though I'm definitely going to play through the whole series), but I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody that likes point and click adventures, murder mysteries, or just generally doesn't need AAA production values to appreciate a game.

												Sherlock Holmes, one of my favorite fictional detectives! This game is pretty neat, sometimes you control Holmes, sometimes Watson. Graphics are good, voice acting is good, and the music is good. Puzzles are quite hard and sometimes illogical. Alot of walking/going back and forth (or fast travel if you use the map) involved, but it's an adventure game. Most adventure games should involve walking.I did run into the not saving issue. Now, I was playing it under Wine on my Mac; (happened to have the Mac version of Steam running in the background) To fix the issue, I minimized Sherlock, closed the Mac Steam, maximized Sherlock and it allowed me to save. Also, I noticed the game cursor had disappeared, only the system cursor was showing. Game cursor had reappeared after I minimized/maximized the game.All in all, a pretty good game. I like it!			"

												I finished this today, I have already played and finished the 'Awakened' and the 'Testament of Sherlock Holmes' so I knew what to expect and it didn't fail. Pretty solid story and the way we reach the Ripper's identity is satisfying in that we get to examine a bunch of real suspects that are doing weird and often illegal actions, but aren't actually the perpetrator of the Ripper crimes.The game was able to give me a real sense of the brutality of the murders near the end and the investigation parts were better than the other two games I mention. I also liked the puzzles.I also liked the end sequence with the Ripper as a concept, but it lacked a bit in execution.I had a couple of issues:- the ellipse needs to be wider- don't switch accounts or to Desktop because the save might stop functioning after a while "

												Good fun but the game has a few minor issues. The point and click is a bit annoying when trying to walk around because they get stuck in corners and stuff and some of the puzzles are stupidly hard, one about the American Civil Wars which is pretty impossible without a lot of prior knowledge and also quite a lot of spelling mistakes in texts. None of these issues really affect the game much and I got it pretty cheap so I'd still reccommend it			"

												A fun little game for those who enjoy a good point and click to kill some time. Some of the puzzles are not that difficult, and if you are a fan of history, the game uses actual evidence of the infamous murders. Plus, it's Britian's most famous dectective vs. the most infamous serial killer.My only main problem is that it feels padded out. There are too many moments where you are just running around doing little fetch quests.			"
