												I bought this game during the last steam sale for like 90 cents. I had no idea what I was buying, but hey, it's a steam sale so you just shut your brain off and start adding things to your cart.Well it turns out I hit a goldmine with this one. I started it up, named my party members after my friends, and got right to playing. Suddenly I was in a low earth orbit fighting asteroids and rogue satellites. My wagon crashes back to earth, and I get burned to death by a dragon after chasing a unicorn through a field of flowers.Start up a new game - everything's going great, when all of a suddenBUFFALO BUFFALOBUFFALO BUFFALOBUFFALO BUFFALOBUFFALO BUFFALO10/10 would/will die in amazing ways again			"

												No game makes me smile the way that Super Amazing Wagon Adventure does.The love that went into making this game -- by a one-person studio, no less -- is evident from the moment that the title screen is displayed.At first glace, the lo-fi visual style is deceptively simple. But as you experience each new scenario, the passion and care that went into creating this specific experience becomes more and more evident.Those visuals are supported by a soundtrack that is simply a joy to listen to. Each phase of the wagon's journey has an overall theme that effectively sets the mood. When the final track begins, the anticipation of reaching the coast is palpable.PLAY THIS GAME			"

												This is my first ever Steam Review and one that I should have done a long, long, LONG time ago (apologies to Sparsevector :P).The game still surprises me to even this day with new stuff that I've never seen.  I don't want to make it sound like a fact, but you will be hard-pressed to find someone who's played this game longer than I have, so for me to say that it still produces new scenes I've never experienced before, that's a stunning achievment.I won't go into detail about the finer points of controls, branching story-arc, the ""meta"" game or anything like that.  All I will say is that I've enjoyed playing the game for many years now, and the ability to rename the travelers is an instant trip to hilarity every time someone new dies.  For less than the cost of a decent sandwich, I've enjoyed over 100+ hours and many years of entertainment from SAWA and it continues to be a staple of my routine.  I don't do numerical ratings, so take my review for what it is:  Two thumbs up.  "

												I think this may be the funniest single player game I have ever played. On my first attempt, I was laughing the whole time, up until the point where my last dude was picked up by a tornado and gored by a flying buffalo. The humor is just incredibly over the top and ridiculous, and I recommend NOT watching any gameplay videos before playing, as to not spoil anything.The game’s really short, but there’s plenty of replay value, so it can keep you busy for a few hours. The music is also incredibly catchy.			"

												It was a dangerous journey, they knew that. But HornyFishMan, NuggleSnugg, and HurgaDerga had to do it. It was time they traveled to the West Coast in their trusty station wagon. Leading the group, HornyFishMan picks up his uzi. They hunt. Bandits attack. Some could even aim. They reach a river. They ford it. Boulders... so many boulders... and then the pirate ship attacked. Luckily, there was a rocket launcher in the river. A few quick shots, and it's down. Suck it, Blackbeard.The group enters the Great Plains. Buffalo buffalo buffalo. The number of buffalo was absurd. HurgaDerga is impaled by a buffalo, and I swear he will be missed. NuggleSnugg and HornyFishMan go on. Horny is healed by health kits that was bought, along with a flame thrower, with the buffalo hide. Remember, the ones that killed HurgaDerga? Revenge is sweet. They see a woman in a red dress. HornyFishMan stops to see if she needs help. It wasn't a trap, and she needs no help. She thanks Horny and sends him away. A civil war battle is underway nearby. The group says hello. There were no survivors. The group reaches another river. It was time the station wagon went underwater. Water buffalo water buffalo water buffalo. The group reaches an island. Horny notices supplies on the shore. He takes them. It was a trap! PELICANS! Luckily, he survives. They swim to shore.They reach a mountain pass. Food supplies were running low, so they hunted. No bandits this time, but wolves. So many wolves. They find a trader. They use the wolves they murdered to buy a double-barreled uzi. There is a snow storm, yet the wolves continue to attack. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... They deal with the wolves, and see a strange figure in the distance... Horny investigates.BIGFOOT! Horny runs at him, and having found another flamethrower in the snow, takes him down easily. It is now out of ammo, though, so he gets his double-barreled uzi back out. Infinite ammo rocks! He runs back to the wagon, and the snow storm was rough, so in their panic, they drive off a cliff.Buffalo followed HornyFishMan and NuggleSnugg off the cliff. So many buffalo. They dodge all the buffalo, and manage to land safely in a river. Having lost their wheels, the station wagon became a raft. They navigated through boulders and fought off alligators. Then they reached a bandit ambush. The bandits attacked with shotguns on their rafts. Successfully defending themselves from the bandits, alligators, and boulders, the group could see the West coast. They almost made it! But then a bandit showed up. He had found some sort of steam boat. Lighting up the boat as much as possible, it wasn't enough. A bandit holding a shotgun on top of the steam boat fired, and Horny wasn't quick to the dodge. NuggleSnugg joined Hurga, after all this time. She came so far, and it didn't even matter. Horny, in all his rage, blew up the boat with his uzi, ending his bandit problem. Reaching shore, Horny shoots pelicans in celebration. He made it to the West coast, though he lost his best friends. He will never forget that fateful Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.			"

												This game has made me laugh out loud more than any game I can remember.The only problem with it is that it may be TOO historically accurate.*It's a thinly veiled side-scrolling SHMUP that milks just about every kind of variant gameplay possible from the genre, and has the political correctness of Oliver Stone directing Monty Python on a cocaine rush. If you grew up in the 80s/90s, this entire game might be seen as either revenge for or praise of your Atari 2600, the Oregon Trail, and that one infamous Battletoads stage.You will cause the genocide of buffalo and, potentially, unicorns. It's utterly, stupidly brilliant. Buy it.			"

Great sense of humor, silly unlocks for some alternate gameplay styles, it's randomized out the♥♥♥♥♥ and does the kind of things you wanted to as a kid.When you first get to a river and are asked ""ford it"" or ""jump it"", you'll know what you're getting in for.

Rose picked up a shotgun and went to go gather berries but was then attacked by bears that also wanted the berries. Once she killed the bears she was then attacked by a massive group of rabid squirrels. She continued to fend them off and it was back to the wagon. On the continuing journey Rose died while avoiding a massive hoard of buffalos. Rachel made it out of the forest but then was dying of hunger in a desolate desert. Out of nowhere another pack of wild buffalo came and hit the wagon and the wagon exploded. Wtf did I just play?			"

Your annoying friend from the 90s with a bowl haircut and khaki cargo shorts would probably tell you that this is Oregon Trail ""On Crack"". Well he's never actually tried crack so what does he know? I, on the other hand, have and I can tell you that this is nothing like crack at all.The great thing about this game is that you can keep playing it over and over again, unlike crack cocaine, which you should only try once or twice.

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a randomly generated sidescrolling shooter that banks on a couple things: goofiness, nostalgia (slightly) and not caring too much about shooter games.If I was to judge it purely based on its mechanics, it's not much more than mediocre. The weapon options are nothing too special, and the enemies mainly rely on strength of numbers to add challenge. The boss fights that I've experienced so far were OK but no big deal.What really is entertaining is the silly nature of the entire endeavor. The game takes a lot of cues from Oregon Trail and basically makes fun of every option.""There is a river. [Tom] has the brilliant idea to jump over it. Or, you could try fording it.""[Ford][Jump]And then you can actually jump over the river if you want to.Other times you might be attacked by modern cars or ""inner demons"", and the text that accompanies almost every event is weird and goofy. And it works almost every time, and because the game is so quick to play (the game I won probably took between 5-10 minutes) and there are a lot of options, it hasn't yet gotten old.But it probably will eventually. And when I'm tired of seeing a million buffalo charge at me for the hundredth time, then I'll probably stop because all it has left are the mechanics, which, as stated, really aren't much special.Still, it doesn't cost much, and it still plays much better than the far more tedious McPixel (I don't know why I feel the comparison is necessary - highly pixelated graphics and bite-size gameplay I guess, but nothing else much is in common so *shrug*) and I still foresee getting some quality time out of it, so I would recommend it!

												A parody of The Oregon Trail edutainment games.Graphics are intentionally retro 8bit, with a CRT monitor filter you can optionally enable. Simplistic, low-detail sprites represent your wagon, your party and anything else that may or may not want to kill you - and the former grossly outnumber the latter.Equally retro are the sound effects, with beeps and blops and a catchy MIDI-ish soundtrack.Gameplay is like a sillier Oregon Trail - normally you control your wagon along a linear course, avoiding obstacles and shooting at things that (rarely don't) want to kill you. Your party has individual life bars and you lose once all of them are dead or missing. Events pop up after every gameplay section, ranging from shooting train robbers, to choosing between fording or jumping a river, to some rather spoiler-y occurences.There's the main campaign mode, and progressing through it and beating certain challenges can unlock survival modes (last as long as possible in a gauntlet of enemies), shuffle modes (your starting settings are randomized from what I understand) and new wagons (which change your speed, party's health and firepower).It's a small game and gets you a few laughs when you play short sessions of it, and it's probably in your best of interests not to take it too seriously, even if it does get a tad dark and difficult (especially difficult).

												I've spent countless time playing this on my 360. I haven't given the PC version the love it deserves but I have a huge soft spot for Super Amazing Wagon Adventure. If you played Oregon Trail (the original, not the terrible mobile ""game"") then you get the joke. If you don't know what Oregon Trail is, well then maybe you can enjoy the absurdity of it all.			"

												What I played: Super Amazing Wagon AdventureWhat I expected: A super amazing wagon adventureWhat I got: A sporadic impossible wagon adventureThis game is a lot harder than I had anticipated; your hitbox is the entire wagon, making it tricky to avoid incoming things. You can only fire directly in front of you, making it sometimes difficult to shoot incoming enemies that clip the edges of your wagon.The controls were a bit hard to get used to at first; you move with WASD and press the spacebar (or mouse button) to shoot, but in scenes where you're walking around outside the wagon, the game plays like a top-down shooter like The Binding of Isaac, Hotline Miami, Nuclear Throne, etc. in that you move with WASD and shoot with the four directional arrow keys (or use the mouse cursor for more versatile accuracy). Of course, all these controls can be remapped as you desire, and even comes with gamepad support if you want to use a controller. Overall, this game refuses to take itself seriously, so why should you? This game is understandingly hard and it's easy to get frustrated, but given the nature of the game and how it's executed, I can't help but laugh every time I inevitably lose.			"

												My SAWA review is quite simple really, Super Amazing Wagan Adventure, is Super Amazing! If you like dem old fashioned side scroller arcade games, you would like SAWA, only difference between this and arcade games down at the arcade is: No need to pay per go, once you buy this its yours :PIf you can tell by the title,  Super Amazing Wagan Adventure (Or SAWA as I shorten it to) is a 2D indie side-scroller game with a super amazing soundtrack. With random events this game can keep you occupied for a good amount of time. No flaws at the moment (That I have found anyway) Some events can be more hard than others but with determination you can survive. I am currently recording gameplay which will be out rather soon (At the time of writing this) so you can look it up if you wanna see gameplay. You can also have a party and name them after your friends like I did and watch 'em die in rather humerous deaths. Its worth the cheap price and it is a really entertaining game :D It gets a good 9 outta 10 from this guy.			"

												This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing super amazing.  So, I died on the first day of traveling, which left Uche and Maya to do the rest of the journey without me.  They accidentally entered low Earth-orbit while trying to jump over the river, and they blew up the international space station.  Uche was then gored by a buffalo and died slowly and painfully from internal bleeding.  Maya made it to the mountain passes, where she managed to fight off droves of ninjas with an ancient sword, slashing them and deflecting their ninja throwing stars.  She got then got distracted and accidentally drove off of a cliff, where she was attacked by eagles, which she slashed through with her ancient weapon.  After landing in another river, she almost immediately got shot by bandits in a paddle boat.  Imagine the reactions I got when I told this story to them at school.If that doesn't convince you to buy this game, then you have no soul and I will personally slice you in half with an ancient katana and then trample on your dead body while riding a buffalo.

To be completely honest:-I forgot about this game before Steam Awards-Steam Awards making me write a review, but technically this game deserves it-I thoroughly believe that this game has given me the most happiness for a non pvp game and I really wish that more games like this can be make. I feel like this game isnt popular enough right now even though it is super fun and always finds a way to kill me and my familry ;). 100000/10 wagons would play again.-If you havent bought this yet...

												Short version: This game has unicorn ambushes, rabid squirrel attacks, and river jumping. You should buy it.Slightly longer version: This game is merciless, unforgiving, and totally ruthless, just as an Oregon Trail homage should be. You are in a wagon and have a gun to shoot things. Sometimes you get out of the wagon to shoot things. If you are lucky you get medical recovery items and better guns, from shotguns to carpet-bombing airplanes. If you are not lucky, your three characters get horrible diseases and die to machine-gun-armed bandits and Civil War fights. More often than not, the latter will build up and have your journey end terribly.What keeps the game from getting overly frustrating (at least for me) is the humor. This game is hilarious, and it has everything from dinosaurs to satellites. The narration is fantastic, and it is worth playing for that alone. It's why I got the game, despite usually not being a fan of these types of games. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure was just too funny to skip.It controls well, once you get the hang of it. I personally am terrible with keyboards for games, but from how it felt, I'm fairly certain a keyboard-savvy player will usually be perfectly fine. There are plenty of options as well, ranging from a number of wagons you can unlock to survival modes. With the numerous scenarios your playable party can get into, it has high replayability.This game is $3 for a base price, and the witty narration is worth that alone. Add in the other great factors, such as the unlockables and tight controls, and you have a huge winner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go back to dying to buffalo.			"

												The short version is for 2.99 this game is an absolute steal.  I absolutely recommend this game 100%.Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a game that made the YouTube rounds a while back and for very good reason.  It's one of those absurd hilarious games that just refuses to stop surprising you hour after hour.  It starts off as a pretty standard Oregon Trail inspired adventure as you customize your party, and pick a wagon.  Then after that first ten seconds I'm pretty sure the game takes a handful of shrooms and maybe coke right to the face and goes completely off the rails.  This game isn't trying to have a compelling narrative, it doesn't want to be IGN's game of the year, and it's not trying to tun the industry upside down with it's wicked angsty edginess.  No, SAWA is a game that just wants to be fun.  It wants to take you an adventure infused with pure randomness and heart of comedy gold.  You'll jump rivers and end up in space, you'll go looking for food and end up tripping balls, you'll be making your way across the plains and then fighting a Buffalo filled tornado.  A FREAKING BUFFANADO!Visuals- The atari style graphics are simple yet endearing, and the color is perfect for the cartoony feel.  It's not winning any awards but it's perfect for the game.Replayability- This game has it!  Not because this game offers new wagons and things to unlock, but because you just can't stop from wondering what could be next.Sound-  Similar to the visuals, it's good but not mindblowing.  It's everything this game should be.Gameplay_  The shooting can be a bit on the garbage side which is a shame.  You'll die a surprising amount, and what you die from will usually be even more surprising.  This game at points doesn't seem to follow any rules either.  I was once killed by a bear with no way to defend myself.  If this kind of thing bothers you, may be best to look else where. "

												Noah Ben and Natalie start their adventure in their standard wagon. Some simple hunting at first then bandits attack. Ben finds a machine gun on the groun and slays all the bandits along with his ammo. Then a machine gun armed bandit cart. Natalie takes a hit but the cart eventually explodes. Ben collects berries and fights a bear, but the bear calls for his squirell army. Ben collects a flamethrower and destroys all the squirrels. The journey continues and takes the gang to a river. They decide to jump it and land halfway. Noah gets hit by a rock but survives. Then pirates. A floating rocket launcher saves them but Ben is imjured. They get to the other side and Noah gets dysentery :(. Their oxen then gets the mumps and is slowed. Then when they least expect it. BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO. Noah doesn't make it through. R.I.P. More buffalo. An absurd amount of buffalo. Then they get to see a fur trader where they get health and a flamethrower. Ben hears gunshots in the distance, but fearful of a trap stays away. They then take their adventure underwater where they're attacked by pirrahnas and jellyfish. Ben dies. R.I.P. Natalie makes it onto an island where she collects eggs for an omlette. Pterodactyl eggs. She is then slain by velociraptors on dinosaur island. R.I.P. 10/10 game would buffalo again.			"

												To anyone who fondly remembers the days of the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision, or any system before the era of Nintendo, I urge you to consider adding this game to your library. The game's simplistic idea and design has allowed the one-man studio to jam enough charm, color and passion to far surpass anything I've seen in an indie game.You'll come into this game expecting a quick laugh, you'll stay for the nostalgia, the joy and all the pleasent surprises that'll cross your every turn.

Product received for free
												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure------------------------------------------------Is like if you took the Oregon Trail and put it on an Atari Cartridge. Although the Graphics look slightly closer to that of intellivision.First thing I hear is the music, while it is a loop, its is pretty cool and works well.I absolutely love that there is choices for the family and that you can customize your own, and that There will be a huge selection of wagons avaiable even if you just start with 1.The Brutal slaughtering of innocent animals all of the screen was pretty funny, while you did kill animals in the original Oregon trail it never looked as cool or funny as this is. Holy ♥♥♥♥balls, Did I just get a rocketlauncher? Its coming right for us!Some Bandits tried to roll up on me, but I shot them right in their stupid faces.Then this crazy♥♥♥♥♥Machine gun Bandit comes out of nowhere and starts going rambo on me, god damn, No rest for the wicked.After I blew that guy to kingdom come, I went off to find Berrys in the forest, That went pretty smoothly, tho I still fired some shots off for the fun of it.I then found a cave and went to investigate, because why not going into A Dark Scary cave at random sounds like a great idea doesn't it?So It was darker then 9/11 jokes in that cave, When I finally reached my lighter I saw the cave was filled with bats the size of cars, they swarmed and instantly ate me....My family went on without me.They had to Cross a River My daughter told mom to jump it, but mom Decided to ford it, and then all these damn boulders came out of nowhere, followed by more boulders jesus! Stupid Boulders!My Wife got Gangrene, and Damn she looked horrible.Then came the Buffalo stampede, it left my wife dead.It was upto my daughter to make it the gold rush and live on our family name....Unfortunently A minute later she was gored by Bison.GAME OVER.Final Thoughts:This was immensly fun, and very much like the Oregon Trail only funner and funnier. I Want to write you a longer review but I just want to get back on the trail already, my biggest complaint is no achievements and no trading cards. Other than that this is a fun little gem that will make you laugh, especially if your remember playing Oregon Trail.Pros:+Decent Controls even if they are basic, PLUS Controller support+Decent Music+Hillarious+FUN AND FUNNY+Educational+Watch your Family Die Cons:-No Trading Cards (Please Add!!!!)-No Achievements (Please Add!!!!)-Educational-Watch your Family Die This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												My party took the wagon on a cruise across fields, rivers, deserts, and mountains. We explored mummy tombs, fought piranhas underwater, and visited outer-space. Cody found love after he ate some mushrooms. I was gored to death by a unicorn's horn. 10/10 for super and amazing.			"

												EDIT: fixed a typoLet me tell you a story of my poor group. We set on an adventure in  our trusty wagon. During a hunt we encountered a unicorn, which has led us into wonderful magic field. We were promptly ambushed by a herd of said unicorn's friends. After slaughtering them we fought a dragon. Then we came to a river. We decided to jump over the river. By some freaky accident we somehow went to the orbit, made our way through a meteor shower, fought a satellite, then we conveniently landed on the other side of the river we were trying to cross. We then entered desert, where we were brutally murdered by buffalo.			"

												I couldn't make a negative review no matter how much I try.This game is one of the greatest single-player games in the world. Even if it's pixel and Indie. It's great.Create your own 3 people (I have Shrek, Snoop, and Bonzi, friend purposes). Shrek and Snoop make love everytime. :)It's a very fun game, much to explore and unlock. It can make you rage a lot at times, but that's why games are good!Anyone who actually reads reviews, go for this game. Have fun, m8.			"

												This game is Super, Amazing, and 100% historically accurate. I didn't think that unicorns or aliens really existed until I saw it for myself. These events all happened during the move to the west on the Oregon trail and I find this very informative. I strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes a taste of class and enjoys historical fiction. In all seriousness, this game is great. The random encounters increase the replayability significantly. Even after completeing the main adventure, you always want to go back and try to get another wagon or a different scenario. Plus naming characters after your actual friends is hilarious. Awesome game, I strongly recommend it.			"

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is hilarious! I find that very few games put me into fits of belly laughter, this is one of those few games that did just that. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure combines 2D side scrolling shooting, peppered with the occasional Robotron style shooter, all wrapped up into an adventure that's different on every playthrough. Obviously this is the game's main hook, and part of the reason why the game is so hilarious. You just can't write♥♥♥♥♥♥like that in real life, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure doesn't even need to try... Seriously, upon my first playthrough, I named my three adventurers (two of them being my best friends and housemates), the games randomly generated story decided that I was going to contract purple fever, help save a train from being hijacked, fall in love with one of my partners (who just happens to be my best mate), ""relieve ourselves"" in the wagon, all before we all died outrunning an erupting volcano, whilst dodging wolves that were on fire.... Amazing!Oh, and there's an awesome chiptune-ish soundtrack and a gorgeous TV scanline effect, mimicking the asthetics of the old Atari 7800 games. Loads of fun, hard as hell, and hilarious as ♥♥♥♥, highly recommend this one!			"

												It is difficult for me to review this game without spoiling the surprise a little too much, so: This is a retro pixel shooter, with both side-scrolling and twin-stick elements, as you and your party head into the low-resolution West to seek fortune, fame and Not Death. There is also a degree of rogue-like flow to your journey; whilst elements of your trip are fixed by geography and time, others are... significantly less predictable.I bought this game for like 50p in a sale and then have since bought about another ten copies because everyone needs to see this craziness.

												tldr:Very arcadey with extremely simplistic gameplay.  Great sense of humor, but the lack of any truly addictive qualities makes this game very easy to put down.  There is nothing wrong with it, really.  There is just not much terribly right with it.  Very neat little game, good for at least a few minutes of entertainment if arcadey is not your thing.extended:This is more or less a series of extremely simple minigames strung together seemingly at random.  Most can be summarized as such: clumsily move around on the screen while dodging pixelated blobs and clicking to fire slow-moving bullets at such.  It can be amusing to see some of the situations described or depicted in the game, but the gameplay itself is lacking.  The controls are just clumsy enough that you never get into that addictive, edge-of-your-seat frenzy that the best arcade games can inspire.  Still, they are not so bad as to incite you to throw your peripherals at the monitor, and there is something to be said for character.If there were an option for, ""Maybe"" instead of a simple yes or no, I would choose it.  That's a rare thing for me, because I am usually pretty opinionated about the games I play.  To put it in perspective, if I had paid $5 for this game instead of $2 on sale, I would feel extremely ripped off.  But for what I paid, I can appreciate the value.  Given all of this, I will err on the side of being positive and recommend the game.			"

												This is an extremely comical roguelike of sorts, fitting the bill of permadeath and random generation. In addition, it has an exquisite challange factor, whilst managing to not feel punishing (or at least, leaving you a hope you won't get that particular encounter in the foreseeable future). It features unlockable wagons and music that accents the games lighthearted and pleasant qualities. As for the actual gameplay itself, however, it is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up, when in the wagon, which is of course most of the time. Who ever went to Oregon on foot, that's silly and extremely dangerous.At first glance, it's simplistic, not much challenge in it. But the rapidity of your movement, the size of your hitbox, and the sheer number and speed of hostile entities makes this game, for better or for w̶o̶r̶s̶e̶  better, a Bullet Curtain. Overall, highly recommended for its quick pace, delightful humour (and the utterly bizarre twists and turns that entails), and of course, its refreshing Roguelike and Shoot-'Em-Up elements. Enjoy! I got my three dollars' worth in a lunchbreak.			"

												Take the famous Oregon Trail, discard most of the historical facts and add a lot of random nonsense and you get Super Amazing Wagon Adventure!Cruise through forests, fields, deserts and even underwater in your trusty wagon and try to stay alive!And staying alive isn't so easy with almost everything out to get you! Bandits, wild animals, zombies and mother nature are trying to stop you from reaching your goal.So what do you do? Offense is the best defense, right? So just shoot everything!Your starting wagon gives you only a weak pistol, but you might find a lot of other weapons on your way, including shotguns, flamethrowers, bazookas and even an airstrike!Unlock more wagons with better starting weapons, including the Diseased, which spreads disease! Or how about the Glitch, which shoots...stuff!Most of the time the game is a sidescrolling shooter. You man your wagon and fire away, but once in a while you'll have to leave your wagon and fight on foot and it's fun all the way.It might be a bit unfair from time to time, depending on what scenes you end up in, but the game is rather short anyway, so just try again! A great game for in between!It's also really cheap and if you're into sillyness, this game is worth a consideration!			"

												It's alright, I suppose.  After finishing it once I concluded that the ""story"" ultimately wasn't my style, and the gameplay itself is average.  It does all come together in a very complete manner, though, and it does not feel like a broken or unfinished game, just not very amusing or deep.  The main draw is definitely the silliness and parody factor, rather than the shooty-shooty.The video is preeeetty much exactly what you're getting.  That's literally what the whole game is going to be like, you just have to decide if you want to throw yourself in its shoes and kill buffalo.  More of a neutral standing, but thumbs down because I wouldn't suggest this to others as a time killer.			"

It burnt out my 128GBs of RAM and 5 GHz sixteen-core processor. Before buying this game, remember to watercool your entire house, it heats up your GPU about ten times more than Crysis 3 on ultra.

												So, I bought this game on a whim, seeing it as a fun, singleplayer experience, but then my dad had to go and eat some strange mushrooms in a field where he then started tripping and had to battle his inner demons, to which he failed to battle off and lay in the field. My brother and I left him, where we shortly thereafter battled a pirate ship in a small river that shot my brother with a cannonball. I managed to destroy the ship and continued onward, where I died in a large field of buffalo. Overall one of the single most hilarious five-minute singleplayer adventures I have ever had the pleasure of undertaking. 10/10			"

												This game is amazing. It's only 3 dollars, which is about 2 pounds i think... anyways its cheap. The game is sort of randomly generated, changing up the encounters frequently. Once I was picking berries when I was attacked by a bear, once I was picking some tasty mushrooms, but when I ate one I tripped out and had to battle my inner demons with a angry falcon! Anyways, the game makes no sense, is completely random, is really hard, involves recreational buffalo shooting, and is awesome and definetly worth 3 bucks. Buy it now.			"

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is truly the pinnacle of modern game design. From the lush, futuristic graphics technology that makes you feel like you can really taste the buffalo steaks, to the blisteringly unique gameplay of shooting bandits, bears, coyotes and rogue satellites, to the thrill-a-second story that could go any way, but will almost always end in horrifying slaughter, this is by far the greatest piece of entertainment in the history of human history.

												3/5A silly and fast playing game that is ridiculous in its humor and presentation which makes it a blast to play. Needless to say, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is exactly what it purports itself to be - a humorous 2D side-scroller with an Oregon Trail vibe. It can be challenging, varies in just about every playthrough, and has some interesting and difficult side games that can be unlocked. It can get boring after awhile and finds it place in the steam library of silly games to return to on occasion. Recommended for silly fun that is quick and easy to play.			"

												Don't be fooled by the playtime. I've owned this game on Xbox for years. It's my favourite game in the whole world.Randomised events for maximum replayability, genuinely challenging in places, and deeply hilarious. My one regret is that you can't just give the bear those damn berries.			"

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a side scrolling shooter. It's very clearly based on games from the 80s. You have to get your wagon from point A to point B... and shot things along the way. There are cool powerups, interesting little random events that may help or harm your run, traders to buy things from, and multiple forks in the road to keep the game fresh and replayable. There are also different unlockable wagons to use, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and special quirks. There's not a whole lot more to say about the gameplay. It's mostly just automatically scrolling to the right as you move around the screen and shoot. It can be pretty easy or very hard depending on your choices and your luck. It's rather short, but highly replayable. I love the art style and the soundtrack is also pretty freakin' catchy. Plus the appropriate sound effects, of course. I really wish I could write a longer, more detailed review, but that's all there really is about it. It's fun, addictive, and only costs 3 bucks at full price. If you enjoy games you can complete in a sitting, this is great. And it keeps you coming back for more with the random events and different wagons. The only downside for this game is that... I wish there was more. More stuff in it. A longer trail. More events. Just... more everything. But I can't fault the game for any of that because what it DOES have is all great and makes for a wonderful experience that not many games aim to give you anymore. If you're thinking about it, just get it. You might not sink hundreds of hours into it, but the ones you DO put into it will all be worthwhile playtime, no filler.Super Amazing Wagon Adventure gets an 8/10 for being a very fun little experience with lots of replayability and that throwback feeling.

												$2.99 for a game that never gets old and never stops being hilarious, with lots of unlockable wagons and the most interesting ways to die possible. Not only that, but the game is FRIGGIN' HARD!!!! The person who came up with this is deliciously demented and very adept at appealing to an audience with a goofy sense of humor, that also yearns for the nostalgic gameplay of yesteryear. There's really not a lot I can think to say about this game other than BUY IT, BUY IT NOW. Support this developer, in the hopes that they'll make more games which are just as fun, and just as funny. For the price, replay value, and graphical genius (in my opinion, everything about this game is funny and enjoyable.), as well as its simple elegance. (Haha)Seriously, 8/10.			"

												Quality game, absolutely breathtaking graphics when played with the stunning Nvidia GTX 980. I wouldn't want to play it with any other card otherwise you won't be able to experience and appreciate the full potential of this game. My friend only had a GTX 760 and said the game was a complete waste of time and money as he had to play in the lowest settings and even then he was only achieving 30fps as opposed to my 90fps which quite frankly makes all the difference. In conclusion this is a quality game only when played with the finest GPU on the market. I want to have my babies with this card.			"

												Frustrating, but not in a good way. I'm a fan of roguelite games; Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon are two of my favourites, so I have no problems with a game that's tough as long as it's fair. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is *not* fair though, so prepare to die. A lot. When there's more or less nothing you could do about it.Your hitbox is the entire wagon (large), but the area your default weapon can attack is one small line right ahead of you. You will get hit many, many times by enemies just above or just below this area charging toward you. Anyone who makes it to the Buffalo will know what I mean. There are other weapons, but there's no way to store or change them, so if you get something that could help you later you can prepare to fire it off about two minutes before you really need it. Your wagon has three passengers, among whom damage is ""shared"". Hits land not-really-randomly on your party members, often hitting and killing one person before the other two. It's possible to get hitpoints back but this happens on a purely random basis, and consists of either events that may or may not happen or medkit pickups you may not be able to reach. The frustration that comes when you find a rare event only to realize it's your 1-HP guy instead of your 4-HP guy that you have to try to finish it with... agonizing.There's some laughs to be had here; I thought it was hilarious when I had the option to either ford a river or jump over it, and then later either go around or swim under the river. There's also a ton of content and different paths your adventure might take; I was still finding new ones until I finally quit playing. It's a shame I'm not going to see the end of the game though because I cannot put up with these deaths that I have no real control over. If the hitbox on the wagon was a lot smaller and my gun could aim a little I'd probably play the hell out of this game. Sadly, I'm sick of it and going to see if I can get a refund.			"

												An Endlessly replayable, action-arcade Oregon Trail-like game of adventure across the ooooooold west.  Will you Ford this river, or jump it?  Will your best friend die by bullet to the head or skunk acid?  Fight Buffalo, Bandits, and Bears as you try to head to the west coast and a better life.  This was made by people who truly know what makes a game fun.  Get it and you won't be disappointed.			"

												""This game is a happy, fun, harmless Oregon Trail clone"" is what you say for all of 2 seconds after starting the game.  This one is far more than just a re-hash of an old classic.  This game gives new meaning to the phrase ""random event"".  It really goes above and beyond to ensure you won't win.  From entering a den of angry bears, to battling your inner demons.  Anything can, and does, happen.  No two playthroughs are the same.  The game's aesthetics are retro to the point of exhaustion.  I don't mind this too much, but at times I can't figure out what's going on.In short, the game works.This game gets my Seal of Recomendation.  Pick it up, if not just for the sheer novelty of letting your friends be mauled to death by bears, and or unicorns.  Happy hunting!			"

												This is a fun little game that can help cut out the spare time you may have. It's a randomly generated game that can be incredibly silly and with many unlockable wagons to change the look of the game and give you certain boosts. I'd certainly pick it up if you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥away some spare time.			"

												In a Nutshell, this game is a Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.The most promising point of playing this game is the fact that the story is always told in a random order meaning after every death you encounter a slightly shifted story.I suggest playing on an old CRT Monitor for best graphics.A little Spoiler for PC Masterrace : You don't need a beefy computer to run this game on 60 FPS "

												The negative reviews for this game honestly deepress me since they seem very opinionated and most haven't even an hour of gameplay. Added also seem to be seemingly not to good at the game since it's made out to be much harder then it is.Anyways this game for me anyways was quite fun for something very retro style which I am not very into.The gameplay is symplistic but fun made aware of by the differientated weapon going from a revolver, a falcon, a rocket launcher, all the way to an airstrike.The game is semi randomized with what you could be facing such as a horde of buffalo or buffalo charging you and even fighting a glitch that shoots numerous amounts of glitch tiles at you while you try to fend it of with the weapons at your disposalI hear you saying ""We are still talking about migration by wagon aren't we?"" and that is when i respond with just wait until you fight of a pirate ship with nothing more than your trusty falcon.

After buying it, you can open the Steam Music Player and start playing the tracks as you'd like, and it comes with two remixes.You can also use it in your videos, or whatever. Just thought that'd be a nice thing to point out.			"

												THIS GAME IS A REALLY GOOD GAME, BUT IT TAKES UP WAY TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME. IF I DIDN'T PLAY THIS GAME I COULD HAVE LEARNED LIKE THREE LANGUAGES OR HAVE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥IGN HARP OR SOME♥♥♥♥♥♥ THE TIMES WHERE YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR MATES AND JUST ♥♥♥♥ING AROUND ARE GREAT; I'VE HAD SOME OF THE BEST TIMES OF MY PATHETIC YOUTH PLAYING THIS ♥♥♥♥IGN GAME. THIS GAME HAS BROUGHT ME LOVE, HATE, THE RAT KID STORE, AND SO MUCH MORE. MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THESE KINDS OF VIDEO GAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO NEVER GO OUTSIDE, NEVER SOCIALIZE, NEVER DO ANYTHING. I AM ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.BUT, THIS GAME GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY FIND CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE AND SPEAK WITH THEM. AND YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING: ""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?"" BUT NO, THROUGH ACTUALLY BEING MYSELF WITH THE MIC AND TEXT IN THIS GAME, I'VE ACTUALLY MADE FRIENDS AND I'VE EVEN MET FEMALES WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!THIS GAME HAS HELPED ME OVERCOME MY CRIPPLING SOCIAL ANXIETY, JUST A BIT. IT GAVE ME A SHRED, JUST A SHRED OF AGENCY. I CAN COMMAND MY TEAM TO GO DEEP INTO ENEMY LINES; I CAN BE A LEADER! A LEADER, SOMETHING I AM RARELY EVER IN MY LIFE. IT GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE TO SPEAK ON THE MIC WITH ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS, AND SOMETIMES HAVE CONVERSATIONS! THE INTERACTIONS IN THE GAME ARE SOMETIMES PRICELESS, FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS PLAYING ALONE, 3A.M. AND I WAS PLAYING MEEPO, ALL THE LIGHTS OFF, COMFY♥♥♥♥♥♥ THERE WAS THIS ONE MAN ON MY TEAM, HE WASN'T FROM THE AMERICAS, BUT HE SPOKE ENGLISH. AND, JUST THE WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE TALK IN THIS GAME IS JUST, ♥♥♥♥ING CUTE. I LOVE IT. ANOTHER TIME, I WAS PLAYING ALONE AROUND THIS TIME AGAIN, AND MY TEAM WAS ALL COMMUNICATING AND♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND THIS GUY JUST SAID: ""ROGER THAT"" I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT JUST FELT NICE. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER. LIKE, WE WERE ALL WORKING SERIOUSLY, AND AS A TEAM. LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEIR TEAMS ARE THE THING THAT ARE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO GAME. BUT, FROM MY EXPERIENCES, IN SOME GAMES. YOU HAVE A PERFECT TEAM, AND YOU ALL WORK IN UNISON, IT JUST FELT GREAT. AND REMEMBER, THIS WAS IN SOLO, ♥♥♥♥ING, QUEUE. PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS AND DOING ALL OF THIS, AND WORKING TOGETHER, COMPLETE FOCUS ON SOMETHING IS JUST ♥♥♥♥IN' GREAT. IT'S GREAT.DOIGN STUPID, GAY COMBOS WITH YOUR MATES IS GREAT TOO, OR DOING SOMEHTING ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, AND HAVING IT WORK IS BEAUTIFUL.THIS GAME, TO ME IS A STEP TO BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL MEMBER OF SOCIETY. BUT, I FEEL THAT IT IS ALSO A WASTE OF FUKKING TIME. 4,300 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS TO MANAGE TO LEARN A BIT OF AGENCY AND BASIC ♥♥♥♥ING CONVERSATION SKILLS IS NOT WORTH IT. I COULD HAVE TAKEN A CLASS FOR ♥♥♥♥ING LOSERS LIKE ME AND LEARNED TO HAVE MADE HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WITH HUMANS!			"

												I have had a bit of fun with this, but fail to find the complexity or depth that is implied by many other positive reviews. To be sure, there are alternative paths and funny little 'side' deals that get a laugh, but overall this is really shallow in terms of content and how much the user can interact with the game. Alot of people complain and compare certain games to what you can play for free on flash sites, and although I am generally not one of them, I would use that argument here. Maybe I am just missing something, but I doubt it.			"

												it's total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and whether you live or die is completely random. it doesn't matter how good you are, if, no, WHEN you get unlucky and are forced into one the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t events that are either insanely difficult to the point of being guaranteed to completely ruin your run or in some cases force you way back making you have to redo massive chunks of the game, and these are often in conjunction with each other, making it guaranteed to kill you no matter how well you were doing. and there is ALWAYS one of those events every single game, and if they don't kill you, they will at least weaken you enough to allow one of the regular events to kill you. it is totally god awful and i wouldn't recomend it if it was 2 dollars, 1 dollar, or even free. or, heck, even if they were paying us to play it it still wouldn't be worth it.in summary: if you enjoy constant frustrastion and near guaranteed death, this is the game for you. if you're sane, avoid it like the plague			"

												I didn't have fun for long with this game. It feels just like it lacks a lot in gameplay, as things are just greatly difficult to accomplish and in the beginning you just depend on your luck if you want to get far.It's biggest sale point, the randomness of events is... not really that big. Yes, there is a variety of things that can happen to you, but it seems to like there isn't really that much variety.You always follow a specific basic path, which then has several options of what could happen to you. Sometimes, you can make the decision, like jumping or fording a river, which basically means having the chance for a random event, like having to dodge bees or asteroids. The other decision will have you... dodge... boulders.If you play it and then die and play it again, you will soon realize that there isn't really that much variety in what will happen to you. And, because the game sometimes just throws undodgeable obstacles in your way, faster than a human being could possibly react to, dying will happen to you a lot.Also you seem to be very limited in what you can do. The weapons, which the game will not really let you choose to fire it or conserve it, always have very limited ammo. You have, if you coun't all the party members, 12 points of health, from which the game sometimes RANDOMLY decides to take a quarter away. You either heal from (quickly appearing) health pickups or from random events.The game has a real good soundtrack though, and the design is mostly nice to look at, the sound effects also appear to be fitting and they don't get annoying.The text ""scrolling"", which is not in your hand, even on the fastest setting, was still too slow for me. Why not let me decide when to skip the text?In conclusion, the game has some sort of variety and the random events are funny at first, but they get old quickly. The gameplay doesn't have much variety, where I would really have appreciated to put more effort in. It doesn't cost a lot, so it doesn't really hurt to try it out, but I for myself, did not pull a lot of enjoyment out of it. "

												Normally, I would quote ""You get what you pay for,"" since I bought this game for $0.99 during the Summer Sale.  However, since I bought Half-Life on Steam during a sale for $1.99, I think I am entitled to complain.This game is something you would normally see on a flash games website, good for maybe a half-hour of entertainment before it gets boring.  To make matters worse, all of the wagons need to be unlocked through achievements save for the default one.  It also provides little real challenge other than twitch response in terms of gameplay.  The gameplay consists of being flashed a ""random"" message, then being thrown into a scenario that usually involves shooting animals, people, or dodging obstacles.  However, after a half-hour of play, I was seeing the same events every other run.  It turns out that the game isn't procedurally generated in the traditional sense, other than the random location of enemy spawns.  There are certain events that are fixed, such as crossing rivers, where the player is presented with a choice on how to do so.  However, most events that have a chance occur are linked to other events that is required to immediately follow, such as burning buffalo during a prairie fire only happens if there was a prarie fire, which only happens if there was a herd of buffalo, which happens every time upon entering the Great Plains level.  So there is actually not much variety in gameplay, since the event generation seems to only be based on two possible outcomes, often y/n, if a --> b ?, or based on player choice.But I would forgive all of this, even LOVE IT, if the game was just fun to play past the 1 hour mark.  But instead, it becomes a tedious and annoying mess of screen ghosting after that.  Save your ten bucks for something worthwhile.			"

												Please take down this game. This game is a joke. Whos your daddy is more serious and better then this piec of crap that you guys call a ""game"". Its straight up dumb. The adventure is not random its the same thing everytime except with a chance of getting rare wagon. I played this game for 16 minutes. 16 Minutes!!! and im already sick of this piece of crap game. I hate minecraft personally...but that game is better then this game. This feels like a game that was originally going to be a release for the console brown box but then cancelled and sold on ebay for 2$. I do not reccomend this game. If you like pixels and shooting games just buy dead pixels. Now thats a good game. Thank you for reading this and even though some of your favorite youtubers might have played it does not mean its fun. Please take my word and spend your money on dead pixels or surgeon simulator			"

												This game had so much potential. I was realyl excited when this was gifted to me by a good friend. It falls short. I can't put my finger on where, but it just misses the mark. Maybe its the voice that reminds me of some agro-teen saying ""Game over"" TRYING to sound intimidating. Maybe because the progression is completly random. You're in a wagon, there are wagons you can upgrade too... some of them are literally ""at random"" they become available. You shoot animals for food. You battle bandits. You battle bandits with machine guns. You battle Unicorns. Caves. Bats. Large Spiders. All. At. Random. Maybe I like knowing I am progressing... I can't handle the inconsistenacy. It has the potential to be an amazing game, but it just missed it.			"

												I thought this would be like Oregon Trail or something. You make no decisions at all really. It's pretty difficult. My whole group died quick the first time, which is fine as I started to get the feel for the game. Then I restarted only to repeat the exact same events in a ""random"" game. Then I got to the river again, got past the boulders... to face even more boulders! Got past that and then it had me zig-zagging up and down to dodge a pattern of (you guessed it) more boulders that scrolled on forever and ever... and ever. Eventually I just crashed into a boulder to end my misery! Everything in the game happens at lightning speed. To be fair, the speed and difficulty are listed in the product description. I don't know. I just expected something different I guess. I didn't find anything about it humorous either. Others may enjoy this. This game just wasn't for me.			"

												This game is repetitive, with a few random things that fail to spice anything up. It's difficulty is down to this slight randomness. You will die, then you get to do the same things again, with maybe a healthpack here! or instead of spiders, bears! These all react the same way. The music is solid and certainly a perk to the game. I could not even last an hour before I was shaking my head in both disappoint and disbelief that this many people could like it.			"

												I never liked roguelikes, especially ones where the deaths are cheap. This game is adorable, but nearly every death comes from the fact that your movement and attack options are absurdly limited and because of this, death is unavoidable.You might say ""well Oregon Trail was the same way. You could die from dysentery at any time.""In some cases, yes, but Oregon Trail let you plan ahead and save your game. This game lets you do neither. All you're allowed to do is react and hope you get the right numbers from the RNG.			"

												Pretty fun at times. gotta admit i was very amused the first time i started my adventure. i ended up eating mushrooms, having a trip, and got killed by rabbit men. However a few things you should know.-it is always the same. people claim that everything is randomized but thats a dead lie- some things along the way are literally designed to be impossible and kill your whole party without you having a chance. such as crossing a river that just has a continuous line of boulders with literally no gaps. Or facing machine gun bandits that have infinite health.all in all, it is fun, worth the dollar i paid. But it would be a million times better if i could unlock shuffle which i cant due to certain impossible events			"

												Easily my worst purchase of the current Steam summer sale. This was obvious to me after playing all of 15 minutes of the game.I expected bad graphics and I expected simplistic gameplay. What I didn't expect was extremely repetitive gameplay. I also very soon learned to loath the text screens that are always popping up. Unless I am missing something, there is no way to quickly dismiss these text screens, even after you have seen them many, many times. You can slightly adjust how long they remain on screen. Would it have been to hard to have the mouse button/button A dismiss the text screen?			"

Second, the controls seem to lag, when I move, it seems to lag by about a quarter of a second (yes I tried this on 3 comuters) and when you're getting attacked by 400 rabid skunks, that quarter of a second matters.

												Maybe the silliest and funniest game in my whole steam library. It nails the retro style and feel and it is one of the few games that I've played recently that makes me actually laugh out loud even after tens and tens of playthroughs. This is truly a glorious game and you should own it.			"

												Strange and silly and often crushingly hard. Between its dirt cheap price, it's huge degree of randomization and stuff to unlock, and the fact that it's kind of compelling means this is pretty much worth owning. It costs about as much as a candy bar and is a fantastic way to kill 10-20 minutes whilst waiting on other things.			"

												The best game anyone could ever ask for! Pros: Action packed bandit killing fun, amazing fun adventure stories, are able to tell your children about the amazing super fun awesome adventures you have overcome, wild unicorns, AK-47's, ultraviolent action, jumping over rivers in a f***ing wagon, dragon killing, riding tornados in a wagon with buffalo flying at you, getting caught in orbit after jumping over a river, stuff being shot and animals sometimes I don't know what it is running at you, action man action, while being a low price.

												This has to be my first recommendation ever.  After spending my childhood in school looking for excuses to gain access to Oregon Trail on the Apple ][, I've got some sort of neural pathway that's burned in to have a predisposition to games like this.  Organ Trail Director's Cut was a more failthful recreation of the gameplay, but Super Amazing Wagon Adventure takes the memory of the gameplay experience and sneaks it a big dose of LSD without its consent.  It plays in fast-forward and tells a ridiculous story about the travel expereince of three hapless emigrants and their trials with giant spiders, unicorn ambushes, and buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo			"

												If you think buying this game is not worth your $3 (At base price!) - you need to put your head on straight.What appears on the surface as a humourous poke at the genre that Oregeon Trail pioneered most famously on the Apple II gives way to a side-scroller shooter that will leave you with absolutly no air in your lungs - dispenced by your laughter at every little detail and event of this game.Yeah sure, maybe you'll play the game enough that some of the randomly generated scences start repeating. Yeah sure, maybe it might get boring and repetitive two weeks from now - but it is probably the best $3 I've ever spent on a game on steam, and that is a bold statement.Don't pass this one up. "

												This game is a strange one. The best way I can describe it is to call it a retro adventure shooter with hilarious absurdity. This is a fun game with solid gameplay, a unique graphical style and very few (if any) glitches. There are multiple hilarious scenarios, each wavering in challenge and difficulty. This is a difficult game, and a few of the wagon unlocks seem impossible. The turbo edition is a brilliant patch of content. I can give it a solid 7/10.			"

The action is where this game shines: It is balanced out well for my taste. I even like the scanline filter. For some odd reason playing this reminds me of the old Stampede on the Atari 2600...

												Is this game great? No.Is it fun? For a while.Is it hard? Artificially, yes. (Undodgeable objects, inability to heal outside of random chance, random drops in health via disease.)Is it roguelike? Partially. There are random events but only a select few that always occur at the same positions. Example is at the beginning you either get ambushed by Unicorns and fight a dragon or you get ambushed by bandits and fight a machine gun cart. Is this game entertaining? For a while, then it gets infuriatingly repetitive and boring as you never quite reach the end due to dumb luck. It would also be nice if the other carts weren't god awful or impossible to unlock. Reward players, don't cripple them when the odds are already stacked against them. EDIT: One really great thing about this game is the soundtrack. Even if the game is repetitive the soundtrack is enjoyable every time. The Great Plains music reminds me of the early days of Ninja Sex Party. Also the soundtrack is in the games files with remixes not in the game, so drop it into your music player of choice if you want to listen on the go.Do I recommend this game? Only on a sale. It is fun and it's a goofy game to introduce to friends. But it's basically a Newgrounds Flash Game, probably won't entertain past an 30min, an hour tops. $3 isn't bad but I've gotten better for free.			"

												This game is hands down one of the most hilarious games I've ever played. One moment you could be hunting animals for food, the next you could be fighting ""personal demons"" after getting high  on shrooms and the next you could have gone into orbit after a stray wind draft took you there following a decision to try to jump a river. Every playthrough is unique and the fast, sometimes challenging gameplay combined with the hilarious situations makes this one of my favorite games. Definitely pick this up.			"

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure TURBO is the new Steam release we have all been waiting for. Sick chiptunes and roguelike gameplay ensures you will be entertained until you get frustrated at how much you suck at roguelikes and quit. But you'll keep coming back, you just can't get enough. Unlockable wagons, unlockable arenas, secret areas. What is stopping you? Buy it today!Retro-graphics haters probably want to avoid this.			"

												If you think buying this game is not worth your $3 (At base price!) - you need to put your head on straight.What appears on the surface as a humourous poke at the genre that Oregeon Trail pioneered most famously on the Apple II gives way to a side-scroller shooter that will leave you with absolutly no air in your lungs - dispenced by your laughter at every little detail and event of this game.Yeah sure, maybe you'll play the game enough that some of the randomly generated scences start repeating. Yeah sure, maybe it might get boring and repetitive two weeks from now - but it is probably the best $3 I've ever spent on a game on steam, and that is a bold statement.Don't pass this one up. "

 The difficulty is good, not unfair but still challenging. The humor is pretty good, I laughed a few times. The achievements, randomization, unlockables, and rock solid tunes all add up to a few hours of gameplay at least and for $3 that's not bad.

After surviving the ambush I fought a dragon, I won but lost a couple party members.

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure combines action with absurd comedy not dissimilar to games from the 1980s. Possibly inspired by the Oregon Trail, SAWA takes a comedic spin to the story of three survivors (who you can name) and their adventure. It's simple to learn yet the difficulty curve can still spike at an exponential rate. Really fun game so far! Loving the random generator too (:			"

												This game is as addicting as it is hard. 9 times out of 10 I die on an adventure, but the idea of the possiblity of triggering a rare event is what makes you keep coming back to it. And it's not the kind of game that you have to warm up to either; I can just pick it up, play through an adventure, and leave if need be.Personally, I like unlocking things. Even if I don't put it to frequent use, unlockables are very similar to accomplishments for me, so naturally I never get tired of SAWA. The numerous unlockables aren't just for keeping you engrossed in the game; they make you go for certain events that you may not have chosen otherwise (I'm talking about the rivers here). I personally don't like going into the desert with the snakes, scorpians, and vultures, but when I saw the locked Survival mode, I figured I'd go to try and unlock it. Because of this, I encountered new events that I never would've seen without the motivation to go back to that desert. Now I like alternating between different areas to see what kind of new or unlikely events I can trigger!This isn't intended to be a hardcore game, but there are those kind of challenges for the people that always aim for the gold in video games. You know what kind of challenges I mean, and SAWA has them, namely the Random wagon, where you have to make it 50 days in Shuffle without dying. For those who haven't played Shuffle mode, it's a hard challenge. Take it from me.SAWA is great for gamers of all types: casual, hardcore, completionists, you name it. I definitely recommend this game, even if it's for an hour.			"

Quick Breakdown: A side scrolling shooter with occasional top down segments. The game features buffalo, underwater buffalo, space buffalo, flying buffalo, flaming buffalo, and zombie buffalo. Also wagons.Length: 1-3 hoursScore: 5.75/10Full Review: Super Amazing Wagon Adventure (from here on SAWA) is a 2D side scrolling shooter with pixel graphics. Occasionally throughout the gameplay things will switch to a top down view, allowing you to shoot in all directions. You play as a group of three travelers, each one has 4 HP; all riding together in a wagon (never did quite figure out how the game determines who’s HP to subtract from). The game features randomized scenarios to boot. For the most part, it’s pretty simple stuff.But a review isn’t complete with just the quick summary, so let’s delve into it a bit more, shall we? Let’s begin with the game mechanics first. The bulk of the gameplay is the side scrolling shooting portion. From a gameplay perspective, it’s not anything spectacular, but it’s mildly fun. The screen scrolls automatically, and you can move up, down, back, and forth as it does; all the while shooting animals that you can pick up and use as food, or fending off attacking bandits. The top down portions let you walk about the screen and do much the same, you fend off attacking animals and bandits.The game also features different guns for one to use, such as a flamethrower, a basic machine gun, and even the ability to summon a jet to carpet bomb the entire screen. Play-wise, it’s not the grandest thing out there, but it works alright.The game is designed to have randomized scenarios, so as to mix up the game a bit. The game still follows the same basic progression each time, starting out in a forest, then encountering a river, then the plains, etc. But the individual scenarios that make up each of those vary, and some scenarios are more common than others. The game will sometimes even give you occasional binary options, for example allowing you to use your wagon to ford a river, or alternatively you can try jumping over the river. While this doesn’t mix up the gameplay too greatly, it does help add a bit more to it, especially during the first couple times playing.The different scenarios are one of the things the game does better, as in addition to adding more variety, they also provide a small dose of humour. Granted, it’s of the “lol so random” variety, and while it’s cheap and juvenile, it’s still moderately enjoyable, and I did chuckle at a few of them. Such as the time I tried to jump over a river and a gust of wind sucked me into outer space, where I was attacked by buffalo. Or when the volcano erupted and rained hellfire upon my trusty wagon while flaming wolves assaulted me from the stream of lava that was chasing me. And the time when the tornado sucked me up and threw even more buffalo towards my party. (The game has a lot of buffalo).As you play through the game you’ll be able to unlock different wagons by completing certain events in game. Follow a unicorn and defend yourself from its horde of brethren before slaying a dragon and you get a fantasy style carriage. Discover prehistoric dinosaurs and you can ride upon a triceratops, and throw dinosaur eggs that explode with baby pterodactyls that home in on enemies.The game itself isn’t very long, and a successful run through will only take about 10-15 minutes, but you’ll die a few times along the way. Chances are it’ll take you between 1-3 hours to finish your wagon adventure.The difficulty in the game is a bit wonky, as while the gameplay itself isn’t too terribly difficult, it can be a bit cheap sometimes with how the RNG gods decide to treat you. You may, for instance, suddenly contract the measles, dropping your health down to 1 HP for a single character, or to suddenly being blessed with an additional party member to join your wagon (effectively another set of hit points). Point being that a lot of the difficulty comes down to random events that are beyond your control, and sometimes are the make or break for successfully finishing the game. That’s a rather poor way to handle difficulty, and it’s a strike against the game.In addition to the main game, there are also a couple different survival modes that let you see how long you can last against different hordes of wild animals, aiming of course for the best score possible.Completing the game will unlock a shuffle mode, which throws random scenarios at you from the game, which you play until your entire party dies. Your score is how many scenarios you can complete before something claims your life.The game’s graphics are done in a retro pixel art style, and really aren’t anything special. They aren’t great looking retro style throwback, in the vein of a game like Shovel Knight or Hotline Miami. They’re bare bones, and they’re really just there. Which I guess is okay for what the game is, but they’re nothing to get excited about. Likewise, the music for the game isn’t very notable either.In the end, it’s by no means a must have game, but it’s only $3, and it sometimes goes on sale for even less than that. So while even at that price point it’s not a must have, it can be a fun way to kill some time if you’re in the mood for this sort of thing.			"

												When I was little, I bought this game beacause I had watched a video on it. But I could never get past a group of bandits that were unavoidable. I was desperate to find a solution, and even tried to search up cheats*. Eventually, I lost hope.Years later, I was just browsing my games when I decided to revisit this game, hoping I'd be better at it.That was one of the best decisions I've ever made.This is a wonderful and wonderfully hard game, yet it's never punishing**. It's packed with action, adventure, things to do, unlockables, story, a bit of customization, and it will make you laugh at some point or another. If you are looking into this game, my advice is to stop reading this review and buy it. You won't regret your purchase.*Don't do that, by the way. I got no decent results.**Though, it may make you feel unlucky.			"

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is fun, there isn't to much more to say about it, it's a side scrolling (for the must part) shooter parody of the Oregon Trail games, it can be completly ridiculous at times, like going into space, fighting glitches, unicorns, dragons, and so on. But that just adds to the charm and humor to the game. You might not spend to much time on it, but it's worth the price, it's an easy to pick up and play a round or two to blow off some steam kind of game.			"

												A fun little game that you can pick up for under $5. Personally I bought this game pre-pre-alpha (in the ""idea"" stage) where I purchased a copy for just shy of 50 grand. I personally think this was well worth my time as a media buyer, and a frequent follower of up-and-coming video games. Along with the hit game Block and Load, I believe to have my invested $67 000 return IN TRIPLE by at least November of the year 2916. My favourite feature of this game has to be the AK47 and Intervention. The guns were made really well and the quickscoping is so good			"

												This is the kind of game that makes me question if I should continue to bother with video games or not. Am I just wasting my time? Are these games that've been hyped to heaven with almost no backlash just bald-faced lies spitting in my face? I have come to this point after wasting so much of my life, throwing myself over 20 hours closer to my death, playing this repetitive, poorly balanced, poorly made-in-general piece of ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Yes, I despise this game. I have finally come to terms with that conclusion. I tried giving it one more chance after my first (also negative) review that's now deleted, unlocked a few more wagons and modes, but nothing changed for me except the growing hatred for this game, my grown distrust for popular consensus and for sources of game coverage I thought were reliable, and the weariness this has brought upon my life in general. I really, really hate this game.OK to start: what it looks like: an absurdist, tongue-in-cheek parody of Oregon Trail (obviously), like the video game equivalent of a Mel Brooks or an old Zucker/Abrahams movie. And that description is accurate to some extent. This is a game full of zany, random occurrences, ridiculous humor, and gameplay that, to put it one way, bears little resemblance to the original Oregon Trail. This is all just window dressing though. Strip it aside and what you have instead is a really awful vertical shmup mixed in with awful twin-stick shooter segments with a factor of randomization added to try to give it variation but they bungled it up so badly that it makes already badly done mechanics more frustrating.If there is a singular goal in this game, it's to unlock all the wagons, since doing so requires accomplishing pretty much every possible task in the game. One wagon requires you not only unlock all five levels in survival mode, but get three full stars in all of them (which means surviving three or more minutes), another requires unlocking ""shuffle mode"" where you must survive as many randomly ordered scenes from the main game in a row (to get the wagon you need to survive 50), and unlocking the final wagon means completing the main adventure with ALL the wagons. Most of the wagons are unlocked by stumbling upon and surviving random scenarios, some rarer than others, in the game. The main adventure allows you to ride a wagon with three attendants, which you can customize to some degree by gender, hair style, hair color, manner and color of dress, skin color, eyes, and facial hair (reserved for the men only). This is probably the most fun part of the game, not that it's necessarily interesting in itself, even if it is amusing, but because it's the one and only thing in this game that doesn't cause immense suffering. Then you pick your wagon which you only have one to start with and, if I'm being perfectly honest, is probably better than the majority of wagons I've tried so far. It sucks, but it sucks less so than some of the other crap you get. Now the concepts for the wagons sound fun but actually playing with them? No. The magic wagon has probably the worst default weapon of everything in the game, firing spread ""magic"" shots in wide angles, too wide actually, and disintegrates things when it kill them meaning you can't collect precious animal hides with it (better get a power-up!), and it fires slowly at that. The invisible wagon starts you off with 1 health for everyone, no joke, as a compromise for how small and easily maneuverable it is. If you survive the first areas and can grab full health for everyone it's great, otherwise, good luck. The space shuttle starts you all off with TWO health, has an even larger hit box than the other wagons (which are too big as it is, making the NES Silver Surfer's seem like a pixel by comparison), has only the same regular attack as the main wagon, and is faster, meaning, harder to control when you're faced by a barrage of enemies and herds of buffalo who will most assuredly kill you much faster. I could go on about how annoying and unfun some other wagons are but really it's the game itself that's out to get you more than the crappiness of your wagons (though that doesn't help).OK like I said the game is randomized, but not to the extent a roguelike or even some roguelites would take it. It's more like a Tower of Guns roguelite where there is a small amount of randomization but with mostly clear-cut, set paths, level designs and so forth, the difference being that Tower of Guns was actually not a terrible game (I gave up on some of its frustrating challenges eventually but for the most part had a good time with it). The game begins the same way every single time - you kill animals for fur, run into some bandits, seek either wild berries (or if the game wants to ♥♥♥♥ you over, shrooms, though surviving that once does unlock a wagon - but after that, it grows tiresome), then you come to a river crossing, where you can either jump or ford it. Most of the wagons are too slow, clunky and big to bother fording, so I always jumped (which sometimes landed me in the river anyway, getting me hit by boulders coming downriver). There is one set of boulders where you must wait for them to come down, with a space opening up to go through but I swear unless you have a fast-moving wagon this is literally impossible to get through without getting hit. And it goes on and on and on. The game itself is not that long, but you will be assuredly killed repeatedly due to the crappiness of the mechanics and the random events which will screw you over big time.Sometimes the game asks if you want to investigate something, like distant gunfire (which is either a bank or train robbery), but a lot of times it forces you into situations that you don't want to go into. Like, no, I don't want to save the injured falcon or get the poison gun for the billionth time, especially if I'm at the brink of death and have a perfectly capable gun already at my disposal. But it will anyway and you have no choice but to go along with it. Some situations you may as well quit your game since you will get bent if you encounter them. Like having to travel to a distant trader for a new wheel with the falcon with coyotes all over you. These segments are long and the falcon really sucks at taking down large numbers of fast-moving enemies at once. Then you die and you must repeat the process with one of the other surviving characters and you die again. And if you're forced to meet a woman in a red dress and she turns into a bandit, just... quit right there. After that you will be assaulted by bandits you have no chance of winning against. Oh, and buffalo. I don't know how you're supposed to survive the large herds of buffalo with a large wagon without a decent weapon, and if your characters (idiotically) decide they're ""bored"" and speed through the herd, you're dead, and frankly they deserve it for being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid as to speed through buffalo to be trampled to death by them and your poorly handled vehicle. Oh yeah there are ""twin stick"" segments where you might be alone on foot and fight enemies without your wagon or compadres. Your hitbox is more reasonable, but movement never felt ""right"" nor did the mouse aiming. There are too many fast-moving, tiny enemies hard to hit with your puny weapons with you being too slow to outrun them and eventually you'll be circled and killed. That's actually more a complaint of the survival mode than of the main game but it can happen. But no matter where you die, whether by buffalo, by wolves on a mountain, or river boulders, the game always feels so inanely repetitive. You will encounter every scenario, of which there are very few, so many times trying to complete the game with one of your many crappy wagons and failing that it becomes a mentally numbing experience. I don't want to hunt more wildlife, bandits, berries, or choose to cross or ford rivers ever again. This is sheer endurance, not fun.			"

Quick Breakdown: A side scrolling shooter with occasional top down segments. The game features buffalo, underwater buffalo, space buffalo, flying buffalo, flaming buffalo, and zombie buffalo. Also wagons.Length: 1-3 hoursScore: 5.75/10Full Review: Super Amazing Wagon Adventure (from here on SAWA) is a 2D side scrolling shooter with pixel graphics. Occasionally throughout the gameplay things will switch to a top down view, allowing you to shoot in all directions. You play as a group of three travelers, each one has 4 HP; all riding together in a wagon (never did quite figure out how the game determines who’s HP to subtract from). The game features randomized scenarios to boot. For the most part, it’s pretty simple stuff.But a review isn’t complete with just the quick summary, so let’s delve into it a bit more, shall we? Let’s begin with the game mechanics first. The bulk of the gameplay is the side scrolling shooting portion. From a gameplay perspective, it’s not anything spectacular, but it’s mildly fun. The screen scrolls automatically, and you can move up, down, back, and forth as it does; all the while shooting animals that you can pick up and use as food, or fending off attacking bandits. The top down portions let you walk about the screen and do much the same, you fend off attacking animals and bandits.The game also features different guns for one to use, such as a flamethrower, a basic machine gun, and even the ability to summon a jet to carpet bomb the entire screen. Play-wise, it’s not the grandest thing out there, but it works alright.The game is designed to have randomized scenarios, so as to mix up the game a bit. The game still follows the same basic progression each time, starting out in a forest, then encountering a river, then the plains, etc. But the individual scenarios that make up each of those vary, and some scenarios are more common than others. The game will sometimes even give you occasional binary options, for example allowing you to use your wagon to ford a river, or alternatively you can try jumping over the river. While this doesn’t mix up the gameplay too greatly, it does help add a bit more to it, especially during the first couple times playing.The different scenarios are one of the things the game does better, as in addition to adding more variety, they also provide a small dose of humour. Granted, it’s of the “lol so random” variety, and while it’s cheap and juvenile, it’s still moderately enjoyable, and I did chuckle at a few of them. Such as the time I tried to jump over a river and a gust of wind sucked me into outer space, where I was attacked by buffalo. Or when the volcano erupted and rained hellfire upon my trusty wagon while flaming wolves assaulted me from the stream of lava that was chasing me. And the time when the tornado sucked me up and threw even more buffalo towards my party. (The game has a lot of buffalo).As you play through the game you’ll be able to unlock different wagons by completing certain events in game. Follow a unicorn and defend yourself from its horde of brethren before slaying a dragon and you get a fantasy style carriage. Discover prehistoric dinosaurs and you can ride upon a triceratops, and throw dinosaur eggs that explode with baby pterodactyls that home in on enemies.The game itself isn’t very long, and a successful run through will only take about 10-15 minutes, but you’ll die a few times along the way. Chances are it’ll take you between 1-3 hours to finish your wagon adventure.The difficulty in the game is a bit wonky, as while the gameplay itself isn’t too terribly difficult, it can be a bit cheap sometimes with how the RNG gods decide to treat you. You may, for instance, suddenly contract the measles, dropping your health down to 1 HP for a single character, or to suddenly being blessed with an additional party member to join your wagon (effectively another set of hit points). Point being that a lot of the difficulty comes down to random events that are beyond your control, and sometimes are the make or break for successfully finishing the game. That’s a rather poor way to handle difficulty, and it’s a strike against the game.In addition to the main game, there are also a couple different survival modes that let you see how long you can last against different hordes of wild animals, aiming of course for the best score possible.Completing the game will unlock a shuffle mode, which throws random scenarios at you from the game, which you play until your entire party dies. Your score is how many scenarios you can complete before something claims your life.The game’s graphics are done in a retro pixel art style, and really aren’t anything special. They aren’t great looking retro style throwback, in the vein of a game like Shovel Knight or Hotline Miami. They’re bare bones, and they’re really just there. Which I guess is okay for what the game is, but they’re nothing to get excited about. Likewise, the music for the game isn’t very notable either.In the end, it’s by no means a must have game, but it’s only $3, and it sometimes goes on sale for even less than that. So while even at that price point it’s not a must have, it can be a fun way to kill some time if you’re in the mood for this sort of thing.			"

												This game is a strange one. The best way I can describe it is to call it a retro adventure shooter with hilarious absurdity. This is a fun game with solid gameplay, a unique graphical style and very few (if any) glitches. There are multiple hilarious scenarios, each wavering in challenge and difficulty. This is a difficult game, and a few of the wagon unlocks seem impossible. The turbo edition is a brilliant patch of content. I can give it a solid 7/10.			"

The best part is the game is short, full of little microgame-like shooter levels, so that after you die in some ridiculous fashion you can quickly restart and send your covered wagon over the plains, through the rivers, into the outer spaces, and everywhere!  The chunky pixel art is great.  The random story told each time is amazing.  Buy this game...you will not regret it!			"

Though it says that it feels like a new adventure everytime and that its randomized it felt repetitive to me like i was doing the same stuff over and over again which is why i only enjoyed for a couple of minutes before i started getting bored of it. other than that the game is awesome with tight controls and nice 8-bit graphics that really make it i would buy it if its on sale if not save your money and get something else.""Future me"" ok ok i have put in a good hour or so of this game and holy crap its adicting ok in the first part of the review i was knocking it but this game if funny with all the random crap it make you do cant stop but laugh every playthrough though it does feel repetitive sometimes i still enjoy it buy this game if its on sale like i said befor its not worth the full price but on discount yes :D 10/10			"

Quick Breakdown: A side scrolling shooter with occasional top down segments. The game features buffalo, underwater buffalo, space buffalo, flying buffalo, flaming buffalo, and zombie buffalo. Also wagons.Length: 1-3 hoursScore: 5.75/10Full Review: Super Amazing Wagon Adventure (from here on SAWA) is a 2D side scrolling shooter with pixel graphics. Occasionally throughout the gameplay things will switch to a top down view, allowing you to shoot in all directions. You play as a group of three travelers, each one has 4 HP; all riding together in a wagon (never did quite figure out how the game determines who’s HP to subtract from). The game features randomized scenarios to boot. For the most part, it’s pretty simple stuff.But a review isn’t complete with just the quick summary, so let’s delve into it a bit more, shall we? Let’s begin with the game mechanics first. The bulk of the gameplay is the side scrolling shooting portion. From a gameplay perspective, it’s not anything spectacular, but it’s mildly fun. The screen scrolls automatically, and you can move up, down, back, and forth as it does; all the while shooting animals that you can pick up and use as food, or fending off attacking bandits. The top down portions let you walk about the screen and do much the same, you fend off attacking animals and bandits.The game also features different guns for one to use, such as a flamethrower, a basic machine gun, and even the ability to summon a jet to carpet bomb the entire screen. Play-wise, it’s not the grandest thing out there, but it works alright.The game is designed to have randomized scenarios, so as to mix up the game a bit. The game still follows the same basic progression each time, starting out in a forest, then encountering a river, then the plains, etc. But the individual scenarios that make up each of those vary, and some scenarios are more common than others. The game will sometimes even give you occasional binary options, for example allowing you to use your wagon to ford a river, or alternatively you can try jumping over the river. While this doesn’t mix up the gameplay too greatly, it does help add a bit more to it, especially during the first couple times playing.The different scenarios are one of the things the game does better, as in addition to adding more variety, they also provide a small dose of humour. Granted, it’s of the “lol so random” variety, and while it’s cheap and juvenile, it’s still moderately enjoyable, and I did chuckle at a few of them. Such as the time I tried to jump over a river and a gust of wind sucked me into outer space, where I was attacked by buffalo. Or when the volcano erupted and rained hellfire upon my trusty wagon while flaming wolves assaulted me from the stream of lava that was chasing me. And the time when the tornado sucked me up and threw even more buffalo towards my party. (The game has a lot of buffalo).As you play through the game you’ll be able to unlock different wagons by completing certain events in game. Follow a unicorn and defend yourself from its horde of brethren before slaying a dragon and you get a fantasy style carriage. Discover prehistoric dinosaurs and you can ride upon a triceratops, and throw dinosaur eggs that explode with baby pterodactyls that home in on enemies.The game itself isn’t very long, and a successful run through will only take about 10-15 minutes, but you’ll die a few times along the way. Chances are it’ll take you between 1-3 hours to finish your wagon adventure.The difficulty in the game is a bit wonky, as while the gameplay itself isn’t too terribly difficult, it can be a bit cheap sometimes with how the RNG gods decide to treat you. You may, for instance, suddenly contract the measles, dropping your health down to 1 HP for a single character, or to suddenly being blessed with an additional party member to join your wagon (effectively another set of hit points). Point being that a lot of the difficulty comes down to random events that are beyond your control, and sometimes are the make or break for successfully finishing the game. That’s a rather poor way to handle difficulty, and it’s a strike against the game.In addition to the main game, there are also a couple different survival modes that let you see how long you can last against different hordes of wild animals, aiming of course for the best score possible.Completing the game will unlock a shuffle mode, which throws random scenarios at you from the game, which you play until your entire party dies.

""It's like a cheap deep-fried food you usually find on the street food corner. Not too filling and kind of unhealthy, but it's cheap and you can eat it while on the way.""Super Amazing Wagon Adventure created by sparsevector back in 2013. In this game, you play as 3 migrants travelling west....And that's where the similarities end. To put it simple, this game is a retro-like side-scroll shooter with randomness and humor that's all around the place. Expect wacky situations to occured when travelling west. - Civil war? Check.- Bank robery? Check.- Zombies? Check.- Battling inner demon? Check.- And many moreEven your migrant's death descriptions are funny. Well, in most cases. One playthrough usually last about approximately 10 minutes (maybe more, maybe less). While some argue that the short duration of each gameplay can hurt the replay value, that's not really the case in the game. There are variety of wagons that can be unlockable during the main story, and because of the randomness, you can't really unlock them during one gameplay. And the way to unlock the said wagon also worthwhile. What else I could say about the game?- Controls are responsive- The sound assets are catchy, and kinda fit with the whole wacky nature of the game. - The system requirements are lowProbably the only thing I dislike about the game are the screen transitions. It's kinda fast sometimes, I can't finish reading the text. Because of the wackiness, I don't really recommend this to people that hate randomness in their games. But if you like unpredictable situations, do get this game. It's cheap, fun, and can be done in a short time, something rare these days (IMO). TL;DR: A quick game that you can play when taking a short break from your activity, and also fun.Also, one last word. Buffalo "

												I bought this game  after only watching the trailer during steam sale (it was €0,90 back then). After you die you just HAVE to start again, also the different wagons brings up the completionist in me. Only disappointmet is no steam achievements, but overall a great game for it's price tag!			"

												I bought this game during the Steam Summer sale for a dollar and some change. I've heard very good things about this game and honestly, it's all it lives up to be and then some. At first, the game plays out pretty well and there's a few good moments that's genuinely comedic but after playing more than 30 minutes of the game, you begin to actually take the game seriously and find that some parts are unforgiving if not seemingly impossible.I've currently unlocked about 6-8 of the wagons so far but not each without their own pain of doing so. The game becomes reptitive after a while and some of the challenges more frustrating than funny. I can't tell you how many times I've threw out a f-bomb when dying by ninjas in an event I cannot control or trying to navigate a maze with falling boulders and ravenous wolves or running down a river with boulders that you cannot navigate through (or destroy because a lack of a good gun). Over all, the game is enjoyable and something you can sit back and play for 15 minutes at a time but if you plan to play more of it, prepare for a kick in the balls because this game is quickly unforgiving.

												A fun little game that you can pick up for under $5. Personally I bought this game pre-pre-alpha (in the ""idea"" stage) where I purchased a copy for just shy of 50 grand. I personally think this was well worth my time as a media buyer, and a frequent follower of up-and-coming video games. Along with the hit game Block and Load, I believe to have my invested $67 000 return IN TRIPLE by at least November of the year 2916. My favourite feature of this game has to be the AK47 and Intervention. The guns were made really well and the quickscoping is so good			"

												System Specs:i3-4150, EVGA 750ti Superclocked ITX system. Resolution: 1920x1080Average framerate: 100000000Graphics settings: Atari 2600Input device used: Xbox 360 Gamepad, Wii U Pro controller with Mayflower Adapter. Gameplay: Amazing, unpredictable, hilarious. Super fast-paced and quite difficult depending on what wagon type you're using. Characters die at random. Watch out for bear dens and spiders! It's like the oregon trail on crack and often feels like a bullethell. Story, Characters: The story and characters' names and likenesses change with every playthough. You're a caravan of settlers trying to settle. You can customize characters and input the names of your friends or enemies! Atmosphere, Graphics: Atari-like graphics with vivid colours.  I recommend you play in CRT mode for some pre-birth nostalgia!Sound/Music:Fun chip-tune music. The best music is in the timed survival mode.I'd like to add that this game gets very difficult and it definitely helps if you do not use the standard wagon, especially near the end levels. To be honest, I was never patient (or skilled) enough to finish it myself, but had tonnes of fun watching a friend get frustrated, but masterfully beat it. The weapon/cart upgrades and ever-changing story make every playthrough unique and fun-filled. 8.0/10 "

It's pretty darn difficult, but it's still pretty sweet. I'm not usually a fan of shoot 'em ups like this, but this one I enjoyed quite heavily. Considering I'm not usually a fan of shoot 'em ups, fans of the genre may want to look at other reviews of people more familiar with the genre to determine its merit more definately.			"

												For only a dollar or two, this is an excellent game that's as ridiculously difficult as it is funny. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is basically a shoot 'em up / bullet hell type of game that starts very slowly and that adds more and more and more elements to the mix until you can't take it, putting you in situations where you must dodge rabid bears while shooting at bandits while steering your wagon through flaming tumbleweeds. The gameplay is very simple, but the developers really nailed the difficulty right, which forces you to constantly stay on your toes and expect the worst possible outcome. Random elements and choices leading to several possible outcomes ensure a different playthrough almost everytime you try to clear the game and there are several fun unlockables for completionists.Come for the price tag, stay for the hilarity, and make sure all your friends get to try it as you watch.

Quick Breakdown: A side scrolling shooter with occasional top down segments. The game features buffalo, underwater buffalo, space buffalo, flying buffalo, flaming buffalo, and zombie buffalo. Also wagons.Length: 1-3 hoursScore: 5.75/10Full Review: Super Amazing Wagon Adventure (from here on SAWA) is a 2D side scrolling shooter with pixel graphics. Occasionally throughout the gameplay things will switch to a top down view, allowing you to shoot in all directions. You play as a group of three travelers, each one has 4 HP; all riding together in a wagon (never did quite figure out how the game determines who’s HP to subtract from). The game features randomized scenarios to boot. For the most part, it’s pretty simple stuff.But a review isn’t complete with just the quick summary, so let’s delve into it a bit more, shall we? Let’s begin with the game mechanics first. The bulk of the gameplay is the side scrolling shooting portion. From a gameplay perspective, it’s not anything spectacular, but it’s mildly fun. The screen scrolls automatically, and you can move up, down, back, and forth as it does; all the while shooting animals that you can pick up and use as food, or fending off attacking bandits. The top down portions let you walk about the screen and do much the same, you fend off attacking animals and bandits.The game also features different guns for one to use, such as a flamethrower, a basic machine gun, and even the ability to summon a jet to carpet bomb the entire screen. Play-wise, it’s not the grandest thing out there, but it works alright.The game is designed to have randomized scenarios, so as to mix up the game a bit. The game still follows the same basic progression each time, starting out in a forest, then encountering a river, then the plains, etc. But the individual scenarios that make up each of those vary, and some scenarios are more common than others. The game will sometimes even give you occasional binary options, for example allowing you to use your wagon to ford a river, or alternatively you can try jumping over the river. While this doesn’t mix up the gameplay too greatly, it does help add a bit more to it, especially during the first couple times playing.The different scenarios are one of the things the game does better, as in addition to adding more variety, they also provide a small dose of humour. Granted, it’s of the “lol so random” variety, and while it’s cheap and juvenile, it’s still moderately enjoyable, and I did chuckle at a few of them. Such as the time I tried to jump over a river and a gust of wind sucked me into outer space, where I was attacked by buffalo. Or when the volcano erupted and rained hellfire upon my trusty wagon while flaming wolves assaulted me from the stream of lava that was chasing me. And the time when the tornado sucked me up and threw even more buffalo towards my party. (The game has a lot of buffalo).As you play through the game you’ll be able to unlock different wagons by completing certain events in game. Follow a unicorn and defend yourself from its horde of brethren before slaying a dragon and you get a fantasy style carriage. Discover prehistoric dinosaurs and you can ride upon a triceratops, and throw dinosaur eggs that explode with baby pterodactyls that home in on enemies.The game itself isn’t very long, and a successful run through will only take about 10-15 minutes, but you’ll die a few times along the way. Chances are it’ll take you between 1-3 hours to finish your wagon adventure.The difficulty in the game is a bit wonky, as while the gameplay itself isn’t too terribly difficult, it can be a bit cheap sometimes with how the RNG gods decide to treat you. You may, for instance, suddenly contract the measles, dropping your health down to 1 HP for a single character, or to suddenly being blessed with an additional party member to join your wagon (effectively another set of hit points). Point being that a lot of the difficulty comes down to random events that are beyond your control, and sometimes are the make or break for successfully finishing the game. That’s a rather poor way to handle difficulty, and it’s a strike against the game.In addition to the main game, there are also a couple different survival modes that let you see how long you can last against different hordes of wild animals, aiming of course for the best score possible.Completing the game will unlock a shuffle mode, which throws random scenarios at you from the game, which you play until your entire party dies. Your score is how many scenarios you can complete before something claims your life.The game’s graphics are done in a retro pixel art style, and really aren’t anything special. They aren’t great looking retro style throwback, in the vein of a game like Shovel Knight or Hotline Miami. They’re bare bones, and they’re really just there. Which I guess is okay for what the game is, but they’re nothing to get excited about. Likewise, the music for the game isn’t very notable either.In the end, it’s by no means a must have game, but it’s only $3, and it sometimes goes on sale for even less than that. So while even at that price point it’s not a must have, it can be a fun way to kill some time if you’re in the mood for this sort of thing.			"

Cowboys! You're thrown into the deep end at times; whether it's fighting a previously undiscovered boss on one heart and yelling out loud as you die, or tearing through animals in the hopes of getting that pistol upgrade, there's always fun to be had in your Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.

												On my first playthrough I took the wagon hunting and shot some skunks and squirrels only to be attacked by a horder of vicious carnaverous squirrels. After fending them off I was finally finished off a machine gun cart. Sure it was fun and amusing, maybe the squirrel horde was a bit outlandish, but all in all, it was an experience consistent with what be expected from an adventure in the West...Then on my second playthrough I was led by a lone unicorn into a unicorn ambush and mauled to death by these heavenly creatures.

												It's not bad at all, actually. It takes the premise of Oregon Trail (with several jars of salt) but gives you direct control over the cart, allowing you to dodge or shoot hazards with a varity of weapons as absurd as the encounters themselves. It isn't a game that can be played for hours at a time, however, and while there is plenty of content you may find that the core concept isn't engaging enough to drive you to unlock everything.			"

												Game: Super Amazing Wagon AdventureGenre: Joke (Ha Ha!) The Good: - Many different wagons - Character customization - You can just pick up and play. - Puts a wacky twist on the oregon trail... The Bad - ...Yet sometimes doesn't make any sense at all. - Another 8-bit game (Yawn) - You are mostly just moving around and occassionally shooting some buffalo. - Sections last a bit too short (You lose when it gets interesting) Overall: SMWA is a short and boring game. If you want to waste time than buy it. Otherwise stay away from it for even $3.Rating: 4.3/10Buffalo			"

												Haha this  is a really cool game. If you're turned on by the idea of 80's arcade graphics and game play, with todays humor then you're in for a fun little game. Think of it like a mini game in the same way out run was a game. I am kinda high whilst writing this so yeah, this should be interesting.Perks: It has percs like hunting your own food! Simply spam the space bar when behind some critters and bam, dinner is served.It has nice graphics! Even though they are very old school, the colours are very very well done. The right blend has turned them up very nice indeed. It has Vehicles! Yes you heard me. You ACTUALLY get to ride around in a horse drawn cart while you shoot at outlaws and critters. (Next one was going to be drive by shootings). Of course, the game being Super Amazing WAGON adventure didn't hint there to be a vehicle now did it?It has many other perks which I am either too high, or too stoned to remember right now and not too many negatives.THE NEGATIVES!That blasted ""GAME OVER"" sign. God I HATE THAT!!!			"

												This game is rediculous, it's a shmup combined with the oregon trail where you can go into space, underwater, into the future on a highway, fight dinosaurs rabid squirrels, a dragon and probably a million other things I haven't found yet. It's pretty darn difficult, but it's still pretty sweet. I'm not usually a fan of shoot 'em ups like this, but this one I enjoyed quite heavily. Considering I'm not usually a fan of shoot 'em ups, fans of the genre may want to look at other reviews of people more familiar with the genre to determine its merit more definately.			"

												Super amazing wagon adventure is a retro looking game where you control a group of three migrants in a long journey.You can customize their names and face looks, then you choose one kind of wagon to travel with , there's several to unlock aalmost 20.The game is very basic you control the wagon and shoot, easier with a gamepad, every minute or so you will be presented with a choice, jump the river or ford it, investigate random noises or keep going, etc. and random events, one of your migrants being sick, your oxen feeling sick, stop to gather berries and be attacked by bears, jump so high you end up fighting stuff in outer space, be sucked up by a tornado and avoid falling cows, etc.The game is quite fun for just 3$ but after an hour or two it kind of loses it charm, the first 5 minutes is always the same, kill some animals, kill some bandits, it could have more events in the game but at that price it's easily worth it.

												I followed a unicorn hoping it would lead to magic or at least more guns to fight off river boulders and bandits. But alas, the unicorn lead us into an ambush! They were everywhere, Mary was impaled on a horn, Sgt.Bigdick swore vengeance. He had loved her ever since they sat around a campfire and talked about feelings to regain health. He found a tactical carpet bombing and called it in saying ""See you all in hell."" under his breath. But, somehow he and LD had survived, they looked around them, blood and horns everywhere...to Sgt.Bigdick it was beautiful revenge, but to LD it seemed as though Sgt. had gone mad. They were on their merry way when suddenly, bandits. LD picked up a bow and was able to shoot a few before he ran out of arrows. Sgt.Bigdick pulls out his trusty pistol that never runs out of ammo for some reason, but now was not the time to question it. He was able to pick off 5 bandits before a machine gun bandit came in and shot Sgt.Bigdick within an inch of his life, the group found a rocket launcher aimed and blew up the machine gun bandit. The party comes across a river, Sgt.Bigdick obviously suffering from blood loss has the idea to jump it before fading out of consciousness. LD had the significantly better idea to ford the river, at first all was fine then...the boulders...so many boulders. Sgt. woke up just in time to be crushed by a boulder. LD was in tears as he finally made it across the river. Just as he thought nothing could be worse than losing his superior officer...a herd of buffalo appear. LD finds a flamethrower and roasts all of the buffalo without sustaining a scratch. But then, BUFFALO...""no""LD whispers...BUFFALO...BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO. LD goes down in a blaze of glory fighting till he couldn't bear to go on at one health left he sees an on-coming buffalo, this was it, this was the end. He had lost all of his friends, it was time...LD drove the wagon ox first into the buffalo and was immediately trampled to death. BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO 10/10 Would BUFFALO again.

												This game is absolutely amazing. It's simple and there isn't much to it but it makes up for that by being absolutely hilarious. The randomly generate scenarios it comes up with will keep you laughing. If I had to complain about one thing it would be that some of the scenarios happen every time so you begin to get a little tired of them. Although for as little as the game costs you can't really complain about there being a little bit of redundancy.			"

												Best played when you customise the party of travellers to be you and your two best friends. The initial setting of it is based on a clasic game, The Oregon Trail. A party of travellers are making the arduous journey to begin life anew... Unlike the Oregon Trail though, the events in this game are as random as you can imagine. In no other game have I experienced my friend Vee play up to the mad animal lover she is to rescue a falcon from the roadside then been attacked by zombies then laugh as my friend Josh got melted by a god damn Dragon!If you need a laugh (or even if you dont), GET THIS GAME!

												I generally like to get a dollar an hour out of playing a game, if possible. At that rate, I consider a game a wondrous success for raw entertainment value, alone. This game has 6 hours on it from me, as of writing this, At 3 dollars, that's $.50 an hour for that entertainment. It's funny, raw and just exactly what it is meant to be.

												This game is something special. It's a hilarious trip through the Western Trail with an incredible amount of replayability. Every game is random, but you can normally find most of the scenarios the game can play out within a couple hours. Despite that, the game is only three dollars. You can get more out of this game than you can most sixty dollar games. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this.			"

												And so after defeating The Pirate Ship of Blackbeard while fording the river, Danielle and Joey were killed by a herd of buffalos, and after that, Katy thought about his fallen companions, and was killed by a horde of zombies, therefore starting The Great West Coast Infection of 1856.RIP Danielle, Joey, and Kat.Great game, really worth it on sale, and I would've dropped the money for the base price. Hilarious at the right moments, pretty hard on the first tries, and a nice replayability from what I can tell. Don't regret the purchase.Edit: So, I was just ambushed in a clearing by a herd of Unicorns. If you were on the hinge about buying this, do it. Now.			"

												Simply put, this game is a cross between Oregon Trail and WarioWare.  The story is a fast-changing, completely random journey to the West Coast.  Throughout your journey, there will be quick mini-games that mostly involve avoiding objects and shooting animals and bandits.  I smiled the entire time and LOL'd during several moments.  Highly Recommended.  SCORE:  9/10			"

												The hardy pioneers who traveled west in their covered wagons faced many dangers: weather, dangerous river crossings, bears, narwhals, machine gun bandits, diseased monkeys, lava, malevolent glitches... Now you, too, can experience this historically accurate retelling of how the West was won.In terms of gameplay, it's a short but replayable, increasingly silly series of mini-games with many variations on shooting and dodging obstacles. I've been laughing enough at even a few minutes' play of this -- four fatal encounters with the above and more -- that I've gotten my money's worth already. You can appreciate this game more if you've played ""The Oregon Trail"", but it's not necessary.			"

												This is a game that does everything right gameplaywise in the sense that your mistakes are (usually) the only reason you lost health/died, your choices are the only things getting you into sticky situations, and your knowledge and skill at and of the game is the only determining factor in how far you get. You're going to die quickly your first few times, and that's okay. This game is what many NES games were/should have been in the sense that it's not made to be beaten in a day, the same reason Castlevania is such a great game. You have to play it, fail, find out what you did wrong and learn from it, and you'll find yourself improving with every run. This never gets repetitive, as every run is different, with millions upon millions of different sets of events you could find your party going through, and more wagons being unlocked. Which wagon you choose out of your arsenal is up to you, you may choose a faster wagon to dodge projectiles, you may choose a wagon with a better weapon to fight off more enemies, or you may just go with the standard wagon because it's what works best for you. This is a game that lets you play it your way, choosing the path your party takes as you travel through a noticeably stranger 1830-1870's America, bobbing your head to the beat of the excellent soundtrack and giving a satisfied sigh at the NES-era graphics through this game, a game that gets my 10 out of 10.

												Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a game where you create a party of three to ride a wagon to migrate west.  It alternates between a side scroller (when you're in the wagon) and being able to wander around on the screen to acomplish a task (on foot)  Most of the time you're going to be trying to avoid death by shooting various enemies with an assortment of weapons.  But you don't get this game for the gameplay you get it for the story.  While you will figure out the general format after a bit of playing the game will still continue to through curve balls at you.  This game will kill you and your other 2 friends  in ways you never expected such as unicorn magic, UFOs, and your inner demons to name a few.  Be prepared to die a lot.  My only complaint is that there is no mouse sensitivity adjustment, so in game my mouse is has very low sensitivity which is annoying.  Fortunatly the game can be played with only a keybord and doesn't require a mouse.9.6/10			"

												I set off with myself, my adopted Jamaican uncle JoJo, and my platonic female friend Sexjoke.We realize we need food, meat specifically, to keep our spirits hardy during the long journey. We kill countless animals and store their corpses in our wagon, we will eat well...My company and I come across a legendary beast of old. The magestic yet misleading unicorn. Our feast for flesh knows no limits, so I consider killing the beast for food. I, being the leader, decide otherwise. ""No!"" I tell my companions. ""We shall follow this beast, and see will it takes us!""Ah unicorns are shifty beasts are they not? The magestic animal had led us into an ambush, and its brothers and sisters charged at us, their horns thirsting for blood. We fend them off and pick up their corpses for meat.We thought it was over, but suddenly a ferocious cross between a snake, a bird of prey, and a big cat comes out of nowhere to send us to meet our maker. A dragon! It breathes flaming hot fire onto our wagon, burning JoJo and I to death.Haunting the cart, I watch as Sexjoke valiantly defeats the vile creature. I've never been more proud.Mourning our deaths, she came across a roaring river, she could ford it, but she could attempt to jump over it.She chooses the latter, but miraculously survives, only to land in a family of bears, waking them from their slumber.One of them runs up to Sexjoke and hugs her, the force of said hug causes the poor lady to explode.Our journey is over, but we unlocked Fiona's wagon from Shrek.(10/10) Would die again...

Sure it was fun and amusing, maybe the squirrel horde was a bit outlandish, but all in all, it was an experience consistent with what be expected from an adventure in the West...Then on my second playthrough I was led by a lone unicorn into a unicorn ambush and mauled to death by these heavenly creatures.

												Is this game great? No.Is it fun? For a while.Is it hard? Artificially, yes. (Undodgeable objects, inability to heal outside of random chance, random drops in health via disease.)Is it roguelike? Partially. There are random events but only a select few that always occur at the same positions. Example is at the beginning you either get ambushed by Unicorns and fight a dragon or you get ambushed by bandits and fight a machine gun cart. Is this game entertaining? For a while, then it gets infuriatingly repetitive and boring as you never quite reach the end due to dumb luck. It would also be nice if the other carts weren't god awful or impossible to unlock. Reward players, don't cripple them when the odds are already stacked against them. EDIT: One really great thing about this game is the soundtrack. Even if the game is repetitive the soundtrack is enjoyable every time. The Great Plains music reminds me of the early days of Ninja Sex Party. Also the soundtrack is in the games files with remixes not in the game, so drop it into your music player of choice if you want to listen on the go.Do I recommend this game? Only on a sale. It is fun and it's a goofy game to introduce to friends. But it's basically a Newgrounds Flash Game, probably won't entertain past an 30min, an hour tops. $3 isn't bad but I've gotten better for free.			"

												This game is awesome, yet historically acurate.It narrates the short journey that those brave men and women took on the Wild West on the 19th century.As real people, they fought illneses, wolves, bandits, unicorns, laser weapons... And, that's how i remember history.The game is pretty fast, It mixes classic shoter scenes with ones with one of your oh so acurate travelers on foot, involved on looking for stuff, either to eat or to declare loves.Also, the variety of weapons is awesome. One second you are killing buffalos with a pistol, the other you have a flamethrower. Or a bow. Or a falcon, Or something like a bullet-train.To sum up: get the game if you still havent.And, If you excuse me, I'll try to save my adventurers yet again (hopefully unsuccesfully)			"

												There's not a lot to this game, but then it doesn't try to be much. The humor and complete randomness makes it tough to play this game without a smile on your face. If you're looking for hours of fun, this isn't the game you're looking for (yes, that was a vague Star Wars reference). If you want to spend a few minutes here and there laughing as you and your friends die horrible deaths in the most random of ways, this is a great way to do so without actually subjecting the people you know to flaming buffalo stampedes.

												The hardy pioneers who traveled west in their covered wagons faced many dangers: weather, dangerous river crossings, bears, narwhals, machine gun bandits, diseased monkeys, lava, malevolent glitches... Now you, too, can experience this historically accurate retelling of how the West was won.In terms of gameplay, it's a short but replayable, increasingly silly series of mini-games with many variations on shooting and dodging obstacles. I've been laughing enough at even a few minutes' play of this -- four fatal encounters with the above and more -- that I've gotten my money's worth already. You can appreciate this game more if you've played ""The Oregon Trail"", but it's not necessary.			"

												This is a game that does everything right gameplaywise in the sense that your mistakes are (usually) the only reason you lost health/died, your choices are the only things getting you into sticky situations, and your knowledge and skill at and of the game is the only determining factor in how far you get. You're going to die quickly your first few times, and that's okay. This game is what many NES games were/should have been in the sense that it's not made to be beaten in a day, the same reason Castlevania is such a great game. You have to play it, fail, find out what you did wrong and learn from it, and you'll find yourself improving with every run. This never gets repetitive, as every run is different, with millions upon millions of different sets of events you could find your party going through, and more wagons being unlocked. Which wagon you choose out of your arsenal is up to you, you may choose a faster wagon to dodge projectiles, you may choose a wagon with a better weapon to fight off more enemies, or you may just go with the standard wagon because it's what works best for you. This is a game that lets you play it your way, choosing the path your party takes as you travel through a noticeably stranger 1830-1870's America, bobbing your head to the beat of the excellent soundtrack and giving a satisfied sigh at the NES-era graphics through this game, a game that gets my 10 out of 10.

												I love this game so much! It's kinda similar to the Oregon Trail (On MS DOS) but with so much more! You'll encounter Unicorns, Strange Space Machines, Pirates, and even Machine-Gun weilding Bandits! This game has everything! However the only thing I would like changed is how relationships can occur. Sometimes on your journey a party member will fall in love with another party member. I like this feature as it adds an extra layer to the randomness of this game. My only complaint with this is that you can't disable same-gender couples. On one of my journeys one of my party members (He was a guy and my best friend IRL) fell in love with my character (Who was also a guy). This didn't change too much but I was annoyed that I couldn't disable it. Other than that this is an amazing game set at an amazing price and you should try it out!			"

												Hilarious and surprisingly hard, this game is like Oregon Trail on drugs.  I played this game for over 12 hours and only beat it a couple of times, but it's so fun you won't even care about losing. With lots of different wagons to unlock and a semi-random progression, which is partially influenced by the player's choices, and the number of times you'll just lose, this game has a pretty high replay value.  At a price of $2.99, you'll never get so much for so little elsewhere. BUY THIS GAME.			"

A dangerous world full of adventure, hardship and style awaites our pixel heroes as they brandish their bravery, cunning, and bad fortune through the windernous and seemingly random, incomprehensible, and unlikely scenarios.A fun game, like Raiden X (whatever style that is, look it up. I am not going to do all the work for you) But play this game, it is great for fun parties and generates alot of laughts. Plus due to the difficulty you won't get to far so everyone can have a turn.			"

Between its dirt cheap price, it's huge degree of randomization and stuff to unlock, and the fact that it's kind of compelling means this is pretty much worth owning. It costs about as much as a candy bar and is a fantastic way to kill 10-20 minutes whilst waiting on other things.			"

												Huh, this'll be a nice relaxing sidescroller I can wind down with between other games.What the ♥♥♥♥ was I thinking.Not only is this game the most ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating game I have ever played, it is also one of the funniest thanks to its originality. Other reviews praise the game for the ""Shuffle"" mode which allows you to play a completely random generated journey. Shuffle mode is unlocked after the ""short"" Adventure Mode is completed...ATM I have over 16* hours in this game and have yet to beat this story mode. Never in my life have my mechanical keyboard and G502 been put to better use than killing 10-Pixel-People (yes) on a quest across the United States of America. (You may think this game is cheap at $3, but the investment into necessary gaming peripherals just to play the game properly, puts the cost at well over $150.)If you, like I was, are looking for a game to play between other games... think again. This will become the Game you take a break from, not the other way around. That said, the only reason you'll be taking a break is to calm down before you shatter your monitor in a rage fueled punch after you stand up and curse at the bison or bandits, once more falling victim to the endless predators of the great North America.*UPDATE: I have beaten the game with only 38 hours playing time. Shuffle mode is insane, totally not worth my time and effort.			"

												This game is funny and weird. There are only a bare handful of things that stay the same with every attempt to get to the end, assuming that there even is one. If you're looking for a game that is firmly rooted in a logical world, then this is not the game for you. To sum up what this game is in one fragmented sentence for those of you that hate drawn-out reviews, this game is: Oregon Trail gone batshit insane while still being hilarious.This game is one I won't be removing from my library in a million years.

												Oddly replayable.  Super Amazing Wagon Adventure plays like a NES game.   It's simple pixel graphics are completely justified with nice effects and an actual attempt to care.  For instance,  blood splatters, look like pixel blood splatters.    Visually, the style works.The sound is amazing too,  and I regret not bein able to find a soundtrack.What you're looking at is essential a Rogue Like.   A very fast paced one at that that is completely and utterly unforgiving.  Master the controls,  and get a rythem down for the random events allows you to survive.  So not only do you need technical skill playing, but also the fate of an RNG.   Lots of unlockables also means that while you don't get to the end each time,  you might at least pull out a new Wagon,  or discover a differnt event.    Finally, price.  You just can't beat it.  Worthwhile overall,   Are there negatives?  Not really,  apart from sometimes getting creamed too often by the random generator,   slightly off putting.   Fixable?  Sorta, but that's not the point.

												a fun game that can be a bit frustrating at first, but with the right choice of wagon quite easy to beat,  aiming the gun on foot with a gamepad (XBox360 f.e.)  is crap! I actually grab the mouse while still using the d-pad on the controler to beat those stages.biggest weakness of the game is that it's somewhat short, sure you can explore the different paths and try to get all the wagons and stuff, still there could have been more levels and the difficulty could have been lower to make it a really good game...still for something around 1-2$ it's ok and fun!

												I saw this game on sale for less than a buck and said ""hey, why not?""  That was probably the best decision I made that day because I am getting way more than my money's worth out of it and I can say without a doubt that it is worth more than its full price.  Granted, this is not some Earth-shattering monument of technical achievement or anything.  But for what it is, it is very fun and will provide you with hours of amusement.  For an idea of what the game itself is like, imagine Oregon Trail meets Galaga as written by Tim & Eric and directed by Mel Brooks (because that totally doesn't sound like some kind of monster).  The gameplay itself is smooth, fun, and well-varied.  Most of the things that you come across are pretty much random events (there is some overall structure; i.e. you generally pass through most of the same 'zones' in the same order, however what those 'zones' contain tends to be randomized), and there are some very interesting (and amusing) random events.  Controls are simple and responsive and it's controller-compatible, so you've got options there.  There are also a bunch of unlockables to keep you engaged for a while, including different modes of play (sadly, however, no multiplayer).Overall, this game is a really great deal if you like retro-styled side-scrolling shooter games with a heavy helping of humor.  Get it.  Play it.  Enjoy it.			"

												This game is awesome, yet historically acurate.It narrates the short journey that those brave men and women took on the Wild West on the 19th century.As real people, they fought illneses, wolves, bandits, unicorns, laser weapons... And, that's how i remember history.The game is pretty fast, It mixes classic shoter scenes with ones with one of your oh so acurate travelers on foot, involved on looking for stuff, either to eat or to declare loves.Also, the variety of weapons is awesome. One second you are killing buffalos with a pistol, the other you have a flamethrower. Or a bow. Or a falcon, Or something like a bullet-train.To sum up: get the game if you still havent.And, If you excuse me, I'll try to save my adventurers yet again (hopefully unsuccesfully)			"

I played this game for over 12 hours and only beat it a couple of times, but it's so fun you won't even care about losing. With lots of different wagons to unlock and a semi-random progression, which is partially influenced by the player's choices, and the number of times you'll just lose, this game has a pretty high replay value.  At a price of $2.99, you'll never get so much for so little elsewhere. BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Bullet hell, Wild West simulator a la Oregon Trail... if you removed any reverance for the hardship of the frontier and included unrealistic, exaggerated craziness.10/10 for the price.5/5 Graphics5/5 Music4/5 Replayability5/5 Game for the priceSAWA represents, to me, the ideal cheap game. It's inexpensive, it's a game you can pick up and play for 10 minutes, but it has plenty of unlockables, divergent events, and so on.Basically each 'level' is dodging enemies or projectiles.  There are also plenty of bosses and minibosses, and each time you play is different.  What makes SAWA different is that the each event is insane, from accidentally jumping into outer space, to taking shrooms and fighting off your inner demons, or my personal favorite, fighting glitches in the game as they attack and try to break the game. There's not much to say, the replayability is great but does run dry and is completely randomized, so there's no way of knowing if you'll ever unlock some of them.  It's cheap, small, and a great time waster for a few laughs.			"

												If you have ever played The Oregon Trail you know that it's a historical game that teaches you about history. This is exactly like The Orgon Trail, except it's not historical and teaches you that zombies, eagles, ninjas, roberies, and space ships exist and anything can happen. This game is cheap and you can play it for upirs without knowing it.			"
