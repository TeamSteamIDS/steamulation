												It's a mixed bag that I can only really recommend to old school adventure game aficionados. The puzzles can be pretty lame in their nonsensical logic or the proverbial hunt the pixel game for that one item you are missing to be able to make any headway while searching through several screens worth of pixels... also the story itself is... well amusing if you like cheesy, trite, and hackneyed plots with a supposedly genius protagonist that acts like a moron throughout.Basically a pretty underwhelming effort that you can skip at your leisure. Give it a go but don't be afraid to just go straight for a walkthrough so it doesn't feel like too much of a waste of time.			"

												There is a puzzle in this game where the solution requires you to have had the foresight to predict that a tranvestite black woman used to be a basketball player without the game indicating this may have the been the case. Unless of course the assumption relies on racial stereotyping? This game was silly unintentionally hilarious garbage, but I have never laughed so hard at, (although I do mean AT) an adventure game as much as I had this one. To be fair, most of the puzzles are usually pretty reasonable, but the occasional leap in logic plus the game's overall very corny writing make this a work of art in the genre of funny shlock. Would recommend to anyone who likes that sort of thing. I know I do.			"

Runaway: A Road Adventure is the first game in Runaway series made by Pendulo Studios, back in 2001. It has its ups and downs, coming into a résumé of being cheesy and needlessly complicated with a crude, childish charm on the side. It is only interesting enough for an old school adventure gamer, who wouldn't mind empty character stereotypes.Let's see... There is an interesting variety of graphic and art display used in this first game; including old school hand drawn cartoons, slightly computer animated skylines, 2D characters wrapped with vibrant colors in gameplay - similar to original Broken Sword series - and creepy plastic 3D models used in between cut scenes. It feels that someone failed to pick a homogenous art style for this game. 2D models + hand drawn cartoons is a great combination which we are already used to from older adventure titles, but 3D models? Well... I personally think the 2D + 3D artwork combination is a tricky one, and it wasn't well produced here. Some of the character designs were okay, but they mostly ended up being exaggerations of stereotypes. Brute and ugly rather than being funny, and character movement animations - especially ones from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 - were downright spastic.I don't know a lot about you, but a strong and unique protagonist with well-arranged character is really important in adventure games in my opinion. For the acquired immersion, you have to like the main character, or at least find him/her interesting. Brian Basco was neither likable nor interesting. For a supposed boy genius, he spoke and acted as a real dimwit who ends up becoming a Ken doll stereotype eventually. Gina - the supporting female character - isn't anything interesting or genuine either. She is there to live up to the labeled existence of being an exaggeratedly sexy bimbo.The scenario is meaninglessly complicated and it seems that our characters have no actual control over any occurrence. On a series of quite random and unfortunate - or amazingly fortunate events - they manage to get by, but there is no exact brilliance to their progress. They always go through any kind of progress through the help of absurdly friendly random individuals with eccentric backgrounds that they meet around. The story itself is so fragmented and scattered, it doesn't really make any sense until the last chapter of the game. During the last chapter, every random plot hook are properly arranged and tidied up by yet another collection of random people - not our protagonist. In all events and occurrences, Brian Basco may be one of the most naive and ridiculously shallow characters in adventures games that I've played so far.If we are to talk about gameplay, I have to confess that it has a ridiculously slow progressing game play for a ridiculously fast progressing storyline. There is odd repetitions in actions and with the speed Brian moves around, you'd better spare a whole day. It is a killer pixel hunt to collect items, or even notice that certain items are actually collectible. Some item combinations are just fine, the others... well, without a walkthrough I wish utmost patience for you. NPC interactions and dialogues are pretty much straight forward, but even though you'd be pretty confident about what you should do, the game forces you to either confirm that through making Brian realize the needed action, or at least try what you absolutely cannot do first as an elimination process. It ends up being tiresome after a point.All in all, Runaway: A Road Adventure is nothing miraculous. There is a great selection of adventure games you'd enjoy without a doubt. This is not really one of them if you are not a fan of cheesy character stereotypes and crude elementary level humor. I've been hearing a lot of good things about the other games in the series - especially Runaway 3: A Twist of Fate - so I'll finish the series to get there anyhow. Apparently, story arcs follow each other with references so it is not possible to thoroughly enjoy the last game without playing the prior ones. Take this one if you are curious enough, or wait for my reviews in other titles in the series!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												This is the first in three games that form the Runaway series to date. As such it is bound to be potentially less refined than the latter two so there are some issues with it and things that detract from my enjoyment of the game. I hope as the series progresses they get better and better but for now here is my review of the first title in the series...The first aspect is the art style, it appears cell shaded in format or what I would associate as such and it is an aquired taste as far as artistic styles go...unfortuantly in this specific case it is not a taste that fits well with me. Normally I do not mind cell shaded looking games but this is on the poor quality side where quite often I found myself looking at the shading on the characters and thinking what the hell is wrong with their face or body which maybe okay for a while for the amusment of looking at weird shaded and shaped characters as some times it was just plain freaky looking but kind of wears thin on me after a while. It comes across as like a premature/immature use of the art style inline with the time period where the game came out which I think was early 90's and it may well be the case that the following games in series matured and refined this art style but that's more related to future reviews of those not this one. However I am sure there are enough screenshots and such online and in the community section for this game here to give you an idea of whether it is an art style you can grin and bare or might enjoy. For me it was the former and for others it may be the latter. The environments on the other hand are not too bad, some are even quite good I feel for the most part but the characters on the other hand are ugh...not to my liking and quite often look very odd or creepy.The VO work is okay, not amazing but not too bad either. Nothing to write home about though. There were some glitches and bugs I came across when playing, screen freeze couple times and on some occasions glitches relating to the the VO/animations. I thought it is worth mentioning just incase happens to others too. It was not game breaking in the sense I was able to reload from last save and continue but it might be worthwhile if pick up this game to keep saving manually often just in case.The introduction music track and general theme song Runaway one is catchy and a nice tune. It was a nice enjoyable peice of music but for the rest of the game there is pretty much a lack of music to add to this nice audio start to the game. The puzzles in this adventure game are also not so great in the sense for the most part yes you will be able to proceed without hinderence for a fair amount of the game just by using simple logic...but there are some that defy belief and boggle the mind in a not so good way. You will most likely need to use a guide or walkthrough to solve some just because some defy logic. I will give just one example so not to spoil things where the game fails in this regard. There is a train and you can add water to the engine boiler by going to and from town, filling up a handheld item with water then back to the train to put it in the boiler. When you add water and check the water level it tells you the same thing each time that the water level is still very low. You can repeat this process over and over and will tell you the same thing and on the fifth or sixth try something will pop out of the chimney that you will need to progress in the game. Now here is the problem. Firstly there is no hint or anything like that letting the player know that he should keep going to and from the town and train adding the water over and over or that anything will happen or that anything should happen. The repeated phrase of still low on water after th first few times most people would stop doing it thinking it serves no purpose since game does not tell you has any purpose at this point. You will reach a point where cannot continue the game until decide to go back to putting water in for no apparent reason.There are also ones which annoyed me in the sense I had collected items that could solve situations had the game let me combine or use them logically but the player is forced to find a different way not because your way would not work if was allowed but because the game expects you not just to solve the puzzles but to solve them the exact way the developer would solve them and this is very annoying. While there is an element of this in most adventure games, in this one it feels blatent and annoying. When you solve some of these puzzles you may feel like shouting eureka but not because you want to pat yourself on the back for being smart but because you managed to figure out what the hell the developers were thinking when they made that puzzle. I might be sounding harsh but some of these puzzles are simply bad. Not all however are so bad, some are generally okay and while you will come across bad ones there are quite a few logical and non brain exploding puzzles in there too that most people should have no problem with.The story itself is okay, interesting in parts but average in others. The romance aspect feels very forced and this reflected badly on the characters to me. This game was made in the early 90's though so I never expected it to be up to todays standards in many areas but overall as an adventure game it felt like an average game, with a few very annoying puzzles but with good introduction song and an interesting art style provided the art style does not rub you the wrong way. I can only hope the rest of the series gets better and will be trying those in order as I go along at a later date. I have higher hopes for the rest of the series which were developed about two years apart if I recall, expecting and hoping that they improve with each new one in the series as they learned from their mistakes. The ending was very predictable, but that is to be sort of expected given it's the first in three games that carry a narrative follow through between them from a timelime and characters perspective. I won't spoil it but it is worth noting that the series is linked in such a way so that while you could start with the second or third game and skip this one, you will not get the full story relating to the characters and and may not understand everything that's going on or why things are the way they are unless play them all in order. It's not as bad as say starting watching the LoTR skipping the first and starting on second film in series instead and wondering what's going on but there is a link between the games in this series so worth keeping that in mind.Should you buy this? Well depends on what floats you boat but for me this was an average game, nothing making it stand out far enough to scream buy or don't buy... more of a if you are bored, like adventure games but played all the best ones already and need to start playing the average ones before making a start on the worst then this fits in that average catagory. My advice is maybe pick it up during a sale. It's not bad enough that I will say do not buy it, so I will say recommended but only for those who fall into the above catagory I just listed if your anything like me. If determined to buy an adventure game made by Pendulos Studios I would much rather recommend (The Next Big Thing) game from them which actually is a very good adventure game compared to this one which I consider to be average.

												This is a good point and click adventure. It has small bits that are a bit annoying. For example the protagonist explains every action before doing it and there are several quite illogical puzzles that involve searching randomly through spots that you already 'looted' before. Anyway, the story is interesting and the locations and characters are quite unique. The game still looks very nice and the music is mostly good. Overall a very solid adventure experience :)			"

												Be thankful for any series that tries to revive the point-and-click adventure genre. Runaway is a couple years old at the time of this writing, but it was still made much after the genre had ""died"".But in reality, we know it's not dead and Runaway is a good game in that genre. Not the best, but not subpar at all.			"

Short version: 68%The first Runaway game is an extremely beautiful point ‘n’ click adventure with bad voice actors, and needlessly overcomplicated plot and puzzles, completed with a last act that redeems most of the game in one swoop. Be prepared to use a walkthrough from the start though.Long version:Pendulo, a Spanish studio tried to revive the dying point ‘n’ click genre at the start of the century by releasing their first decent hit, Runaway: A Road Adventure. The game stood out with its spectacular, lushly coloured, hand-drawn backgrounds and cell-shaded 3D characters. (The latter technology was a big rage at the time.)And this is also where most of the budget went, because the lavish exterior hides a rather lacking adventure game.The most apparent issue is the audio. The main theme is catchy (albeit dated), and the soundtrack is good, but the voice acting ranges from somewhat tolerable to downright horrible.The less-apparent problem is the writing. Initially it seems great: a rather everyday protagonist accidentally gets dragged into a spy thriller by accompanying a beautiful woman. Then it just flips out and throws in locations and characters at random without any coherence. Heck, it even resorts to using aliens and magic.Thankfully this mess is sorted out by the end, resulting in a good mafia story, but this is a very small compensation for all the stupidity you have to endure before it. The puzzles are worse. Remember the infamous passport sequence in Gabriel Knight 3? Imagine that as the starting difficulty, getting more convoluted and illogical at every new step you take. And the solutions themselves are on rails: you cannot do what you are supposed to do unless you find out all requirements for even the most basic actions.At its time, Runaway was a welcomed comeback of the adventure genre, but today it is just a pretty, but dumb piece of point ‘n’ click history.

												When I play adventure games, usually I like to play a compelling protagonist, solve ingenius puzzles, and meet a colourful cast of interesting characters. Unfortunately, Runaway fails on all counts, and then finds some more levels to fail on, in case I was not sufficiently put off from it with it's sheer audacious ineptitude alone. The art, while competent in it's backgrounds and interesting in the execution of the cel-shaded comic style, fell short when rendering the characters, whose bodies float around while their mouths snap into keys, a discordant, stilted animation method that only serves to both highlight the failings of the watery bodies and the limited mouth animations. The character designs ranged from by the numbers boring, to overwhelmingly offensive and reductive. Racist stereotypes pop up again and again, gentle and unassuming, as if the writers thought nothing of their inclusion, with a literally yellow faced asian lady at one juncture, and a Tojo-style bucktooth japanese stereotype popping up later. The game seemed to take great pleasure in exaggerating features that weren't part of the caucasian face. While Brian and Gina were bland to the point of soporific, some of the supporting cast were so caricatured as to make them inhuman. The resulting mashup was incredibly distracting, and often insulting. It didn't fit together well.The puzzle design was some of the worst I've ever seen - and unquestioned in it's sociopathy. Oftentimes the solution to a puzzle is to destroy some great work of art, or a career, or simply make someone's life worse for Brian's gain. Other puzzles involve leaps of logic so great as to bring into question the world this game was made in. Filling lipstick tubes with gunpowder, for instance, apparently makes for bullets. In what sane universe would this not just melt the lipstick and cause a jam in a gun? And Peanut Butter made by heating butter with some peanuts. Not only do the puzzle solutions often not make sense, but are literally antithetical to the goal you are trying to achieve. Brian will, at times, do something that is counterproductive to his aims for no real reason other than to prolong the game's running time. He is also an incredibly inconsistent hypocrit, refusing to steal some things because ""he is a decent guy"" and gleefully stealing and destroying other items because ""they won't miss it"". The amount of unquestioned property damage in this game is staggering. I was actively rooting for something horrible to happen to the protagonist by the end, as he got everything he ever wanted and more, as he complained about being lied to while lying out of his♥♥♥♥♥at every opportunity, and as he made everyone's lives a living hell while they did nothing but be accomodating to him. From the very beginning, the insufferable Brian Basco comes across as a bland, entitled dudebro, whose complete disregard for his fellow human beings' safety is only matched by his lack of personality traits. I can only sum him up as some kind of dark, unfathomable void-beast who wants to go to Berkley University. In his quest for getting the female supporting protagonist, Brian poisons, strongarms, and causes the death of all who get in his way. He is unaffected by the death of friends, loved ones, and nothing bad that happens around him ever seems to stick - upon being told to not mourn by a Hopi Ghost, for example, he instantly feels better and snaps back to being the insufferable twit that he normally is.Mentioning the Hopi, an important point has to be brought up. The Hopi, in the game's setting, appear to be a extinct tribe that have only a presence through spirits and ghosts, when in reality the Hopi are still a political presence in Arizona, with several towns. It reinforces the awful ""Native Americans are Already Dead"" tropes that resonate throughout media, which is part lie and part incredible racism, of which this game has in spades. The story is at it's heart, forgettable, but only through Brian Basco's audacious awfulness is it elevated to a travesty. The twist in the plot takes five out of six chapters to come to fruition, and it is such a damp squib of a twist that you question why you even bothered with the game in the first place. The game's setup promises intrigue that the game ultimately does not deliver on. It barely engages more than morbid curiousity, let alone any proper intrigue. The game sets up a mystical element that ultimately only serves to give our hero yet another item and a pat on the back when he loses something. The love interest element is sickeningly underwritten and overemphasised, mainly when our hero reminds the supporting cast, and the player that he is not gay. His love interest spends most of the time unconscious, indisposed, or absent. What spark they could have had is never shown on screen, just that he thinks she is beautiful, and ergo he needs her. And she wants him for an unknown reason, probably because he hit her with his car and she needs protection. She is an eternal damsel, and her story is never expanded upon, even though it is far, far more interesting than his,Describing Runaway as a power fantasy would be completely apt - Brian Basco represents the nadir of the human being, but still gets everything he ever wanted while reassuring himself, and being reassured, that he is the Decent Nice Guy Who Gets The Girl. It is almost sickening how pornographically this game presents us our ""hero"", in the sense that everything he does brings him everything he ever wanted, he never faces any real, lasting trauma or tragedy. No character development, just a stagnation into the awful person he always was, and will always continue to be. Runaway is exactly what you should do when faced with this game.			"

												This game is one of the worst experiences I have had, though I suppose part of it can be forgiven considering the age of the game. The game starts right off with you saving a barbiesque girl from some thugs. The protagonist is sure to tell the audience direcly about how beautiful the girl is and that this the main reason why he won't refuse to help her. The game is contradicting at times between the antagonists wanting to kill the girl at first, but then after catching her they want to interrogate her. The game also weirdly dips into native americans and then the supernatural, before ending on a relatively normal note. The final revelation of the plot is probably the only thing interesting about it. Mostly, the game seems to take itself too seriously for how bland it is.While the models are simple and cel-shaded, the animations leave something to be desired. Talking animations often appear to be 2-frame mouth open/mouth closed animations. Interacting with people is often delayed while they finish an idle animation they are in the middle of. Characters aside from the main ones often stomp or shuffle around in ways I can't tell to be intentional or not. The first few 2 chapters had some decent puzzles, but afterward it is increasingly difficult to determine what you are supposed to do. There are multiple times when you have an idea of what to accomplish, but with no idea of how it relates to your current goal. As the game approaches the end, the puzzles seem more like exercises in mind reading on the developers. At one point I had to give the name of a movie director and one of their movies to another character as it was tangentally related to a solution for a problem the protagonist had at the time. There was also a time when I was to cut a ""rock hard"" object with a knife that had been heated, because it would cut better. A third one involved throwing a basketball to a particular character because they were secretly used to be a famous basketball player. In none of these scenarios did I find any clues to the answers.A few other bullet points:- One part of the game involves you performing the same task 5 times, each time taking about 6 room transitions.- The end of the game gets pretty tedious as you repeatedly leave objects for other characters to examine, leave the room, and come back. - There are also times when a searchable object or container will need to be examined multiple times or at different times before new needed objects will be available to be picked up.

												Runaway: A Road Adventure is a point-and-click (P&C) adventure game which, by design, it is no more than your typical P&C game from the ‘90s.The story centres around Brian Basco, an initially shy and nerdy Physics graduate from New York whose life totally changes the moment he almost runs over an admittedly hot chick, Gina Timmins, with his car. Could this be faith? Taking her quickly to the hospital, Brian soon finds out that the mafia gang is after her as a result of possessing an enigmatic crucifix given by her father which she pledged to protect. From here on out, it is knowable what is about to happen and is already hinted in the title itself: become runaways chased by the mafia whilst trying to decipher the mystery behind the crucifix.While the set up already sounds painfully cheesy, enough to put it next to your minty collection of B-movies from the ‘80s, the overall story is actually decent for an adventure game once you witness the conclusion at the end. In fact most of the story’s writing is corny, but feels shamelessly light-hearted. Split into six chapters, it becomes evident after the second chapter that the story itself is something which must not be taken too seriously – in a good way. It can be wacky (like some of the extravagant support characters) and ridiculous at times (I lost it at the “abduction” part), weirdly making it a very amusing, yet silly, experience. The story builds up well as the game progress, but loses some steam about the second last chapter. It provides several funny moments, but there will be a debate on whether this is because they are intelligently funny or because they are so bluntly stereotypical, corny and a bit sexist. Kind of like laughing at a joke which seemed good on paper but was abysmally delivered. When the story does get serious, it can feel like you are playing a low-budget Broken Sword game. And there is plenty inspiration taken from the first two Broken Sword games displayed in here.Runaway: A Road Adventure is possibly one of the hardest adventure games you will ever play when it comes to solving puzzles. This can either turn into one of the most satisfying moments of the day when you singlehandedly discover the solution to a challenging puzzle, or the most induced rage you will ever exhibit. In general, the puzzles are mostly logical and varied especially in the first few chapters. Conversely, they are exceptionally unintuitive and require a lot of pixel-hunting. A lot. This will be the thing which will turn off most people, but if you are patient and like actual challenges, then this will be rewarding because the puzzles are truly enjoyable -- a bit absurd and scientifically inaccurate at times though -- once you realise their solutions. Obviously, there are still some awful puzzles which require a lot of backtracking for instance, mainly in the second last chapter. Honestly, that chapter was not well designed from a puzzle solving point of view. An advice is to have a walkthrough next to you just in case you get completely stuck at any point. Also, minor puzzle spoiler: getting high is a solution to one of the puzzles. Greatest puzzle ever? The graphics are impressive in respect to the hand-drawn backgrounds, which might be the main reason why anyone would be attracted by this game in the first place. There is a variety of nicely drawn locations the player can visit, although the last three chapters are featured in the same dessert setting, so it can be argued that it loses some of its magic in the second half. Sadly, the animations in this game are subpar. The closer the camera is to a character model, the uglier they get. This ugliness can range from realising how bland the models are to their very static facial movements. Similar moments are also noticeable in many of the game’s CGI cutscenes which can be a bit horrific to watch. For instance, there is a particular animation of Gina crawling on the ground which looks dreadfully creepy. Thus, retrospectively, the animations did not age well. Rewind eleven years back, I would probably have been happy with them.The voice acting is a mixed bag. It is average at best, but enough not to harm the playtime experience. On the other hand, the more hours you sink into the game the more you will get comfortable hearing the voices. Sadly, that is not applicable for some of the support characters who simply make you beg to turn off the audio completely in an instant. Inevitably there will be two or three characters which turn out to sound annoying, not necessarily because of the voice actor’s capabilities but the way some deliver their lines – intentionally over-the-top. The audio compression is also poor, making the dialogues sound fuzzy at times. And this, if you did not know, is not an adventure game from the mid-‘90s which all sounded as if the voices were recorded in a tin can back then. Frankly, the fuzziness is not distracting at all, but rather noticeable when characters talk. Lastly, the soundtrack is solid, without a disappointing track.One personal annoyance is Gina’s portrayal and lack of involvement in the game. Most of time she is either unconscious, kept locked as a hostage or unable to move due to injury making her useless in helping Brian in any of his tasks. Honestly, she is a pathetic damsel in distress with some admirable “assets”. Thankfully, there are signs of personality and humanness to her character than it meets the eye by the end of the duo's adventure. Yet, she lacked any solid character development throughout most of the story, giving little reason to feel attached to her as a character.In conclusion, Runaway: A Road Adventure is an adventure game which you will either love for superbly replicating that old-school and wacky feel of classic adventure games -- or hate for its unintuitive puzzles and low production values in the audio and animation departments in particular. Unlike more modern adventure games with damsels in distress, such as Deponia which shares almost the same critical flaws, Runaway: A Road Adventure has a lot more charm. Maybe because it does not take itself too seriously, just the way Monkey Island was more of a comedy-oriented adventure game (of course, the latter had top-notch production values which outshine Runaway in all aspects). Regardless, while there is a lot of room for improvement, the story alone provides enough inceptive to invest time into this adventure until the end if you like wacky fast-ride adventures.			"

												If you're partial to a cinematic experience than 'Runaway: A Road Adventure' might just be up your alley. Although on first glances it seems like a standard point and click adventure game, you'll find out that it has a completely different individual element to it that is a rarity in modern day titles. A distinctive charm if you will. The combination of 2D and 3D graphics is neat but alas the characters themselves aren't that interesting. The music is outstanding, but the main story itself is rather weak which is disappointing as it had so much potential.			"

												Runaway, A Road Adventure, is a point and click adventure game from Pendulo studios. It is the first game in the Runaway series. Action begins in New York City, and takes you for a cross country road trip as you uncover the secrets behind a Hopi artifact while trying to avoid mob hitmen hot on your trail.With point and click adventure games, two of the most important aspects are the story and the puzzles. The story in Runaway is gripping enough to keep you interested throughout. As the story progresses, you will uncover more and more about the artifact, while also coming up with daring rescue and escape plans to keep yourself and Gina safe from the mob. It is not without its flaws, however. A lot of the story could be described as White Knight, the game. You play a nerdy student named Brian who almost immediately falls in love with Gina, and will do anything for her. As a player, you don't have much interaction with Gina, since she disappears for one reason or another after the beginning cutscene of almost every chapter. So, sometimes you ask yourself why he is bothering to do all this stuff for her. Even though he has these feelings for her, at one point he is very quickly willing to give her up for lost, which did not gel with all of his actions to that point. It was a little confusing, and made me think that the main character is a little fickle with his emotions. The overall payoff of the story was good, and worth seeing through to the end. There is even a small set up for another game if you stick through to watch after the end credits.The puzzles do not live up to the quality of the story. I had some issues with the fact that you will need to search through certain areas multiple times to find all the objects they contain. At one point, a bag contains three items you need, but you can only find one item at a time as the story progresses. There is also a puzzle that makes you transition through multiple scenes 5 times just to solve, which seemed like busy work after a while. For the most part, I found that a lot of the puzzles used ""adventure game logic"", meaning that you will be using a lot of items in illogical ways to proceed. Nothing as bad as a cat hair mustache, but a lot of things along that line. The good thing is that you can't really fail, and the characters you can speak to will give you hints sometimes to point you in the right direction. So, sometimes you just have to keep plugging along until you figure everything out.The graphics are a bit of a mixed bag. The backgrounds for the most part are very detailed and well done. The first part of the game will have you going between a variety of areas, and you don't know where you will end of next. The entire second half of the game takes place in the desert, and while they try to mix it up by giving you lots of areas to explore, it can get rather repetitive. The characters have a cartoonish feel to them, and look generally well drawn during gameplay. The cutscenes have a noticeable drop in quality, with character faces lacking a lot of detail. Also, why do Brian's shorts have to be so short for the second half of the game?Voice acting is not great but not terrible either. It won't distract you from enjoying the game, but I felt like sometimes there was a good amount of emotion lacking in the lines. The were some songs written specifically for this game, and one song in particular you will probably hear so much that you will get sick of.Controls follow the basic point and click model. Left click to move, double click on an exit to travel quickly, right click to switch between look and grab. The inventory can be accessed at the top of the screen. Sometimes it was a little difficult to find the exact pixel you had to be on to interact with an object, but that only happened a few times.Overall, I would recommend this game, but just barely. The story was enough to overcome the flaws with the puzzles, and while the art wasn't amazing to look at, it kept me interested. I was entertained enough that I want to check out the sequel.Grade: C			"

A cel-shaded video game featuring drag queens? Shante, you stay!Also starring the damsel in distress stereotype, racial stereotypes, female sexual objectification and rather looong cutscens. If you have a problem with any of these things, then do yourself a favor and don't play this game, it's certainly not your cup of tea.			"

												This is a great point and click adventure, a real visual story that actually feels like I am interacting with it rather than some titles which simply have you play eye-spy for certain objects.An engaging story with fun and complex puzzles, I picked this up during the Summer Sale, fell in love with it and bought the entire Runaway series.If you haven't checked out any of the work from Pendulo studios, I recommend starting with Runaway: A Road Adventure "

												I'm a big fan of Pendulo Studios but unfortunately most adventure games don't age well. At all.The plot is not interesting and doesn't give you a reason to care. Not to mention it's incredible slow.The puzzles take the nonsensical aspect of adventure games to a whole new level. I had to give up after realizing I had to find a specific rock in the middle of the desert on Chapter 4. Yes, that's a thing.The characters... now, that's the bigger problem. The characters are just awful. From the nerd who becomes more attractive to the pretty damsel in distress with big boobs and no substance, the stereotypes are unbearable.If you wondering which Runaway title to play... skip this one.

												I recommend this game only because of its awesome animation. It's a pure pleasure to watch these drawings, but it would be better off if this was a 2h movie rather than 8h game.The plot is ok, it also has a little twist, characters are simple and stereotypical, jokes are not funny. Music does not stand out.The worst part of the game are the puzzles. I've played dozens of point&click adventures and never have I seen such absurd tasks. The only way to cope with some of them is to do a mix o pixel hunt and trail&error (click everything on everything). All of these must be repeated many times as some objects appear only after the plot moves forward. The same applies to some action. It is not rare that to combine 3 pieces you need to do 1+2, and then +3. You cannot do 1+3 or 2+3 first.Also a few very irritating puzzles which involve pointless change of locations making you click all through the locations for 5-6 times or the most absurd - bank safe puzzle.In the puzzle you turn safe's wheel until you hear a click, than change the direction. However, you do not have to listen to the click (the character will tell you when it's done). All you have to do is click your mouse for over 150 times to change the digits one by one.If alt+tabbing to the walkthrough does not scare you and you are a fan of classic point&click adventures, this may be still worth looking.

												If you are a true adventure game fan, this game should be in your catalog. There are a few things to be wary of. Just about every rule of making a good adventure game is broken by this game. You'll have to go back and repeat an action with no clue that it will magically give different results this time and worst of all, one action will need to be repeated more than three times (involving four screen changes, two dialogue pieces and an inventory combination, all exactly the same) which will make you question your sanity. Don't worry, it's the developers who weren't sane.Despite these flaws, the game is a solid adventure game with puzzles that are usually interesting and rarely obscure. I had a few puzzles I struggled on, but the solutionalways made sense when I found it. (Nine times out of ten, I missed an object in my pixel hunting... Oh yeah, this game has pixel hunting). When this game does puzzles, it does them well.			"

												Do you like point and click games? Me too!Do you like pixel hunts? Do you like not being able to solve a puzzle because you clicked the nail on the hammer instead of the hammer on the nail? Do you like strong female protagonists who become incapacitated every five minutes so that the male lead can save them? Do you like to play as a bro-ish, self entitled cis male who uses people and lies, but thinks he's an outstanding dude? Do you like racial stereotypes? Me neither.I love this genre and try never to look at the walkthrough, but I found this such an unpleasant experience that I stopped even caring towards the end. Often, they relied on intense pixel hunting--in one instance you actually go to the desert and have to pick up a specific rock. Some puzzles rely on truly obscure knowledge, like how you can theoretically get extra life out of a battery by exposing it to extreme cold. I don't want to ramble. Point is, this game isn't merely ""not good"", it's bad. I found it painful, and Steam has plenty of alternatives in the same price range.			"

												I purchased the Pendulo package after hearing some good things about the game and trying buy some time until the second half of Broken Sword 5 comes out. The game follows a man named Brain Basco as he gets roped in with a girl named Gina who owns a mysterious crucifix that the Mafia wants to get there hands on. To be 100% honest when I first started this game I thought it was a little boring, I wasn't to interested in any of the characters but after awhile the plot picked up and it caught my interest. In my opinion it's a decent adventure so I warn buyers not to expect anything to amazing as it doesn't live up to some of the bigger names.All in all I reccomend this to people who want a new adventure game and already crossed the others on there personal list off, but I only reccomend buying this on sale because to be honest if I had paid $10 for the game I would have been disappointed. At around the same price for all $5 I feel I walked out with a nice deal though.			"

Had...Honestly, I could never really get into this game. From the first room I ran into trouble progressing. It is no news that some adevnture games contain illogical or infuriating puzzles, but usually you get the hang of it by carefully reading the dialogue and/or exploring. I had to heavily use a guide, when I usually refuse to use guides at all, as they destroy the purpose of those games but in the end I prefer it over examinating every pixel in every room every time you progress a little bit. When you can only progress by trial and error, fun gets work and finishing this one was alot of work.			"

Not the sometimes mindless combinations and solutions that only a walkthrough can give.  Fun game the whole way through with fun characters.There are a lot of cut scenes though.  I didn't mind but the game breaks up into basically a movie type 3d scene, and then the interactive part.  Some of the scenes can be 20 minutes long.  No joke.

Sometimes they are in the foreground, but not highlighted which makes things more difficult or it's inside a mudane item. Another annoying thing is it does one of the problems I don't like with some adventure titles where there is clearly a item of interest and when you try to interact with it the character is like ""I don't know what I'd use it for"" plus your invantory gets wiped when entering a new chapter.  I mean did he seriously think ""Oh a crowbar, don't think I'll need that anymore."" but I digress, the story is quite involving and you only have 2 options with what to do with items.

This is not a great game, but not one I regret playing.Pros:     Likeable animation     Fun characters and plot     Some of the puzzlesCons:     Most of the puzzles are easy....if only you could find the needed object, or even knew there was one to find!  Unfortunately, the pixel hunting drove me to a walkthrough.  Pointless, terrible design.     Lots of waiting for animations to finish.     In terms of puzzles, the game either just got worse and worse or I got less and less patient.     Several items you can't notice or pick up until the game decides you need them.Trivia:     Lani Minella voices the sultry and (ridiculously) scantily clad damsel in distress/love interest Gena.  She's quite good, but Lani also voices Nancy in all the Nancy Drew games, of which I've played most.  And she used the same voice for Gena that she uses for Nancy.   So it felt like I was hearing a young girl's voice coming out of a voluptuous woman's body -- it made me feel wrong and uncomfortable inside. "

												When it first came out, the adventure gaming was in decline, and many people considered Runaway to be some sort of a genre messiah. Sadly, it wasn't. While Pendulo surely tried to match Sierra's scale and Lucas Arts' wit, they failed in recreating the two key aspects that made adventure games great: puzzles and characters.Too many of the challenges the player faces in the game are stupid, if not completely Illogical (getting the wrench and filling the tank, to name a few). And the two main characters are as underdeveloped and unlikable as they can get. Gina is nothing more than a damsel in distress, completely objectified and helpless; and Brian is shown as a self-centered jerk, totally unmoved by anything that happens around him, while stopping at nothing to fulfill his, often questionable, agenda.Those hoping to find another Guybrush and Elaine, or Gabriel and Grace (or even George and Nico, for that matter), should skip this game.

												Pros: Fairly fluid user controls/interface- it's easy to acclimate to fast. The digital-animation-on-illustrated-backgrounds art direction is relatively unique- and sometimes quite nice. It's generally pretty entertaining. It encourages the player to actually want to solve the mysteries. It's a decently good low to mid-level length for a casual player. [Ignore my time played, I left the game running while away] The music is certainly interesting. It can be frankly hilarious in that unintentional, truly bad B-movie way. Cons: The animation itself is laughable- sort of a pro and a con. Even for the time period, it's pretty bad. The story line has a plethora of holes and issues if you pay much attention. There are nigh-endless amounts of rampant racism and sexism. The main character isn't actually very likable: not as smart as he should be for his background, not as good or nice of a person as he's touted as, not a bad or tricky enough person to be much fun otherwise. I actually actively disliked him- not so great. The 'science' that happens in the puzzles is often hilariously nonsensical. A lot of the 'twists' are predictable. It can get fairly pixel-hunt-y at times. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone a bit older who's looking for a casual, silly, fast ride of the adventure-game type. It'll be no fun if it's taken too seriously- and I could see it being quite annoying and super offensive for some. It's not for kids. If you're looking for anything like Monkey Island, don't bother. Personally, I didn't deplore it, but I certainly didn't love it, either. I would settle for 'It definitely filled my time and kept me amused, but wow that really wasn't very good.' It's hard for me to flat out say if I'd reccommend it or not- I would, but only for specific types of players.			"

Unfortunately, it had little to do with the overall experience. Cons: Extreme pixel hunting!Some items are never usedRepetitive manoeuvres without the game noting that you have to perform the same action several times (imagine having to wash a car seven times to make it clean without actually hearing or seeing any change after each time)Flat storyVery predictable plotIllogical character actions and reactionsNo real puzzlesSome chapters are rushed while others feel eternalSome dialogues you must complete come without any previous indication about why you have to talk to this specific person to get that specific information (I had to try randomly to find the exact one)The ending is a cluster of badly written cutscenes.That's what I experienced. Hope it will help you decide if this is worth your money or not.			"

												Even though I am a big fan of old-school adventure games (such as Indiana Jones: Fate of Atlantis) and even though that this game has a similar approach to it , it is simply a badly executed example of the genre. The story is ok. A little cliché but what the hell, it is bound to be like that anyway. A well executed cliché is a great taste in video games and movies alike, so there is nothing wrong with it. The problem is that they just couldn't execute it well in this game. The puzzles are ok. They are not too hard or too easy. You can just think of possible solutions to a situation yourself. However the game is too rigid with its expcetations. You cannot be creative which is something you would expect from a video game at this age. Having said that, some puzzles are simply ridicoulous. Especially the ""SPOILER STARTS HERE"" - locomotive steam puzzles. A jail key and sherrif's badge in a locomotive engine? Really? Very logical - ""SPOILER ENDS HERE"". The voice acting... Oh god. Don't get me started with that. And the musics, too. I just couldn't stand it. Finally... The game is very slow. I don't mean FPS or any other technical aspect. It is annoyingly slow, especially the cut scenes where the main character goes on with his narration. You can see how slow the ""chapter name"" comes on to the screen and you just have to wait for it to finish, even after the guy stops talking. Why? And why torture us even more with that final cut scene with the bridge and that terrible music and the closing credits? Why can't we skip all that with a click? For that terrible extra scene at the end, which means nothing at all and causes us to wait even longer for it to vanish in an eternally slow speed? All in all, I am glad that people are still trying to make games of this genre. However, I would give a rating of 4 out of 10 to this game in general. It simply sucks as a production. I felt more torture than fun when playing it. So yeah, 4 / 10 "

												Its a bit of a mixed bag, the art style and voices are largely good. The story isn't bad but its pretty predicabile, with a couple of stand out moments. Some cut scenes go on way too long, like the beginning of Chapter 4 (I think) which just seems to go on and on without you being to able to interact at all.Overall I'd give it a 2.5/5. There are better adventure games out there. (I would note a few of the photos for the game on the store page aren't actually in the game)			"

												I honestly think this game is a stinking pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥I read through the reviews after playing and feeling the bile in my throat increase to violent rage as I played. How has no other reviewer pointed out how ♥♥♥♥ing narcissistic and sexist (border-line misogynistic) this game is. It is possibly one of the MOST offensively narrow minded and despicable portrayals of women in video games I have seen in years.The main character is irritating to the extreme, in fact if you do not hate him at first entry to the game where he monologues how he is the god-blessed son of all things awesome - you have something seriously wrong with you. This game is NOT humorous at all, it isn't even BAD funny, it is one of those BAD BAD BADLY written things that make your eyes and♥♥♥♥♥♥bleed simultaneously.			"

												This is my second effort at playing this game. I first played it a long time ago, until I got to the hopi village and then just got bored, which was a pity because I was quite near to the end. Look, it's a good effort by a latino studio (judging by the credits), but ultimately this adventure is far too tedious. There's lots of pixel hunting, and some of it is quite unreasonable (the key that gets blown out of the train's chimney). Some of the puzzles are pretty illogical too (a hot knife can cut open bean pods better?). There's also some grinding (filling the train's water tank). There is some fast travel, thankfully, but still the characters walk far too slowly. The game wasn't thrilling enough for me to tolerate slowly-walking characters. I didn't like the art style that much either. I just wanted the game to end as soon as possible, so ended up using a walkthrough. Some morally questionable choices in the game too, plus taking of drugs, etc. There are far better games out there, but you may have to endure this one if you were planning on playing the series.

												I tried... I really tried... But geez. The lackluster animation isn't an insurmountable problem, because a solid script, quality puzzles, decent voice-actors and likeable characters can make up for pretty much anything. And I'll give the game this at least: the puzzles were pretty good. Aside from the ones which relied on COMPLETELY INVISIBLE AND UNDETECTABLE OBJECTS, that is. But that is the game's only saving grace -- the animation, the writing, the voice-acting and the characters are all dreadful! And you'd think people setting a game in NYC and Chicago would bother to LEARN ABOUT THE CITIES! At least consult a map!

												Ok. I knew that this wasn't one of the most respected adventure games out there but still. I mean if they wanted to make an animated movie they should have done that. This is probably the longest time from game start to interactivity I've ever seen. And why does the main character have to tell me that the game is exciting? Why do I have to wait for the character to make a plan which he then narrates to me? Why is over half of the story narration? And the game in between?

												I played this game so you don't ever have to.SPOILERS AHEADA beautiful but largely unplayable point & click adventure. This game suffers severely from illogical puzzles and unobvious click targets. While the scenes are quite pretty, they're typically poorly designed with regard to contrast for item discovery. You're often left to hover your pointer over every pixel on screen in order to find that one elusive item that must be in the room but doesn't stand out. There's also way too many ""red herrings,"" scenery items you can have your character interact with but which never present a use. Then there's just bizzare item combinations and uses (not even comically), like (SPOILERS) making fake peanut butter when you've already got a jar of the real deal, or tinting a characters glasses with oil to trick them into giving you a bottle of...oil, or fishing a tool out of a trough of mud not by scooping it out with the bowl in your inventory, but by dropping in a flower pot from the second floor!Also the protagonist comes off as a jerk.As a lover of point & clicks I can't recommend anyone ever play this game.

												Dropped the game at chapter 3 out of 6, it just didn't give me enough positive experiences to balance out the downsides.+ Nice art style for its age+ Intuitive UI+ Some fun item descriptions and narration+ A surprisingly non-transphobic depiction of the drag queens. Though it still reduces them to one-note sexist stereotypes just as every other character is depicted in the game.~ Cheesy and silly plot, with dissonant moments of cold-blooded murder~ Puzzles of varying quality, often it's difficult to figure out what the developers want the player to do, and several tasks require pixel-hunting- Very one-dimensional and stereotypical characters, 3 chapters in none of them are likeable (eg. the protagonist guy is sexist, his love interest is emotionally manipulative)- Irritating and over-acted voice acting- Blooody long cutscenes- The facial and walking animations look quite weirdVerdict:A kinda meh experience, more aggravating than enjoyable.

												Listening to the narration of this game was like hammering a whiny, high-pitched spike into my skull. It was so bad that I was unable to actually play the game, as I couldn't make it past the second interruption by the narrator without alt-tabbing and shutting off the game. Why it was considered a good idea to begin the game with a pointless monologue by the most dislikeable character conceivable, I do not know.			"

												Honestly, who gave this poorly made game a thumb up?First of all, I had to switch to 1024x768 every time I wanted to play it. But that would be a small price to pay if the game was good. Sadly, it isn't. From one dimensional characters, via uninteresting and full of cliches story, to irritating controls and pixel hunting type of gameplay. There is not much positive to say about Runaway. There are moments when you'll curl up in your chair out of embarrassement. Half way through the game there is this huge WTF moment when you realise how bad the game really is. I truly believe a 5 year old is able to put up a better story and more interesting characters than this. But even if you're not into story and characters, etc, you won't have good time playing the ""point and click"" moments - the inventory combination choices are unintuitive and sometimes downright stupid. The game requires you to use objects on people without any prior clue whatsoever. You might as well use every item on every person and see if you've hit the bullseye. You will easily miss items - you will eventually feel like electrons in CRT monitors - scanning from left to right towards the bottom of the screen. Or you could just alt+tab to a walkthrough - the old fashioned way. I stopped playing it after realising this game has farily little entertainment value. So little that I can't remember the main character's name. His supposed transformation from a nerd to a cool guy will make you cry ""Oh why did I spent money on this!"". Trust me, I'm a doctor.			"

												2003.... Yeah It feels like a game from 2003.While I'm going to review this game negatively.  It's NOT an awful game.  It's actually good for the time frame.  However the biggest problem with this game is it's a point and click adventure game from 2003.  By this I mean you have a bit of logical jump, weird puzzles, and of course, everyone's favorite feature.  Pixel hunting.  I'm sorry but with no in game hint system, and being forced to hunt for a small object, the game just isn't fun. I'll focus on the first chapter of the game. Now first, let's talk about the main character Brian.  He's... oddly shaped.   But beyond that he isn't that interesting a character.   He works as the player character but he's verbose about everything.  EVERYTHING, and none of it is helpful. On the other side of the story, there's a heroine (yes a heroine) and it's again a 2003 heroine.   Big breasts, skinny waste, cocktail lounge singer, with a cocktail dress, and a face... well I get that they were trying to make her sexy, but they missed, if Brian is oddly shaped,  Gina (the heroine) is plastic surgery gone bad. Anyways there's a LONG opening, at least 15-20 minutes maybe longer, and not very interesting. It also  appears unskipable (save after you finish! just in case)   But I won't fault it's length, they're developing a story, I will fault it's presentation which is.... humorous for the wrong reasons. So anyways, when you final get puzzles you get a total of three rooms to explore, one of them locked away.  There's a good puzzle to open the third room.  That is fine.  Then the problems start.  You need to save Gina, but the game really doesn't make it clear how, however every so often dialog will allude to something.  Making a decoy.  Well to make the decoy seems easy, however... it's not.  You can get the parts of the body with out a lot of struggle, but then you're told you need to cover the head.  ""How do you do that"" well this is where you either get it or you don't.  There's a bag in the room and if you found it, you're good... well almost.  If you search the bag once, you find an item, you need to search the bag again.  And mind you finding the bag in the first place is reasonably hard. Then you have to pixel hunt and find a small piece of paper on one of the three rooms.  Good if you found it yourself. Then you have to pixel hunt a third time and get a book.  Mind you the game doesn't even give you a hint where these objects are, you either find them, or you're stumped.  Thankfully UHS is a thing, and gives good hints.  But the hints I'm getting aren't ""how do I solve the puzzle"" it's ""where is this object.""So after you get the book the worst puzzle comes up.  You need to give a Gina a shower (to wake her up).  you think ""Grab a glass fill it with water and spray her.""   No.. that's too simple.  You need to use a aerasole can and matches to set off a fire sprinkler.  The problem is the sprinkler is maybe two or three pixels wide.  I moused over it three times before I realized it was what I was actually looking for. The thing is this isn't a fun game to pixel hunt, and the story could work if the game wasn't a chore to play.  Even the graphics aren't a total mess, though they are odd.  I like the idea, but the age of the game gets in front of it.  With Telltale games and others being able to be played, I can't really recommend a 12 year old game which expects the player to pixel hunt to find every little object.  And Little is the operative word there.   I would avoid this game, and look for better point and click games.  This one isn't really worth your money.			"

												The puzzles make sense - except for the fact that you have to look at item A again AFTER condition B in order to get to solution C, or otherwise the guy will just say ""Nothing special here"". There's nothing wrong with that idea, though, when item A has already been looked at BEFORE, he should mention *something*, something like ""Oh, this reminds me of XY"".Anyway, apart from that, the graphics are a bit overkill if you ask me - 2D has so much more charme than 3D models - the story is engaging (although not thrillingly), the characters are interesting and not too flat. And this first game is preferable to the sequel, imho.			"

Those old 90s educational games with a adult theme. You know, like Disney's Animated Storybook series or Math Blaster? Yeah, those...			"

												It was so alot of fun, The scenery was interesting, there was quite a bit to do in terms of gameplay. The only thing I didn't like honestly was how deadpan the main character was. I think they could've found someone with more vocal range. Other than that I really enjoyed it.			"

												Nice adventure game, not too long. The only annoying part is in the western town, when you have to walk and walk and walk again and again through the same overview screen (you'll know what I mean when you get there). Still: fun to play. If they are on offer just play all three in the series.			"

												Runaway: A Road Adventure is a great game after what I thought was a mediocre execution of the introduction. Before you take control of the main character, the game plays a rather lengthy cutscene that lasts for about 9 minutes and it serves as a prologue.  The problem is that while the story in it is worth knowing and some of the animation was nice, the overall quality of it suggests that it would have been better if it was shorter. At one point in the cutscene I was wondering if this game was worth getting into.But after the first chapter things really kicked off.  The puzzles are interesting; the side characters flesh out the charm of the setting, such as the janitor who is also a ""businessman"" that sells high quality optics; and the main characters become more attachable as the story develops. The story can get a bit corny at times, but combined with the previous qualities the game turned out to be quite memorable. If you're looking for an adventure game saga, the Runaway series is definitely worth getting into.			"

												This game should be called Runaway: A pixel hunt adventure.  Such an awesome visual presentation is ruined by annoying pixel hunting for items, and the most stupid illogical puzzle solutions to grace an adventure game since their inception.  The game will have you trying to combine anything with everything because it throws common sense to wind and encourages the most idiotic solution.I really wanted to like this one.  Its art direction is top notch, the score is excellent, the voice acting is... well it's great at times but the main character can be whiny and annoying.  However, all the positives didn't overcome the frustration of ridiculous illogical puzzles that will have you consulting a walk-through after wasting hours trying to solve things with common sense.I've downgraded this game from a ""AAA"" game to a ""B-""			"

												It's a somewhat older game from a small studio. Some items are pretty difficult to find and it has a number of items that may only be picked up after some other action which can be a bit demotivating. But most puzzles are good and there are enought headscrating unlikely usable items that you need.It's a bit cheesy in the storyline, but it makes up for it for a good long playthrough that hardly ever gets dull.

												Fun little point and click, most of the desired results from the puzzles are obvious which helps keep the game moving between sessions of working out how to reach the goal.			"

												I haven't played an Adventure game since Inspector Gadget back in the 3rd grade. This game has definitely stepped it up to become a hard and intriguing adventure. My only complaint is that I had do things in ""story"" order even if I thought 4-5 steps ahead on how to solve the puzzlem. Became a little annoying but I'm looking forward to playing the other two in this series.			"

												The puzzles make sense - except for the fact that you have to look at item A again AFTER condition B in order to get to solution C, or otherwise the guy will just say ""Nothing special here"". There's nothing wrong with that idea, though, when item A has already been looked at BEFORE, he should mention *something*, something like ""Oh, this reminds me of XY"".Anyway, apart from that, the graphics are a bit overkill if you ask me - 2D has so much more charme than 3D models - the story is engaging (although not thrillingly), the characters are interesting and not too flat. And this first game is preferable to the sequel, imho.			"

												ENG/FR reviewBought it twice (physical copy and much later Steam version). Runaway made me think that, maybe, the genre was being resurrected. The only bad thing in this game is the ""train"" puzzle, the rest is perfect.If you like point&clicks, go get it!If you're new to point&click and can't stand pixel art (good old LucasArts, stunning new Wadjet Eye), it would be a good start.-------------------------------------------------Je l'ai acheté deux fois (en boîte puis sur Steam bien plus tard). Runaway m'a fait croire un instant que le genre aller revivre. Le seul reproche que j'ai à lui faire c'est l'énigme du ""train"", le reste est juste parfait.Si vous aimez les point&clicks, achetez les yeux fermés.Si vous voulez découvrir le genre et n'aimez pas le pixel art (les bons vieux LucasArts ou ""récemment"" ce qui se fait du côté de Wadjet Eye), c'est un excellent jeu pour commencer.

												Whole Runaway trilogy is totally awesome, but the very first game is one of my favourites. The Road Adventure is warm & cozy, but on the other hand it's hilarious and sometimes frightening (no spoilers!). This game always makes me laugh via its' brilliant jokes and funny cultural referenses. This quest is really worth playing. Yes, I agree, that graphics and models are out of date, but first - it was released in 2003, and second - those lips movements really do the trick and I birst into laughter everytime. I guess it's not a bug, it's a feature!Anyway, Runaway: A Road Adventure has complicated story and puzzles, which are interesting to explore and solve. Totally recommend:)Still Awesome!			"

												I started playing Pendulo games back when The Next BIG Thing came out, and I felt like revisiting their arsenal. I read through the majority of reviews before playing this game and was quite worried at what to expect. I will start out by saying that yes, I do believe it deserves a thumbs up. [WARNING: Save regularly because the game can crash occasionally]The immediate follow-up to that statement is that it's not a perfect game. This game has a lot of things to talk badly about, and I find the majority of mine come down to having puzzles that require nonsensical logic to complete. The answer to this problem is to have a walkthrough handy. I don't support using walkthroughs in most games, but this one actually requires one. The rule of thumb should be, give yourself 10-30 minutes of being stuck/lost before you look up the next step. Most of the time, one step will be enough to get the ball rolling, and you won't need another. A couple of the sections of the game shouldn't require looking anything up, but I'd say that 50% of them do (3 out of 6 Areas). The story is basic, and relatively easy to see where it's going to go, and I felt a lot of nods to Full Throttle in there as well. The voice acting can feel distracting more often than not, but some of the characters redeem this issue. Oscar stands out as a lovable oaf that reminds us all of Lenny from Of Mice and Men. Another thing that might distract people in a time where female characters are becoming more complex and fleshed out, is Gina, who plays the generic damsel in distress. Beyond that fact, she also tends to be clothed in practically nothing throughout the entire game. Her male game equivalent is seen outside of a barn in one of the areas, baking shirtless in the sun, chucking beer cans in a metal tin, but I digress. This game is a decent ride, and on sale, it's a solid playthrough. Not to mention the fact that it's the first of multiple installments. You'll walk away remembering side characters like Sushi, Lula, Rutgers, Oscar, and possibly Saturn. The art style and story are certainly enough to make the game warrant a thumbs up in my book.			"
