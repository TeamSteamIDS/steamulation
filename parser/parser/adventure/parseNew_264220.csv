												This game starts out alot like other games in the genre, learn to walk, jump and run to name a few. The levels become ever more devious as you progress but are never hard for the wrong reasons. One cool mechanic is the scenery/mood change after you die alot. And you will be dying alot. One tip, look carefully ahead of you for any traps that might not be easily apparent. The music is very good and sets the mood nicely for each set of levels. The scenery and backgrounds for each level are beautifully done and are pleasant on the eyes. The hero moves at a slow pace to begin with but before long you are running for your life from traps and ducking and dodging with the best of em. In each level a collectible can be found and in alot of cases, a new power is needed so collecting it must be done later. All in all the game offers value at and above the current price. It has its charm and challenges and will have you cursing every god you can name at times but as always, overcoming the challenges is its own reward. For what the game is and offers, it executes perfectly in every aspect and any platformer fan out there should rise to the challenge.			"

												Reminiscent of Super Meat Boy in its ambience and brutal traps, this little platformer proves itself worthy of those who enjoy a short but fun challenge. This, coupled with an astonishing soundtrack, make this game a must for the genre-lovers considering its current price.The only downside is the current lack of workshop content; it would be nice to see user-created levels in the near future to lengthen even more the game experience.Note that at the time of writing this review, I've roughly completed about 1/3 of the game. In no way does my playtime reflect the actual duration of this game. Considering the levels get more and more complicated (NOTE: The difficulty curve in this game is pretty good), I assume it will last between 2:30 and 3:30 hours.EDIT: I am about to finish this game, only about 10 levels left including a couple special levels, and still lots of achievements to earn. I'd say my estimation of a little more than 2:30h was kind of accurate. The difficulty in the final levels is still a bit challenging, though I find that I may struggle with a level but then complete the next one in just one go. However, the game is still as fresh as when I bought it, and I am enjoying every second of frustration and satisfaction of it.			"

												Brutal platformers are basically small levels with tricky jumps and an emphasis on speed. Mr. Bree+ delivers 60 levels of gameplay, but with a far more forgiving difficulty curve than many of its competitors.The concept is simple, you play as the titular character, running and jumping through 60 progressively more difficult levels. As you waltz through the early stages, you will collect various abilities to aid you such as wall jumping, double jumping, ducking and sprinting. Each level also has a bonus collectible item to find which is usually in a tough to reach spot. Collecting enough of these unlocks the more difficult stages later.Mr. Bree+ is best described as a mashup between Super Meat Boy and Toki Tori. There is less of a focus on speed and momentum, allowing you to take your time and work out the best way to deal with a particular problem. It also has frequent checkpoints so you don’t have to replay the level from the start if you should die. This makes completing the game considerably easier than Super Meat Boy, by borrowing the reduced difficulty, slower pace and level design from Toki Tori. The levels themselves usually involve avoiding spikes, either on the floor, walls or flying through the air. Levels also contain camouflaged traps such as pits or nets that fall from the ceiling, as well plenty of moving platforms.Aside from the core stages, the game packs a plethora of achievements which involve collecting items, completing stages within a time limit and without dying, as well as a few pointless ones such as watching the end credits all the way through. In general, they do add an extra challenge if you found the main game too easy.The game doesn’t control nearly as smoothly as games like the aforementioned Super Meat Boy, or others like They Bleed Pixels. This is likely down to the slower pace, but most certainly a lack of polish on the way Mr. Bree handles. For example, since double jump and wall jump are the same button, he often doesn’t quite know which one to do. Add to this occasional game freezes, Windows 8 compatibility issues and odd bugs like starting a level lodged inside a wall, or a gate not triggered open properly if you press the switch in a certain way, you have a disappointing number of annoying bugs to deal with as well, albeit rarely. These should be relatively easy to fix, but no word as of writing on an update.Mr. Bree+ has a plot, but the developers really tried too hard and got a little too ambitious (Slavery? Really?). The sorts of emotions they try to convey simply do not hit home for several reasons. For starters, the game is just too simplistic for any sort of serious storyline to be taken seriously. Secondly, a lot of the text appears at the bottom of the screen during the game, most of it is missed because you’re too busy concentrating on actually staying alive, the text also disappears so fast that you wouldn’t be able to read it anyway. Even if you did get the chance to read it, you will find many grammar and spelling errors and just bad English in general.The visuals are a mixed bag, with some elements shining while others drag the experience down to the point where it affects the gameplay itself. For starters, the character animation, for a budget title, is simply wonderful. The character sprites are fully animated, along with impressive stylised artwork in the cutscenes. Level design assets are less impressive, with most of them being static and having little variation or consideration for making something aesthetically pleasing to look at. Lastly, the biggest flaw with the graphics by far is that the framerate is locked to 30FPS, which is an absolute travesty for this genre of game.Audio also has its ups and downs. What few sound effects there are come through as mundane and generic, as well as having little variation despite being used repeatedly. On the other hand, the soundtrack is awesome, I mean REALLY awesome. The soundtrack alone is worth the asking price for this game, in my opinion. The soundtrack is not available through Steam, but can be found on Bandcamp for $1.In summary, Mr. Bree+ is an inexpensive introduction to this particular platforming sub-genre. The budget price is justified by the various quality issues, but is fully competent at what it does and the effort that has been put into the presentation shines through in many aspects. A delicious pork chop, even if it does get stuck in your teeth on the way down.Pros:~Cheap~Balanced and steady difficulty curve~Good visual presentation for a budget game~Great soundtrack~Plenty of content, good replayability valueCons:~Several unnecessary and annoying bugs, glitches, freezes~Framerate locked to 30FPS~Disappointing boss fights~Embarrassingly bad plot			"

												Mr. Bree+, an adventure platformer from Brazilian developer TawStudios. The game has received some very positive attention at different stages in its development.The game puts in control of the titular Mr. Bree as he makes his way home to his piggy family, dodging deadly traps and making odd little observations and witticisms to himself. It’s a bit of a mixed bag, but if you can forgive its minor faults you’ll be in for a good ride.The platformer action is pretty solid. Each level challenges you to reach a puzzle piece item to proceed, putting obstacles like pits, spikes, buzz saws, locked doors or falling boulders in your path. Mr. Bree starts out the game without any abilities, not even jumping or ducking, but learns these skills as the game progresses, slowly making you more capable as you proceed.The world doesn’t quite look like a Saturday morning cartoon but it has a pleasant, cheerful quality about it that’s nice to look at. Many of the graphics appear to be hand drawn and some of them have a particularly rough, sketchy quality that might not be equally charming to everyone, but overall the game has a nice, vibrant look with settings full of detail and animation.The game has a fantastic soundtrack that almost doesn’t fit the game. The first levels start out with a dark, somber piano tune that feels very ominous although maybe a little out of synch with the colorful forest background. Later levels pick up the lonely wail of an electric guitar. Depending on your tastes you might find it doesn’t match the rest of the game.Mr. Bree+ does bring a good chunk of game to the table with sixty levels and lots of production value. It’s fun and charming with it’s slightly off English translation, colorful scenery and shredding soundtrack, and I think that platformer fans and occasional players will find something to like about this title.

Platformer masterpieceIt's about: piggy Mr. Bree who's escaping from his captives; jumping a lot; collecting special ""bad memories"" to get access to locked levels for better story understanding; collecting special ""good memories"" which provide additional skills: jump, crouch, run, double jump.Why you should play this: you like platformer-games and don't mind to go through some amounts of failed attempts; simple, but nice story and great soundtrack; unlike in many other platformers here you truly develop your character obtaining new skills (RPG-light, hmm... very light) and not just simply running through the same levels; level-design: it truly changes from level to level and it always different (no copy/past parts), adopted for new piggy's skills and looks comprehensive and simple at the same time, some of the levels have secret places; game encourages you to get back to previous levels after you got new skill for collecting ""bad memories"" - you might find that with new skills previous levels feel and play in other ways; right approach to the difficulty: there's no fights for 'right' microsecond when you need to push the button, here you need to be precise, accurate and fast with controls, but at the same time do everything in cold blood; on some levels things looks impossible to do, but that's wrong impression: after the most suicide and difficult double-jump the more suicide double-triple-wall jump follows and this feels amazing; check-points on most of the levels.Why you may not like it: it's truly hardcore: you need to be mentally prepared for constant failures - one wrong step and you must start over again (or start from checkpoint); colour of the level's background is changing depending on amount of failures: so, one of them is deeply red and it becomes difficult to differentiate level's enviroment - you might not see properly traps, spikes and etc.; no option to regulate the volume: you can only turn music on or turn it off, the same about sounds - very strange approach in 2015, soundtrack is very nice, but still...; it's not intuitively clear how to fight with the first boss.Unique platformer game with great amount of fun for a very modest price. The weapon of your choice if you desperately looking for challenge.P.S. Gamepad is strongly recommended. "

												For those wondering, the majority of my listed playtime was spent idling for cards. I've actually beaten the original Flash incarnation of this game before, so this is less a review and more of a comparison/series of general thoughts.Mr. Bree was, and still is, an enjoyable cartoon platformer. Through a series of 60 levels, you'll control the titular pig as he runs and jumps through a series of increasingly-difficult locations, ranging from simple forests to abattoirs and everything in-between.I never got the sense that this was as difficult as any of the Meat Boy games, as there seemed to be a lot of leeway in difficulty - I never felt it was impossible to complete a stage, and the levels feel like they were designed to reward people who practiced the wall-jumping/double-jumping and wanted to speedrun them.Much like Meat Boy, though, the story is near-irrelevant fluff meant to tie certain worlds together. The whole pretext of the story is a pig waking up with amnesia after escaping from a slaver, and he has forgotten most of his basic skills. I felt that this concept (of having to learn your abilities) could have been taken a lot further. While there are opportunities to go back to earlier levels and get items with unlocked abilities, the levels themselves never really play up the fact that you're limited in mobility for a certain stretch of time. Contrast that to something like Don't Move, which rewards you based on trying and/or failing to increase your mobility or set of abilities. Once you unlock double-jumping, most of the levels become a breeze and there's no real threat to any of the obstacles.Still, I found it to be an enjoyable romp, and for the price point (usually around $3, but less during sales), you could do a whole lot worse.

												Mr. Bree is just another pig trying to make it in a 2D platformer world. Despite his inability to survive even the slightest contact with a sharp object, he continues again and again until he makes it home.Honestly, I don't care much for Super Meat Boy and the sub-genre it helped spawn. I don't fault the way those games are designed, it's just a personal preference. Short & brutally hard games just aren't my thing. I still managed to get most of the way through Mr. Bree+. I guess I should explain why.Relatively-speaking, this is a pretty easy game. The deaths are constant, but the checkpoints are frequent. The music is also really good. Porcine protags are few and far between, so this game gets points for that. At the moment the only other game I can think of is Muchi Muchi Pork. This is a 2D shooter about pig-girls who ride flying bicycles, while fighting evil*. Anyway, this is a game that's actually rather pleasant, despite Bree's aptitude for exploding. His constant internal monologuing makes him a bit pretentious as well, so half the time I feel like his deaths are deserving. There are a decent amount of stages, the rare collectible, and the controls are suitable enough. There's even a hardcore difficulty and you're constantly challenged to beat your best times. However, Mr. Bree+ is held back from potential greatness due to a number of issues:Poor frame-rate - It goes without saying that a platformer should be 60 fps. Mr. Bree+ is 30? Less than 30? More than 30? Whatever, it's not good enough. This lack of frames translates to missed jumps, which results in shredded pork** Flying objects are also more difficult to dodge, which is the reason why I didn't beat the other boss. There are two of them, one at the end of the forest, the other at the end of the slaughterhouse.BIG hit-box - The difference between Mr. Bree and Mr. Breesket can sometimes be attributed to his large hit-box. It's kinda hilarious really, because even sharp objects that touch his cape will kill him. I figure that this game can be improved, if it accounted for bacon-saving close shaves. The lousy boss-fights - The thing about bosses, is that any issues with the game tend to culminate at these exact moments. This evil warthog is beaten by dropping a box on his head a few times. Getting there is a pain. Before he each attack he has a little code-word, which clues you in on what he's going to do next. The thing is, you won't know the first time around, which leads to guaranteed deaths. This might have been alleviated if the hit-box and frame-rate were improved. The other (slaughterhouse) boss forces you to dodge flying spikes while wall-sliding. It was at this point I surrended.In my opinion, both bosses could have been dumped in exchange for some new stages, or a better finale. Maybe Bree could attempt to escape giant meat-grinder/tank, or parachute from a butcher's flying fortress while dodging buzz-saws, I don't know. Fixing the frame-rate/hit-box issues is probably a lot simpler, and would leave me less of an excuse for being a quitter.Mr. Bree+ isn't a bad game. Even for a guy like myself who thinks spikes should belong in pits and not walls, ceilings, or in the atmosphere. Aside from a frustrating finale it's a decent enough game to jump through. Give it a go, you might not regret it.*If you guessed that Muchi Muchi Pork is a Japanese game. Congrats!....You don't get a prize.**Mmm...shredded pork.			"

												Good game. Highly recommended for fans of platformers.The story is decent though I felt that it lacked something. Can't quite put my finger on what exactly it lacked but it kept me interested long enough to actually complete it. At first I tried to play using just the keyboard but quickly switched to my gamepad.NOTE: I recommend using a gamepad as it makes some of the tighter places in the game much easier to reach.One complaint I have is that you can't change the controls. I would rather have used the triggers for the run ability and whenever I pushed the thumbstick in, the game paused causing me to die after I resumed the game. A couple of places in the game I glitched out and had to restart the level which was a little annoying. Luckily the levels are not that big so not much progress was lost.The game is fairly short but enjoyable. Can't say it has much replayability but I only paid $2.00 for it so I'm not complaining. I like the allusion to a sequel at the end. If you buy it and play it you'll see what I mean. I do hope there will be a sequel but this time around a little more focus on the overall story would be very nice. One annoying feature of the game, when you die a number of times the background changes color and throws shadows on the game which sometimes makes it harder to play. Sometimes it's raining, which doesn't make much difference to the way the character interacts with the world but is annoying. Key solution? DON'T DIE! SpoilerIf you do buy this game and play it, note that the Wild Boar boss at the end is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Just keep moving and don't let him or anything he throws touch you and You'll be okay! NOTE: That it's easier said than done! "

												An Open Letter To The Developers:I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for making a platformer with responsive controls, that challenges me and makes me think. Thank you for supporting Gravis Gamepads; most Indie developers these days think that just providing support for the XBOX 360 controller is good enough, so I appreciate that you thought of the rest of us. Thank you for making a game that runs beautifully on my three year-old Big Box computer. Thank you for a game that is multidimensional, and that features an extraordinary, bright, appropriate color palette...and thank you for knowing when to mute that palette for dramatic effect. Thank you for creating a game that has thoughtfulness and depth in storytelling, emotion, and gameplay; just by simply putting puzzle pieces that can't be reached until Mr. Bree acquires later skills adds replayability (not to mention wanting to beat my own times). It should also be said: While I've not experienced any issues with running or playing the game, thank you for addressing the complaints and suggestions of those who have.I regret not picking this up sooner (I almost feel guilty; it's so good that it deserves more than a bundle price!), so I'll make you this promise: Keep putting as much thought into your future games, and I'll pre-order every one.Thank you for treating your gamers, and yourselves, with such tremendous respect. That's not often seen these days, so...THANK YOU!!			"

												A pleasant surprise. Mr. Bree+ is what you'd call a ""budget hardcore platformer"". I got this game in the IG Friday Special bundle and thought that it's just the usual bundle-fodder. However one day I got a crazy idea that instead of just idling for cards I might as well play it! I was pleasantly surprised, it's a nice little game with interesting mechanics and brutal (I mean hardcore brutal) platforming experience. The graphics are nice (for the price) nothing extraordinary, the music is atrocious but you can turn it down anytime. You'll die a lot, but thanks to the nifty checkpoint system and non-existent loading times you won't eve notice it (except the achievements popping up at 50,500, 1000 and god know how many deaths!)Anyway to keep a long story short, this is a nice little game and definitely worth playing.

You can throw at him daggers, spikes, sawblades, traps, ANYTHING! Mr. Bree WILL SURVIVE! He is awesome. He also comments everything he encounters, there are neat cutscenes and the music is just.. wow... beautiful. Highly recommended and it's CHEAP!

												It's hard for me to come up with anything cooler than a badass pig that takes on wild boar taskmasters and dodges sawblades, spikes and a whole other assortment of hazards in a search for his family. I fell in love with this game right after watching the trailer and bought it minutes after. Also because of this game for the first time in a very long time I played a game all through the night and then right when I got up in the morning until I'd beaten it. I'm ordinarily not even a platformer fan, but this game's concept was amazing. If there were any drawbacks in this game, the only one would be that there could have been more story, but it wasn't badly lacking.			"

												Ah what to say that hasn't been said? This is yet another entry in the ""super hard, FML, I hate my life, I hate this game, FU"" controller throwing hard-as-nails platforming genre. It's immediately comparable to Super Meat Boy and to a much lesser extent, Braid. I say Braid simply b/c of the soundtrack which has a wistful and relaxing approach while you meet your death over and over again. Gamewise its just a simple platformer with some puzzle elements as you go along. You go through levels avoiding various traps and you slowly gain new abilities. You cannot jump in the first few levels. You cannot crouch in the first fewer levels, but eventually you can do both along with other abilities that you gain as you progress.This game is recommended for two sorts of players. If you are a platforming masochist (as I am) and enjoy torturing yourself while you master the levels, this game is up your alley. I also recommend the game for the very strong soundtrack which is where the comparison to Braid comes in. There's a lot of piano, violin, and live drums rather than a drum machine, which gives the music a more organic feel to it. Frankly, the music is what kept me going as I found myself raging more and more (one look at my achievements will tell you how easy it is to rack up the easy deaths) at this fun, but torturous, game. This also feels by design as a more erratic soundtrack would make it harder to want to go for ""one more level"".It's already low priced and its been bundled a couple of times which should make it an easy purchase for an SMB or platforming fan. At the time of this review I've not even covered a fraction of the levels, and with timed runs through every level, replayability is very high. Level design is smart even in the early stages. If I had to choose a negative trait, I'm not much of a fan of the screen tint changes as you die more and more in the same level. It makes it harder to see the smaller obstacles and while its pretty obvious this is by design, it annoyed me more than I liked it.Get it. Torture yourself. Enjoy the music and the very strong color this game exudes. And watch out for hidden traps and later on, the nets that will surely cause even more pork chops being served in Mr. Bree's lovely forest beginnings.Controller is highly recommended to enjoy this game to the fullest potential.

												Mr. Bree+ is an epic platformer which provides hours of fun and challenge. With the changing mood, great soundtrack, level-based Metroidvania-esque mechanics and tens of levels and collectables, this game will not leave you cold. Along the levels, you follow a story about Mr. Bree travelling through the forest to get back to his family. I played for quite a long while this afternoon and I don't think I'm even halfway through the game. If you don't get the game, you'll miss out on a lot.Mr. Bree+ doesn't leave you wishing for anything more but a sequel as good as it is.			"

												 I consider myself a big fan of the genre, so I had to write a review. This game looks to be inspired by hardcore and classic platformers (elements from Super Meat Boy and even things that remind me of Rayman). The game overall plays really smooth. Platforming mechanics are ok, but the wall jumping is trash in my opinion. The music/audio is excellent, great controller support, trading cards, and steam achievements.With all that said, its not really THAT hard on the normal mode. There are checkpoints throughout each level, so if you fail you can still finish the level without completely restarting. To me, replaying a game for a second time on a harder difficulty that I havent unlocked isnt the way I like to experience ""replayability"". For the price, you really cant beat it. It is an entertaining platformer, that will suck you in.			"

												Mr. Bree plus deceived me with it's cute art style into believing it might be a fun little platforming adventure. It actually tries to be somewhere between Super Meatboy and an unfair platformer. For me it is rather an unfair (albeit beatable) one because of bad controls and communication. The game forces controller users to use the analog stick for movenment controls where a directional pad would feel more appropriate. Traps are hard to see and often require sheer luck. New mechanics are introduced in a conterintuitive manner - the wall jump for example is aquired in in a tight space with no way to try out immediatly.My ""favourite"" aspect of the game is a red tint that appears when you start to many times on a level. It makes it even harder to see traps dangers and, well, anything.			"

												HUGE NOTE: Mr. Bree+ apparently runs in some kind of Flash and it may be supremely laggy or drop frames constantly for you (this happens on my PC). If you in any way think this is going to affect you, AVOID AT ALL COSTS, it's miserable.Basically this game is Super Meat Boy except you're not kosher now*. Also, the controls are sloppier. You know how SMB really worked because the controls were tight at all times? Yeah, this game doesn't have that and it ups the frustration as a result. I wouldn't say it's ever as hard as the worst parts of SMB, but only because I played every stage in SMB and this has nothing near that game's heights. Overall I'd say it ramps up pretty fast. Really wish this had a demo because that would be the perfect way to judge if this would work for you/whether you'd like it, but I guess that's too much to ask from some folks.I really don't think it's a bad game? Just incompetent enough that it really makes me mark it down on the rough side of ""not fun"", even on the earlier stages where framerate is consistent it didn't feel that POLISHED. I can't tell if the frame lag is what's making jumps feel semi-random or not, either, a single tap of the button is sometimes a short hop, sometimes ""WHOOPS YOU LEPT INTO A SAW"".* I just kind of assumed Meat Boy was kosher because Salt Factory. I may be incorrect.			"

(mostly spikes)but still a solid game, and I enjoy difficult platformers like these. Definitely worth playing if you are into difficult platformers.The level design / environments look great as well.Some downsides:As you die the brightness / night/day cycle changes, and the ""sunset orange"" part makes it VERY difficult to see some traps.Not much of a story.The Title of the game is kind of odd.

												Gaaah this game has so many issues. The most glaring is that the wall jump mechanic is *awful*. Really, purely, one of the worst wall jumps I've ever seen in a platformer. Doesn't tend to work properly is most of the problem... gets pre-empted by double jump a lot. As well, there's some problematic level design; Level 5 and Level 60 both stick in my mind as having the biggest issues, but there's a lot scattered throughout. But... on the whole it's generally okay. Not amazing, but for the price you pay it's not overcharging you or anything. The levels are generally pretty nice, a lot of mechanics and decent variety. It's competent, at the very least. I enjoyed it as a whole. Still far from perfect but I can tell the devs at least put their heart into it.			"

												This is a nifty little platformer with a few hours worth of entertainment and mild frustration. You are a pig...walking on 2 legs for whatever reason and everything around you is going to gut you. There are spikes, arrows, traps etc. Every level introduces new elements. There is also 1 puzzle piece per level which you can collect to unlock a sort of prologue.The character will frequently share his thoughts with you if you enable it in the options although you will often miss it, because the game is quite demanding. It calls itself ""hardcore"" I think, but it's not Super Meatboy level insane. It plays a lot slower and more determined, although some passages seem to be only manageable by pure luck (arrows so fast you can barely see them) and those are extremely annoying. Luckily though the game handles pretty decently. Your character moves when you tell him to and stops when you tell him to, even in mid air, which took some getting used to. He just stops dead when you release the button.You can also get 5 special powers. The first of which is how to jump (lol that was kinda funny). The game gets increasingly more complex (1st of 3 official ""chapters""). It also looks kinda neat and is challenging, but mostly fair, as you get a multitude of check points during each level. The only real gripe I got with it is the setting. You're in a forest and that's it apparently (with exception of the slaughterhouse prologue you can gradually unlock). Also when you die the screen often changes colour (I think this is to simulate daylight and night time?).Hands down the best thing about this is the beautiful and soothing sound track though. Whoever composed it is a genius and deserves your money. If it were purchaseable I'd buy it. It is eerily enchanting and ominous.			"

												Initially, I just booted the game up to get the cards and play for a few minutes. Maybe grab a few achievements. I ended up playing through the entire game today and getting about 3/4 of the achievements. I was surprised by how fun the game was. It was difficult enough that I struggled against many of the later levels and the bosses. But it wasn't so hard that I wanted to stop playing or bang my head on a wall. It could probably be compared to Super Meat Boy, but I don't feel like it is quite that difficult or punishing. There are no heat-seeking missles. It does have checkpoints pretty frequently, which I like, but some hardcore platformers might think that makes the game too easy. Though there is a hardcore mode after beating the game that removes the checkpoints.Anyway, it is a quality game for a good price. Sometimes I did have to use my mouse on the menu screen even though I used my controller during the levels. And I think I had one or two bugs where my character got stuck in a platform or under a falling box and had to completely restart the level. Overall, I feel like the game is worth the price.			"

												Mr. Bree is a hardcore platformer. It is generally easy to pick up, but it gets progressively harder as you go on with a ton of traps ready to kill you at any time.Mr Bree balances the hardcore nature of the gameplay with very generous checkpoints. This is nice for players who might be a little intimidated by a harder platform game as you can easily make progress even after dying a lot.I highly recommend this game as it was quite fun. With the game time above I was able to complete the game and also spend a lot of time in hardcore mode, which is truly brutal towards the end. There are tons of achievements and you can also collect items inside the levels to unlock more levels. For the money it was well worth it, as it's a great game with a reasonable amount of content.One small gripe I do have about the game is the changing color scheme within the levels. The color scheme of a level will change after you die about 5 times, and this will repeat in going through certain colors or weather effects. This would be a cool effect if it didn't dramatically change how the screen looks. The red color was quite annoying as it was very difficult to see. Of course I could just suicide my character until the color scheme changed, but I feel it is something the developers should look into and consider changing.The 2 boss fights in the game are ok, but don't feel too fun because of their boring mechanics that are reused between both of them. I feel more time and creativity could go into them to make them more interesting, or just remove them in favor of hard platforming.These are my only complaints, and this game was still pretty great and I'm glad I purchased it. If you're a fan of challenging 2D platformers, this should be a no brainer for you.			"

												Let's call this a ""soft"" no.Mr. Bree+ is a difficult and surprisingly dark and bloody platformer. You start with nothing but the ability to move back and forth, but quickly learn how to jump. From there, you unlock other moves (a crouch, a wall jump, and a double jump) that will let you go back to earlier levels and collect items you couldn't get before to unlock bonus levels. The difficulty scales fairly well, and the controls are good enough that you have a decent handle on what you're doing most of the time (although wall jumping takes some getting used to).HOWEVER, this game has some major problems. The most important one is that this game must have some sort of memory leak or something, because the framerate is terrible and only gets worse as you keep playing. I could still manage to beat levels, but good lord is it ugly, and I can definitely see it throwing some people off. The game also does this thing where after every 5 deaths or so, the look of the level changes. The problem is that after the first 5 deaths on a stage, it changes to this very dark black and red theme, like this. It makes it much harder to see what's going on, as there are some platforms that are hard to distinguish even when the lighting is normal, and it also makes some traps like the trapping pits basically impossible to see. At that point, it's almost better to just kill yourself 5 more times just to change the lighting to something more tolerable.It's kinda hard for me to give this game a thumbs down, because I did like the level layouts and the controls are pretty much fine. But man, it just does NOT run correctly, in addition to having levels be almost unplayable for a period of 5 lives and a few bugs that freeze the game. I would say wait until a patch, but it doesn't seem like the devs actually plan on doing that. If it ever goes on sale for less than a dollar, maybe you'll get some fun out of it? But really, it's just a mess.			"

												This is definitely a good game worth the price. As already mentioned in other reviews, this game is similar to Super Meat Boy. But there are a few really annoying things in this game:- Changing weather (This should've been a cool feature, but in the end it's really annoying because traps are hard to see when it happened)- Dumb falling net traps (Those will rustle your jimmies)Other than that, it's a great game. I like how the game has checkpoints rather than the requirement of beating the level from start to finish in 1 life. 8/10.			"

 4/5. GREAT GAME !  OVERALL I loved this sidescroller, it takes its inspiration on Super Meat Boy and that's not a bad thing, it's really fun to get through the 45 main levels through trial and error and will highly recommend it for $3 to any platformer lover. REPLAYABILITY It took me nearly 5h to finish the game main stages and its rather unforgiving final boss, however I then decided to play some of my other games and didn't finish to unlock the 15 secret levels of The Slaughterhouse, if you are a hardcore player you will need to collect special puzzle pieces hidden through the main levels to have access to it, 3 pieces = 1 stage of Slaughterhouse.  GAMEPLAY It has good controls, although sometimes very sensitive near the ledges (reminded me of Super Mario for the NES), I played the game with an Xbox 360 game pad and had a blast, it has a good learning curve and doesn't punish you when you die since you are just teleported to your last checkpoint stone on the level. AESTHETIC I loved the visual look of the game, a nice touch was that every time you die you respawn and the time of the day has moved forward and on sun down all is really reddish and a little harder to distinguish some elements, I rather play during night, morning or day but I enjoyed this nonetheless, if I was stuck on some area and things got reddish I just committed suicide a few times until night had fallen. STORY The story is quite bizarre, you get a better grip of the story by looking at the trailer than by the game's cinematics. You are a pig who wakes up in the forest with amnesia and are trying to get back home, as you progress you collect some golden puzzle pieces that actually unlock a bit of your memory and grant you a few more abilities (jump, run, double jump, etc) and this is what drives the game forward until you get back home and battle the game's final boss, an classic boss that you will need to memorize all his attack patterns to beat, meaning that you might die (A LOT) in the process. MUSIC The music is so so, you pretty much only have a couple of tracks but fortunately the tunes aren't that bad or otherwise this game would have become very nightmarish very soon, I played around 15 levels a day and finished it in 3 sittings and wasn't bothered by the score at any time (except maybe with my 249 attempts to beat the boss).

												This is basically Take a good concept and drag it on way too far: The game.- There are very few different hazards, far too few to keep 60 levels varied- Several hazards rely more on the player not seeing them than actually being dangerous, making for some quite cheap deaths- The story is pretty unique, but like the levels, it's stretched way too long- Several parts of the story are easy to run past, and they don't respawn if you run backOn the other hand, the graphics are beautiful. And the soundtrack is absolutely stunning, I can't praise it enough.Instead of buying this game, I recommend buying the soundtrack[mattschiffertawstudioentertainment.bandcamp.com], then playing the free Mr. Bree - Returning Home[www.kongregate.com].

												Here we have a sidescrolling platformer with controller support. You are a pig who has suffered total memory loss. The story is strange but also funny and enjoyable and it adds a lot more depth to the game than other Indie Platformers where you just grind through levels, not knowing why. The worlds are full of traps, so you may die a lot trying to figure out how to get through the level and collect all items. Personally I'd actually enjoy it more than Super Meat Boy if it worked on my PC. The game was coded using Flash, so basicly it has no way to utalize the hardware of my PC which in turn makes it glitchy, constantly crashing, and after a few levels time seems to slow down so reaction times for me are still the same, but projectiles and traps engage so slowly that I can easily out manuver them and avoid them. At first I thought the slowing effect was part of the game because I was dying so much, but once I restarted the game, the effect was gone until I beat a few more levels and then it was back again. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I am running a 5 year old computer with an i5 2.3 ghz processor and a ATI HD 5470 graphics card with 512 mbs of ram, but I doubt it. Other platformers play perfectly with exception to Fez which is understandable considering it's complexity. I want to like Mr. Bree+ but as it stands broken right now, I highly recommend that you save your $3 and put a down payment on a less buggy platformer.			"

												You are a pig named Mr. Bree. You've been through something terrible that you don't quite remember and all you want to do is get home to see your family. Thus, you begin your platforming adventure through the forest. First, the good: The art style is very nice and the music is pretty good as well. Checkpoints are provided for most levels, so you can pass even the harder levels without too much difficulty. These can be turned off when you unlock hardcore mode. There are collectibles to find that unlock extra levels and the rest of the story. The level design is nice for the most part.The bad: The game is riddled with bugs. The game crashes and freezes randomly, has poor controller support, and environments that blend together and make it hard to distinguish foreground and background. Wall jumping feels janky and the controls in general do not feel tight enough to be in a 'hardcore-style' platformer. There's also a mechanic where the time of day changes each time you die in a level. Some of the lighting schemes for certain times of day render traps and pitfalls nearly invisible, making levels that you are already having trouble with even harder simply because you can't see anything.For $2.99, I didn't expect a lot from the game. It feels like there is a decent platformer hiding somewhere beneath the bugs and issues and I think I could recommend it if some things got fixed. As it is, I'd rather just play Super Meat Boy.			"

												Mr.Bree starts out feeling pretty good with nice colourful graphics and ok controls, but when you get further in the game you start so see flaws that are unacceptable in this type of a game. Firs thing you will notice is that traps and projectiles blend into the backgrounds way too easily and when the screen scrolls things tend to get blurry and hard to see. The controls while ok for non hardcore games, but for this i find them not responsive enough. Wall jumping mechanics also are not to my liking.The game crashes constantly under Win 8.1, so i played it on my laptop on Win 7 and it seems to work ok on that.Level design is ok, but there is nothing here you would not have seen in Super Meatboy already.For the price it currently is on it is good value, but left a sour taste in my mouth so i can not recommend this game.

												정확한 컨트롤을 요구하는 게임. 스토리도 흥미롭게 지켜볼수있으며 중학생 수준의 영어만 있어도 전체적인 스토리가 파악이 된다. 노말 난이도와 하드코어난이도가 천지차이기 때문에 일반적인 플레이어는 2회차를 하지 않는것이 좋다.			"

												The best part of this plodding platformer is the engrish the main character spouts every level. The graphics are pretty but reflect poorly on the gameplay, where branches and leaves often cover up deadly hazards. It's basically a cruddy super meat boy.			"

												Buyer beware, whatever you do, do not buy this game.I'm actually ashamed to have spent money on this, and I hope the devs are ashamed for releasing it in this state.I can't even run this game properly on my gaming rig because of the ridiculous (Read 5 FPS) lag.Do not purchase this game, and if it's in an indie bundle where you can split the revenue, don't even give a cent to the devs.			"

												It's not the new Super Meat Boy, if that is what you are looking for. There is a story, which I like, and graphics are quite ok for a game in this price range. Main drawback is the gameplay itself. The pig moves funny and this is the only game where my controller fail to be recognized. I was disapointed with this. Maybe when I get my controller working, this might be different.			"

												'm not going to say this game isn't similar to Super Meat Boy because it is. It still has a very unique feel to it and is more forgiving than SMB with checkpoints and general level difficulty. I completed the game without doing alot of extra stuff, like collecting dark memorys, in about 3 hours. If you are a fan of harder platformer games I totally recommend you pick this up.			"

												Solid and challenging platformer, along the lines of Super Meat Boy, but with smaller (and fewer) levels and less floaty controls. The story and way the game progresses is enjoyable and unique. The English translation is rough, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment.			"

												I rreeaally want to fully recommend this game, but be forwarned you may have to tinker with some settings if your using windows 8 to get it to run smoothly.  This does not resolve everything, however, theres a few times it may lock up and have fits.That aside its a very addictive game once you get a handle how the game flows fans of Super Meat Boy will be right at home with this.I really hope the Devs figure out whats going on with this title and issue a fix or an update but if you can handle the hassle its well worth it in the end esp for $2.

												Lots of fun.  Challenging.  Frustrating but soooo gratifying when it all works out.  Only problem I have with it, is probably an issue with my particular gamepad.. But the 'hold to run' to run button is on the far right when it should be at the bottom if the jump is on the left. ANYWAYS. Good game, worth it.			"

												Great and difficult platformer. Really classic, ya know? Oh, aaaaand, of course can't leave one final, teensie, important detail out: The soundtrack is INSANELY good! Suuuper reminiscent of Valdis Story: Abyssal Story. Great vibes; definitely worth a pickup.			"

												At first I was hesitant about getting this game from some of the negative reviews saying the controls weren't that great. So when it was on a Steam sale for a buck or two I figured why not?I am glad I bought this and gave it a try, this game is highly enjoyable if you like games like ""N+"" or Super Meat Boy, my own personal opinion is I like it better than Super Meat Boy. The controls are responsive (I play on a Microsoft Xbox Controller) although the wall jump takes a tad bit of getting used to.The levels are challenging but I found them to be not that frustrating at all due to a good layout of check points for each level.The only negative thing I really came across was some random times during the Level Select screen the controller doesn't work at all and you have to use the mouse, other than that little nitpick the game itself is great. Like I mentioned before, if you're a fan of Super Meat Boy, N+ and maybe 10 Second Ninja, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game just because I had a couple left over dollars from buying another game, but I got a very nice supprise. The platforming is very fun and challenging and it controls very well. I still can't beat the final boss it is way too difficult but the rest of the game is fantastic.

												varrying levels brutal platforming in just large enough stages to either make you feel good or rage with time progression showing the day pass as you die. Imagine Super meatboy but only if SMB was at all fair and was an awesome pig, and also it slowly builds and adds to your skills over time instead of throwing everything at you all at once. Totally worth the buy if you enjoy a challenge but don't want to slam your face against a cheese grater in psychotic fits of rage.			"
