												I've now finished the game so i've updated my review.This game is a lot of fun, not sure why the professional reviewers hate it so much. Maybe they're expecting it to be a fast-paced action game or something like that which it definitely isn't.It's a detective game with an interesting story and characters that draws you in. It's also pretty novel in that you're playing a criminal-turned-detective's ghost who's trying to find the identity of his killer. You spend the game collecting clues to figure out your killer's identity while stopping along the way to help out other lost souls in little sidequests where you figure out how they died so they can pass on. There are also lots of collectibles, some of which provide background for the story, such as notes left by the main character's wife, or that unlock stories about unsolved crimes connected to hauntings. You end up collecting a lot of clues and you have to figure out which ones will help you solve whatever crime you're working on. They make sense and its fun. I've noticed a few negative reviews saying the clues don't make sense and you end up just clicking on everything till you get it right. I only did this once at the beginning of the game...and all I can say is, try thinking a bit and paying attention before just mashing your mouse. If you do this, you'll pretty quickly get a feel for how the clues work in the game and figure out which ones are useles. You can also posess the living, and while you can't move them, you can help them remember and eavesdrop on their conversations or thoughts. You can, however, posess cats which allow you to reach places you can't reach on your own. Everything about the game makes sense...you can't walk through the outdoor walls of buildings that have been consecrated, the demons you have to sneak past to take down from behind are souls who never passed on, etc. The mood the game sets just enhances the experience, being creepy and immersive.Overall, this game is a lot of fun. Story is great, gameplay is fun, voice acting is well done. Having finished the game now, the story is a pretty good detective story, with everything falling satisfyingly into place at the end and a few neat twists. There are only a few drawbacks: the graphics aren't the best, but they're still decent (especially the lip synching); sometimes when you posess someone and listen to their thoughts you'll hear the same thought in different people; the parts where you have to sneak behind demons and take them out can be a bit tedious. However, all these are definitly worth overlooking.The other drawback is that the game is a bit short. I finished it in 7 hours, and if you check out my achievements you'll see I didn't get 100% completion. I did all the side-quests and found as many collectibles as I could. You could probably stretch it out to 10 hours if you wanted 100% completion which seems totally possible in a single playthrough. Its up to you to decide whether a 7-10 hour game is worth $60 or if you want to wait for a sale.In short, if you like story-driven games, or mystery/adventure games then you'll probably like this game. If you want this game to be a gritty shooter, then go buy Max Payne instead, because you won't get that with this game. Having finished it, I would now give it between a 7 and an 8 out of 10.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure detective game, which was released in mid-2014 on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One. The game was developed by Airtight Games; which hadn't released anything worthwhile for a while before this game. You play the role of detective Ronan O'Connor, based in a town called Salem in USA. The story is based around hunting down a serial killer by the name of ""The Bell Killer"". Ronan is killed by the serial killer at the beginning of the game and you are revived as a ghost and must find the killer before he can move on to the afterlife. The game is played in a third person view as you wander around the town of Salem, the town is split into a couple of separate areas, such as churches, graveyards petrol stations etc. As you progress through the story, you learn a few different abilities, such as being able to teleport yourself short distances, being able to possess other living beings allowing you to read their minds or being able to influence their decisions in dialog scenes. The main game play element is solving the mystery of the killer; you do this by investigating the crime scenes for clues on the killer, and trying to predict their next move. This takes on a similar way of doing things as games like LA Noire has done; in that you have to find specific items of evidence scattered, and sometimes hidden around the crime scene in order for you to put them all together in order to resolve the scene. This can lead to quite a few moments of where you need to study all the evidence put in front of you in order to solve it giving it a real detective vibe. On top of these detective scenes, there is a small element of combat in the game - as you are a ghost, living humans are not able to detect you; however the demon souls of the death world can. You have to remain hidden to these ghosts in shadows before being able to pounce out behind them to kill them by pressing a few key sequences in a small QTE - these combat scenes are very few and far between however and aren't really anything to rave about as they become very monotonous as you progress in the story. Visually, Murdered: Soul Suspect looks nice. The whole game takes place in the time frame of one evening, so the darkness of night gives the game a very eerie feel to it. It doesn't have ultra-realistic graphics, but all of the characters are well animated. There are a couple of poor quality textures, however given that this is a sort of open world game, this can be forgiven somewhat.  The story in Murdered: Soul Suspect is something really special. From the opening scene, I was completely drawn into the plot and was able to fully immerse myself in this world being unfolded in front of me. As you progress, you come across other characters who aid Ronan in his efforts to solve the mystery and you grow attached to them too. The story is 100% linear though; there are no game changing decisions which you have to make which disappointed me slightly. But the overall plot which is being shown here is really interesting.As this game is being categorized in the horror genre, I would of expected a little more from the sound effects, but I was let down by the fact that there isn't anything really that scary in Murdered: Soul Suspect; the scariest I came across was the demon's you encounter; and even they are tame and the lack of any jump scares or horrifying scenes was a let-down too. Every character you find in the game is fully voice acted to a high quality though. None of the voicing sounds off or cringy which is always a plus. I found that there was next to zero levels of difficulty in Soul Suspect; the lack of any real combat leaves this game without any skill element, and is purely based on your ability to solve the crime scenes by finding the relevant clues - I was able to resolve all of the crime scenes with a 3 star rating 99% of the time (you are scored out of three). The hardest point I found has to be due to the game's controls which I will go into on the technical issues section of this review. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a vast open world game; you are able to go wherever you want, whenever you want (within reason). There is absolutely tons of stuff to explore and investigate not related to the main plot. There are a number of side investigations you can complete in the early chapters, but these slowly become less and less common as you progress and focus more on the main plot. Another huge part of this game is finding the collectables; this has to be the game with the most collectables in I have ever played - there are hundreds to find.  Each level has its own version of collectable items, and there are also the overall games collectables which unveil even more about the main character's past, and information about the killer. Due to the fact that there are so many of these to find; I felt a little overwhelmed by trying to find them all and just sort of with the approach of picking any up which I come across whilst completing the investigations. I finished Murdered: Soul Suspect in just over thirteen hours; this was with doing all of the side investigations, and collecting over a hundred collectables. I also took the time to playout all of the dialog options with all of the characters and spent a lot of time exploring the town of Salem. Sadly though; there is no reason what so ever to play through this game for a second time; you are not able to change the story in anyway nor are you able to ramp up the difficulty simply because there is no difficulty there in the firstI had a couple of technical problems whilst playing. Firstly I was playing on my high end rig, on 1080p settings and even though the majority of the time the frame rate was over 100 fps, it still felt like it was stuttering at times. I had to play with v-sync off because otherwise this locked gameplay to 30fps which looked horrendous. Cut scenes are also played out in 30fps in the game graphics, which makes the transitions between gameplay and cut scenes feel a little off too. The game's controls during the combat scenes also came across as clunky too; I often found myself not actually completing the QTE presented because it's not clear which buttons you have to press and what you can let go of which meant a lot of running and hiding from the demons due to failed attempts at killing them.  Finally the last issue I had was there are quite a few invisible walls to be found to, these often are in places where you would not expect them, leading to moments where you'll find you are suddenly floating in mid-air because you've walked into a wall and are trying to climb up it - this is something which can affect the immersion of the game and it's a shame that it is still in it given it's been out for well over a year now. I am going to recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect; it has an amazing story which you really do need to experience in order to fully appreciate it, and has an original concept. The linear gameplay, lack of any many action scenes, and a couple of technical issues renders me unable to recommend it more than just that, a recommendation to play. The full price of £19, 99 is also slightly over marked too, so you may even want to wait for it to hit the sales before purchasing.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Murdered: Soul Suspect is supernatural detective adventure thriller game where you are playing as detective Ronan. He got murdered by a Bell Killer a primary antagonist and now he need to solve his case as a ghost.Pros:+ Great main character+ Voice acting is really good+ Enjoyable graphics+ Good story and atmoshpere+ Lots of collectibles + As a ghost you can walk through walls, read people's minds etc.Cons:- Short ( main story for around 6 hours )- Combat is poor ( you basically sneak behind the enemy and do fast QTE) - Only one type of enemy- Most of NPC's are just clones/duplicates- Only 4 optional quests ( to finish them you need like 5-10 mins each)			"

												Let me preface this by saying that regardless of my ""No"" recommendation, I do believe this game is worth playing once. The story is OK and the ending twist is OK. But it is simply not worth the asking price of anything over $10 bucks.You play the ghost of a murder victim in the town of modern Salem, MA. The goal is to solve your own murder...as a ghost! In the same town where the witch trials took place in real life! How could this possibly be bad?!? Well, you'd be surprised. On paper, this should make for an awesome adventure game. Too bad the execution is horrendous. It's certainly not an action game and it's one step above a Fisher Price point-and-click adventure game (and I love adventure games). The world is as linear as the story. The entire game boils down to ""walk around and spam E (maybe R, before E occasionally)"" until you hit the cutscene. It's impossible to fail any ""investigation"" (a very strong word to use in this game) until literally the last mission in the game. And even then, you just repeat it until you get it right. Investigations aren’t dynamic, they never change regardless of what you do. You can't ♥♥♥♥ up investigations in any way. But if you pick the wrong item, the developers decided it would be a good idea to make you re-enter the ""which item is it?"" screen over and over until you get it right. No, it couldn’t just stay open, that would make too much sense. The controls in general are bad. You can’t mouse click anything and the camera sensitivity is high no matter which setting you use.The NPCs standing around are useless. If you're like me, and you like to absorb story in your games, you'll learn pretty quickly to not even bother ""possessing"" them because nothing they say is ever relevant or interesting.There are demons in this game. Demons, in a game about souls....whodathunk. Too bad they're the most irritating part of the game. They are obviously in the game as filler and annoying filler at that because they tend to pop up when you have to backtrack (which you do a lot of, btw). It's like the devs knew this game was short so they needed to find a way to stretch it out. You “fight” the same type of demon throughout the entire game and how you deal with them never changes. They have pre-determined patrol paths and you simply wait until they have their backs turned and then you ""execute"" them during a quicktime event.None of the characters are very likeable. The main character is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and it’s very easy to forget the name of the others. In a game filled with ghost, you would think there would be some awesome death or haunting stories, but there really isn’t. Maybe one or two are interesting (mostly in a sick way), but the rest are “waaaaaahhhh, I’m dead! Whhhhhhhhyyy” that you quickly get tired of.And it’s all topped off by credits that are unskippable and seem to go on for 3 hours. Shame, this game had some really interesting ideas that I feel would have been better realized by a more capable studio. The sound effects are really good, and the environment with the old Salem blending with modern Salem is nice to look at. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game filled with souls, but ultimately, it’s really lacking one of its own. "

												From the first article I read about this game I was hooked. Investigating your own murder and other crime scenes as a ghost? Yes please! The idea seemed so original and any screen shots I had seen looked awesome.  So I get the game and the first half hour is awesome. You'll have fun getting used to the controls and your own abilities as a ghost, but it didn't take me long to lose interest in walking through walls and making printers/TV's malfunction because at the end of the day, you rarely stumble across anything interesting or you get little to no reaction from the living people in the area. I mean come on! if I'm a ghost I want to be able to scare the living. Not just distract them from guarding that door for 20 seconds. So let's get down to the things that really got on my nerves.(1) Gameplay - It gets repetitive. Honestly, you'll find yourself running across the city/buildings where  your obstacles will be either one of  two things.        - Oh there's a demon there? better sneak up on them and extract their soul.        Or       - Oh would you look at that, a fiery pit straight to hell is blocking my path. Luckily for me there's  this person here I can possess, who's sole propose seems to be walking down this hall for the rest of their lives.  Oh which leads me to another thing, if you give us the ability to read minds, actually have the characters think interesting stuff that's personal to them, instead of the same thing like, ""Oh its cold outside"" or ""I hope they find that killer"" Seriously, a little variety never killed anyone. (There's a pun in there somewhere.) (2) Skills/abilities - You will pick up skills as the story progresses, skills like teleportation....eh and umm teleportation. So on top of being able to posses people,(and don't be fooled, the most exciting thing you might get them to do is move their hand from blocking that page you want to read.) reveal the events that lead up to peoples deaths and maybe another ability that I have forgotten about, that leaves you with about 5 (give or take) skills. Not much and nothing that's gonna make you sit up and go F*** Yeah!! with excitement, which is disappointing.   (3) NPC's - If we were back in the early 2000's I might forgive this but there is a serious lack of character models for the npc's (there's about four different character's for each sex, who will either have  one of three different voices, all of whom usually say the same dialogue.) (4) Collectables - For example once you've collected the 15 or whatever amount of saws, a memory is unlocked. Now considering some of these can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to collect, you'd expect maybe a flash back to the event. You know a cutscene, an animation. No, what you get is one image that is some what relateable to the story, with a bunch of  text in front of it (and I mean a bunch) and possibly the most life draining narration I've ever had to injure. (5) Game length - The game is short! I finished it in under 10 hours and this is coming from someone who went out of her way to find as many collectables and whatever other extras there was. (Near the end I gave up, not caring any more and just wanted to finish the game so I stopped putting in any effort.) So for someone who'd only be interested in the story you might be able to get this game finished in 6-7 hours. (6) Connecting crime scene clues. - Honestly I don't know how to describe this. Once you collect all the clues you'll be brought to a window that asks you a question. You have to click on a clue (or three) that answers that question. Being the generation brought up on CSI you're more than likely going to put on your Horatioto glasses and think long and hard about the choices and outcomes. My advice don't. Pick the clue that when you read it you think ""Nah, that's not even a clue. more like a statement/common sense."" Watch a lets play of one of these, you'll see what I'm talking about. (7) Deus Ex desktop screens - Awesome the first computer screen I saw it on but when every police officer in the station seems to be playing Deus Ex on their work computer no wonder you haven't found the killer. Whoa, okay I've complained a lot about this game. I don't want to come off too hard on it. There are some pro's.Pro's Spooky S*** - There are some legitimate scary scenes and dark deaths and twists in this game. Some that will really make you feel for the characters. Villian - I never wanted to punch someone in the face more. Well done on making a completle d*** of a villian. You get to posses a cat. Press A to meow. Okay I ran out of pro's..... but it isn't that bad. To me I feel that the idea behind the story had so much potential but failed to deliver. The end result is that it seems lazy and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which you will feel while playing the game. It's worth a play through but do not buy this at full price. Last word: If Patrick Swayze was a cop in Ghost and Whoopi Goldberg an annoying emo teenager this would basically be the game adaptation.			"

“Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.” ― Benjamin FranklinMurdered: Soul Suspect is a one shot wonder coming from Airtight Games; the last game they developed before closing their doors in July 2014. It is a wondrous detective story with a supernatural background that takes place in the timeline of one evening in Salem, present time. Salem? Does that ring any ""bells""?Aside my unintentionally cheesy joke, this game is about Ronan O'Connor, an ex-con and street dog turned his way straight and decided to become a detective to atone for all his past misdeeds, with a pretty gal for him to impress in the mix, of course. The events of our game start with the untimely demise of our main character. We watch Ronan as his life passes before his eyes in a stream of memories - recorded on his body as tattoos representing milestones in his life. The Bell Killer, notorious serial killer who was terrorizing Salem for months now, killed Ronan. But surprisingly, this is the beginning for him rather than an end. Now, he is a ghost, stuck in between worlds until he manages to solve his own murder. Ronan's persistence to seek the truth will take him through an old, dark ordeal in Salem history: Salem Witch Trials.As I continue, I have to note that I loved the character of Ronan O'Connor himself. Aside being an ordinary bad boy, he has vulnerabilities, character flaws and a short temper. His death isn't even heroic as most main characters in video games as we see nowadays. He just ventures out, without having anything to loose and without a thought; and bang! He ends up getting hunted and falling to his death. We are able to read an in-depth backstory for Ronan, with Julie's perception from many collectible memory notes within the game, and put together, it portrays the story of a life. I salute developers for presenting Ronan as an original character, different from any darkened vigilante or street thug. As I was playing, I found myself recalling Mickey O'Neil, a gypsy character that Brad Pitt portrayed in Guy Ritchie's Snatch: a reckless and wild rascal, a swindler with a golden heart. He feels much real than any old book knight in shining armor, at least for me.If we are to talk about the atmosphere, well, sure. It is a success. Graphics and textures are impressive, alongside the modelling of each and every character. The game manages to present you the feel of an open world: the ghostly, dark remains of the old Salem clashing with the modern, physical environment, Airtight presents us a ghost's perception. It is uncanny and impressive. Combined with a successful voice acting for all characters present: this game is basically L.A. Noire quality with less action packed and more on the supernatural side.Gameplay? Sure, it's nothing extraordinary. We run about the town - collecting a huge number of collectibles for either background story, or some independent creepy ghost stories, or trivial facts about Salem history if we feel like so, by the way - and try to predict the movements of the killer. We even gain a living side-kick as we progress: Joy, a snarky teenage who will become our involuntary aid in the world of the living. There are three defining elements to the game: item collecting, demon hunting and investigation. None of these parts are incredibly well-put, but the story being absorbing, you keep playing. Investigations are quite basic, with little to no chance of guessing wrong and combat section consists of a basic stealth kill for some demons in each new area. Could have been much more, but I won't complain.Is it worth your time? It surely is, but still I'd recommend grabbing it on sale, so 30 dollars would be a grand exaggeration for what you're getting yourself. The greatest plus of the game for me, was its story. For one time, I really wasn't able to guess the ending, and the precise position of characters involved. I so hope that Ronan's story wouldn't end here. Would it be so much to hope for? Well, we'll see.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Ah, Soul Suspect. The trailer alone had me clapping my hands from excitement. However, there's a lot to say about the game itself. The concept seems unique at first; a murdered cop who is forced to solve his own murder before he can pass on to the other side, where he can be reunited with his dead wife. It's not an angle you see often. That being said, the game feels empty when it comes to gameplay and the semi-original plot can't make up for it. It feels like all your abilities seem to have huge potential and you have fun playing with them for an hour or so, excited about what more you can do along the way. Then you realise that you're limited to distracting people with flashing lights and walking through a wall (but not all walls, only some walls, obviously) every now and again. You also have the ability to possess people, which seems wicked awesome at first. You can possess pretty much anyone you meet and you have the options of mind reading or influencing them. However, the reality of possession is that you possess a person, read their mind and they're like ""Oh man, it's sort of chilly today"" or ""I hate my job"" and you lose interest pretty fast when that's all you hear. In the end, I'm unsure about whether or not to recommend this game. It's visually pleasing, the voice acting is decent and the idea behind it is worth the time. But the final product is just not satisfying in the long run. Murdered: Soul Suspect is another one of those games that you should get if it's 60-75% off, but it's not worth the full price. Overall, it's like a lukewarm bowl of pudding. It's not entirely done and feels a little lacking, but hey, it's still pudding in the end.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is detective-ghost story told through the interactive-medium of gaming. Murdered is kind of like a combination between a TellTale game, LA Noire, and Alan Wake... But honestly the game is more often than not more like an interactive movie, and I think it's with these expectations that you best experience Murdered.Murdered: Soul Suspect tells the tale of a man named Ronan, who at the game's start experiences his own death. He is pushed out of the window by a notorious murderer, who is known as the Bell Killer, who then commences to shoot him seven times in the chest. Ronan grew-up as a criminal in Salem, but changed his ways late in life to become a detective, partially for the woman he loved, Julia. However, he was torn apart a few months earlier, when Julia's life was taken at the hands of a street mugger. At death's door, Ronan discovers he is a spirit to this world, trapped here until he can move on from something that's keeping him bounded here. He finds out that he can be with Julia again in the world beyond our own if he can resolve whatever is keeping him here, so he goes out to try and solve the case of his own murder.Gameplay is rather simplistic in Murdered. You will spend most of your time exploring around, using your ghost powers, and looking for items and clues in the environment. As a ghost, you can freely pass through human-world objects, which essentially makes clipping a gameplay mechanic, but you might be surprised how natural it ends up feeling and due to some good visual cues and sounds it ends up not looking or feeling weird, and makes sense with everything else built up with the game. The only objects you can't pass through are ghost-world objects (relics from the past which are present in the ghost world, and tell-able they're ghost world as they glow with a blue aura), and into or out of buildings freely (ghosts can only enter or exit buildings through open doors or windows). Other powers at your disposal include the ability to possess people, to either read their minds or influence their thoughts, to poltergeist and make objects (mostly machinery) act up, to teleport around by choice, and a few other underutilized but still interesting powers.The game splits-up between 'stages' (bigger interior areas usually), and a Salem hub-world. The stages I thought generally got better as the game went on, and Salem was a joy to explore... At first. The problem is that not much really happens in Salem, it stays the same mostly for the whole game so you can literally almost do everything in it the first time you enter the hub-area (with only a few things you can only do once you gain the teleportation power).As you explore, there's a variety of content to immerse yourself in the world. There's a lot of side areas and areas off the beaten path. You can approach living people to listen in to conversations they're having with each other, made more amusing you can then possess them and see what they're REALLY thinking. You can approach ghosts, and either talk to them briefly, question them about something they're up too, and very occasionally help them via a side-quest to move onto from this world to the next. However, there are literally only about 3-4 side-quest in the game, and there is obvious content and characters that were left around for more side-quests, but were left-out as cut content. Things like items you can observe for no real reason, characters it looks like you would be able to help but then they cut you short from actually helping them.And then there's the collectibles. This game kind of goes overboard with it's collectibles, but they're pretty enjoyable and expand a lot on the plot, the lore, Salem's history, character background's, additional cinematics, and my personal favorite, ghost stories. Extended from this, the investigation scenes usually have you looking for and going about collecting clues, and then putting together the clues that matter to a particular solution or outcome. These typically were rather simple, and sometimes felt more like sort of mindless collecting to get to the point. However, other times they actually felt kind of rewarding. None were really 'puzzles' I would say, but were a mixed bag.The only other real gameplay mechanic is demons, which are rather underutilized. I didn't find them offensive, and I'll admit there was a few times when their screeches or them detecting me legitimately startled and scared me. However, there's only one type of demon in the game, you only face a few of them in the game, and their encounters are often brief and they're easy enough to deal with (you sneak up behind them to execute them, otherwise they spot you and chase you down, where you hide in things until they lose interest).But then this is a game I'd argue isn't really about winning or losing, it's an interactive film essentially, and on that account it pulls some things off really well.Firstly, the audio design is fantastic in this game. The voice acting for the main characters are all well-done and performed, and even most minor characters are rather well-voiced (though you'll find a few reoccurring VAs). The ghost stories you can get via collectibles deserve particular praise, as the acting done here really adds a lot to the story, and honestly are really well-done.But it's not just the voice acting. The music is very good too, with some good creepy vibes, emotional melodies, and songs to go well to the mystery. The ambiance of sounds in the environment also add a lot, with a lot of attention to detail to help bring the locations alive. And even the game sounds, for solving cases, getting clues, etc., are all satisfying and fitting.The story is quite good, especially if you like detective-ghost stories, ala' The Frighteners, Sixth Sense, or the like. While the writing can be a bit hammy at times, they do have some believable dialogue between characters, the story has interesting developments as it goes on, and there are some rather well-done plot twists throughout.Cinematics deserve special mention. The cinematography is really well-done, with fantastic angles, focus, artistic direction, and were a joy to watch. And the characters are well-realized, trope-ish, but manage to be developed and become more than their tropes and have rather realistic relationships with each other. They have fights and don't agree, but come together (sometimes reluctantly), and there are a few heart-warming moments and real development with each other as it goes on.Graphically it looks good for the sort of niche budget title it is. Some nice attention to detail in environments, some good art direction, and some of the models are rather well poly'd. There's some visual quality dips in certain areas, textures... But not a bad looking game at all.Generally, I would label this as a game for gamers who like story, exploring, and world-building above all else. Gameplay really takes a step-down to the game's other elements, and it will definitely strike with its niche. But its lack of action, focus on making what is usually the 'extra' parts of games the main part, and just the general styling and minimal gameplay make it lack that mainstream appeal. I'd also say it isn't worth its $50 pricetag, but felt it was worth it for the $15-25 range.I'd say if the game interests you, it is worth experiencing... Just maybe not at full price. It is different than your typical budgeted game in this day and age, and is sure to find a cult audience. In some aspects, it's a bit disappointing or under-cooked, but as a whole, this may be one of the best realized classic-styled ghost stories to appear in the gaming medium for years. Like the Fedora or not, Ronan is the perfect tour guide into a very different look at ghosts, Salem, and games with a budget.			"

Short version: 86%Murdered mixes interactive storytelling with exploration mechanics to create a somewhat predictable modern ghost tale. The writing quality, especially the world-building, easily carries the game, despite its sometimes downright terrible (keyboard) controls.Long version:Murdered: Soul Suspect combines one of the most common basic premises of modern ghost tales—solve the case of your own murder—with a buddy cop system, where our titular freshly-murdered detective teams up with a young psychic girl to get to the bottom of a series of strange killings. And to maximise the possible clichés, this ghost story is set in Salem.In many ways, Murdered can be classified as an exploration game, as we spend most of it looking for things. It is divided to several levels (all tied to major Salem landmarks), where we search for clues or specific (otherworldly) objects. The clues are used in simple matchmaking minigames to draw conclusions and push the plot forward, whereas the collectibles eventually turn into a series of long backstories.Interestingly enough, these backstories supply the bulk of the content, as this is where we can learn the most about our protagonist, the game world, and the many tragic stories it hides. Since the central plot is painfully predictable, sometimes these stories are the biggest reason to continue playing.Although Murdered could have worked perfectly as an adventure-like game, apparently the developers were worried that the console generation’s attention span would run out without enemies to kill, so we have shoehorned action sequences against a bunch of wraith-like apparitions. To kill them, we need to play short stealth sections with mandatory quick-time events. These QTEs are downright impossible to do on mouse and keyboard, so, in the end, even with these tacked-on parts, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, but only to gamepad owners.			"

												7.5/10 Very Good game , but id recommend buying it on sale.A mix of Alan Wake meets LA Noire and has a baby delivered by Bigby Wolf with the whole thing being recorded by Nicholas Cage on a 8mm film, and Jennifer Love Hewitt standing by to help all the ghosts watching cross over.PROS:- Good mystery story and atmosphere- Lots of collecting- Very interesting system and dynamic of game while playing as ghost- Dark undertone of story- Enjoyable graphics and pretty smooth gameplay imo ( had only 1 minor bug fixed by reloading )CONS:- very little and very simplistic combat (might as well remove it completely and add a few more sidequests or even some puzzles)- if you strictly rush main story without exploring or doing sidequests might be a bit short. I did 2 playthroughs first one i collected all except 5 items and it took me 12 hours, second one i rushed to get those few items and it took me 5h to get almost to last part of game ( Judgement house). So rushed probably 6h playthrough.- wish world was more open to explore and more interractive and immersive (ghosts you meet are pretty forgetable after you do quest)- this would work great as a mystery adventure with some rpg progression- not really scary , very little horror.  More of a murder mystery thriller if you ask me.CONCLUSION:Worth playing. Hope there is a sequel and i will buy it when it comes out.			"

												Ever thought about being a ghost?  Pass through walls, posses people, teleporting,  making the T.V. go wild, things like this make it fun to be one. Of course, being a ghost has to be somewhat dark and taken seriously. After all, being a ghost means you’re dead. Murdered Soul Suspect is a game where Ronan, a detective that follows a lead, dies but stays in this world as a ghost and the only thing that keeps him from finding peace is solving the case. The story is very noir like, despite the presence of modern objects, since the dark atmosphere and the mystery  are the things that are unavoidable in this game.  The plot is as it should be,  clear, logic and ended with enough closure to make you realize what a good story it is. In a world where ghosts have many questions, where are mediums that can see that and a killer that hunts those people down, you are the one that provides the answers.  There are ghosts that you can help find peace. There are collectibles that give you a lot of backstory on various topics and characters. There is one murderer that can’t be stopped still loose in this town. All of this is obvious throughout the game and that’s what will keep you hooked. 


Ghosts can live in this world

Gameplay wise, the game is easy. To put it simply, you’ll  take walks,  find clues, conclude investigations with the correct solution, execute demons by taking them from behind and collecting stuff if you feel like it. To put it as it is, things are more complex than that, but not much more.  In order to gain clues, you’ll need to look for them at the crime scene , you’ll need to interact with someone or something to find more, which sometimes mean possessing a person, influencing them to think about the topic you need or looking through their eyes.  The things that present a challenge in this game are the demons, that are very much alike with the dementors. They’ll consume your soul if you are exposed to them for long enough.  You can pass by them, or you can execute them by going behind them and using one of your ghostly abilities. Ronan can hide from them by possessing people or hiding in different entities. At the player disposal is also the ability to see the demon from afar, even through walls.Facing the demons are the stealthy section of the game, but they’re not frustrating enough to make the game challenging at all. For completitionists, there are a lot of collectibles to be found, which contain backstories of characters and places, or a separate story.  They aren’t hard to be found and there are more than one good guides, so you could say it’s easy to get all the achievements. The town of Salem is beautiful, varied but after you explore it all, it feels like a small place.  There is free roam until the last mission, but that is useful for those who want to get back to specific locations to get the rest of the collectibles.  Also, if you see an NPC that looks interesting to you, you can posses him and hear what he thinks. 


Too bad for them I'm the better spirit

Is the game a great one? No, it’s simply good. It lasts for about 10 hours, it has great concepts and executes them simply, which may be a fault for it, since many said about the game that it had great potential. Still, there’s no other game that can make you have fun for being a ghost like this one.  Passing through walls, possessing people, talking with other ghosts, potterghasting different object to perturb the living ones, it’s all very enjoyable. The theme is dark, some details are gritty, it’s a game where you solve a mystery which has a solution that isn’t obvious at all(the plot-twists turned out to be mind-blowing).


No matter where they're from, two can work together

All in all, Murdered Soul Suspect is a good game that delivers on what it describes itself to be and doesn’t take risks in being something more. "

												I was fairly dissapointed with how this game turned out. The concept was interesting, and I love the genre; however, the excution of the game play mechanics was lacking in any real dept. All of the crime scenes were a fixed camera angle away from being a point and click adventure, and putting the clues together could be done by random guessing without penalty. The characters felt forced, and fell deeply into non-relatable stereotypes that were hard to really care about. I really wanted to like the story, but I kept finding myself just grinding through everything to see it end. I couldn't see me much functionally wrong with the game, and didn't encounter many bugs; however it just got down right boring. The stealth/combat whatever they were going for with the demons, ended up becoming an annoyance, and half the time I could just run by them without worry. The voice acting, music, and ambient atmosphere were excuted well, and they created the emotions the story was trying to encourage. Unfortunatly the writting its self was too forced, and anti-climatic at best. I completed the game in about 7 hours without collecting everything, but I did all the side cases I could find. It wasn't a completely regrettable expierence, but for the price you're better off waiting for a good sale as this is a play once and uninstall title. I hope this helps someone from being stuck with a $50 dissapointment like I am.			"

												I am here against all odds to recommend this game to everyone. You will like this game if you are like me and loved reading those detective novels. The Good Very Cinematic Approach, with a 1st person narration and 3rd person navigation.Quite an intriguing story.Even though the theme is supernatural it doesnt talk about religiousness or any other stupid stuff instead focuses on the characters that are in the game instead.The background score is great along with good voice actors.Very simple controls nothing too fancy considering the fact that this is a ported game from a console version.The BadThe Story is so condensed that the entire game takes place within a single night. In a sense it is a fast paced game but it doesnt feel like a fast paced game at all. The only other comparable game would be Fahrenheit aka The Indigo Prophecy.You are a ghost, there are a ton of fun stuff you could probably do as a ghost but this game doesnt allow you to fulfill your Hollowman dreams.The Story is very linear, there are no alternate endings, hence its very predictable considering it is a AAA priced game there should have been alternate endings.Limited exploration of the surroundings, you dont get to go everywhere you want. The only reason you get to explore is because you have to collect certain artifacts and items -again- the reward for which is negligible and has no direct relation to the game's storyline.In a way the game does try to teach 'children' about a moral about fulfilling your debts and being honest & things like that, but the developers forgotm kids dont get to spend 50 bucks. Teenagers and Grown up gamers do. You do get to snoop around a little to help a few other souls to 'move on' but it is nearly not enough.I am a DOG person why are there so many cats here and no DOGS in Salem ??The UglyThere is no denying the fact that the game has a very sloppy game engine. The quadruped animation quality of the cats are less than okay.I was stuck in a limbo / mid air within the first 5 minutes of the game.The lack of action. Despite what the trailer had me believing there is absolutely NO action game play here. The Cut Scene sequences are fun to watch but thats it.There was a million different ways how this game could have been made way better than what it is, the story, the interactivity, the side missions everything felt too little and too less.My rating 3.8/5 "

												Mudered: Soul Suspect left me wanting in almost every aspect of the game. I expected an engaging story focused 3rd person game with puzzles and minimal to no combat and in a way thats what you get here, just not well executed.Graphical Fidelty is mediocre as you would expect from a Console Port and i wouldnt mind if the mechanics and story were up to compensate for that. The Main mechanic of conducting an investigation is for them to designate an area where you look for a set number of clues to tell you what happened. This almost plays like a hidden object game and its really not interesting. At the end you are supposed to select some of the clues to conclude your investigatoin into a story and a little cutscene tells you what you gathered from that. Sometimes you can possess a witness where you can peek through his eyes to find a clue on a screen or notepad, influence his memory by selecting a clue you found so that he reveals more information about that or you can eavesdrop on a conversation. The Problem with all this is that you do it maybe 5 times in the game with some effect while the rest of the time, it doesnt do anything at all. Mindreading in Salem is really boring and i hope the real inhabitants have more going though their head than these NPCs.The Game has two types of collectibles which reveal some lore about your former life or a criminal story. The lore bits about your former life or you girlfriend reveal information one at a time which you can access by going into a horrible menu where you have to click on each piece individually to see what it says. And the Navigatoin of the Menu is horrible, the most basic pc-conversion where using your mouse is a pain, they put no effort into adjusting a system for pc which is badly designed from the start. Why dont you let me just click on this! You just dont want to navigate through this to get 2 sentences about the meaning of your tattoos, or how you met your deceased wife.The second tye which reveals a little story is even worse, because these are collectibles in a major areas which only reveal their story after you collected all of them. This means you can run around the levels for ages looking for that last piece which extends the game time in a very boring and artificial way. Only some true OCD guys will suffer through that. And they even have more ideas how to prolong their game time. Sometimes there are areas with demons which can end your undead life unless you sneak up behind them and press a button+mouse combination to ban them. So you jump from hiding point to hiding point to get behind them and banish all of them. This is neither challenging nor interesting, its only annoying because you want to get through this part which adds nothing to the game.All in all i am very disappointed and if i had payed full price for this i would be furious. The game doesnt know how to tell its story through its mechanics. the mechanics are uninspired and boring and there is a lot of filler to prolong a game wich doesnt have much to offer. I took 7h for the main story line and there was an infuriating bit at the end, where i had a lot of respawns right on top of these black spot which draw you into the abyss. So i got to spawn found myself  dying and reloading several times in a row before i could continue to the end.I am Sorry but A resounding: Dont Buy! from me "

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third-person supernatural mystery-thriller where you play as Ronan O’Connor, a thief turned detective, who gets shot to death while trying to prevent a murder by the notorious Bell Killer, an enigmatic hooded man who kills his victims in different ways around the town of Salem, Massachusetts. Waking up, Ronan discovers he is a ghost stuck in some sort of a limbo, referred to as Dusk, but eventually figures out that the only way to free himself and meet his deceased wife is to stop the Bell Killer before committing further murders.The story in Murdered: Soul Suspect is all about Ronan’s journey of redemption. Each new finding leads Ronan to a new destination and at one point he even ends up partnering, out of necessity, with a medium by the name of Joy Foster, a punk-looking teenager, who can see and talk with ghosts. Joy is looking for her mother who is assumed to be followed by the Bell Killer. The chemistry between Ronan and Joy is legitimately good. As a murder mystery story with supernatural elements, it is fairly decent but I hardly think it rises above the average. It does not deviate too much from tropes, so it may feel very familiar to fans of this genre. While it may start off like an original story, by the end it is hard not feel like you might have experienced a similar story in games such as Blackwell (Rose and Joey), Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father (witchcraft) and Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller (Cain Killer). That bugged me a bit. There are enough genuine twists to keep you invested in its very short story (6-7 hours) though, even when the game tries too hard to fool you, but the ending is underwhelming.Now Murdered: Soul Suspect has a very strong presentation. Visually, it genuinely reminds me of Batman: Arkham Asylum/City. The story unfolds during the same night, so it is always night time in the game. Character models are generally well made, including their facial animations, although there is a noticeable difference in quality between the protagonists and civilians; the former being more detailed. In general, the performance is solid as well.The world, or the town of Salem, is a sinister semi-open-world similar to Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines where the streets are narrow and split between a few regions. NPCs are present on the streets of Salem, although most of them have fixed positions while others seem to follow the same walking path. Shockingly, at the first crime scene, two civilians have the same character model which, at the time, made me laugh. The more I played, the more I discovered the lack of variety in the NPCs roaming the streets which is rather disappointing considering a good effort was put into the presentation.The voice acting is also one of the strong points of the game and the voice actor of Ronan brilliantly gives the protagonist a Clint Eastwood vibe. Bluntly, Ronan O’Connor is one badass character without losing his credibility in the process. Furthermore, the soundtrack of Murdered: Soul Suspect suits most scenes and creates a fitting atmosphere that is quite chilling at times. There are even a handful of occasions which throws in a few questionable horror-oriented scores, as for the most part, the game is not much of a horror game. However, the soundtrack does tend to become very same-y over time.Where Murdered: Soul Suspect falters is in its game design and gameplay. Even within the first few minutes after you wake up as a ghost, I decided to venture outside the perimeter of the crime scene, just for the screen to fade to black and teleport me back to the crime scene. For me, this triggered a red-flag. Thankfully, this only happens at the first crime scene, as the game world opens up later on. Well, sort of. As a ghost, Ronan can walk through walls and objects, but not all of them. This is explained in the story, something about purgatory houses and whatnot. There are also many pre-rendered cutscenes (locked at 30fps) in this game which gives it more of an interactive movie feel than a traditional adventure game.Now, one of the things which makes the game appealing at first is how investigations work. At a crime scene, you look for clues to solve the puzzle. The more clues you find, there is a better chance of finding the right solution. More interestingly is Ronan’s ability in ghost form to possess people (or cats) and read their minds, or jolt their memories of a particular event, peek at what they are looking and influence them as part of your investigation. On paper, this sounds superb, but sadly the game misses so much potential by its lackluster execution. The problem here is that the aforementioned supernatural abilities are very restricted. You cannot always use the ability to peek whenever you desire. You cannot influence people whenever you want. No, you can only perform these actions when the game tells you. This is utterly stupid because it makes the game even more restrictive and linear than it already is. On the other hand, you can read any NPC’s mind at any time, but they barely give any useful information except when you are at an important plot point.Additionally, the investigation puzzles rarely give you an “A-ha!” moment because there is no challenge. When piecing the clues or connecting the dots, so to speak, you are not punished (fairly) for any mistakes you make in your deduction despite a rating system showing how well you performed. Later on in the story, Ronan gains two new abilities: Reveal and Teleportation. Both are self-explanatory, but they are criminally underused in the gameplay for trivial activities, with the latter being used mainly to get to a secret room with a collectible. Yes, throughout the game, there are 150 collectibles for the player to collect, at their leisure, which provide the backstory of the pivotal characters, the history of Salem and some ghost stories. Side missions are also present, albeit not too many. These involve helping out other ghosts stuck in Dusk and take about 5-10 minutes to complete. They are really easy to solve and optional. Sadly, most of them are not really that interesting as subplots and are not even connected to the main plot.The game has some stealth sections where Ronan has to either avoid or take down Demons once in a while at certain plot events. Contextually, these Demons are corrupted souls which stayed too long in Dusk and their only purpose is to consume the souls of other ghosts to regain humanity. Again, the problem here is down to the execution. There is no depth to the stealth, and frankly, I would barely call it stealth. Ronan can hide from them through soul fragments scattered around the area or by possessing a human, but all this is useless as the Demons can be taken down easily by sneaking behind them and performing a basic QTE. Not only that, but the Demons have an absurdly short line of sight. Even when you get detected, escaping is easy too. Worse, the Demons have a fixed path. There is also a stealth section involving smuggling Joy through a police department and an asylum, but again, the lack of depth in distracting the guards is laughable. In the end, the “stealth” works, but it is lazily implemented and these  sections become more of a nuisance. Thankfully they do not take too long.In conclusion, Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very difficult one to recommend mostly because it is neither utterly bad nor substantially good. It sits perfectly in the middle. It has the looks of an AAA game but the heart of a mediocre indie game. I strongly feel the game could have been better if it were a standard adventure point ‘n’ click game with a longer story, tighter mechanics, challenging puzzles and less emphasis on a cinematic experience. The story on its own, which is only decent at best, cannot carry the game with its current faults this time around. You will not be missing out much by skipping it, hence why I am not recommending it.			"

												So far I love it! :D  It kept me going, and if I didn't have to work, I'd stay up all day and play this <3So far I haven't come across any bugs, but when/if I find any, I will edit them into this review~So pretty much, if you love mystery, with a dab of action, then you'll like this a lot.  And as I get further, and experiance this more, I will keep updating my review. But for now, I would recommand this game as is until later noted. :3I will say that the only thing I don't like is that there is no save option.  It's all auto-save, and it's only 1 save for this game completely so far as I've seen.  So if you have family/friends who want to play on your PC, you'll have to tell them to wait for you to finish it, as that's the only way to not lose your progess.Hope this helps :3			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third-person adventure game, in which you play the role of a ghost, who needs to find out about his mysterious murder.You're playing Ronan O'Connor, a detective, who gets murdered right at the beginning of the game. The Murderer itself gets away unidentified and you're staying in this world as a ghost, to find out what happend, why and who did it.The game itself is very story-driven. You're walking (or running) around the different hubs, interacting with items or persons, trying to find clues (and combining them) about your murder or the victims of the serial killer, which you were after at the beginning.There are also various collectibles to be found, which will keep you occupied (if you like things like this).Graphics are pretty neat and i liked the atmosphere of the game, though, even as you visit different scenes and buildings, the overall look doesn't change drastically. A bit more variety could have been better.The story kept me entertained quite well and had also some nice twists throughout the game.There is one part, which could be frustrating: from time to time demons appear on your path, which you'll either need to evade or destroy. THis only happens at certain points in the game (not often) and if you kill them, they'll be gone forever and won'T reappear.It's not *that* hard, but if you don't like things like this in an adventure game, then you might have a little hassle here.Apart from that, i can recommend this to all players, which like fairly easy, story-driven adventure games.

												If you like games such as L.A Noire and Sherlock Holmes this should be right up your alley. It is different from those games though, because this is you solving your own crime. That means your a ghost, wandering around the town looking for clues. I would say this is a very unique game, and that's rare these days.Gameplay wise it's simple, look around for clues, draw a conclusion and go to the next place. it's very interesting because you are a ghost and you can simply walk through walls. However you cant go through solid buildings, unless someone opens the door for you. You can also use abillities like poltergeist, mind control and even take over a cat. This game is extremely story heavy, and the story is really intresting. It kept me coming back until I was done. Even the simple sidequests really intrigued me and made me want to collect every little collectible I could find.About 1,5 hour of the game is cutscenes and the others are gameplay. It's not that long of a game, but I would actually say this was the perfect lenght. It didn't overstay its welcome and drag out for to long. The story was exciting all the way through, and you could never figure out who it was until the end. A lot of plot twists in this game, which reminded me of Heavy Rain. The story is great thanks to impressive cutscenes and good voice acting. Any downsides with this game? Only that the demons and the elements were quite repetitive, but that isn't that big of a complaint since the game didn't go on for that long, and I can clearly see that they put the work on cutscenes and story instead. I really enjoyed my time in this dark and gritty town. This is a game that everyone should play at some point in my honest opinion, it's that damn good. I really hope they will make a sequel or something along those lines.			"

At the moment of this review I have played for 13 hours. Didn't like it some time ago but now... oh yeah.Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? YES, absolutely. I bought it on steam sale, but believe me, this game is worth at full price. A few words about this game? You have to be in mood to let the story trap you. Are you familiar with Occam's razor? If you are not it's ok, because in this game, that theory doesn't work.

Graphics: If you have a mid/high graphic card you can force to downsampling to play 4k at 30fps. If not, you will play very smooth with everything high. Also, i recommend to use a sweetfx filter because like vanilla, the game is like be inside a soup. The air is grey and you are trap into it. I suppose that the purpose of it it's to remember you that you are dead but hey!! I can go through walls and I have 7 bullet holes on my chest, I know I'm dead! Some of the npcs are clones, you will find the same face sometimes and even when you posses them, some of them will think the same but Salem city is big and alive enough to seem a real city that is under the siege of a murder.The most interesting I found is that the game mixes the past and the present into the same place. You are a ghost and you can see the ""memory"" of the city, pieces of walls, canons, gallows, sunken boats... places where something (not necessarily bad) happened and are still here somehow, into the spiritual plane.Music: Tension, suspense, horror... I really don't remember the music itself but I can remember the feeling that it provoked ot me, so yeah.... good enough.

Story: Murdered: Soul Suspect will transform you into a detective trying to resolve a case about murders which are happening into salem city. This is important because if you are not in mood to do that role, you won't like this game and it's a shame because it really worth. You will be Ronan, a police inspector with a dark past, who has been murdered during the investigation of the murders (this is not a spoiler) and here is the reason why Occam's razor can't be useful here, because you are a ghost investing the murders... what ghost can see...The story ""is"" the game. You have to follow the clues, going deeper into the case because like a ghost you have acces to where humans don't have and that's the best bet of this game and at the end is why it traps you until you finish the game.There are some secondary stories that are really good enough to try to resolve them.Gameplay: You can walk, run, posses npcs, and use some ghost powers to boldly go where no man has... well, to try to arrive to new locations and escape from demons. The way you can resolve the different cases you will find is easy and you can think that even boring but the real purpose of it, it's to make you think about the murders and step by step, think like Ronan. You will find yourself thinking on the case, the clues, the main suspect... and just by this the game would be good enough Negative point: You can't save or customize the controls. Demons are supposed to frighten you, but when you realize that they move inside a path, always the same patron, you just sit, wait and ambush them. Some repetitive npcs models, even their thoughts are the same Versión en Español Tenía mis dudas pero el doblaje es francamente bueno.			"

												Bought this game on sale not too long ago, and I'm glad I bought it when it was cheap, as I feel the $6 tag was about right. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a crime drama about a murdered cop on the hunt for his killer. The story ended up being pretty good, a lot of twists and turns throughout, very well done and well written dialogue. If you're looking for a decent story that doesn't drag on, an interactive movie, this is a good purchase. However, if you're looking for more game elements? You won't really find it here. Gameplay is abysmally easy, the hardest parts coming in quicktime events, which are no more than two button combos. The puzzles are no more difficult than ""Which one of these reminds you of a cheese sandwich?"" *picks the picture of a cheese sandwich*. The setting is great, if albeit a little heavy handed (Wait... Salem... has witches?!), and the graphics are nice. The rest of it... just isn't really there. I completed the game (not 100%... like 75%, maybe) in about 10 hours, and do not feel the need to replay it or go back and hunt for the avalanche of clickies throughout. Unless this drops to about the same amount I paid, I would give it a pass, but $6 feels about right.			"

												Good:- Ghost Trick + LA Noire- Audio- MC is a ghost detective, and seems levelheaded and cool- setting is coolBad:- ""Combat"" is a qte that keeps changing- Textures on max are AWFUL and inconsistent- compressed cutscene video after compressed cutscene video. WHY??- Level design is lame- Have no idea what the MC's name is- ""puzzle"" answers are so obvious that I tend to go ""no it can't be that"" and frequently get them wrong, until I get the right one and realize I was thinking too hard- Investigation is kind of overly tedious, Phoenix Wright did this better years ago. This is like Miles Edgeworth investigating. - Can't seem to get steam screenshots to work properly and I'm not sure why.Got it for around $22, I feel like I paid a little bit too much. Absolutely not worth $50+			"

 One of the most surprisingly good games I’ve played in a long time. It manages to sell its bizarre premise and builds a solid, moving story out of it, and the plot-propelling investigations add immensely to the detective feel. Walking around as a ghost is clever and entertaining, and it even manages to inject variety into some of gaming’s most overused elements.  9/10  "

												Murdered: Soul Suspect - an AAA 21th century quest title. Or adventure, if you like that definition more. Main mission of the whole game is to fugure out how to move to the next level, optionally helping some other people on the way.1. Gameplay. That's the game where you will not be shooting, or fighting. Except of dodging and expelling some hollow wraiths from time to time, by stalking them from behind and clicking a button to win. On the top of things, you'll be searching for pieces of evidence, and making some investigation going through and through some unpleasant secrets, revolving mostly around old dark history of the town you're settled in.Other than that, you can roam the levels in search of collectables, using your ghost powers to unlock all the achievements and background spooky stories which that game holding under the counter.2. Troubles. Game is buggy. Not messy or totally out of control, but I had to reload the starting sequence two times, unable to ""follow the light"", and later there was a museum bug (right after the running train part). Those two mentioned  bugs aren't really game breaking, but quite severe, the way I see things. Especially the first one: sure, it's just the start of the game, but, intro video is unskippable, duh!Other than those bugs (and some smaller), and the point that not everyone might like a point-n-click adventure with oversized ""search for scrappy notes"" part and ""open-world roaming"" like in the Batman games, where not all places are opened from the start... I am out with any other reasons why you may not like the game.3. Summary. Sure, the visuals aren't really top-notch, and the story is maybe too short for such a project... the actions gets repetative after a little while, and all that ""hiding from wraiths"" part is not too pleasant... but hey! - every, EVERY game has some weak spots, and someone will not be pleased with it.But, from my point of view, it's really a great game. A piece where you don't need to stab, kick or blast your way through is always a rarety. Ability to help some bystanders while doing you main quest, by putting some of you abilities in a good use, is surely a nice addition to the game's pro sides. Finally, a well-written detective story is always a welcome on my bookshelf. So, I'll mark Murdered: Soul Suspect with 8/10. Not perfect, but really good game which I'm glad I've played.			"

												Well, just finished the game and i have to say that I liked it a lot! The story was pretty satisfying and nice, the main protagonist was one to remember and this made you into the game, which is pretty nice.Pros: Nice storyI liked the Ronan as detectiveNice plot twist in the end, but if you have played taht many games you can find out shortaThe feeling of completing a sequence Posses and use a cat, i wish I could do more as a can into the game.Cons:The image was freezing from time to time, the game play wasn't so smooth the most of the timeDemons, i mean ofcourse there had to be some difficulty into the game, but for people like me who sucks at synchronization to use the right keys it was a hell for sureThe areas, I would like to find more pieces for the short stories into the game, but withdemos around I wouldnt like to go back and check. Youtube is my friend now :PIn general lines it was a pretty solid and nice game, not too short, not too long but it created some feeling into me, which is always a good thing for a game. I recommend you to get you on sales , or in a banndle. I got mine from humble bandle and i think it was the best money i would have spent into the game. Anyway, go guys play it, it is a good game, some times annoying, but you will feel nice when it endes and will feel that you lost the case in person "

												This a fairly classic noir story -- with a supernatural twist. I've seen the reviews that put the game at around a 5-6 (mediocre) and on one hand I can see that. The graphics aren't anything amazing and for fifty bucks I'd like to have spent longer than 8 hours to finish the main story. On the other hand, what a fun (if somewhat predictable) story. I especially enjoyed the investigation elements; they're reminiscent of games like L.A. Noire or Condemned: Criminal Origins. Even more, the game is focused exclusively on the storytelling and there's really no combat or action -- it's all about the mystery and puzzles. What little combat there is in the game is mostly based on sneaking around and running away from enemies (you can only attack them from behind).Where the game really shines is in characterization and story development. The two main characters, Ronan and Joy, have a great odd couple vibe that had me laughing in spots. Most of the character development for everyone else (and even backstory for Joy and Ronan) happen through collectibles but provide really deep storytelling that is (occasionally) historically accurate and interesting. I'd recommend this to mystery or noir fans but suggest you wait for the price to come down since the game is so short. I finished all the main story, the ""interactive"" sidequests AND managed to collect about 75 percent of all the collectibles in my 8 hour play through.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Murdered: Soul Suspect Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Adventure; Mystery; Third-Person; Detective My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers REVIEWMurdered: Soul Suspect is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on collectibles and “detective” work, and very little action/combat. You play in 3rd-person adventure style, progressing the story and moving throughout the game world from one spot to the next.  You collect clues and make deductions in the case you are working on in the primary story arc.  The game is pretty linear, which is to be expected for something so focused on story telling; but there is some freedom of exploration.  Much of the backstory and lore can be learned about through the extensive amount of collectibles scattered throughout the levels.The graphics are pretty nice at max settings and the atmosphere of the game is fitting and done well.  The voice acting is among the best you will find in the realm of video games, which is important since the whole appeal of the game is the story.  It’s a pretty short game, perhaps medium-sized if you decide to get all the collectibles— but it is paced very well, and wraps up right around the time it starts to get stale.There is really only one mechanic to the game, which is to move around and pick up clues or artifacts... and maybe use a few bland abilities here and there.  The combat is rare and one-dimensional and never evolves into anything more.  So it feels a lot like a show/movie where you control the main character.  To keep you busy, you can explore the levels to search for collectibles as you play through the campaign.So in conclusion I would posit that I enjoyed my playthrough of this game.  It is pretty minimal in terms of gameplay mechanics; but if you are one who enjoys good story-driven games with atmosphere, and who enjoys collectibles in a 3rd-person adventure setting: then you will probably enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I am judging this review based on its full price and therefore cannot recommend it. I would only recommend getting this game when there is a deep sale. The pro/con section will be at the bottom of this review .Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective adventure game where you play as Ronan, an ex-con badass who became a cop to atone for his wrong doings. You get killed by a man in a hoodie and become a ghost. You learn that you need to find clues to figure out who killed you in order to complete your ""unfinished business"" and be at peace. This game had so much potential to be something great but fell short and left me with an unsatisfactory experience.GameplayThis is a detective game where you play as a ghost in the mortal world. Think about all the things you can do as a ghost, it's going to be awesome!.. Or at least that's what you are led to believe. You start off the game learning that can you can walk through walls, only to realise that there are ""ghost walls"" all over the town Salem that you can't walk through. These walls are just there to hinder you from exploring the town of Salem and become extremely annoying after a while. Next you learn that you could possess random people and read their minds, only for it to get boring and repetitive after 20 minutes. The people around the town were bland and shamelessly copy pasted and the only thing you get from reading their minds were always something along the lines of ""Oh dear a murder, that’s terrible"" or ""I wish it wasn't so cold"". It's the same thing over and over again and eventually you just won't bother with the possessions. Their scripted dialogue with each other is pretty interesting to listen to though.The core gameplay has you travel from place to place in order to investigate scenes and solve puzzles. You have to find a couple of clues and then come to a conclusion about what the killer was doing or where he was going to next, much like the crime scene investigations in L.A Noire . However the puzzles are so painfully simple and boring that it doesn't take you long to come to a conclusion. In the end it just becomes a sort of glorified find the object game with an extremely obvious ""which one of these objects are related to the crime?"" conclusion (seriously, a spoon , a fork, or a key that belonged to the killer? I wonder which of these are relevant). The combat system is an extremely basic stealth system where you have to hide from patrolling demons and then execute them when they weren't looking at you. However, like most of the game, demons pose little to no challenge and are just there to hinder you and fill time. The combat didn't evolve over the course of the game and after the 4th or 5th time I heard the demons arrive I just thought to myself ""ugh not again"".You also have several dialogue options to choose from during the story, but these have no effect on the story at all. There are also side quests where you go about helping other ghosts to finish their business and these quests are rather interesting.There are collectibles hidden all around the map for you to collect, these will allow you to learn about the town of Salem, Ronan's background as well as give some insight on the killer. Unfortunately there is no map function and also no way for you to check which collectible you already have and which ones you still need to find.  I enjoyed listening and reading the stories about the artifacts I collected and make exploring the town enjoyable, I just wished the damned ghost walls weren't so restrictive and annoying.GraphicsThe game is quite good looking and the town of Salem looks great. The ghost structures and mortal buildings complemented each other well to give this dark and gloomy feeling.The main characters looked unique and well designed. There is a 30fps when you have v-sync on, but you can turn off v-sync in game and use v-sync from an external program such as Nvidia's control panel and the game will run at 60fps.SoundThe music in this game was pretty good. It set the mood really well and occasionally the music would go eerily quiet to build tension. The combat music also tries its best to build excitement and tension but was unfortunately unable to complement or help the poor combat system.The voice acting in this game was superb and was one of the only reasons why I could finish this game. I enjoyed listening to the conversations between the main characters and especially liked listening to many of Ronan's monologues.Pros+ Town looks great when the ""ghostly"" and ""mortal"" buildings are mixed together to form a unique hybrid look+ Voice acting is superb+ Interesting lore and backstory about the town as well as the protagonist+ Good chemistry between the main characters+ Interesting storyline+ Side quests are a nice change of paceCons- Basic and boring combat system- Core puzzle solving is too simple and repetitive- Extremely linear game- Ghost walls are a hindrance- Somewhat clunky controls- Choices make no difference to the story's conclusion- No replay valueIn conclusion this game is an overly simplified detective game with a boring stealth combat system slapped on it. It fails to impress, and with a price tag of $30 I certainly cannot recommend it over other detective games such as L.A Noire			"

												Ronan is a criminal-turned-cop who is killed by the mysterious Bell Killer. Playing as Ronan's ghost, investigate a series of crime scenes (sometimes with the help of teenage medium Joy), searching for identity of the killer. Many supernatural elements come into play – ghosts, witches, demons – and some flashbacks of the witch trials are pretty gruesome (drowning, burning, hanging). As the investigation progresses, you'll explore a graveyard, an apartment house, an old mansion, a police station and of course the obligatory asylum level. While the game world is small, it is open, with the ability to just wander around the town of Salem. It's a gloomy place – the game occurs entirely at night – but is well-dotted with NPCs and collectibles. Obtaining collectibles can unlock other stories (usually brief, narrated cut-scenes), and some NPCs will provide side-missions. There's a decent amount of stuff to do, but most collectibles were easily found as I explored the town or a level. Investigations require exploring a a crime scene, finding evidence (“Press E to analyze”) and sorting through the collected evidence (“Press Q to conclude the investigation”). Walking (or later, teleporting) around as a ghost feels fun; Ronan can walk through walls, possess people (mind-reading), and turn on random stuff to mess with the townsfolk (poltergeisting). Especially cool were the impenetrable “ghost walls” from past times that can block Ronan from exploring – or even provide new hazards (watch out for the ghost train!). Oh, and you can possess cats, too. This is actually crucial to progress through several stages of the game.The demon sections, though, dragged the experience down a bit. Demons will sometimes spawn after completing an investigation. Their existence does have a crucial part to play, and they're easy enough to defeat with a little patience. Given that this is a supernatural tale, it would be rather weird if demons of some kind weren't in the game, and having some stealth sections added some variety to the gameplay. But after a while the demons became annoying distractions from the story.And the narrative is where Murdered: Soul Suspect stands strongest. There is a lot of backstory to be found about Ronan and his wife (via collectibles). Sometimes collectibles are merely annoying, but they are worth pursuing here. Jason Brooks (as Ronan) and Cassidy Lehrman (as the medium, Joy) provide stand-out vocal performances. The graphics (Unreal 3) are great – murky and dark. Jason Graves' score provides a classic horror-story undertone. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a well-crafted detective game with a few quirks that holds its story aloft as its best attribute. If that sounds good to you, then go ahead and get this one.			"

„All those street brawls. It’s amazing I lived as long as I did.” ~RonanMURDERED: Soul Suspect is a new game made by Airtight Games, known from their other, warmly acclaimed production: Quantum Conundrum. This time, instead of a puzzle-adventure game devs made sure to provide us with a polished action-adventure suspense story backed with a supernatural mystery. Although professional reviewers are mostly critical about this game, I’ll try to convince You that it’s actually worth both its price and Your attention.The Game starts on a high note, with our protagonist – reformed cop Ronan - falling to his death after brutal fight with a mysterious murderer haunting the streets of modern day Salem. Soon he comes to his senses, only to discover that death itself was just a beginning. We end up being trapped on earth, but in a new ghostly form, with our mind set on a one simple goal: to complete our unfinished business, and finally move on to the other side.Unfortunately for Ronan, this unfinished business involves solving this one last case, which ultimately led him to his own demise by the hand of a dreadful Bell Killer. Luckily our hero is a fast learner, and easily adapts to the new state he’s woken up to. On our quest to hunt down the killer we’ll be using Ronans wits and experience gained as a police detective to find new leads, connect evidences and even access past memories imprinted into the ghost-realms fabric.The game consists of two different gameplay modes – first being a free roam explorations, during which we use our ability to pass through objects, summon or cast away solid fragments of the past Salem, and later even teleport to pass beautifully designed locations while finding as much collectibles as we can, and second being much slower ‘investigation mode.’The investigations are the most iconic moments of the game, and thanks to their presence many players felt obliged to describe Soul Suspect as “L.A. Noirish”. I’d argue with this opinion, because although in both games we progress through solving some cases the feeling of those is definitely different. In Soul Suspect we conduct our investigations with appropriate supernatural twist by correctly influencing possessed people, linking uncovered evidences or even accessing past memories lingering in the ghostly Salem. In turn Soul Suspects system feels much more simple, and dynamic in comparison to L.A. Noires ‘adjust and question’ model.Leaving gameplay behind, the strongest point of the game is definitely its scenario. With perfectly written characters and interesting plot twists, Ronans crusade against Bell Killer will be a memorable experience appealing to every gamer. The locations inspired by some of the Salems most iconic buildings are recreated in a great detail, and greatly contributes to the games spooky atmosphere. The whole experience is polished by believable voice overs and sounds, with only minor flaw being games music which felt somehow nonexistent.The only serious drawback of the game, is the large amount of collectibles, that makes even ‘Alan Wake’ blush in shame. It’s actually hard to move more than 5 ft without stumbling upon some new note, item or a graffiti flooding us with new information either related to our investigation or the Ronans past. All those stories are pretty well written, but the sheer number of those papers seriously affects immersion preventing us from fully diving into the games world.Murdered: Soul Suspect is definitely worth getting and trying especially for its captivating story. The game is definitely a must have for every supernatural events enthusiast, shining brightly in comparison with other productions picking up this subject. And if after reading the above review You're still unconvinced, I'd like to tell You that in this game You can possess a cat, and fool around in its body!Pros:- Agitating suspense story with supernatural twist.- Smooth controls with both mouse/keyboard and x-box controler.- Lots of witty puzzles and logic investigations.- Interesting ghost-powers affecting gameplay.- Clever world design with parts of the past Salem overlying its modern streets.- Really spooky side stories to unlock.- Can possess a cat!Cons:- Game’s a bit short, with full play through taking about 8-9 hours.- A high number of collectibles seriously affects immersion.- Due to its nature game is linear.

												Well, I did not know who Airtight Games was up until now but doing 2 consecutive walkthroughs of Soul Suspect will certainly make me remember them for a while! This is a third-person view adventure game that employs some stealth elements and lots of crime scene investigation gameplay mechanics.The story follows Ronan, a con-turned-detective who has just been murdered and whose soul - for some reason - cannot leave this world and proceed to Heaven where his wife awaits. We soon learn his killer is the one he was originally after - a couple of cutscenes later his memory is refreshed and he is certain he needs to solve the mystery of the Bell Killer who has been haunting his residential town for a while so that by solving the murder case he can peacefully enter Paradise.Now, when playing this game I was constantly thinking of the adventure games released by Telltale Games. Why? Because the puzzles are easy and there is a great emphasis on the story immersion. Unlike those Telltale adventures Murdered allows you to control the protagonist and freely walk around in Salem. Still, I wouldn't really call this an open-world journey as many places are only accessible if the story demands it - the ""hub area"" is mainly for collectibles and a couple of side missions where you help other ghosts finish their business and ascend once and for all.Then come the demons. Certain sections require you to hide from the beasts and approach them while they turn away - execution is not mandatory but collecting evidence and other ""artifacts"" in the areas require you to rid Salem of them for good. While the game is not difficult, at all, and lacks any real combat it does have a great story. I almost completed it in one sitting as I really wanted to see the antagonist dealt with. Murdered has a great atmosphere which is accompanied by a great score and very well done voice acting.To summarise: if you are in for a great story and for something new and you do not mind that one playthrough gives you all the experience (a 2nd should only be done for the collectibles) then Soul Suspect is an easy grab - especially with a discount!

												Vou tentar ser meio breve aqui, mesmo que não consiga. Os trailers do jogo deixam qualquer um muito ancioso para jogar, porém, dependendo do tipo de pessoa, possa vir a se decepcionar com o que encontrará dentro do jogo.Para quem espera algum tipo de luta, velocidade, tiros, qualquer tipo de ação em geral, não vai encontar isso por essas bandas. O jogo é quase que um livro animado, para quem é acostumado e gosta de ler bastante, vai adorar (Assim como eu gostei bastante). A história pode não ser perfeitamente feita e maravilhosa, eu particulamente achei que o motivo de toda a confusão poderia ter uma explicação mais interessante, ou melhor dizendo, o motivo de tudo poderia ser outro, essa parte da história poderia ser mudada para algo melhor ( Só minha opinião por sinal, não deixa de ser interessante. )''Murdered - Soul Suspect'' não é um jogo de muitas horas, se você seguir direto para o final da história principal ( Deve durar mais ou menos 8 horas, algo assim.) Mas caso não o faça, tem muito o que explorar, muita informações escondidas pela cidade de Salem, além das sidequests, que basicamente é onde você, Ronan, faz uma boa e manda os fantasmas presos a terra para o céu, aliviando a dor que eles tinham devido alguma dúvida.Pessoalmente falando, o que mais gostei no jogo foram as informações pelo mapa sobre tudo, todas as histórias que faziam a atmosfera da cidade ficar ainda mais sombria.------------------------------------------I'll try to be brief here, even if I fail. The trailers of the game let anyone excited to play, however, depending on the type of person is likely to be disappointed with what you find in the game.For those expecting some kind of fight, speed, shots, any kind of action in general, will NOT find it for these bands. The game is almost an animated book. For anyone who is used to and likes to read a lot, you'll love (Just as I quite liked). The history is not that perfect and wonderful, I thought particularly the reason for all the confusion could have a more interesting explanation, or rather, could another part of this story be changed to something better ( Just my opinion by the way, it is still interesting.)'' Murdered - Soul Suspect'' is not a game for many hours, if you go straight to the end of the main story (should last roughly 8 hours, something like that.) But if you do not, have a lot to explore , a lot of hidden information by the City of Salem, besides the side quests, which basically is where you, Ronan, is a good soul and sends the ghosts trapped in the earth to heaven, relieving pain because they had any questions.Personally speaking, what I liked the most about the game was the information about the map everything, all the stories that made the atmosphere of the city get even murkier.

												So you investigate your own murder, your investigation skills are enhanced since you're a ghost ( in a very nicely done way) This game has amazing story worth making it a movie The investigation scenes are brilliantly done makes you think, connect things, follow leads and        reveal the story in an interesting way, and they're not that hard   Graphics are good  Sounds are not badThis whole ghost thing mechanism is done in a very appealing way, I like to see more games like that.My problem was with the 100% ashievements, codex are a ♥♥♥♥♥ for instance, and if you finish the game without getting all the ashievements you need to start all over again, and it would be nice if they told you how many collectibles left in a certain area so you know when It's done and move to another.Such a great game.

												This game starts untraditionaly, with your own death, but what's wierd you just get up as a ghost, told that you need to finish your things on earth to actually move on. You figure out that your purpose why you are still in the ghost world is finding out the killers identity. Last thing you remember is that you were called somewhere to the city centre where was spotted The Bell Killer, a serious killer who terrifies Salem in last weeks. Through the story you are finding out more about The Bell Killer murders with newly obtained abilities, like posses, read mind or influence someone. You are also finding out more about your main character detective Ronan with very difficult to understand past full of criminal records, and also about his dead wife Julia. Identity of your killer is unknown until the last minutes of the game, unfortunately its not that simple and just finding out the who actualy kills is not enought...During the gameplay you have also option to help some of the other ghosts to find peace using your detective skills which is a nice variegation of the game. I really enjoyed this game, for me it is a game full of interesting stories and some detective elements. In some moments it reminded me of Batman Arkham series, where I was always checking every corner for collectibles and seeking everywhere to reveal and solve another mystery. You can find out some information about history of city of Salem which is known for the witch trials and few ghost stories and of course some of main character's past and thoughts of his wife. I must admit the ending of the game really surprised me, you really need to play this game until the end to be satisfied. Nevertheless the last part of the game seems tacky, it hurt the game and I would appreciate longer and better ending cutscene. 7/10			"

												This is a fine example of style over substance. The voice acting is solid, the writing is generally okay (it's cliched at times, but has some decent moments) and it looks good. Unfortunately, it is hampered by gameplay which ranges from mediocre to bad. On the mediocre side, you are given a mere handful of skills, which are used remarkably infrequently and only in very obvious situations. The detective aspect has some good aspects, but while it mostly avoids LA Noire's tendency towards arbitrary and frustrating sleuthing, it does so by making things terribly obvious and having no consequences for failure. My favourite was a scene where you have to find a key. Not only does the game tell you how to go about getting to the key, it then presents you with a puzzle to pick it up, where you have to choose between the key, a fork and a spoon. Spoiler: the correct answer is the key.As for the bad, the combat is hideous. Awkward controls, very limited options and overwhelming noise make for a frustrating experience.There's plenty of collectables in the game, some of which are at least a mild challenge to get, but unless you're really into that aspect of it, you're better off just watching the story on YouTube.

												8,5/10+ nice presentation, although graphics are not next gen, the locations and character models are well done and the atmosphere is creepy as it should+ runs great on highest settings+ nice sound, excellent voice acting+ dark, original story about you trying (as a ghost detective !) to catch a serial killer + gameplay wise it's more of an adventure game, with lots of exploration, tons of stuff to collect and notes to read, main progress is done by investigating scenes, that is finding clues and piece them together+ fighting demons on your way by using stealth and then using qtes to kill them are the only action sequences that can be considered in the game (that's fine for me)+ nice diary that tracks everything- gameplay feels monotonous through the end, they could add some more gameplay mechanics to keep interest higher, but still you will want to finish it for the very good story- technically it could use more polishagain the reviews for this game are very unfair, maybe it shouldn't be rated as high as i have done, but it's a genre i love (creepy adventure in heart games)			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an amazing game in its own genre, not a 10/10 one but still fun and enjoyable, especially for those who like supernatural games and enjoy solving puzzles. It has a really unique and unusual gameplay which makes the game special. There aren't car chases, weapons and other ""ultra modern"" stuff, the only enemy whom you will face are the Lost Souls aka Demons.The story isn't that long, but if you keep looking for artifacts and doing side missions it will take a while till you finish it and I swear it won't be boring.I highly recommend this game for everyone, if you don't expect anything , you will be suprised how awesome is it.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective puzzle(?) game, with some action(?) elements. You play as Ronan O’Connor, a cop whose wife died. That's all the back story the game has to offer. Though there was a bunch of collectables, each one had around 2-3 sentences of boring info. So I never bothered to read them, as it wasn't engaging or well wrote at all (much like this review). Ronan is murdered at the start of the game by the Bell-Tower Killer, who Ronan was hunting down. He soon discovers he is a ghost, and he must solve his death to move on to the afterlife. The game is open world, in the sense it has a hub of sorts between missions. It's literally just filler to add time to the game as you walk a short distance to the next area. The hub is littered with collectables to find, but they glow up so it's easy to get them all quickly. Investigations are poorly done. The only game I could compare this to is L.A Noire. But this feels like the poor man's L.A Noire. It's a total cheap knock-off. Asians are not only making fake American clothing, but games now too. You are thrown into an area and must walk about looking for clues. There is no indication of what might be a clue, so sometimes you could be spending upwards 10 minutes looking for the final one. Only to stumble upon by sheer luck, Whereas in L.A Noire, the controller would vibrate, or a jingle would play. The clues are also really badly thought out. Most of them are just one word, or a little phrase. Instead of finding proper evidence, you'll get one word like ""damage"", or ""scratch"". It's as if no thought was poured into the game. The only action in the game consists of you running up behind demons and holding a key, then pressing a QTE prompt that's displayed. There are no more than 20-30 demons in the entire game, so this was very lackluster. Concluding investigations was poorly done. You'd be shown all the evidence you have found, and must select 1-3 different pieces you think are most relevant to the question asked. But this could be rather arbitrary. As the clues were poorly explained, it was hard at times to figure out the most relevant ones. There are 3 badges displayed at the bottom of the screen. I at first assumed these were lives, and that if I messed up 3 times I would have to start again. But it turned out they are not. There is no failing. If you get it wrong, there are no consequences at all. As there is no point/scoring system, or achievement for getting all 3 badges in every case. Overall, the story was pretty meh. There was not much to it, and it was rather cliché. Nothing was really explained either, or made much sense. The main focus was figuring out the murders, but there were random things to do with other people tacked in, which seemed silly. Gameplay was pretty bad. Being a ghost was cool, but there were issues with walking through walls. Investigations were poorly done. Again, if you expect another L.A Noire, you're gonna be seriously disappointed. Most actions were performed with pressing a key or two, and there was just nothing to it. You walk up to an item and hit E. There was no examining it, or any of that jazz. Action was non-existent. The whole demon business was stupid and pointless. The game takes around 9 hours to complete 100%. Rushing the story and ignoring the collectables will probably reduce that time by around 3-4 hours. I do not recommend this game, even on sale. It was a drag to play, and I only did so because of the Playfire Rewards.			"

 Overview  Murdered: Soul Suspect is a mystery adventure game played in the third-person perspective of Detective Ronan O'Connor a career criminal turned cop, who is hot on the trail of the notorious ""Bell Killer"" in the quiet town of Salem, Massachusetts. The opening scene will introduce you to an elusive killer, Detective O'Connor and an unknown teenager. The failed capture of the Bell Killer leaves Detective O'Connor dead, the girl missing and the killer still at large. It is now up to you to solve your own murder and find out what happened before your soul can move on.It should be noted that none of what I mentioned above is, in any way, a spoiler. This occurs minutes into starting a new game. However, it stands as an interesting premise, one I honestly can't recall playing in the past. With that being said, Murdered: Soul Suspect has been a very difficult game to pinpoint. I found myself motivated by the main storyline, but often pulled astray by lackluster side missions and shoddy combat junctions. The end was worth the time invested, but getting there was one of uncertainty; let's start from the beginning.For those that don't know the history of Salem, Massachusetts, it is infamously known for the capture, trials and executions of accused witches circa 1692-1693. The game takes place entirely within a small suburb of Salem and the lore of the game is derived from such [so much so it practically beats you over the head with it]. While previous knowledge of these events aren't necessary, as the game will give you over two-hundred collectables that provide details of such events, it is interesting to see what was influenced from the town's history or forced to make deductive conclusions from seemingly illogical perspectives.During the course of your investigation you'll meet others [both dead and living] that will help you on your journey, providing clues that propel you closer to the truth. Here is where I had mixed feelings about the game. You see, the main story I found compelling and the script did a wonderful job of teasing you with tiny, minute details without giving you much of anything to go on. Then, however, you're side-tracked with boring side missions and dreadful combat. As you were warned, you must occasionally fight demons whose sole purpose is to consume your ghostly essence, but luckily Ronan has the ability to banish these demons with the power of obnoxious QTEs; where he gets these powers is never explained. Whenever I was forced to fight these demons I found it painfully annoying. These encounters felt forced, stuffed into the fabric of the game where the suspense waned and a hole needed to be plugged. I hated the combat to the point I chose to simply die each time I got caught and reload as opposed to actually killing the demons.Demons aside, Soul Suspect suffers from several other shortcomings: repeating dialogue between NPCs, useless abilities like ""Poltergeist"", which gave me the ability to possess electrical devices during plot convenient sequences, the ability to read minds when it was necessary and the ability to teleport. Even with all of these powers I still felt like a poor excuse for a ghost, the store brand product of something better. The game gives you these abilities, but then severely limits you to what you're able to do with them. Even as a ghost, I couldn't indiscriminately walk through walls, forcing Ronan to avoid ""ghost walls"" or spiritual residue from old structures and objects, all of which prohibited walking through; Invisible walls for ghosts you might call them. It is never explained why they exist or the reasoning behind them.The strangest thing about the game isn't the main story, which is surprisingly solid, but the extras the game throws in to expand its own longevity. The side missions were dull, the collectables were seemingly unnecessary outside achievement hunting and the combat was utterly pointless. Woven between these shortcomings was a tapestry of mystery that could have been so much more if the effort was put elsewhere. Instead were given bits of possibility only to be disappointed. Forgo the extras and put that effort into Ronan's murder and you have a great murder mystery to solve. However, you never really feel like a true ghost, nor really even a mediocre detective. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a case of trying to do too much and spreading your content too thin. The phrase ""less is more"" fits this game all too well.  Pros  Voice Acting - I was surprised by how good it actually was done. Atmosphere - I really liked the environment, music and background effects of the game. The creepy, ""ghostly"" vibe never let up.Main story - It kept me hooked until the end. Cons   The combat is forgettable, the demon portals just stand as roadblocks if nothing else.  The ""stealth"" aspects are impossible to fail, even if you try. Zero replayability. Overall, Murdered: Soul Suspect is good, but not great. It has a lot of hiccups that, if you can look past, has something interesting to offer. The story is intriguing, the voice acting is well done and some of the characters are interesting. I'd cautiously recommend it if you can find it on sale, but don't except a masterpiece if you pick it up. Case closed.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale for only $3.00, so the price was not an issue for me - but now having played it all the way through I can genuinely say I would not have regretted paying $30.00 for such an enjoyable, atmospheric experience.Storybuilding was phenomenal - from beginning to middle to end, there was never a dull moment as I was deeply engaged the entire time. I grew attached to the protagonist Ronan O'Connor fairly quickly, especially as you begin to uncover clues about his past. I bought everything the developers sold me about the ""ghost realm"" and how it functions (such as there being consecrated ""obstructions"" that ghosts can't pass through - perhaps not the most realistic idea to some, but considering we're dealing with a video game, I found it to be a very reasonable and clever excuse to keep the player's area of exploration streamlined but not restricted). The way that one investigation would lead to the next felt natural and smooth. Towards the end of the game I started to grow fearful that I would be disappointed by the conclusion, but I absolutely was not. From start to finish the plot was well-thought out and brilliantly executed.The worst part of this game to me are the demon-hunting sequences. In all fairness I've never been much for destroying enemies, but even moreso than usual I found them to be an annoyance. Luckily individual demons follow their own path on a loop, but when there's more than one to an area it can become much trickier to get the timing right. Really, though, it just takes a lot of careful planning and mapping out your steps in advance.Otherwise, for negatives, the autosave feature is a bit of a pain because I had to leave the game up & running at all times until I finished. That is, you cannot save your game on your own time, the game chooses when to save FOR you. So then if you exit & reopen the game, you'll be started back at the beginning of the last area you entered instead of specifically where you left off. Also, there are some parts of the game where you have to select the ""most useful"" clue(s) and while I got most of them easily, there were a few where the logic was simply lost on me.The 38.9 hours I spent on this game only accounts for 1 playthrough - I know the average person doesn't take NEARLY as long to finish, but I'm a born-again explorer and spent a ton of extra time scanning the environment in every direction, every corner, every wall I could pass through and even revisiting areas I'd already been to in case I missed anything. So if you enjoy being thorough like me, it is possible to make this game last a long time which adds to its value.Also, there are multiple occasions where you can play as a cat. A+++			"

The Good Stuff++Ronan is a total badass +Lots of history about Salem and the Witch Trials+Dark supernatural story+Side quests provide some diversion from the main story, similar to RPG games+Collectables provide backstory, lore and real life historyThe Ok Stuff=NPC's not related to the story are composed of the same five or six models and repeat the same lines. Same goes for voice actors. There's one part in the game where all the cops said the exact same lines with the same voice despite being a different model =Gameplay is very linear, especially when it shows you what to do exactly when you possess someone=A little priceyThe Bad Stuff-Combat seems very unnecessary and kind of a nuisance.

Product received for free
												The game is a supernatural detective thriller, where you play as a detective who was working at the Salem Police Department. The game takes place in the city of Salem, Salem is known as one of the most famous witch trials in the United States. In the game you are a detective who tries to find out who his killer was, Ronan. The killer is known as: The Bell Killer. The police has no clues, no leads and no links between his victims. In the game you have the freedom to explore the modern-day town of Salem. Except trying to find out who his killer was, you can also solve the other side quests from another ghosts like you. They also wants to know something, like: how they died or did my boyfriend cheated with another woman before I died?When you first play you start with a cutscene that tells you the most important things you need to know at the beginning. After the cutscene you fell of a window and tells the most imptorant things of his past. After these cutscenes you can play the game, but the soul of your body got out after the incident. So you'll be trying to get in your body, but after getting shot by seven gunshots at your chest. Your body dies except the soul. He became a ghost, because he tries to resolve who his killer was. Normal people can't see you, except mediums. But there are also purposes of becoming a soul, you have abilities that you never had before like. Some of them are: Teleporting, manipulating- and to influence people. Souls can only die by Demons, whoa are trying to eat your soul and you die also by a red/black creepy hole. My Impressions of the game:The game is really amazing and I had most of the times fun. The game looks in my opinion like The Wolf Among Us and L.A. Noire. In The Wolf Among Us you'll fall from a window too at the beginning, coincidence?The Pros and Cons.Pros- The game got good graphics- The game has besides a good main story, also good side missions- The game has trading cards- The game audio is well-madeCons- Sometimes there are too much demons in one room- The normal price is a little bit expensive This game is definitely worth a shot if it is discounted for a reasonable price.

												I will make this one very simple for you: Do you love collecting♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, really REALLY love collecting♥♥♥♥♥♥ Is all you ask of a game that you push a button, hear a pleasing jingle, and see the ""X out of Y"" counter increment? Because if you do, you will love this game. And if you don't... well, let's talk.Murdered is the tale of the tragically-named Ronan O'Connor, loose cannon of the Salem PD with nothing to lose. The game opens with him getting ventilated by the world's least-subtle-slash-least-catchable murderer, the Bell Killer, and you spend the rest of the running time trying to figure out why. Well, that's a lie. You spend most of the running time wandering around Salem, ghosting through walls and people in search of the 242 collectable knick-knacks scattered throughout the city. While some require your ghostly powers to reach or reveal, most are just sitting out, waiting for you to mash X on. Each one gives you a tiny snippet of backstory on the characters or Salem if you bother to open the menu, and a few let you hear a cute creepypasta story if you collect the whole set.If you're wondering why I haven't talked about the core gameplay yet, that's because it's dogshit. No lie, the investigations in Murdered are probably the worst of their kind. At every major story beat, you have a crime scene you need to investigate for clues to answer a specific question. Around the scene you'll find plenty more doodads sitting out for you to mash X on, each giving you a clue. After finding all the clues, you have to pick the clues that are the most relevant to answering the question at hand. This is where it all falls apart, because the expectations of the developers in picking answers ranges from so obvious you'll miss it to absolutely non-nonsensical. You're either going to breeze through every investigation or stumble over every answer depending on how well your brain is wired like the developers. Not that it matters either way, because there is literally no penalty for ♥♥♥♥ing up an answer, you just try again.So that's how Murdered plays, terrible detective sequences broken up by fits of collection-sperging. If that was all, we could flip it the bird and move on with our lives. The weird part is, everything else about the game is fantastic. The graphics are gorgeous and detailed, bringing the town of Salem and its residents (living or dead) alive. Sound direction is on point with satisfying effects and a moody, fitting soundtrack. The characters are charming and memorable despite what seems like every effort to make them obnoxious. Bad-boy Ronan is vulnerable and compassionate, manic goth-girl Joy is plucky and nuanced, and the entire supporting cast is interesting in their own ways. Your ghost powers also keep things fresh, allowing you to possess people to intrude on their idle thoughts, or poltergeist their appliances to freak them out. There's even some stealth combat against some pretty horrifying demons that's simple, engaging, and a welcome break from the running and collecting.I'm not going to pretend Murdered is a great game, or great for everyone. But even after identifying its flaws, I had a blast with it. Full disclosure, I watched my buddy stream the entire game months ago, and still had enough fun with it to play through the whole thing myself. A lot of your enjoyment is certainly going to hinge on the collect-a-thon aspect, but if you get into the story and learn to love Salem and its characters, there's a perfectly good game to be had here.

												I can't believe how much I liked this game, considering all the negative reviews it got. It's like some bizarre mix of Condemned, LA Noire, and Ghost Trick. The only combat you're exposed to are simple exorcisms, and the rest is investigation, story, and mystery. The only down side is that it doesn't run so well at times. Entering new areas make you lag & stutter on any setting I tried (and I spent about two hours combining different settings). If you can have a little patience while it chugs a bit in new areas, then you're in for a treat. I would have paid for this (won it in a contest), but I wouldn't have paid full price. Worth a grab if you see it discounted on g / 2 / a or greenman gaming, or even on steam if they get it £15 or lower. This is a really, really good game.			"

												I can't recommend a game where the developer refuses to address a game killing bug for two years.  That tells me all I need to know about the developers.  This game has a bug where the keyboard interface simply stops working in the investigate window resulting in your having to manually shutting down the game and lose all progress since the last save point.  It is a known bug since launch and the developers have done nothing to address it or even respond to it.  Save your money and don't support developers like this.			"

												Murdered :Soul Suspect is a refreshing new concept for a game and it sure does deserve a metascore of more than 60 % .Gameplay  7/10 Yes there is no real combat system , no hordes of various enemies , no grenade launcher  , none of that .But it was never meant to be a Resident Evil clone , it's more like a playable thriller /detective movie . You play a ghost ( Ronan O' Connor ) who must  who must solve the mystery of his own death and you have ghost like abilities , like mind reading , warping and you can possess humans and animals . Also you can collect various artifacts to uncover the city of Salem's dark secrets or uncover the backstory of the main character e.g.Finished the game in around 12 hours, so it's best to say it's kinda short . Story 8/10 Very unique and with a little twist in the end , like a good thriller .I won't go into detail , because this would surely spoil the story .Music  7/10 Okay , nothing spectacular . Just good background music and noise .Voice acting is okay too. Graphics 7 /10 The graphics are kinda outdated . They look more like  PS 4 /Sbox 360 . Character models are not very varied . You got like 4 different ones , only the main protagonist and important side characters are unique. Definetely a must buy if it's on sale . "

												Inspired by 1996 classic The Frighteners, Murdered fails to provide Michael J. Fox's film main value - FUN.Technically and visually the game is smooth and pleasant and if you're not planning on getting every collectable, you probably won't notice it's flaws. The gameplay is ridiculously easy and sometimes even silly. The puzzles where patronising and never prompted me to think.The mediocre story of the game is very well presented and can even surprise with the ending some unspoiled player. But everything in it, especially characters, is so cliche, that I wouldn't recommend the game to people familiar with the Peter Jackson's gem.Despite everything, I tremendously enjoyed possessing cats.

												A lot of potential but sadly most of it is unreached. The detective side quests are particularly confusing and counter-intuitive.The game is visually great and at times an enjoyable experience but I'd definitely not pay full price for it. That said, if they brought out a free (or reasonably priced) DLC which expanded the universe and improved the gameplay experience I would gladly retract my negative review as this game had so much potential.

												So. I really wanted to play this game since a very long time. I usually play games for the story and I mostly play point and click adventures, I am to unpatient and unskilled for anything else.What I like:- great characters- many stories you can collect and listen too (that's great)- awesome storyWhat I didn't like:- the fights...they were awful, you have to sneek behind the demon and that execute him with some stupid quicktime event. There are a lot of fights. Story. Demons. Story. Demons. Story. Demons. Demons. Story. As soon as you get some clues and you now something important, they just pop out of nowhere!!!!! They're evrywhere!!!! And they're at least three in each area.It would be a really really great game without these stupid demons. I hate them. There the reason I don't want to play it a second time. - It's very short? But that's okay, I got the game 50% off.I would recommend it, without the demons. Why is there no maybe button by do you recommend this game? "

												Extremely short, like 5 hours short. Very cliche and cheesy story that barely has time to develop. You barely get to know any characters in the game, and the ending falls flat on its face. Also absolutely zero replay value. I really wanted to like this game, the premise seemed awesome and I was excited to play it. I had it preordered which I never do anymore, I was looking forward to it. But it turned out to be a barely finished game. Repetitive as anything, and the ""combat"" was a waste of time and should have been better implemented or scrapped. I would stay away from this game and save your money. I know I regret buying it. At most I could see it being worth $10 on sale, but no more. Trust me.			"

												I gotta admit, I did not expect this. This is a unique game to be honest, because it surprised me, a whole lot.Imma do it like they all do, cus it's easier to understand reviews, so here:PROS:-An unique experience (for now)There aren't many games with it's concept being you die and become a ghost solving your murder (not really a spoiler, because the title spoils it all then), and this one is from my perspective done exceptionally well.-Voice QualityI can't say this is the best voice quality I heard, but the voice is mixed and put together, doing its job of keeping you on your toes, really well.-GraphicsFor the graphics maniacs and the graphicsrexics this is a meet down the middle. For its scenery and location, the graphics fit really good, since it gives this dark, mysterious vibe with a dash of detectiveness.-StoryOh. I absolutely loved the story (I haven't finished it yet (at about 7,5 hrs right now) but I know I'll be too lazy to edit this review, but I know I'll love it, so y'know), and some moments in it are a really well done,unique, some other important adjective of a moment. It's what it is - great.-DemonsWell, I wasn't really expecting them and I was scared sh*tless at first (still am at times ;D), but you get used to them. They offer a new type of enemy, but in an interesting form, making it something you probably won't see soon.-CluesThese little sons'a'b*tches are tricky but fo' real entertaining and I think that with time I started enjoying myself, when I got the answers to various questions about, ''why this happened'', ''why that happened'' and them putting them together, reminds me of Sherlock Holmes in a way, yet unclear to me. Checking IGN guides on where stuff is also happens quite often (often being almost everytime).-CollectiblesA lot of em. A lot. Which is good (?), but what's even better is, that at any time when you're in the town, you can go to various interiors (since collectibles are more or less spread out across interiors), and collect the ones you might've missed.CONS:-There aren't any consI enjoyed it, and the achievements make for some work, but you get the hang of it.Also, when this first came out, I was oh-so-not interested in it, but after time (time being about a year later), it was on sale and I said ''why not''.P.S I don't think I regret it.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect has a really cool premise. You're dead, a ghost, and you need to figure out who killed you. You can walk through walls, do poltergeisty stuff, read people's minds, woo!In reality, the game is mostly just wandering around surprisingly small maps, picking up a seemingly endless pile of collectables that serve as plot-filler and as a source for some spooky ghost stories. Also, since you're a ghost and still cannot walk through some doors (because the writers of the game wrote themselves into a corner) you need a living person to help you, and that person is one of the most annoying 15-year-old goth-teenage girls I have ever seen in a videogame. Yaay for cringe!Beyond walking around, touching things and reading people's minds, the only form of gameplay is avoiding and destroying demons in an oversimplified stealth minigame followed by a QTE. On the whole, the gameplay is not very engaging and solving some of the scenes flawlessly requires you to do quite a bit of the old ""what was the game dev thingking about here"" -mindgames.For a murder mystery plot, the game has way too few characters and the clues are too obvious to keep the game interesting.The game also seems to have a low number of voice actors, resulting in samey characters, and for some reason it also seems the game devs made precisely four character models: ""man"", ""woman"" ""girl"" and ""scary little girl"" (five if you count the demons) and went with those, so all the people in the game have the exact same body types and... It feels weird. Like they're all clones, milling about endlessly.All in all, Soul Suspect falls flat despite a cool premise and the game isn't really very enjoyable.Playtime: 6+ hours (Single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 6Audio: 7Story: 4Gameplay: 6Overall: 5			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed  Murdered: Soul Suspect. Let me start by saying if you are looking for action, adventure, and shooting in a run and gun style look elsewhere (You don't shoot a gun at all, not even once). If you are looking for a solid game with a great storyline, reading, thinking, and a great mystery plot that keeps you guessing look here. Is the game scary? No I would not say it is scary, maybe creepy or atmospheric. The Dev does a good job of making you feel and realize that you are not among the living. There is the occassional disappearing ghosts and scary music but nothing like silent hill, dead space, or amnesia. The point of the game is not to scare or freak you out. It's to tell a great story and for you to solve a mystery.On top of figuring out your own mystery there are about 6-10 little side quests. None are very long, but they are each enjoyable and have a little story of their own. There are also hundreds of little collectables to find and to keep you busy. I am not usually a fan of finding and hunting for hidden objects; but for some reason in this game it does not seem to tedious or difficult. The style of game just seems to lend itself towards finding lost or hidden items.All that being said I would recommend this game overall score 8/10. I picked it up at 75% off and am not disapointed. I think for me even %50 off would justify the purchase. If it's on sale and you are a story driven gamer I would strongly urge you to pick this one up at some point.Oh and if that's not convincing enough did I mention you have the ability to posses cats, and you have a never ending cigarette?! Yup see I knew that would help you make the right decision!			"

YouTube™ Video: Murdered: Soul Suspect Review 

			Views: 118		

			We take a look at the detective horror game Murdered: Soul Suspect! http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Remember those God awful Nancy Drew Detective games that were sold in the bargain bins at Best Buy and Walmart?...Well swap out adorable Nancy with a buff, gritty, tattoo covered, cop and you have Murdered: Soul Suspect. The game puts you in the shoes of a recently deceased detective who becomes trapped on earth as a ghost until he can track down his murderer and solve his own case. While the general idea of the game sounds very interesting, the gameplay doesn’t hold up strongly enough to back this promising premise.The game offers fairly solid visuals; they aren’t anything that will knock your socks off but they get the job done and provide an immersive, bone chilling, spooky experience. The game is fittingly set in Salem Massachusetts, but you won’t be exploring much of the town, as the game is designed to give you the false sense of free roam when it is in fact painfully linear. The game has a fairly expanse world, however due to the ghostly limitations the game places on you, you are unable to enter any buildings unless the door or window is already opened for you. This leads to the game being extremely linear, with what appears to be a vast explorable world turns out to be an empty ghost town in and of itself.The core gameplay mechanics consists of incredibly disappointing “Detective Work”. Detective work is conducted by entering the crime scene (which usually consist of about 3 fairly small rooms) and meandering about the room pressing the interact key on all the shiny clues that are sprinkled throughout the crime scenes. The game requires that you find a painstaking amount of these clues for each question and at some points you may find yourself spamming the interact key repeatedly hoping you will blindly click on the last elusive clue that you need to proceed, imagine it as the Easter egg hunt from hell. The game does introduce some fairly interesting puzzle mechanics on certain clues, such as word association deciphers where you are presented with an image and around 15 words and have to pick the 3 or 4 words that are most related to the image to crack the clue, however these interesting tidbits are never truly fleshed out to their true potential.Don’t go into this game expecting any form of combat whatsoever, the combat is almost nonexistent and consists of walking behind the demonic enemies and performing a series of simple quick time events to eliminate them. The demons themselves look genuinely terrifying and if you do happen to mess up the quick time event then you will be chased by the demon and have to escape by quickly transporting through preplaced ghostly rifts that allow you to hide until the demon gives up on searching for you.  The only thing this game really has going for it that makes it worth playing is the intriguing, twist filled story. The stories pacing is done very well and at times you almost wish Murdered: Soul Suspect was a movie rather than a game. The voice acting is pretty solid and one of the best aspects of the game; being such a story driven game it benefits greatly from making sure that it has some good quality voice acting. While there are many cut scenes, they are enjoyable and emotion filled. It’s just a shame that the rest of the game feels like such a grinding chore just to get to the next cut scene to watch the story unfold.Overall Murdered: Soul Suspect seems like it has so much potential but never truly takes advantage of anything that it has going for it. The game holds your hand through a painfully linear environment and offers absolutely no challenge or difficulty. The only thing that makes Murdered: Soul Suspect even remotely worth playing is the fairly enjoyable story delivered through the cut scenes. The game plays out like a very good movie with obnoxious, tedious, burdensome, gameplay in between. What seemed like a very promising premise wasn’t strongly supported enough by the overall weak puzzles and lack of difficulty.I would only recommend this game if you get it at a ridiculous sale pricehttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												I really don't know what to say about this game..I mean the story is great, the graphics are good and the voice acting is also decent and the area where you're playing in is also really well done.I personally don't really like the demons, I mean I understand why they are there but they are just kinda annoying, though they are super easy to kill and you can easily lose one if it happens to come after you.And sometimes finding those glues can get really frustating because some of them might be hidden really well.I paid about 7€ for it and I think it's worth that but I really wouldn't pay more than 10€ for this.So if you can get it for really cheap, go for it!

												Short ReviewThe Good:- great setting and very spooky atmosphere that pulls you in- the story is very good and will keep you attached till you reach the conclusion- solving puzzles and putting clues together is really fun- graphics, sound and voice acting are all great ( if you want more than 30 Fps you have to change that in the .ini file)Nuetral:- there is no combat in this game, i liked that but i guess some people won't like it, the only combat in game is just sneaking behind few spirits and kill them in a quick-time event- the length of the game, it will take about 8 hours to finish and most likely you won't be playing it again unless you missed some collectables or achievements i really enjoyed this game and i hope more people would give it a chance and don't listen to critics' reviews.

												7/10.   If you enjoy story driven games, this game is a good fit.  A well fleshed out storyline with excellent voice acting, cinematics, and live action gameplay.  I didn't find any silly time wasting quests or non-sensical gameplay at all.  		I had no idea what the gameplay would involve, and it's an interesting mix.  You are a detective who becomes a ghost and needs to find out who killed you and why. So, lots of investigations.  To me, the investigative parts of the game are most like a hidden object game.  You walk around a small area and find the clues to solve the inquiry.  Very straightforward.  There is a bit of action involved with demons to dispose of. You play stealthy while sneaking up on them.  Later in the game, it gets more intense with up to 4 demons simultaneously and can be a little challenging to sneak up on.	There are clues, letters, special bad guy info bits, historical parts, human mind reading, and some side quests too.  I didn't enjoy these as much.  They just aren't interesting and add little to the game story.  Mostly, the human mind reading gets boring to the point where I stopped bothering to read minds one third of the way through the game.  There are also ghost stories to unlock.  Some are good, some are so-so.  I liked the asylum one best.  Those are optional and require going through the rooms quite a bit more to search out hidden unlockables.  If anything was time wasting, that was it.  But, it's not mandatory.	To me, the story dragged up until about halfway.  After the cemetery I was hooked and kept on playing without any lack of interest. Before then, I was getting a bit bored, so slow gameplay and story up until midway.		Two things that stood out to me that may interest others: 1) It's not an adventure game.  Don't go in expecting an adventure game of any kind.  This wasn't clear to me from the onset until I had been playing a bit.2) If you like action or fast paced horror games, this may not be for you.  This game is laid back, not terribly scary, and takes it's time.  More for the detective story fans IMO and fans of hidden secrets.	The ending is good and don't watch a vid of it please or it really ruins the experience.  If the initial half of the game wasn't so slow and a bit scarier, I would probably rate it higher. Still a good game, lots of love went into it, and it's optimized very well too.  "

												I had this in my library for a while. I just played it because it was already on my HDD and I wanted something to entertain me while other game was downloading. Aaaaand I just finished it in one go. Completely ignoring freshly downloaded game.Game is locked at 30fps, which is a little bummer, but I got so into it, that I did not want to waste time to look for a way to bypass it. It's a good detective story with mechanics that don't hold you back. It was fun to uncover secrets, recreate crime scenes and gather clues. If that isn't good enough, there is a ton of side stories. A lot of other ghosts, who are trapped in the same place as Ronan. Interactions with them felt so authentic, I genuinely wanted to help them. Places with their own history. Great amount of detail was put into it, it's coherent, it's interesting. And best of all, voice actors did amazing job. I think they contribute greatly to the I fact I liked meeting other characters so much. I found myself slowing down the investigation just to roam around and find out more about the place I was in, see what other ghosts are doing. I even feel like I want to go back to find everything I missed.Overall, it's a great title. Good story, fun mechanics, exploration, voice acting. Now I feel bad that it took me so much time finally play it. "

												I liked the game upon the moment demons appeared in the game and it became a demon hunt and hide&seek game instead of a detective game.  This was basically the thing for me to stop playing, those demons and 'that' whole gameplay felt like it belongs in an other type of game.  Other than that the game was promising and good quality. Sadly a thumb down from me.Edit: To clarify a bit further, I didn't like the whole hide & seek thing with the demons, it changed the gameplay from the first +1 hour that I did like. It began as a cool detective story with looking for clues and observing things. When the demons becomes a part of the game it turns into a surreal horror stealth hide & seek game and it puts the whole detective lore and theme to the background. Besides that, even the 'ghost reality' is far a part from  the normal after life reality you normally see in games/movies so that demon gameplay made it lose connection to that 'detective' atmosphere for me. When I bough the game after looking on the store page and seeing the trailer I didn't expect that gameplay. I didn't refund the game and might give it an other few hours as the design and graphic quality was good, but yeah, I would have skipped this game if I knew the gameplay would be like that.			"

												n my humble opinion:Played 2-3 hours and it feels like a Point and Click, just more sophisticated. It also feel a little bit like someone is holding your hand and telling me to look behind the door or under the bed, wish was a bit more complicated or more cerebral. At one point at I was at loss because a clue was not interactable until you solved something else, and didn't thought of trying again - which is tpical of Point and Click. Personally I love Point and Click so it is not a deterent for me, it's all about the story and its twists.There isn't anything revolutionary but there is some original concepts where you you can possess someone and read their mind or influence them, demon trying to get you though so far it was really easy to defeat them and not scary a bit, I think they are scared of me at this point Now the story is intriguing and I hope will develop into something original and surprising and maybe a lil scary ? Will definitely play again tomorrow after some sleep .. oh and after work (darn).			"

												Very interesting game, you are the detective and was killed by this ""Bell Killer"", you are about to know his identity by investigating(solve the puzzles). There are also side quest you could solve, every puzzles has a good cinema/movie on it. There is also combat in the game and the demon souls of the death world are your enemies. You have to remain hidden to these ghosts in shadows before being able to pounce out behind them to kill them by pressing a few key.  Demon souls are only destruct in your path, they aren't really anything to rave about as they become very monotonous as you progress in the story.in the end, it's really disappointing•the game is short•not replayableIf you want to get all the achievements, you'll need to get it in 1 whole game straight, if you ever finished the game, you can't replay it back. You'll need make a new game and find all the objects.Buy this game only on Sale/discount.			"

												This game narrowly scraped through with a positive rating. Soul Suspect has a great aesthetic - the ethereal world interactions/ghostly events look great. There is a fair amount of freedom and exploration of Salem available but the game still feels incredibly linear. There isn't much deduction or detective work and the 'combat' serves more as a hindrance than an excitement. I still gave it a positive review because I enjoyed it enough to play through 100%, but there is zero replayability. If you're interested, I recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												An excellent game. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a story rich detective game. Your character is murdered at the start of the game, and now as a ghost he has to solve his own murder by following the trail of a serial killer.The game takes place in a dark urban setting, giving the atmosphere of danger and hopelessness the entire time. In addition to the crime mystery element, it also includes a lot of paranormal concepts, particularly relating to ghosts and mediums. The story is paced very well and does not drag out or include any filler content. Every area you visit is another jigsaw piece in the grand scheme that helps you get closer to uncovering the mystery behind the string of murders happening in town.Most of the gameplay consists of you searching around the area for clues and then putting them together to finalise on what happened. Most times it's pretty straight forward. It plays like a point & click game, but without overly convoluted puzzles. Everything you find makes logical sense. In addition to that, there are also other collectibles scattered in each level, each of which provide some information on characters or the town's lore. Some also let you uncover special hidden ghost stories, which is a nice reward, as some of those stories are pretty chilling.At times there are stealth sections where you have to avoid being seen by soul-eating demons. They add a bit of challenge to the game, but overall I was not much of a fan of these sections as they felt unneeded and often got in the way of you exploring. A lot of the time the demons would come in groups of 3 or so, meaning you'd be spending some time trying to figure out how to get past them. You can't fight them, and the only way to kill them is via an execution from behind, if you're brave enough. Gladly these sections were few and far in between. Most times you'd only come across 1-2 such sections per level. So if this aspect is putting you off, I'd still recommend to try the game, since most of the game is spent putting together the clues.Don't expect challenging gameplay or anything of that sort. This is a story-driven detective game at heart, and I think most critics who have slammed the game have missed this point.I'd highly recommend this game if you like games about solving murder mysteries or anything with a dark, gripping plot for that matter.

												Well, nearly made myself to finish it. This one started as a promising story-driven atmospheric paranormal detective about ghosts and investigation of death of your own character while actually being a ghost: walking through walls, spy on citizens, possess them and read their minds, do stuff in yout favor, collect evidence and make conclusions... Yeah, very promising. And this all also wrapped with pretty good graphics with good visual art and detail, good score and voice acting. As a fan of atmospheric story-driven games I was really looking forward to Murdered: Soul Suspect. And at the beginning it was good. But it failed for me eventually.The catch? - Dull story and mainly boring and repetitive gameplay.The story had a good potential but authors were unable to pull it off. Eventually it slipped to so trivial and dull finale, that I began to regret for my wasted time. Authors tried to fill it with the notes of Salem's history, Ronan's personal story and love tragedy, but it didn't worked, something was missing and the main story felt... shallow. The ending of the game is plain ridiculous both gameplay- and storywise.Throughout the game there is almost no progression in gameplay: after you learned how to discover things, collect evidence, solve the case, possess people, counteract the opponents - you'll do it till the end with almost no diversity or new meaningful mechanics. The investigation part is very dull and making conclusions is not particularly interesting - especially when doing it dozen of times.I know this might look silly to blame a story-driven game for lack of gameplay (it's not Dear Esther though), but we're talking about the game with also sort of 'open' locations for your discovery, where you can freely go and explore it, solve some side-quests (they are also trivial and repetitive). On the contrary, I never got bored in story-driven Spec Ops: The Line, even though it's mere third-person shooter, because of its constant progression in fascinating story, locations design, changing circumstances, obstacles and gameplay.In Murdered, besides that you can wonder around the locations doing side-quests, looking for collectibles (fun at first, become boring and useless later) or navigating your way from point A to B there are a lot of times during the second half of the game when you forced to revisit old locations and more often than not run through it from one end to another.The locations themselves are not very distinctive and did I mention you can't run through every wall? At first that part with looking your way through the labyrinth of real and paranormal walls was OK, but quickly faded since they all looks the same, same blurred bluish corridors all the time. This is an unnecessary protraction of the game - you simply getting bored and 'felling off' the game's reality and story.The enemies? Man, I wished that part of the game's 'features' never ended up in final version. It's just wrong, unnecessary, badly designed gameplaywise, and... oh, that console port QTEs... Quickly press W+RMB / D+LMB... etc.No, I don't recommend this game, because I don't want more games of such quality of game design.			"

												You play as Ronan, a freshly deceased cop who's trying to figure out his own murder. Because of this unfinished business, he gets stuck between hell and heaven, wandering in the world of living, invisible to the naked eye, only able to interact with human mediums. As you learn the ropes of this supernatural world, you start collecting clues and putting all the stuff together. The ending blew my mind, really. Some people may say it's too short for a fully priced title but I think the time was appropriate for the told story and filler missions would only ruin the ambience of certain urgency in the air. Perhaps this should have been something episodic, one murder story - one episode. But we all know that is not happening anytime soon.Murdered: Soul Suspect has an awesome story and I enjoyed uncovering the case in L.A. Noire-ish style. Playing as a ghost? Very nice, not a common thing in games. Possesing people, reading minds, communicating with mediums? Sounds awesome, seems like these devs are taking the ghost business seriously. Being a murdered detective investigating his own murder? I'm sold.These ideas are great but something went wrong and they were kind of poorly executed. My guess is the developers either got lazy and told the janitor to put together some pieces of the game because they were busy actually working on the main storyline and side quests that really got some love. Or they were rushed by the greedy publisher, what do I know. But some details are just like whatever. Details so strong in numbers that I couldn't just ignore them after a while. For example: Reading minds of the entire city - extremely few lines that keep repeating even between different people. Musicless, slow, unskippable credits. Overdesigned main protagonists while other models are just copy pasted - even in the story, totally destroys the overall pleasant graphics. Some controls are weird, whole main menu and ""press start"" while using k+m. And a few more.Even though I needed to vent my frustration with this game in here, it was mostly because of the lost game of the year potential. (For me) I still enjoyed it. There is nothing like it on the gaming market and I very much like originality. Mixed with amazing story makes a great, underdeveloped game. I feel bad to rate it 6,9/10. I'd smack the people responsible for the lazy/rushed details.			"

												I don't know how this game has so many people liking it.It's nothing like LA Noire, everything in this game is a forced QTE, the stealth parts where you take out the demons are awful and feel out of place, and the game is just all around boring.In LA Noire, I felt like I was actually solving crimes and interacting with the evidence and finding out who had done the deed. In this game, it's all done for you. All you have to do is press E and it will go to some cinematic crap and just put it down in your ghost journal which will fill up with crap you will never care about and utterly just be a cluttered mess of writings about stuff not pertaining to the fedora man at all. The console port is just awful, it's so hard to control the UI and the camera when hiding from the demons will ♥♥♥♥ you up and utterly get you killed, and oh god, the demon fighting is just horrible, absolutely horrible.1/10 for fedorasPlease, do yourself a favor and save your fifty dollars.

												THIS is what's wrong with the industry. Reviewers and websites want to insure business, They do that by ""pleasing"" the majority, and they do that by guessing what the majority would and wouldnt like and let that bias affect their own review of the games. This works sadly. But that is also why many who would enjoy a game such as Murdered Soul Suspect won't even try it. Sad reality.This game doesnt have ""action"" it doesnt have shooting, stealing cars, and destruction. And it is better for it. In its own genre and taken as a separate entity, this game shines.It is a mix of old school adventure atmosphere, smartass detective work, it is slow but it is great. The Story keeps you interested, the acting is top notch, the relationship between the main character and his partner is akin that of Booker and Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite. This game is fun and funny, ok in some areas and amazing in others. It is a relaxing experience, and one that should be experienced. You'll feel like you are watching Ghost (the Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze flick) at times, at others it'll be a Tex Murphy experience.It is a fun and enjoyable experience, I am more than glad I bought this game, and if this genre is your cup of tea, you will be quite glad you had this adventure. You can't beat possessing poeple and reading their thoughts.Buy this game and enjoy it, if you have your doubts, wait for a sale. But don't miss it.			"

												Oh dear, I'm dead - pretty much the main mechanic of the game.  MURDERED: Soul Suspect starts out with the death of the main character who goes by the name of Ronan, a local Detective investigating a murder. It's not the most unique premise out there, but it handles it in such a way that makes it intriguing, but can ultimately fall a little short thanks to the way the game itself is structured. A Clean Cut GhostWhile Ronan and the other main characters look pretty good and the environments themselves look pretty top notch, I can't really say the same for the NPCs. I noticed they re used qutite a LOT of NPCs without as much as trying to hide it somehow, which can definately break the immersion this game tries to set in with it's dark and drab setting. The lighting is top notch also, and really helps give the game the sense that you're in some ghostly world in an already dark setting.The environments, as stated above, look very nice and I really like how they themselves tell their own stories because of the way the game places just random objects in an area. You can have, for example, a train inside a museum to let the player know that in the past, where the museum stands now used to be a regularly used train track and the game's chock full of little things like that, as well as it uses flat and ghostly images that sorta just fade out as you get closer to them to help accentuate that you are indeed in a ghost world. It's really good. Even greatly influencing the atmosphere the game has, is it's sound design. You can occasionally hear ghostly wails in the backgrounds, and the game is very light on music, only really playing it during tense moments like when there are Demons around, it knows when and when not to play music and it handles it pretty well. Voice acting is pretty par for the course, Ronan and the main characters sound decent, but some of the VA's for the NPCs can be pretty hit or miss. Solving the Case   Murdered: Soul Suspect  is pretty much a glorified adventure game. The very linear structure the game has is done to help accentuate the story, making it feel actually more like a 3D Visual Novel than an Adventure game. The game is pretty much divided up by ""stage"" sections and an overworld (The Town). Each ""Stage"" has it's own set of collectibles that, once fully completed, gives you insight into a usually very dark and grim backstory into those items you collect as well as having it's own story section and more in general collectibles. What can feel detrimental to the game's pacing, is the way each stage is handled. It always ends up being a straight up Move from Point A to Point B sort of ordeal while exploring through every nook and cranny to find collectibles. As far as mechanics go, the game can sometimes feel a little messy since there's no map to indicate an overall layout of the area you're in, thankfully, no one area looks exactly like another so it's usually easy to tell when you're going the wrong way - you can also walk through certain walls, and railings on stairs but not all of them. You can also posses people and read their thoughts (random NPCs) but sometimes they just end up repeating lines, other times, for story purposes, you can posses people to get over obstacles, you can posses objects to cause noises and distract NPCs and you can influence people to think about certain events by using clues. Clues are items you inspect during an ""Investigation"" phase which can be used occasionally only during said investigation, or sometimes long term throughout the whole game. That being said, the only challenge this game does bring, is some half baked stealth sections involving ""demons"", creatures that live to suck out a spirit's soul and re-kill them I guess? These sections can be very tense thanks to the musical cues and the great wails they tend to do, but they merely serve to give the game padding and often can break up the pace of the story. The demons are also never used in any meaningful way to complement the story.   Murdered is a pretty fun and short adventure game that can clock you in anywhere from 4-12 hours depending on how much you decide to focus on collectibles. There's no real punishing methods the game uses outside of demons catching you, it has a fairly uneven pace that can otherwise dull a pretty nice Murder thriller story. Pros + Amazing atmosphere   + Great sound design accentuates further the atmosphere  + Decent Voice Work + Interesting and fun story  + Fun mechanics that makes you feel like a ghost.Cons - Uneven Pacing  -  Game is on the short side, story alone clocks in at about 4 hours or so  - Repeated use of NPC models can break immersion.  -Demons serve no purpose to the story and are used as padding.Overall, if you can pick this game up at a decent price range, it's definately worth a playthrough if you enjoy Murder/Crime Thrillers, outside of that, this has very limited appeal.

												It's linear mystery, horor, detective, hidden object game with no decision making and with some frustrating controls at times. What you are doing most of the time is running around and collecting things and stuff. Then you move to new location and start over again. Pros: - voice overs- semi interesting story- it's short- lot of collectibles if that is your thing- there is one likable characterCons:- controls (bad object targeting)- stealth passages- detective work has no impact- there is not much of the gameIt is not a bad game, but you miss nothing by not playing this one.

												I have been looking forward to this game since it showed up at E3...In which i honestly say it was not worth the wait or the money. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game with 33/48 achievements when i was not even trying to. keeping things short, the only major flaws would be that investigating can become a ""click on everything"" moment due to it being difficult at times to tell if something is useable or a pointless object, and the gameplay gets incredibly repetitive after a while and feels like it was added to keep players busy.....Also, the big ""twist"" to the end of the game wasn't a very good one, so please consider waiting for it to drop in price before a purchase.

												Seeing as how the only 2 options here are ""Would Reccomend"" or ""Would Not Reccomend"", I will give it a thumbs up, but whether or not I would recommend this game to you really depends on who you are and, more importantly, what you are looking to get out of a video game.Are you looking for a challenge?- This game isn't for you.Are you looking to shoot some bad guys?- Nope, keep looking.Are you looking for action of any kind?- May want to skip this one.Are you looking for something story-heavy?- Getting closer.Are you looking for a mystery with some twists and turns along the way?- You can definitely scratch that itch here.Are you looking for a game that is basically a movie that you are more involved in?- Ding!  Ding!  Ding!  You found it!This is a lot like a Telltale game, but with less dialouge.  Its basically an interactive story.  Think of it like Heavy Rain with a supernatural twist.  The story itself is really not bad, and the ending was, in my opinion, pretty clever.  There are definitely worse ways to spend 6 hours.7/10P.S. - Don't go into this expecting something as good as Heavy Rain.  I really enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect, but Heavy Rain is a hard act to follow.			"

												There are many flaws with this game, still I quite enjoyed it (at a discount purchase).- There are way too many collectibles (nearing 200). You need to collect a random number of things to unlock a story (e.g. 14 chainsaws). That's way too many and after collecting the necessary collectibles in the first section of the game I never did it again.- Sometimes you need to collect clues and the prompt for them are very precise. You need to angle the camera in just the right way which is very annoying for a game that's focused on that.- You need to battle demons in this game. It's by far the worst part which consists of teleporting between safe spots and trying to sneak up behind them. When I had the opportunity, I just ran by them to enter the next section.- It can be hard to find your way. This is partially because you can just walk through walls which is disorientating. At a later point in the game you learn to teleport which makes it even worse.- There are stealth section in this way where you need to guide your human partner while distracting guards by ringing the phone and other poltergeisty stuff. I didn't mind this is as much since it's easy and you don't seem to be able to fail (which I consider a good thing).- You sometimes posses a cat and run through vents because... you're in Salem?- There are (near) instant death traps and you die so incredibly fast, it's kindof funny? They just consist of black spots on the ground and are easily avoidable.I enjoyed this game the best when I ignored the side stuff and just focused on the main case where you're trying to solve your own murder. I bypassed the demon battle sections as best I could. The cat scenes were ok but unnecessary. The stealth sections where you guide your partner was kindof fun. The main meat was the investigation stuff where you collect clues and try to figure out what precisely happened at the crime scene. I completed this game in 5 hours which is probably not worth it at full price but it was for me and I found that the story didn't drag.Go buy it in a sale!			"

												Ronan is a criminal-turned-cop who is killed by the mysterious Bell Killer. Playing as Ronan's ghost, investigate a series of crime scenes (sometimes with the help of teenage medium Joy), searching for identity of the killer. Many supernatural elements come into play – ghosts, witches, demons – and some  flashbacks of the witch trials are pretty gruesome (drowning, burning, hanging). As the investigation progresses, you'll explore a graveyard, an apartment house, an old mansion, a police station and of course the obligatory asylum level. While the game world is small, it is open, with the ability to just wander around the town of Salem. It's a gloomy place – the game occurs entirely at night – but is well-dotted with NPCs and collectibles. Obtaining collectibles can unlock other stories (usually brief, narrated cut-scenes), and some NPCs will provide side-missions. There's a decent amount of stuff to do, but most collectibles were easily found as I explored the town or a level. Investigations require exploring a a crime scene, finding evidence (“Press E to analyze”) and sorting through the collected evidence (“Press Q to conclude the investigation”). Walking (or later, teleporting) around as a ghost feels fun;  Ronan can walk through walls, possess people (mind-reading), and turn on random stuff to mess with the townsfolk (poltergeisting). Especially cool were the impenetrable “ghost walls” from past times that can block Ronan from exploring – or even provide new hazards (watch out for the ghost train!). Oh, and you can possess cats, too. This is actually crucial to progress through several stages of the game.The demon sections, though, dragged the experience down a bit. Demons will sometimes spawn after completing an investigation. Their existence does have a crucial part to play, and they're easy enough to defeat with a little patience. Given that this is a supernatural tale, it would be rather weird if demons of some kind weren't in the game, and having some stealth sections added some variety to the gameplay.  But after a while the demons became annoying distractions from the story.And the narrative is where Murdered: Soul Suspect stands strongest. There is a lot of backstory to be found about Ronan and his wife (via collectibles). Sometimes collectibles are merely annoying, but they are worth pursuing here. Jason Brooks (as Ronan) and Cassidy Lehrman (as the medium, Joy) provide stand-out vocal performances. The graphics (Unreal 3) are great – murky and dark. Jason Graves' score provides a classic horror-story undertone. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a well-crafted detective game with a few quirks that holds its story aloft as its best attribute. If that sounds good to you, then go ahead and get this one.			"

												I will try to make this review as short as possible, and list a few pros and cons.You play as Ronan O'Connor, an ex-convict that found love and got married to a police officers sister, Julia. Which got his reputation cleared  criminal records hidden  and allowed him to be accepted into law enforcement. Shortly after Ronan marries Julia, she attempts to stop an argument between two men that didn't end too well, she got stabbed by one and dies in Ronan's arms. Shortly after Ronan loses his cool and basically turns into Batman.  He goes in alone and tries to stop the Bell Killer, but is quickly over powered, thrown out of a window, then shot seven times.  now you are now stuck in limbo and have to find out whom killed you before you can go into the vast world beyond. This is where your story begins.Pros. Great voice acting, almost no loading screens (I only got 3 during my whole play through.), a great cinematic story (7 hours of gameplay for most users), a very pretty game. Graphics don't always matter, but I still have to throw this in.Cons. Almost no real fighting in this game.  The Demons are too easy. , very linear story, little to no replay value, cliffhanger ending. I never liked them.TLDR. It's a great game, if you like playing a cinematic story. The $20 price tag may actually be worth it, but I always go for game when they are on sale or in a bundle. Got this little gem in Humble Bundle myself.			"

												MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT is not a bad game & not really THE BEST game either. The characters & voice acting are great/impressive. The story were actually good & mind blowing, but what ruining it is the ending made no sense.Like this guy said on a story discussion : *WARNING SPOILER ALERT* ""If abigail can possess and control anyone, why didn't she simply possess the father in the church to kill/capture joy the moment ronan led her to her? (she was following him probably the whole game as seen in one scene) or when she was interrogated in the police station? or when joy was sneaking through the police station or mental hospital, there were so many cops or nurses which abigail could have instantly possessed to finish the job (as seen with the 2 poor cops at the end of the game)or when she can summon these demon hands at any time, why didn't she finish ronan earlier?""   source [www.playstationtrophies.org] This games have so much potential with their unique atmosphere & the devs should've add more things to make it perfect/complete but too bad they didn't add too much things. (this is the reason why it's not really THE BEST game) The combat system is too simple. Bugs/Glitch can occur everywhere & anytime. But in the end, I still enjoyed it & I'm glad I played this game.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is supernatural detective adventure thriller game where you are playing as detective Ronan. He got murdered by a Bell Killer a primary antagonist and now he need to solve his case as a ghost.Pros:+ Great main character, Ronan is really likable and unique.+ Voice acting is really good+ Enjoyable graphics, as long as you play with V-sync+ Good story and atmoshpere+ Lots of collectibles + As a ghost you can walk through walls, read people's minds etc.Cons:- Short (main story for around 6 hours)- Combat is poor, if you can even call that combat (you basically sneak behind the enemy and do fast QTE) - Only one type of enemy- Most of NPC's are just clones/duplicates- Only 4 optional quests ( to finish them you need like 5-10 mins each)Maybe they're expecting it to be a fast-paced action game or something like that which it definitely isn't. It's a detective game with an interesting story and characters that draws you in. It's also pretty novel in that you're playing a criminal-turned-detective's ghost who's trying to find the identity of his killer. You spend the game collecting clues to figure out your killer's identity while stopping along the way to help out other lost souls in little sidequests where you figure out how they died so they can pass on. There are also lots of collectibles, some of which provide background for the story, such as notes left by the main character's wife, or that unlock stories about unsolved crimes connected to hauntings. The mood the game sets just enhances the experience, being creepy and immersive.Overall, this game is a lot of fun. Story is great, voice acting is well done. The story is a pretty good detective tale, with everything falling satisfyingly into place at the end and a few neat twists. There are only a few drawbacks: sometimes when you posess someone and listen to their thoughts you'll hear the same thought in different people; the parts where you have to sneak behind demons and take them out can be a bit tedious. There's a lot of repitition and it seems like they re-used a lot of stuff.The other drawback is that the game is a bit short. I finished it in 7 hours, and if you check out my achievements you'll see I didn't get 100% completion. I did all the side-quests and found as many collectibles as I could. You could probably stretch it out to 10 hours if you wanted 100% completion which seems totally possible in a single playthrough.In short, if you like story-driven games, or mystery/adventure games then you'll probably like this game. If you want this game to be a gritty shooter, then go buy Max Payne instead, because you won't get that with this game.TL;DR: 6.5/10, fun detective story, don't expect a lot of combat/action, very short.

												Despite an interesting premise and a promising start, Soul Suspect suffers from some significant problems.The game is good at setting an atmosphere and the lead characters background is interesting - if a little hard to belive.It struggles, however, when trying to be a computer game.  The puzzles are interesting, but their internal logic is inconsistant - you end up having to think like the designer.  Unfortunately, it's obvious that each of the puzzles had a different writer each time, meaning that every time you approach a problem it's sometimes hard to know what it is that is being asked of you.  This is a problem as the game has a rating system that punishes you if any mistakes are made.  The punishment is only the loss of a points on a system that doesnt seem to have any real bearing upon the game at large, but it is irritating to feel that failure is more due to an inconsistant mechanic than a mistake.The worst aspect of the game is undoubtably the action sequences involving the hunting or avoiding of deadly shades, trapped between the our world and the next.  Sound intersting? In practice, it's not.Unfortunately, these sections feel rushed; a knee-jerk attempt at introducing some action into the otherwise slow pace of the game.Not a bad idea in principle, but the problem is that these fights vary little from the start of the game to the end.  The shades don't do anything other than follow very short, pre-set paths which occasionaly pass something that may be used to distract them.  The ""challenge"" comes from the fact that as the game progresses increasing numbers are put in your path - not exactly imaginative. Mistakes result in dashing about trying to hide from the shades that hunt you more aggressively, which would make these sequences more exiting, execpt that some areas seem to lack an appropriate number of places to hide.  This leads to you dashing between the few available, never quite caught but still unable to shake the shades off.  In the end it becomes nessecery to let the shades catch you, just so you get the opportunity to try again from the start.I  would often find myself wishing that I skip these sections so I could get back to the story, which is far more interesting.  If - of course - you ignore the feeling that the check-list of horror settings is being almost audibly ticked as you progress from graveyard to asylum to church, etc.It's worth a go if you see a deep, deeeep, discount on it but I wouldn't recommend it at any other time, the feeling that the game is constructed of hedged bets is just too prevelent.

												I am recommending this game as I personally like it. I will give my reader a huge WARNING before purchasing : the game play isn't super immerse, it's more the genre of the game. The controls/abilities are a bit limited. The game itself, however is comparable to a beautiful painting. Murdered : Soul Suspect follows a detective who was pushed out of a window and then shot repeatedly as he was trying to get up. The (bell tower) killer is an unknown assailant who has been attacking random individuals. After being shot, the detective is now a ghost and has to figure out why he's still roaming the Earth and hasn't passed on.You are in third person view of Ronan (the detective) and have identical controls/movements (not actions though) to Hitman Absolution. What is probably the most outstanding feature in the game is the fact you can walk through walls. Of course, you cannot walk through any wall you wish. This will be made obvious with a solid white fill on a few walls or other ""ghostly"" objects will appear that will not let you pass. None the less, something completely different I have never been able to do in any game I've played yet. The combat is quite minimal. I should add if you are looking for a cop fighting action game, this isn't it. The most you'll be able to do is pull lost souls from demons that roam nearby areas. Demons are to be approached from behind when they cannot see you and soul extraction happens when you press RT. Again, not much to it but there is a rush associated with it. If you are seen, you will be chased and killed. You may hide in ""ghost remnants"" (small ghost cracks in levels) and can fast travel to each one in an attempt to evade the demon. There will be other obstacles in your way such as demon traps in which you require to possess a person while they walk across it. Being a ghost, you are able to possess literally anyone. NPC's will have general thoughts you can read while certain characters (usually for missions), you're able to ""peek"" (see what they're seeing) or ""influence"" (use a clue to job their memory in an attempt to force an action). They made jumping/possessing person to person quite easy to do. The game even goes as far as allowing you to posses a cat (with a purpose of course). Over time you will acquire new skills such as teleportation, poltergeist (setting a printer or phone off) and detect mode which lets you see through walls. You may also run in game but you do not have the ability to crouch or jump. Most of the time you will be free roaming until you come across a crime scene. Once in investigation mode, you will be looking around for clues and sometimes need to hit RT to reveal the complete evidence. Often times than not, you will need to find certain clues in order to find other clues (meaning intervention or possessing others to get a complete answer). Once you think you've found enough, you can conclude your investigation with the clues you've found. The game basically follows one crime scene to another and in between there are small side quests. Doesn't really sound appealing (which I'm sure is why people don't like the game) but it appealed to this extremely picky gamer. The visuals are pretty good (not super fantastic but good). I have an AMD card and have tried to get more than 30 FPS. The graphics really resemble those of Hitman Absolution. They do have a lot of symbols and ghost writing that does pop up which enriches the environment. The sounds are suitable to the environment the game provides. It's not super over the top but I would assume it's hard to imagine what a demon would sound like. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I think it's cool to play through but leaves the player with no replayability. I got this game on extreme sale in a bundle. I would say it was worth it for what I paid. I would highly recommend people do their homework before buying such a game. I like to play it, you may not due to it's lack of actual gameplay activity. RATING : 7/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign A- Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C- Overall  C+ScreenShots :  If you didn't believe me about the cat thing Common sense questions will come up in which you'll have to be able to connect the dots Something oddly satisfying walking through walls What a cinematic looks like  Having a short term memory will bite you in the bum  Just like in Hitman Absolution, you can press a button to see through walls and avoid danger  Me attempting to execute a demon and save a soul  "

												Ronan a criminal turned cop dies and becomes a ghost. Now he must figure out who his killer is with the help of a young girl, and the abilities to investigate crimes and possess people. He can't move on until he finds out truth....This is a really fun horror game without the jump scares. It does have a creepy atmosphere, but there's nothing particularlly scary about it. I loved how the invesitgations are set up, how you can search for clues, and I love possessing people to hear their thoughts. If you gather enough clues you can even hear ""ghost"" stories, and even help fellow ghosts. The stories are well written and thought of. I don't usually like going around collecting items, but I didn't mind in this game so much. The only thing I would possibly change in the game is the annoying demons that you have to avoid and banish. I realize that most people like their games to be challlenging but I hate ""stalking"" my enemy waiting for the perfect moment, only to foil it and have to restart from the latest checkpoint. Overall, the game was entertaining, medium length, and well written. Investigations are fun and not too difficult. Its more of a good storyline game above all else.			"

Putting clues together to find out what has happened was really enjoyable.Great & Mysterious atmosphere. It is really good to wander around a silent town full of urban legends in the midnight and search for clues & learn about the horrible history behind it. Various locations to search, speaking to ghosts that are like you & listening to their stories was really really good.I also found out that if you become a ghost, your cigarette won't run out =)Tattoed Man, Salem, Joy, Demons, Cemetery / 10			"

												The game is good, worth a shot, but still hardly worth the full price considering that the main story can be completed in about 7 hours. Yeah, there are side quests, but there's little motivation for anyone to waste time trying to complete them, except maybe for achievement hunters, since they're not connected to the main story too closely. Since the combat, the action part of the gameplay is very simplistic (just attack the enemy from behind and press some key combinations), the exploration part could've saved the day if it weren't just as simplistic as well. Anyway, if you're like me and care more for a good story than sophisticated gameplay, Murdered: Soul Suspect will be a nice experience.Pros:- the story is complex and captivating, the ending is pretty unexpected- the visuals are nice- good voice acting- interesting characters- nice noir/dark atmosphere- interesting basic concept (some kind of ""walking dead"" but not the ""usual"" kind of ""walking deads"" :)  you die right in the start and then just play as a ghost  )Cons:- kinda short- the gameplay is quite simplistic, in terms of both fighting and exploring- there's only one type of enemy to fight- horror is hardly a good keyword to describe it, there's pretty much nothing scary about it- the full price doesn't seem very reasonable considering the gameplay's length			"

WARNING!Avoid it if you're looking for a game.Get it if you're looking for a visual detective/supernatural book. This game is heavily story driven. It's so story driven that you can't even call it an adventure game!Monkey Island has more gameplay in it than this game.All you do is walk around and press X where needed (I use an Xbox 360 controller). It's not a third-person action/adventure game or hell, it isn't even a ""detective"" game like L.A Noire (another epic game) is.Nope, in here you just walk around and press X. You don't solve puzzles, you don't shoot, you don't...you don't do anything but walking, really. It has an ""open world"" sandbox city that you're free to roam but there's nothing to do in it. Sometimes you stumble on a collectible and press X. That's all there is to it. The minimap shows you where you need to go in order to ""progress"" in the game and well, just walk on over there and you get a new cutscene.Other games that lack in gameplay, such as The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, let you choose what to say or do in certain situations. This adds some replay value to both games.However, the story in this game is linear and you can't make any choices. No choices at all!So why am i recommending this game ?It has a good story! A very good story! If you don't mind watching a movie with a controller in your hand or sitting in front of your PC/laptop then this ""game"" is for you. "

												It was a bit boring in the beginning, but it gets better once the story starts to pick up. The gameplay is kind of repetitive, so you have to either be in it for the story, or you have to like the whole LA Noire crime solving thing. Overall, Fantastic game. I'd wait for a sale, though, and it'll definitely be worth your money since it's relatively short. Also, if you plan on going for 100% completion, *DO NOT LEAVE THE MUSEUM BEFORE YOU HAVE COLLECTED EVERYTHING!!* You can't backtrack there, and I ended up needing to replay the game just for the 2 collectibles I missed there.

Firstly, I have to say that this game has a great story and is the most unique one I’ve played in a long time.I never played a game where you play a ghost and the protagonist is dead from the begginging. The primary goal of him is to find his murderer and be released from his ghostly form.Secondly, the setting is pretty believable and rich in detail. There are so much innovative things I only can scratch the survface of it in my review: The trains of thought to find out the truth are pretty great depicted: There are a bunch of clues which you have to find and then you have to find the link between them by clicking the most important one or figure out the right order of events. Only game of this type I played was The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. You can posses people and read or influence their minds to get clues. You can posses cats (This is pretty cool) and climb/jump around in trees. The atmosphere is pretty dense and unique. Outstanding voice acting!!!!  Great story telling (This is no action game!).  The only action element of this game is that you get hunted by demons. This is sometime kind of intense but nothing extreme scaringThe only thing which spoils this game a bit are the darn bad technics of this game. You notice every second of playing that it’s a console porting. You can’t change the assignment of keys. For that’s unacceptable: sprinting on shift..WTF?! Another thing which bothered me is hat you can‘t disable 30 FPS lock with V-Sync enabled. So it’s either ""tearing"" or no FPS over 30! Sometimes there are some strange glitches, too. One time I was falling into nothing (see the video at the bottom), the other time there was no background sound and one time I got stuck in the menue. Only solution was restarting the game. Well, sometimes, when you go back to the desktop via Alt + Tab, the whole game just gets stuck to your screen and the only thing to do is restart....Again!All in all, a great and very unique game with some technical glitches and confounding factorsPS: Thanks to khay★jeet ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaybleet/ ) for gifting me this game!! Danke!

												-All you do is collect things, walk around and watch cutscenes. There is no combat system. You can sneak past demons in some instances and control a cat to reach certain areas which is frustrating and annoying. You can't fail solving anything because if you mess up pointing to the wrong evidence or clues the game allows you to try again until it's corrected...so what's the point on solving anything if the game does it for you?

												Despite having its flaws, Murdered: Soul Suspect is quite possibly one of the most enjoyable single-player games I've played this year.The Pros:· A unique story that feels like a combination of Silent Hill and L.A. Noire, and the beginning does a great job of introducing you to its atmosphere. · You start at the point where Ronan O'Connor (the game's protagonist, of course) starts the hunt on his murderer, the Bell Killer. This makes you feel like you know as much about the afterlife as Ronan himself does and creates a sort of connection, right from the get-go.· The town of Salem is pretty small, but its yours to explore... and it's worth exploring. Tons of side missions and collectibles can be found in Salem, and the eerie mood that constantly lingers around really immerses you into Ronan's role.· The atmosphere is incredibly unique and satisfying. The ghostly white glow around certain object make the bridge-world connect with the world of the living. Seeing the flickering souls of dead children sitting next to a swing or a dead corpse dangling from a tree by its neck is oddly disturbing and makes you feel uncomfortable, which a bridge-world should.· Pretty cool characters. Ronan is your typical rebel-turned-cop tough guy, but his tattoo's reflect his life and the sins in it, and the detail to him is quite impressive. Even though he's partially see-through (because you know, he's a ghost and stuff), the orange bullet holes give Ronan a distinctive look from the other ghosts in Salem.The Cons:· The mechanics feel a bit underused at times. As a ghost you could be able to do so much more, like possessing and controlling others for example. Sure, you can influence people and read their minds and control a cat (10/10), but it limits the player.· For a detective game, it doesn't really require too much thinking. You have to find clues and connect the dots (sometimes those dots connect in an unlogical way), and that's basically it.· The NPCs are mostly the same. Salem doesn't have many people walking its streets, but two of the same people might be sitting a few feet from each other. Plus, they have the same thoughts, which is weird. Like freaky weird.· The combat is there, but its simplistic and repetetive. You hide in lost souls, sneak up to a demon and quickly rip him apart. It's satisfying and it even feels as if you're helping those tormented souls, but it's just too much of the same.The Visuals:· Most of its atmosphere comes from the visuals. Ghostly white silhouettes and detailed environments may not look next-gen, but they're stunning none the less.Final Verdict:· Murdered: Soul Suspect sure has its flaws, but it's a unique and highly enjoyable experience and easily one of my favorites of the year. 8/10			"

												I like this game for the reason that it's a sort of interactive movie, like you're the actor running around the movie scene, being able to do whatever you want. I like the storyline, it's interesting as well as full of action. You can do side-quests, which I enjoy a lot because sometimes you're just done with the main storyline. It's also fun to help every ghost to find what  is holding them from ""the light"" and bring them there. What I don't like about this game is that there are a few bugs, where sometimes the sound doesn't play in cutscenes but it does in the rest of the game, but this is easily fixed by restarting the game. I bought this game in a Steam Sale and it is definetaly worth it's full price, and works on 60fps even on my pretty medium pc.			"

												An interesting concept, a breath of fresh air but the execution is horrible.The groundwork is good, the protagonist, the abilities...but after playing an hour you will see all of the glaring flaws.The map is small and the town is underpopulated.When you do possess people they all have the same 2-3 standard thoughts.There are only a handful of side quests in the game, where you can help other ghosts move on.It starts to feel like a collectathon as you are constantly picking up (revealing) objects on the ground. The only enemies are demons who are easily avoided or you can attack them by using a QTE....fun it is not.They are thinly spread out however so that didn't bother me so much.What did bother me considerably is the length of the game. I already finished it in under 8 hours and  to be honest with very little replay value I can't recommend you get this unless its on a big sale, think - 75% off or more.			"

												This game is fun for the first couple of hours. Over time though it slowly gets boring and you can't really do anything with your new ghost powers that really makes them fun to have. You don't even get the really cool powers tell about half way through the game. Overall I can't put into words the amount of disappointment when I finished the game. I dont feel like this game lived up to the hype it had going behind it. This game is not worth the $29.99 it is labeled at. If you find Murdered: Soul Suspect at least 75% off. Go ahead and pick it up for some short fun. Just because I did not find it to my liking doesn't mean you won't.Overall I would give it 6.5/10 - It is a good game but I think I was expecting more from it.			"

You play as a dead detective's soul and you must solve the mystery of your murder and find the killer to be able move on in other world. But story is not only about you, it's much more and the ending is really good. The biggest downside is the price. It's not worth the full price. But at 80-90% off it's a good buy.

At one point part of the storyline is hindered by a locked door, however you can simply pass through the wall and open it while the NPC still believes the door to be locked with their hands inside the door's model trying to get it open. Many issues also exist with the port to PC. I'll be honest, I am a PC gamer and haven't played this game on console, however I expect game ports to be decent. On numerous occations I found myself in one of the game's many menus and interfaces with my mouse unable to correctly interact with said menus, I then had to go keyboard-only with the arrow keys to navigate and exit the menus. Character animation is also a bit sub-par, especially when characters are talking. Unfortunately all of the bugs and glitches I've noticed could have been fixed with patches yet have not been.If you insist on playing this game I highly recommend a gamepad.			"

												Good game. I liked it. Specially the environment, the surroundings. Some side missions could have really helped the game to move forward. But not a good amount of side quests. But really you will like the game for sure. A bit different game. Would recommend.			"

												It's closer to the visual novel rather than the adventure, but it's ok and setting is pretty neat.It's the rarest example of the game i realy wished to finish lately.Detective mechanics are undeveloped, but your score doesn't change anything, so you can simply retry your answer with no consequinces.Rudimental stealth takes so little time it's no obstacle to the story and has no way to grow into something complex.The story's good, the world's neat, it's a good time killer. The only drawback is you can't return to the finished areas to huntdown achievements.			"

												Good game. Interesting plot, dark settings and environment surrounding you all the time. Some puzzles, investigation, mystery, charismatic characters,... However it might have a lack of challenges.  This is a game to have fun playing the role of a detective's ghost trying to solve his own murdered. You will enjoy it.			"

												I will premise this by saying that I have beaten the game and have all of the achievements completed. The metascore has you doubting, doesn't it? Well, don't let it. This game has some good and some bad, but the good wins in the end. First thing's first. Play this with a controller. I started this game with my keyboard/mouse and I immediately hated this game. The controls are a joke. The FOV is WAY too sensitive (even after changing settings). I was almost ready to give up on this game when I decided to try my Xbox controller. This choice saved the game for me. The Bad- Crappy save system. You can browse the discussion boards and find people have issues with the autosave. You can't make your own save and have to rely on it... trouble is, it's not that reliable. (you can however copy the save file from your steam folder. You have to look up how though. I think it's titled 233290. So it's a random number, not a name)- Limited action. This game is a walk around and talk to people and find clues game. There is only one type of monster (demon) and you have to sneak up behind him to banish him. So it's all about timing. I think there are probably less than 20 of them in this entire game. - Collectables. There are a lot of clues to find. Some are necessary, some aren't. The necessary ones will be located in a limited area, so you can eventually find them. The other collectables are scattered around and you have to find them. This is going to either be great because you love these kinds of things or frustrating because some of them are hard to find. Each one tells a little bit more about the story and it's characters.  The Good- Cutscenes. There are a lot of them, and I found them to be good. I know some folks hate games with lots of cutscenes. If that's you, look elsewhere. - Story. I really enjoyed the story. It's a dark mystery that you just can't help but want to solve. I felt the characters were engaging. They felt real and their struggles were believable. - Easy achievements. You will get most of the achievements without trying. There are some for collections too. Those ones I used a video walkthrough to help me find them all. - Simple investigations. So your job is to get clues and solve a mystery. This isn't the kind of game where the answer makes little sense. You collect as many clues as you can find and pick the answers based on them. You can solve a mystery without finding all the clues, but I recommend you find them all. - Time. This game didn't take long to complete and to get all of the achievements. Overall, I would recommend adding this to your wishlist. It's a really good game as long as you know what you are getting into. If you want an action packed game, this isn't for you. If you want to sit back, relax, and listen to a really cool story -- this game will be perfect.			"

												You can play a cat! ...For that matter alone the metacritic score is a joke. ...The storyline is thrilling, it feels a bit like The Darkness. The charcters are expressive, especially the main character and his companion are likeable which is comparable to The Last Of Us. The Settings of the different places deliver a good variety and some of them remind me of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and some of them of Alan Wake. The cases are exciting but the way you solve them is just as repetetive as in L.A. Noire.Its really one of the best games i played in a long time (e.g. i prefer it to Bioshock 2, which i played right before) and it's definitely not too short if you explore the town and absorb all the stories and sidequests. And its also remarkable that you don't fire a single bullet in this game and you don't even miss it and realize that good games don't need to be about killing thousands of wretches.			"

												Murdered is a detective game with unique gameplay ideas such as the ability to walk through most objects. It's set in Salem, which is the American city known for its brutal witch trials, and this historical aspect is fully incorporated into the game.The script writer clearly has done a great job because the game has you hooked until the very end, making you want to figure out what's to happen. The main characters are explored in depth throughout the game, with their stories and relationships being interesting and relatable, which can easily allow you to establish an emotional connection to them and even make you tear up. The good voice acting definitely contributes to that as well.There are some genuine horror elements to this game, although it's mostly about exploration in the dark, noir, relatively small but detailed world with a lot of paranormal elements.

												This is a great game. As per usual, the crappy port from console tends to hamper the gameplay (damn you ubi/enix). If you are alright with paranormal themes and a L.A.NOIRE-esk detective game -- then you're going to enjoy this one. I've played about 1 hour and I find it fascinating and interesting both from the story's perspective and it's got me thinking about the afterlife in a logical and interesting way - it's neat.I encountered a glitch, my character walks / shudders at half/quarter speed as if he's walking in slow motion. He runs normal with L.Shift but goes back to painfully slow without it. I'm about to restart the game and see if it's fixed.So far I'd give this game 6.3 / 10Story                               7 / 10Mood/Emotion                6 / 10Graphics                          6 / 10Sound                             8 / 10Gameplay Mechanics      7 / 10Technical Mechanics       4 / 10 *glitchy movements			"

Posted: July 11, 2016
												""Killerman is Killerman""MURDERED: Soul Suspect is the Square-Enix murder mystery blockbuster that you never knew you needed in your life. Or afterlife. Whatever.I'm writing this after just having finished the main storyline. I'll admit I didn't grab all of the many, MANY collectibles in the game, nor did I ace every investigation with full badge power, whatever that's even supposed to mean (it was never made clear by the game as to what exactly those badges represented, if anything), so maybe I didn't get the full experience from this title. However, I'd like to make a few notes on what little I did have the pleasure of going through.Much as I'd like to ramble on at length about specific instances ingame, I do think it's poor form to spoil what passes for a plotline in this game... So I'll try and keep this as general as possible.The investigative portions of the game are awful.The stealth/combat sections that break up the investigative portions are also awful.The interrims between major investigations, where you wander around town picking up collectibles and taking on side missions, are probably the most fun... But, ultimately, still awful.No, really. Investigations are broken up into two main parts, one being ""pixel hunt around the room for CLUES(tm) that are either lying on the floor or on top of a table"", and the other being ""poke inside someone's brain with the correct CLUE(tm) so that they give you the last CLUE(tm) you need to open up the next area"".Pixelhunting is pixelhunting, and for the most part it's pretty tame. The game's nice enough to not require you to find every piece of evidence in a scene before coming to the correct conclusion, but it's also sneaky enough to WITHHOLD further evidence from you until you make a kind of halfway-conclusion. If this sounds confusing, good.It's the parts where you possess someone and try to kick their memory into gear that things get truly miserable, because I made the dreadful mistake of trying to be clever and think of actual clues, evidence, or events that might stand out in someone's mind and unlock a larger memory. No, that is not relevant to an investigation. What's relevant to an investigation is squeezing into someone's head and straight up asking them ""WHO IS KILLER?"". Need to work out where the suspect went? Just activate the clue ""SUSPECT GOING SOMEWHERE"", and you'll get all the answers you need.It's not so much an exercise in deduction, so much as a quick test to see if you remember why you're in that particular room.  Failing this repeatedly doesn't seem to have any greater consequences than not unlocking some achievement, since you just keep trying things until you pick the answers that the game wants.Okay, so the investigations aren't all that great... But maybe that's all worth glossing over in the face of an intriguing and suspenseful story?No, not really. The story is laughably predictable. I spent half the game waiting for the main characters to get on my level regarding an understanding of what was going on.  There were several points where the character was making a frustrated rant about ""What does it all MEAN?"" and I just sigh heavily because he's literally just read exactly what it all means.  But, hey, I guess that's what you get from the kind of genius who carefully steps over fallen debris as an incorporeal spirit.Also, yeah, psychics are totally normal and work with the police department, our first encounter with the police force shows an officer picking up forensic evidence and wearing it on his head and the creepy standoffish ghost girl who absolutely doesn't look exactly like Wednesday Addams is TOTES INNOCENT, BRUH.Oh, right, I mentioned stealth sections... Well, they're bad. Just... Stupid. Unfun. Not even difficult, they're just tedious and blatant padding with completely inexplicable mechanics. Why can our ethereal hero Mr. Fedora McGruffinsmokes banish the zombie goasts by giving them atomic wedgies? Why are they there in the first place? What even are they? Why do you have a set number of floating ghost smears you can hide inside of by rapidly bouncing back and forth between them? These and many more questions add to the mysterious mystery of MURDERED: Soul Suspect.So, yeah. Do you like sleuthing and crimesolving? Don't get this game. Do you like stealth and/or action? Don't get this game. Compelling story that makes sense and doesn't leave half of the everything unexplained? Yeah, no.Do you like backtracking repeatedly through cramped environments to pick up a staggeringly huge number of tediously hidden collectibles filled with unrelated backstory? Well then, this might very well be just the game for you!...but even then, wait for a sale.			"

IF you ar a explorer this game have a average time play, but if you play only a story it's maybe 6h to play. Murder Soul Suspect is Simple LA Noire version with Supernatural elements with great story and graphic. Gameplay elements not for everyone, no fight in hole game only collect clues and stealth play with demons. 8/10 Thumbs Up			"

My thoughts are as follows:GOOD:Unique concept with some cool abilities - passing through walls, posession and teleportationTONS of collectibles reveal more of the characters' backgrounds as well as history of the cityDecent voice acting, characters with believable motivationsInteresing blend of spirit world into the material world.  Ghosts are a nice touch, add to atmosphereEducational - I learned a lot about Salem and its history and locations - and enjoyed learning it (gasp!)BAD:RepetitiveEasy - no difficulty setting, no incentive to replayGraphics are.... meh.  I know it's nighttime, but expect LOTS of grays, browns, and fogDEMONS! Not scary, not difficult, just.... annoying.Fairly short.  Took me longer because I was hunting down collectibles, but expect much shorter completion timesif you're just following the storyUGLY:FOR GAWDS SAKE!  Would it have hurt to include an in-game map???  So.  I liked the game, yet I can't help but feel it doesn't really live up to its potential.  Although there are some cool/unique or original mechanics, they are rare little glimmers in an overall sea of....meh.  By a small margin, I DO recommend it, but only some time down the road when it goes on sale, or as a rental (if you own a console).7/10 "

												so i just finished the game, thought i check out the user reviews and was suprised they are so positive.First off, i dont hate the game, it was entertainig. But not more then that. When the game starts a girl explains you the game mechanics and tells you you can go into every building, which is not true. you just can go into a couple that are related to the story. The investigation part is pretty fun looking around for clues. and killing demons is also pretty fun, but also very easy. Other then that you're just looking for easter eggs. and when you hit the final chapter you cant return to look for them. It's pretty easy to figure out who the killer is since there are like 5 characters. I admit they still gave me a little suprise something i didnt see coming the entire time. Finished the game in 13 hours.To some it up: I'm happy i bought this on sale. Fun game when you'rew bored, but dont spend 30 euros on it because you'll be disappointed.			"

												I don't know why the Metascore is so low, this game definitely deserves better. I have seen good metascore on games that sucked and vice versa such as in this case. And so obviously, Metascore is not a thing to be trusted.As for the game, this was a really good and intriguing game. The things you find such as books or side stories which have lots of text to read to follow up but you can skip on it, this is one of those games that made me want to read every bit of text i found. The back stories for characters were really good, the plot is fine and unique, the animation and the artstyle is spot on. The voice acting for all the characters is damn great. This was like an adventure game following a story with no action or shooting as one might maybe expect. A game with story and interaction that not even for a moment felt boring or made me want to rush through and end this.The gameplay in this consists of looking for clues and collectibles and evading demons at times while in the story, you're chasing your own killer trying to solve your own mystery from one place to another. This is a free roaming game and gives you the liberty to roam around the Salem city which is filled with collectibles and cats and other spirits whom you can help and set them free by solving their deaths.As for my recommendation, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone even mildly interested in this. This game might not appeal to everyone, certainly not to ones looking for an action/shooter. 7/10.			"

												I haven't felt the need to review for a while, but I can't help but talk about this game. For those of you who have played the Blackwell series (look at my review), I feel that Square Enix programmers played the games and thought, ""Hey, we can make a non-P&C, grittier, updated graphics version of Blackwell!"". In some respects, it really feels that way. A ghost needs to solve his own murder, plus help lost ghosts solve their issues so that they can move on with the help of a medium. Only instead of Roseangela we get a whiny teenager by the name of Joy. The crime solving isn't that difficult, but when the story is this enjoyable who really cares? The game takes place in Salem, and I feel that the town is one of the big stars of the game. The developers knew they had a lot to work with and they did a great job. You get to discover artifacts that uncover Salem's dark history, uncover artifacts that reveal haunting stories, and help ghosts piece together their untimely end. The main characters are a mixed bag. Ronan, is a detective who spent most of his life on the wrong side of Lady Law before joining the force. He's a great character. His sidekick is a gothic emo of a teenager named Joy. I see why they think she needs to be here, but I just didn't like her that much. Luckily, she only appears as much as she needs to, leaving you free to take your time between levels to explore Salem and backtrack for achievements or artifacts if need be. For you artifact and achievement junkies, there is a ton to find. Most will be able to find a lot of the stuff, in the first playthrough, but it is worth playing again. I highly recommend this supernatural detective game.			"

												It's like watching an episode of CSI (minus the puns) except you're the smart♥♥♥♥♥peicing things together. It's pretty fun and the entire enviroment is filled with scary stories. Finding collectables is easy and upon completion of a set you get a decent horror story narated to you. Which is the kind of vibe the entire game has, horror. But not scary horror, more like classic horror.It's an extremely easy game, ""combat"" is just pushing the right button to kill an enemy that only floats back and forth. Gamepley is heavily based on looking for clues and picking out which ones are the most important. Which is refreshing because solving the mysteries requires a type of thinking that I haven't seen in any other game.Extremely well made, but too short for its price when it doesn't really hold much of a replayability value. I would reccomend it as a $25 dollar game, maybe $30 but not at $50. I was fortunate enough to get it as a gift.10/10 GameplayUnique puzzle playEasy as MarioEnjoyed myselfTL;DR: You're an invisble man that can run through walls but no one is ever naked.			"

												Wonderful game! A great story, good plot, decent acting and pretty graphics add up here nicely! The game is a bit short (about 8-10 hours finishing most things). Combat, if you can call it that, is a bit odd but very unique. An in-game map would be nice. And the system specs are GROSSLY overstated. I played this game maxed out on my laptop with an AMD A10 5750 APU (2.5GHz quadcore) with a 2GB Radeon 8970M and an Xbox controller on my 55"" HDTV. All things considered, if you are more about story and less about action this game is excellent. Take your time and explore. Experience the stories and histories. Sadly, having said all that, I can not in good concience recommend this game at $50. It's WAY too short. But if you find this gem on sale or at a reduced price ($25 or less imho), then snag it! I promise you, you won't regret it ;-)			"

												Loved, loved, loved the game... You run around solving different aspects of a serial killers murders, and along the way you collect items, for little side stories, on your own account... Sometimes it is not always obvious, how to solve some of the problems, but for the most part, if you follow the story and read the clues, it's quite logical... One part, I was not too fond of, myself, was the demons you have to fight... Mostly because I panic, and press the wrong buttons, and then I have to do the whole thing all over again... And cause they freak me out! I'm a panicky person, so the whole fighting/stressful aspect of that did not really tickle my fancy... The map you're running around on, is not that big, to be honest, but because you can run through walls, and into every little nook and cranny, the world just seems so much bigger... And of course there are the cats, that also helps make it bigger... (When you play it, it will make sense) Story wise, it was a good story... Sometimes a little predictable, but when it was important, it wasn't... Or maybe my story predicting skills failed me for once... In all accounts... Great game... I loved it...			"

												This was a very good game. I didn't know what to expect, but I enjoyed the story.Graphics were good. There are some low res textures here and there, but overall I'm happy.Voice acting was superb imo, both main characters were well done.There were plenty of collectibles scattered, gave me stuff to do and look for. The story itself isn't that long, but the added collectibles did add to the playtime and back story.Very simple gameplay. Killing demons was okay, seemed out of place though. Finding clues sometimes became annoying.In regards to the final boss fight, it was more annoying than anything. I didn't expect anything grand, but meh.Not sure if it's worth $30, I got about 10 hours of solid playtime. But a good purchase.			"

												I got this game when it was 1st released, completed it and then didn't play it for nearly 2 years.. Until now, on my second play through I really enjoyed it.. Again. As people have said the puzzles aren't difficult but I think that's the point, you search the crime scene for clues and then piece them together, plus there's no punishment for getting them wrong either, you can just try again, so it just makes a good casual play through.The developers did a very good job with this game, I was hoping for a second, but I doubt that will happen now, with the company gone and all, unless another developer gets the rights to it.I would recommend this game (perhaps when it's on sale, if your not sure) although I had no problem paying full price for this, and maybe not everyone will play it again, but after reading some positive and negative reviews I thought I would, IMO the second play through was better than the 1st!

												This is a game that needs to be approached with the right mindset in order to be fully and properly understood. Murdered is an interactive movie with a story straight out of the best 90's b-reel supernatural horror flicks that dominated the video store of an era long bygone. The challenge level is extremely low but the mood and nighttime atmosphere the game evokes are hard to deny. Destined for Steam Sale must-buy status, Murdered is a game that will engage you and take you back to a simpler time, even as it celebrates its b-movie heritage and paper-thin actual gameplay.			"

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- Original idea, hooray. The idea behind this game is totally unique and works pretty well. You play a ghost and you solve murders and eventually yours with other things along the way.- Good solid storyline which is easily transferable to a decent horror movie.- Collectables everywhere.- Nice dark supernatural style to the game.- Cool demonic enemies which look as if they're inspired by the Azkaban guards from Harry Potter.- Ghosting through walls and the use of shadows in the environment is pretty well done.CONS:- That ending, what a disappointment. In terms of story it's fine but the gameplay for the final level is just pointless.- Gameplay overall just lacks something, I mean the combat is a little lame and became a chore having to evade demons and its a little quick timed in a way.- Detective? Okay so clue finding isn't as good as it should be. You uncover shadows, look at objects which just describe what they are and then he tells you what's happened. Sometimes it's okay cause you have to link to a past clue using initiative but it's far too easy! - Possession isn't utilized well enough, you can occasionally influence people to uncover something or use them to move, or peek at things but this is too few. Most of the time you listen to absolutely pointless thoughts which are uninteresting, irrelevant and sometimes repeated.- Graphics, not sure if I think they're up to AAA scratch. Whilst it's a good port this is no biggie.- Too short with no replayability. Yet it can be found cheap.VERDICT? Decent game if you enjoy mystery games like me, I enjoyed the story, game play is easy and not too thought provoking so suits a casual gamer but this game could have been a lot better for sure.			"

												A really fun adventure game where you chase a notorious killer through Salem, but have many side-missions where you help ghosts move on by revealing what happened to them and why they were dead. Ontop of that, the collectables you find reveal horror stories based around Salem and they are VERY creepy and sound like real horror stories with the first one with the water boilers sounds similar to a real creepy story I heard about recently.The detective parts are somewhat irritating with what peice of evidence contributes to being ""Most Relevent"" and some it feels like ""Duh"" much like the main story where half-way through I already realised what the Killer's target was before the character did, but the twist at the end I never saw coming, but should've.Highly recommended for any fan of the paranormal and detective TV series too.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a nice game, that perhaps falls short if you are a fan of Square Enix games.Graphics and animations are smooth, complemented by a nice interesting story with characters personalities that make you get to know more about them.Nevertheless it feels as if it did not achieve its full potential. The combat feels shallow and the final developments of the whole story do not add up nicely as one would expect.Overall it is a nice game, which I would recommend and definitely give IMHO a 8/10.

												A game in which a Yahtzee Crowshaw cosplayer gets killed by a man and then, as a ghost, follows a fairly predictable plotline to find out who the killer was.  Also the killer kills some other people and there is ghosts hanging about the place.  If you, for whatever reason, struggle to follow the story, just think of it as Ghost, the 1990 film about a ghost, but in a video game.The game starts out in media res after showing the protagonist getting lots of tattoos.  Apparently this is important, somehow, because he was a criminal but is now a cop?  Dunno.  The game then moves on to demonstrating just how bad of a PC port it is.  When I first use my ghostly powers to possess someone, when using a keyboard, I got stuck and was unable to move.  The controls were unresponsive and I had to end the game’s process in task manager.  Definitely use a controller for this one.Shortly after you will meet the game’s deuteragonist, Joy, who is a young girl able to see Ronan, the player, even though he is a ghost.  She isn’t too happy about that because she is always seeing them.  She tells you to♥♥♥♥♥♥off even after she is informed that you are able to help her find her mother who’s buggered off somewhere (it really is just “somewhere”, you never find out where).  Eventually she resigns herself to helping you if for no other reason than to get Ronan to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.  What a great partnership.Ronan himself is a fairly likeable character.  If you can get passed his ridiculous attire, plethora of edgy tattoos and the Phantom Cigarette which he never seems to stop smoking, he’s kind of alright.  He reminded me a little of Bigby from The Wolf Among Us; rolled up shirt sleeves, nasty smoking habit and devil-may-care attitude.  His hat is still stupid, though.  He’s basically a modern time discount Cole Phelps.The game itself is quite short.  While I am not usually bothered by the time it takes to complete a game, I was somewhat miffed when I played for around four and a half hours, went to bed, woke up the following morning and managed to finish the game off in about half an hour.  The game’s ending itself appears rushed, scrambling to tie the plot together by showing various scenes with aspects of the story being finalised, but at least it tries.Like many other developers, Airtight Games felt compelled to shoehorn in combat any way they could.  This means that occasionally you’ll come across Demons which you must kill by sneaking up behind them and performing a QTE.  This serves to do nothing else by distract the player and ruin the pace of an otherwise good gameplay loop.  Fortunately, there is a way to edit one of the game’s .ini files in order to stop the Demons spotting you.  They will still spawn, but ignore you completely.  Some may see this as cheating, I see this as an improvement.SPOILERS AHEAD: The ghost girl you meet at the beginning of the game, Abigail, is the killer.  This comes as absolutely no surprise.  It is quickly established that the people stuck in what is ostensibly Purgatory may only leave if they resolve and move on from a key event in their life.  Ronan’s problem is that he never figured out who the Bell Killer was.  And what about Abigail?  Well, Ronan has a very basic possession ability, allowing him to go inside the mind of living beings (and control cats).  But Abigail’s are far more advanced than that.  Yes, she possess people and then kills other people.  Well, mediums, specifically.  Because they’re, like, witches or something.  Her motives are flimsy at best, completely balls-to-the-wall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ungrounded at worst.Unlike a similar game, L.A. Noire, I found myself always one or two steps ahead of Ronan in the story.  Many times he would receive sudden clarity on something, and I would be sitting there thinking “Really?  Well, duh.  How did you not already figure that out?”.  At one point, when Ronan finally figures out the thing I’d already clocked onto hours before (the killer’s identity) he asked “But how did she do it?”.  BECAUSE SHE IS A GHOST WHO CAN POSSESS PEOPLE.  YOU CAN DO THE EXACT SAME THING.It might seem like I completely hate the game, but I don’t really.  It’s flawed, but it’s also quite compelling.  While the story’s conclusion was foreseeable, it was still enjoyable to watch the characters make their way to it.  I still haven’t figured out why the ghosts could pass through walls, but not fall through the ground, though.  ‘Tis a mystery which plagues many stories like these. "

												I just finished the game in one and a half sittings. I'll go through some pros and cons that I came across while playing through the game quickly.Pros:+The concept. It is so extremely interesting and makes for some great gameplay. Ghosts are cool. :3c+The deduction segments. You actually have to remember stuff that you uncovered way back in order to advance, which I found enjoyable and realistic. No need for a pen and paper though as the game keeps your previous discoveries and presents them when needed.+The collectibles. These withhold some very interesting bits of history, character development and a few creepy♥♥♥♥♥ghost stories.+The setting. Salem is a town with an extremely rich and interesting history, which is uncovered through the collectibles.+Cats.Cons.-Character development. There isn't any really, apart from some of the collectibles.-The story. You will either like the story or be disappointed. You are kept in the shade until the very end, despite all your detective work. The ending is also Shayamalan levels of twisty,-The collectibles. Yes, these were both good and bad. The good thing is the info they contain, the bad thing is they are way too easy to collect. On my first playthrough, without using any walkthroughs and not stopping to explore every square inch of every area, I found around 80% of everything there is to be found. Most of them aren't even hidden in any way. Really cuts down on replay value.-The game is very short. My very first playthrough, which I went into completely blind, only took me 6 hours from start to finish while getting 80% of all the collectibles <_>. This is also the main reason for the lack of character development. The story takes place during just one night though, so I guess the plan was to make the game short from the get-go.-No new game plus. After finishing the game, if you continue from the last checkpoint you are placed right at the last scene, which the takes you to the credits again. The only other option is a new game.-The enemies. Too easy to get rid of. They pose no real challenge and don't even really slow you down.-The town. It is way too small to really bring that feel of exploration, and the various areas are split into separate zones.Overall the concept delivered really well. The game really puts you in that fantasy of being a ghost. I would've wished for more varied gameplay and more gameplay in general. The shortness of the game really destroys it. I wanted to love this game with all my heart but I just can't. The flaws are too numerous and too big to ignore.I feel it deserves to be played, but the price right now is way too high. Definitely grab it when it's put on sale			"

												I was looking forward to this game a lot, as I love anything to do with ghosts as well as crime. But I was let down by the fact that the developers have neglected to allow for keyboard customisation within the game, so that we can't change from having to use the default WASD keys. There are people that are left-handed, or have lost part of their left hand and can no longer play that way for games.

Posted: June 25, 2016
												I was excited to try Murdered: Soul Suspect out as it had an interesting concept and Square Enix is one of those publishers whose name is a guarantee for a good game (well, most of the time it is). The game received average scores from critics upon its release, which is probably due to some false expectations. Worry not however, Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very good game, just don't make the mistake of expecting something it cannot provide.It features an 'over the shoulder' third-person view (as seen in Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space) that might lead you to believe that Murdered: Soul Suspect is an action orientated game. It isn't. It is an adventure game that focuses on collecting clues and coming to conclusions with a pretty good story unfolding as we progress.The introduction is one of the most unique in video game history: we witness our own murder. The protagonist, Detective Ronan O'Connor is killed by a masked assailant, who turns out to be the Bell Killer, a serial murderer who's been killing the citizens of Salem (a fictionalized version of an existing town in Massachusetts, USA) seemingly randomly. As a ghost, Ronan meets Julia, his dead wife, who informs him that he is stuck between the world of the living and the afterlife and cannot join her until he solves a mystery connected to his life that binds him there. It isn't hard to guess, that this is related to the Bell Killer case and we'll have to unravel it if we ever hope to leave this passageway between life and death and join our wife.First we have to get used to what it feels like being a ghost (similar to what Patrick Swayze experienced in the movie Ghost): we can't directly operate objects, can't even open doors, but we can pass through them, if they aren't parts of Salem's Old Town, where houses were christened in order to keep ghosts away (it's a clever way of creating barriers, restricting where the player can travel). There are several ghost specific skills we can use, including the ability to see (and talk to) other ghosts, telekinetic powers and even teleporting (most of these become availabe at certain points of the game). The best and most useful thing however is the ability to possess others, so we can mildly influence them and - even better - read their minds. There are parts where we can also possess a cat (!), which allows us to to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.There are several cases we can solve throughout the game (these are optional) besides our own and they are worth completing. In these cases we can help other ghosts by uncovering informations about their deaths and these side-quests are responsible for probably the best - both touching and satisfying - moments in the game, The old woman with the hair rollers, seen from the intro, for example is responsible for killing a girl who was partying too loud.Also there are little ghost tales (basically urban legends) known from horror stories. As soon as we find the given number of related objects (for example 7 pieces of boilers) we can listen to the narrated story related to that specific item (boiler -> A Watery Grave, in which a tenant finds out why the water coming from the local boiler turns brown). It's a nice little touch and adds much to the eerie atmosphere.The main story is interesting as well of course (of which I'm not going to tell anything about, for obvious reasons). Besides trying to figure out who the Bell Killer is we can find memories which unfolds the background story of the main characters (Ronan and Julia): we come to know how our hero, who had quite a criminal record, became a police officer and fell in love with Julia, the sister of one of his colleagues. It's like reading through Julia's diary, learning about her feelings towards Ronan, how she struggled with her own mental issues and how she finally said yes, when he asked her to become his wife, despite still not knowing much about Ronan. In the end Murdered: Soul Suspect provides us with a love story as well.As I mentioned before, the gameplay consists of collecting evidences and clues, talking to other people/ghosts (surprisingly the game doesn't punish us for jumping to wrong conclusions) and is occasionally interrupted by action/stealth segments. This is probably what might have confused some people deciding what genre this game is. In these parts we'll have to hide from or dispose of demons who are hunting ghosts like us. They come in 2 varieties: the floor demons (stationary, can be easily avoided) and floating demons. The latter type is far more dangerous, because they can quicky catch and kill us. In order to kill them we have to sneak behind them and press the right combinations of buttons. They can be lured away by possessing nearby crows or we can hide in ghost residue and - as strange as it sounds - inside humans, waiting for the ideal moment to strike. This is the part that received many criticism, because it goes against the regular gameplay of the game. In my opinion though it just gives some thrilling moments to the adventure. If you fail and die, nothing happens, the game lets you retry from the point the demons appeared. The end of the game also contains timed events, you'll have a limited amount of time beating your enemy, something that wasn't common until then, but it does make sense (it would feel odd, running around while irreversible events occur).The game features some amazingly well designed characters, from which I'd like to highlight Joy, the teenager medium whose facial expressions and acting are almost as real and good as of a real actor. Unfortunately the antagonist is not so memorable and it deducts from the overall value at the final confrontation. I personally also didn't find Ronan that interesting, They tried to made him unique with all the tatoos and extravagant clothing, but for me it just made him distant, someone who is hard to identify myself with.The visuals of the game are simply amazing: it uses Unreal Engine 3 and it really shows what this engine is capable of. Eveything looks amazingly beautiful and the eerie, foggy and dark (the whole game plays during nighttime) environment is especially noteworthy. You might want to turn bloom off and pick normal AA (anti-aliasing) instead of the other modes though for better quality (something which I figured out late in the game).

A Screenshot of MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT™
By: Atisz2




The sound is exceptionally good as well: the environmental audio is remarkable, finally a game where it pays off having a surround sound system. I remember playing Baldur's Gate and Thief the first time in 5.1 and the difference in sound was amazing. It applies to here as well. The noises in the cemetery, the owl hooting really makes you feel like you were there. While the music isn't memorable (actually I don't remember any of it) the characters voices are amazingly good, thanks to the great voice actors. Again, I have to mention Joy, whose voice actress, Cassidy Lehrman does an outstanding job.Overall, Murdered: Soul Suspect creates the impression of a game made with love, by an unknown developer, Airtight Games. It takes you on a memorable adventure, that's certainly not too long (took me 36 hours, but I explored every nook and cranny, something I usually do in good games) and unusual (an adventure game where you have no inventory - you're a ghost after all). Just don't make the mistake of confusing it with an action game (despite the over the shoulder point of view) and you are guaranteed to have a good time. On the other hand 29.99€ might be a bit too much for it (because of its relative shortness), so try to grab it during a sale.PROS+ very beautiful visuals+ good, enjoyable main plot, very good sidequests+ lots of investigating+ emotionally movingCONS- some underdeveloped important characters- might seem odd for lovers of classic adventure gamesRATING8/10			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure game with stealth aspects. The storyline of this game is what makes you want to keep playing , there are alot of broken or just bad mechanics in the game - inspecting and collecting things seems to be very hit or miss whether u get the button prompt based on camera orientation on the object. They tried to add in a aspect of danger to the game via ""demons"" in my opinion this was only a negative aspect as the combat system is very unfullfling and tedious , i found my self just running past most of these parts of the game ( which i suppose is the stealth aspect they were trying to include). The storyline isnt exactly ground breaking and its probably what you expect from a game set in modern day ""Town of Salem"" it does try to have a few plot twist and turns to keep you immersed in the main story though. There are also side quest investigations in the town which really dont advance the main story and only serve to distract you for  a few minutes. The Graphics and art style of the game are very well done and do a good job of setting the atmospheric scene in the town/game. There are is fair amount of people living in this town the only down side to this is alot of the characters are duplicated which really takes away the immersive feeling the game is trying to capture with its graphics and storyline.Its a Short game but worth a play through ( Definitely worth a purchase if its on sale )			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is very nicely polished when it comes to graphics, sound, and interaction with the world. I hope they make a sequel of sorts. The game isn’t open for direct sequels to the story. A “Murdered” series would be really cool if they flesh out the mechanics to make them matter more.If you’re looking for a puzzle/case solving game, this is not it. If you want to enjoy a cool story with a couple of nice twists and some very interesting game mechanics definitely check it out.Full Review at http://germaximus.com/murdered-soul-suspect-review/ =)			"

												I just finished the game with 88% of achievements done. It's a good game. I love the Stories in this game. But game mechanics are to simple. There is not enough stuff you can do in a map. Once you finished the game there is low replay value. Game can be complete in 7-10 hours. I give this game a 3 out of 5I do not recommed at current price, If price drops $ 40 or lower. I do recommend for story.Positive stuff about game+Fantastic stories+Nice voice acting+Good graphics+Good EnvironmentNegative stuff about game-Controls feel a bit lacking-Easy to find clues and easy to solve problem-Level maps are simple and not much to do other than collect stuff.-Combat is awful			"

												The best thing this game's got going for it is the voice acting and MAYBE the story.  The story had me very interested.  Maybe that's because I'm a sucker for detective stories?  Either way, the game itself is... very standard.  The ""battling"" of the demons is literally a repetitive quick-time palooza.  I felt stressed throughout the entire game because I was more focused on trying to find the collectibles moreso than solving the mystery.  Some may argue this is a great addition to the game, but you get nothing except acheivements for completing this tasks, and it felt less-rewarding then usual.There is no newgame+.  Once you beat the game, you restart from your last checkpoint, which happens to be a point of no return.  If you happen to miss some collectibles after this point: tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're going to have to restart your entire file.I, personally enjoyed playing the game and getting involved with the characters and the story, but I CANNOT support the outragous price Square-Enix is asking for on this game.  I managed to spend 20$ on this bugger and I still feel like I might have overpayed by a small margine.Give or take, I'd pick this up in the future for like, 5-15$ to give it a try.  Skip it for now.

												 Dear Murdered: Soul Suspect's creators,         Games that don't work...I add you to the list. Don't you love spending money on a game and then the game♥♥♥♥♥♥slaps you by telling you it won't respond? The game does not respond as if we have been married for twenty years. All I know is, I wish I could get my money back so I don't just have a steam game lying in the library taunting me with its broken and money whoring ways. I just wish technology was kinder to me in my online pioneering whilst searching for decent games. I was looking forward to this game and everything it would incorporate, but ♥♥♥♥ that. Maybe after a few years the game will lighten up and let me enjoy it. This game could be awesome, but honestly as long as it is sitting there mocking me I will despise it until the day I die. I may never be the same again after I saw that first ""Isn't Responding"". I started to doubt myself and all my purchases; I looked back on all my steam games; I contemplated emptying my library on steam and resigning as a gamer. This game disgraces every other game before it in history because IT DOES NOT WORK! I would rather be forced to play the entire ""I Wanna Be The _____"" series and all of its rage-inducing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t then sit at my damn computer just jerking it as this game does not respond as if it's on its period or something and is not in the mood. I pray to Allah that this game one day fixes itself because otherwise that was just a waste of stripper tipping money. Thank you Murdered: Soul Suspect - you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Love,Yours Truly,BL0ODEYES			"

												I wish there was a middle of the road button in Steam, not just the basic yes or no.When i first saw this game i was really impressed and 100% in on the first day as far as picking it up goes.I've stuck a no on this, but my last comment is pretty much a yes, just for the right price.One of the problem's with this game, is that i perhaps didn't find out enough about it before buying it.I do like my puzzle and mystery games a lot, i sort of had it in my mind that this would be a bit of a hybrid.(Which it is, just not fully developed i think)The whole marketing side was gearing you up for playing an epic murder mystery, but what you get instead is just very linear.I'll point out the bits that really were poor, and then some of the bits i did like.1) Fighting enemies - This is both a chore, and yet few and far between too.It's almost like you ""could"" fight enemies in some areas as there are hiding spots and things to possess -There just aren't any.(When i say fight, basically all you do is sprint up behind them and do a poor QTE)2) Uncovering evidence - Not really uncovering, much more like clicking on things in the vicinity, with a running tally telling you how many you are missing. (This also leads into the next point)3) Detective score - 0 reasons for this to be there, every investigation will rank you out of 5 stars.Trying to jolt someones memory in the game? Well ignore the stars and just click on everything, as you wont get penalised.(Same with the uncovering evidence, just get the main parts you need and move on, the only reason to listen and view all parts is for the story - i have a positive for this later as well)4) Bugged side quests - Meet a ghost and solve their tale, only for the large amount of times that you exit and reload the game for them to be still wailing on about something when you return.(They are supposed to go to heaven... i think after you do the mission - Though it never really says, they just get ingulfed by a white light and float off)5) Masses of the same character models all throughout the game.6) Map hub world -  I can see what they were tryng to convey, what with the ghost buildings... almost like a tear in time.It's just a shame that theres not much acually happening, just a lot of weirdo human NPC's hanging around in parks and on benchs in the middle of the night complaining of a murderer hanging around (Your in a park in the middle of the night... errr)7) Lack of locations.8) Possessing people - It wears thin, especially when they only have two lines of internal monologue to listen to at best.(Most people also have set paths if they aren't just sitting)Ok, what i liked 1) Character development to a degree was pretty good, the main characters are fairly well fleshed out throughout the game.2) The story, although you know it's going to be a supernatural sort of tale, it actually just ignores most of the witchcraft side of Salem until about 70% of the way through.3) The ghost stories and tales are fairly well done.4) What little locations are in the game are nice enough to look at.5) Some times the random ghosts freaked me out a bit.What could have made it better - 1) More sections with the whole ""Cat"" possession :-)2) The ability to scare people and freak them out with possessions.3) More locations and places to explore.4) More... way more, NPC's and things to interact with.So, thats all i got, i think when i was playing it i came up with a lot more negatives, but the story was pretty engaging.If i had to give a score and some final comments i'd say - 6/10 - Only buy if you can pick it up for less than £10.00			"

												Sadly, a wasted potential.The story is generally decent (beside one of the major twists which is utter nonsense), but the execution is just bad.The sneaking/combat mechanisms are forced and boring, the ""puzzles"" are all weak with often simply silly solutions, most ghostly powers range from utter useless (mind reading) to usable only for getting collectibles (teleport).Just a waste of time, and the final nail in Airtight's coffin.

												+: For me it had investigations as part of environment exploration, which i didn't have enough in AC Unity, and ghosty spooky theme I got compelled to after Beyond: Two Souls, and also nice story and fitting location.-: But action gameplay is meh, stealthing for ghost wedgies gets tedious after first dozen times, and then I just curse at raven placement I didn't notice. And some other stuff gets to hidden, doing 100% would be quite painful, so it's uninstalled right after ending.There's Ghost Stories worthy set of bonuses for collecting, but you can just watch it here and not waste time on looking for bloody final piece:

												Murdered Soul Suspect won't blow anyone away, but it's a fun game with some good ideas that are unfortunately poorly implemented at times.To be honest, I was a bit excited when I first heard of Murdered, but the lack of advertising and previews always make me worry about the final product. By the time it released it seems the studio was already closing down and no effort was made to promote it and that way try and earn some extra money with it. This was already obvious by the unusually high amount of discounts, months ahead of its release date. This game wasn't going to win any awards, and they knew that for quite some time then.Graphically the game isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either. Models look nice and detailed, as well as the vilage. There are plenty of people walking around, ghosts and human, and there's a nice mix of still standing buildings and buildings that were destroyed in a fire a long time ago (and, like all the other ghosts, are being shown with a ghostly aura around them).In the beginning it's explained why you can't just enter any building you see which sounds ridiculous when you hear it. It's obvious things were changed because of its low(er) budget. Still, it's more disappointing than it is frustrating. It would've been nice if you could go anywhere you want, but ok, that's just my opinion, of course.A nice touch is the addition of static ghosts in the backgrounds that disappear once you get closer to them. Nothing eery or scary but cool evertheless (and maybe even underused).The voice acting is actually very good, especially that of Ronan and Joy. I also can't complain about the music and sounds, which range from very decent to very good.As far as the story is concerned; it's ok-ish. I was hoping for a mysterious story and while you keep guessing until the end it didn't have the payoff I was hoping to get. About three quarters in, the story becomes clearer and your expectations will probably change. Some might like it, others might like it less. I am part of the group that liked it less. The story became less personal near the end and I was disappointed by it.Ghosts can also be found standing and hanging around certain places. They have some creepy stories to tell, and this is one of the things the game does right. But talking to some of these ghosts will give you a conversation tree to choose from. These are absolutely worthless and add nothing to the story or game. Again a case of wanting to add too much and where it's obvious they eventually had to cut it out because of time/money constraints.The real sidequests have deeper stories than the other ghosts found in the game and solving these is fun and worth the time.The gameplay consists of walking around and pressing context-sensitive buttons. Solving cases usually require you to search the area in search of items or people and press a specific button. Once you have enough evidence to solve a case you can do this, again, by pressing a button. You then have to click a memory (which basically is a piece of evidence you found) or click on memories in a certain order (like; how something may have happened).Stealth is also used but it's so minimal that it's barely even worth mentioning. I think these can be counted on one hand. Still, it adds some variety to the game and it's something that makes the games a little harder. They should've used it more frequently because it works well.There are a few groundbreaking bugs in the game. Mine started with the first investigation when things are still being explained to you. The buttons and tutorial overlays didn't work so I couldn't trigger anything. After a few minutes I reloaded the checkpoint and this time it worked just fine. This happened 3 or 4 more times during the course of the game. Annoying bugs that shouldn't be there because the other elements of the game work fine and even feel polished.Murdered Soul Suspect isn't the game I originally wanted to have but it's still fun if you like ghost and detective stories. Don't expect a hardcore game here, but something a bit more casual; a game that anyone can play and finish.It's not a great game, but not something mediocre either.[Rating: 73/100]			"

Overview11 hours until the end36/48 achievementsI am not a great adventure fan, so for one of these, things might be different.This game has some of the worst aspects of adventures, the very reasons why I do not like most adventures.There will be spoilers, so if you don't want them, stop reading.The good clues:I like the graphics and the sound. I like the idea about being a ghost who searches his murderer very much. Mindreading people is fun for 10 minutes until you realize that it is good for nothing if you are not currently searching for clues.The bad clues:It starts with the bad experience in the first scene, you have to search for clues. You are even told how many there are and how many you already have.You think, ""cool, searching a murder scene for clues"".You saw in a video what happened, you were thrown through a window from high above. So why is broken glass a ""clue""? Why? Why is your gun a clue? You have to find.. don't know 7 or 9 clues and you get NO new info out of these clues. And it is really as bad as in my first adventures, more than 20 years ago. You have to find the pixel which is the clue. But is worse than 20 years ago, because you do not just move your mouse, you move a character and the character has too look at the pixel.Next scene, you have to find x/y clues. After a while you realize, it is again moving around until you get the info that you are looking at a clue. Cool...not. It gets worse. You don't believe me? It GETS worse.You will get no hint in that direction, but sometimes, for example in the second scene, you will not find all clues, but you have to conclude from your already found ""clues"".These conclusions are the worst you can imagine. Nope. That is not true. They are worse.There is NO logic (no human logic at least) behind the decision which picture is the right to chose. Then, after this is done, sometimes you have new sensitive pixels in the scene. Somewhere.Sometimes it is so bad, you KNOW that there, at exact that spot has to be the pixel you want to ""find"" (google, walkthrough or load game), but you have to move and turn and snake around the pixel until you get it.So, what have we until now? Pixel searching, clues which give you no clue and missing logic in the conclusions you HAVE to make.Can it get worse?It can. But at least it is a taste thing. Some - adventure lovers - will see it as normal, some - as me - will start to hate.You see, there will be puzzles. These will be of the kind: ""I am a ghost and have no clue, help me"". Then you search a radus of 5 meters around the ghost for x/y clues (you remember that one, right?) and will come to totally unlogic conclusions and ""puff"", the ghost is happy and goes away to heaven. Yeah, real police stuff, you know.And then, then there are the demons. In a game about ghosts, why should be there no demons you ask?Because they are used as action/stealth elements which make the game longer, have you die and get you to curse a lot.If you find in the steam forum some message about ""how to disable demons"", then you know, you are not alone with your frustration. These demons do not really make sense for the story of the game. STOP! NO THEY DON'T!They just get in your way when you want to continue with the story.Oh oh. The story.I have to say, the story is kind of good and interesting. But had I known how brutal the game (what is told and what you see in backflashes) will become, I would not have bought it.I do not like brutality or sadism in my games. And I like really happy endings in my games.I was sad when the story ended, not because the game was finished, I was so happy that I was done with it, but I was sad because the story told about horrid fates of young friendly girls who just had wanted to help others.ConclusionIf you a an adult adventure lover, get it. You will love it, I fear.For all others, keep away, don't get it, not even cheap. Just DO NOT GET IT!And do NOT give it to your children to play it. I think, the story is just too brutal. At least for me.Do NOT buy!			"

												I wanted to like this game, but then I played it.  Pretty much every mechanic in the game is handled poorly.  Most of the puzzles in the game consist of you searching the crime scene to collect a pool fo mostly useless clues and then picking the correct one out of the list when prompted.  Hmm, which clue is related to the Bell Killer?  Could it be the one that just says ""Bell Killer""? Yes, yes it is.  Every time.   90% of the ""puzzles"" are exactly this.  No creative or deductive thought is required to finish this game.  The only other major mechanic in this game is demons.  They are one of the worst mechanics of any game I've ever played.  Basically they are like wandering sentries that you have to sneak up on to destroy.  If they spot you they chase you around for a couple of minutes.  They are never fun.  They are only annoying hinderences that stop you from continuing the story.  They were obviously slapped onto the game to make things more ""difficult"" and drag the game out.  Without them you could probably finish the game in a couple of hours.  Most of which is walking back and forth between the various crime scenes in the absolutely tiny town of Salem.  There are a bunch of collectibles to find throughout the game, but unless you collect all of them of a given type you don't get anything out of it.  And when you do finally get them all you are rewarded with a crappy little short story about someone's death.  The overall story of the game is ok I guess.  It has some serious problems, but relative to how bad the rest of the game is, I guess it gets a pass.  It does not however make slogging through the rest of the game worth it.  I'll give the game some credit though, the title is sort of clever.			"

												An enjoyable game with an interesting story.  Is it perfect? No but did I have fun playing it? Absolutely.  The story and graphics are good and as with some movies you can predict how the story will unfold you'll be able to do the same here but with some well placed plot twists that I believe the majority of people won't see coming.  .  There are some nice spooky elements to the game like the demons and the random disappearing ghosts.  Folks have complained the game is short - I don't have a problem with that personally - the duration of the game seemed to fit with the nature and timeline of the main story and doesn't have you spending hours doing something for little reward.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is the game where walking through walls and objects is no longer a bug but a feature.First of all you should realize that this game is basically split 50-50 between gameplay and cut scenes. If feels more like watching a movie than playing a game. You get to play as detective Ronan O’Connor. Objective - solve your own murder, and save the terrorized Salem from The Bell Killer. Murdered: Soul Suspect offers a compelling story with several twists, and manages to entertain till the very end. There are also some side quests you can complete by helping several ghost you'll encounter during the game. These ones are optional, but are recommended to complete in order to get a better perspective of the game and your detective skills, especially since the main story is quite short. If you decide to buy it i would advice not to put much hope in the gameplay. It's quite repetitive - explore the location, gather clues on the case, escape the demons, watch the cut scene, and over again... Overall, it somehow felt intriguing and mysterious, also quite different from most of the adventure games i've played. However, even after the recent price cut from $50 to $30 i still find it a bit overpriced and would recommend to get it on sale since it's too short, and has almost no replayability value, except if you're an achievement hunter and would need to play it a second time to get the ones you've missed.

There is no incentive to ""collect"" all the ghost items. Needs more depth into the characters to make the gamer actually care to know more. Severely lacking in side quests			"

												I really enjoyed the hell out of this game.  Sure it isn't without its shortcomings, several mentioned in other reviews - but overall, a great game.  Great story, great voice acting - yes, the body possession could have been used more, but instead of complaining about what the game isn't - I really appreciate what the game is.This is very story driven.  You will encounter a few ""arcade like"" moments where you'll need some dexterity - but overall, the game is at your own pace - and there is plenty to do.  There is a lot to explore, several backstories to uncover.  Yes, you could power through it but the explorer can find lots to do running around Salem.Oddly, it was a lot like playing the movie The Frightners.At $6 it is a no brainer - if you're even remotely interested grab it on sale.  Even at full price, I would not have felt ripped off.Seriously recommended.			"

												A good story game that has some interesting hooks in it and several stabs to your back.Gameplay could have been more, it is on the low side of things - unless you consider collectible hunting to be a highly fun activity. It was decent at best.Graphics, in Direct X 11, its quite pretty - even though its mainly night blue and dark grey - due to the subject matter.Audio does a good job, nice atmosphere it provides.The story is quite good, as you follow the trail, it gets more and more interesting. Even the ending is rather unexpected, even though it was nagging at the back of my mind - I just was't 100% positive.My only REAL complaint is just the lack of real variety amongst the (living) NPC's.The level of lazy we are talking about, is the LACK of many NPS's to begin with. Its roughly 6 for male and female.Even the dialoge for either gender is repeated amonst different types of NPC's. It really annoyed me.Is it worth the sale price of $30?oh nooo.Wait for a sale or to be bundled up with either games. "

												Surprisingly enjoyable. A not so long adventure game with an original idea but plagued by an average execution.The positiveMurdered takes the interesting concept of playing a dead man stuck between two worlds and having to solve his murder to be able to get to heaven. I really love this idea, you're investigating in two embedded worlds : the living and the dead. You can clip through most environment from the world of the living but get stuck against the environment of the dead. The setting is very well made with ghosts appearing and disappearing as well as people in an alike situation as yours : unable to let go and go to heaven. There are 4 side quests where you're helping someone to understand his/her death.I personally loved the aesthetic of the game, a mix of color and black and white. The game also is very well optimised and runs flawlessly on my laptop (i7 4500U, Nvidia GT750m) @ 900p/1080p. The story is enjoyable for the most part and the collaboration and interactions between Joy and Ronan are well-executed. Finally, the game has a lot of collectibles (242 to be precise), this can be either a positive or a negative point depending on the player.The negativeThe gameplay is below average even for an adventure game. Every step of the story involves you looking for clues in a small area, when you have enough clues you are able to link a few of them to each other to solve one question.... and that's it, for the whole game. The clues are either stupidly obvious or stupidly useless and the solving questions are terrible. The combat system sucks terribly too, it's simply about sneaking behind enemies and doing a simple QTE. Murdered won't be remembered for its gameplay.The story is very unbalanced. The first hour is basically setting the story and characters, the pace is slow and isn't very compelling. When you start seeing a bit through how the investigation is going to take place, it becomes enjoyable and that until the end of the game where you are faced to a completely stupid and abrupt ending. The ending feels rushed and I hated it because of this, the last chapter is like 5 minutes long... The rest of the game isn't very long either, count between 6 to 8 hours depending on whether you want to find all the collectibles or not.ConclusionIt might seem that the game is terrible but I personally enjoyed it anyway despite all of its flaws. The aesthetic and most of the story felt original. Many good ideas, poor execution but still worth it in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend it at full price though, buy it on sale.			"

												Fabulous game - enjoyed the story with lots of twists and turns.  Very cleverly put together.  Graphics were good also as well as the background music (although sitting in the dark playing this in the house alone is not reccomended!  Very eerie!!).  Although I did enjoy the concept of the demons and figuring out the best way to strategically defeat them, this became tiresome and detracted from the main storyline.  Enjoyed the side cases also, as that added more variety. I was totally engrossed in the game and hoped it had continued for longer!  Would love to play more games like this one.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is actually a really good game. Okay, maybe that's an overstatement, but I really enjoyed it's approach to detective work and solving the mystery of your own murder as well as the recent string of murders in Salem in a single night.You play Ronan O'Connor, a former petty criminal/turned detective who is hot on the trail of the Bell Killer, only the opening cutscene is your own death. The game picks up right from there as you search for clues and get used to being a ghost. The devs handled the ghost mechanics rather well as far as being unable to walk into buildings from the outside unless there's an open doorway or window. But you can move through walls, bushes, benches, etc.The story is really intriguing and it seemed like it was going to be predictable, but I was wrong. I didn't know who the killer was from the get go. So, I tip my hat to the devs for pulling a decent M Night Shamalamadingdong. Sound design is eerie, as it should be. Unnamed NPC's that walk around Salem that you can possess, well, a lot of them looked the same and had the same responses when reading their minds, that bugged me. And for being an open world town, it seemed more restricted than anything because of the ghost walls that you can't pass through. It just made the town section of the game seem a lot more linear, but like a maze.The graphics were decent enough, but it's clear that the game was held back due to last gen consoles. I mean, some of the modeling and textures look like games from 2010.The mystery work was a lot of fun though, searching for clues and whatnot. Good game.7.5/10			"

												I've played a lot of games, and I've died in a lot of games, sometimes quickly, but this is the first game where I died during the opening cutscene.  Kinda refreshing to just get that out of the way right off the bat.In Murdered:  Soul Suspect, you play a ghost.  You can walk through walls, affect things like lights and TVs, and blow papers on the floor.  You can possess people, but you can't really make them do very much.  Mostly, you just access their memories or influence them a little.This is a murder mystery, and you're trying to solve not only your own murder, but a series of murders you were investigating before you died.Along the way, you'll meet other ghosts, and some of them will help you, some will haunt you, and some will need your help.  Many of the ghosts have stories that they want to tell, and in a few cases, you will solve other murders.This is a beautiful and emotional game with a LOT of depth to it.  It was creative.  It was original.  It was intelligent.  Not flawless.  Not perfect.  But beautiful, and I don't mean graphics.  I mean this is a game where someone put some real love into developing it into something unique.There were only two things I didn't like about this game:1.  The name.  I think they should have just called it ""Murdered"".  More mysterious and dark that way.2.  The demons.  There are these demons that float around, and if they see you they will attack, and then it's game over.  I went into the config file and blinded them all.  I felt they went against the tone and feel of the game.  It's spooky having them their, but this, in my opinion, is not a game that needed action or combat.  So I essentially turned them off, and they became just more creepy atmosphere.Overall, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I enjoyed it tremendously.  Absolutely a unique experience.Playing as a ghost was well implemented in my opinion.  They used what I found were convincing concepts in order to limit your navigation where needed, establishing clear rules from the outset.The mystery-solving was great.  It reminded me of L.A. Noire some (but I much preferred L.A. Noire I must say, as a game and specifically in its mystery-solving methods).  My one problem with it is that there really isn't a penalty for being a poor detective.  It's up to you to challenge yourself by not selecting all the answers until you get it right.  Of course, your 'ranking' is lowered for each incorrect guess but that's not a gameplay penalty as much as a pride penalty.The story was compelling and the voice-acting was brilliant for anyone with a name you learn in the game.  Unfortunately, most of the NPCs with names you don't know, are comically wooden and not remotely human.  I loved Joy, notable given I thought I'd hate an angsty teen written by someone that's not an angsty teen, moreover one that's meant to be comedic and have an attitude; the media don't seem to be good at that in general, so this was a nice change.Then there's the voice acting in the ghost stories.  That was phenomenal.  The stories were well written and well performed.  Absolutely a brilliant touch.I really felt connected to Julia, your wife in the game.  She's hardly in the game, but you can collect her memories, and they're written.  If you read them, you begin to develop a real sense of who she is.  I have to commend that sort of characterisation.The main character is believable.  Probably someone I'd laugh at in real life (even though I'd still like him; he's a good person and he certainly takes things in stride), but I can't say I haven't known people like him.  And the writing and acting make that believeable.Speaking of taking things in stride, that's one flaw in the writing; too many people take too many things in stride.  But that's negligible in the face of everything else.The combat system isn't much of a combat system, but I felt it worked well.  In fact, had they called your one move 'exorcise' or something instead of 'execute', you could have had a true example of a great game utterly devoid of combat, where overcoming your enemy isthe best thing you can do for them.  There's a nice stealth element alongside the one move you have.The dæmons are extremely creepy in design.  I love it.The music is great, but I wish that in a place where it becomes tense for enemies, that it would become less tense once the enemies are neutralised.  It doesn't.  A minor flaw I suppose.The game feels like an indie game and was developed by Airtight Games, who were apparently independent according to Wikipedia.  I say this because the graphics are rather poor compared to contemporary games, and like many indie developers, the engine used was the old UE3 engine, rather than what was most current.There's a lot of history in the game.  Old Salem bleeds into the modern Salem as the main character (and all ghosts I imagine) sees things.  You can collect snippets of history, which were probably all accurate, as the ones I was familiar with were all correct.Bonus:I'm a linguist, and I liked that a lot of the accents were notably correct.  The game takes placein Salem, which isn't too far from Boston.  I'm very familiar with the Boston accent as it's rather high-profile in dialects of English, and moreover as it has a significant Irish influence.  I'm not terribly familiar with Salem's accent but a lot of characters possess Boston traits so I assume they were trying to localise the accent at least as Massachusetts, which is really interesting to someone like me.  Also, a lot of Irish turns of phrase are used, which on looking them up are apparently common in that area of America, from Irish emigrants.  Nice.  Not only that, a lot of people have Irish names, which is rather realistic and once again interesting.Oh, but the old-time Puritan accents were cat.  Absolute rubbish they were.Speaking of cats, you can possess cats and meow and climb things and jump on things.  Another nice touch. "

												Interesting and engaging adventure game.  Gameplay is 95% walking around finding hidden clues and talking to people.  The other 5% are quicktime events to defeat demons which are quite easy (and you can avoid some of them if you want).  I enjoyed the game's premise of trying to solve your own murder as a ghost.  The story is good - not great - but good.  Your character is likable, the dialog is reasonably well written, and the locations and plot points are well realized.  I enjoy hunting down hidden items in games, and this game offers that in plenty.  Most are reasonably easy to achieve, and some are quite cleverly hidden.  One set of collectibles though, the ghost girl drawings, are very difficult because you do not see them in the environment - you have to walk close to the walls and a ""reveal"" prompt will pop up if there is one there.If you like adventure games and murder mysteries I think you will enjoy this game.  Best of all, it does not overstay its welcome.  Steam says I completed the game in 12 hours and I was quite slow and deliberate in playing (trying to find all the collectables).			"

												At first, I wasn't sure what to expect. Picked up the game just because of couple of good reviews and interesting video. Gosh, I went for a treat. The story of the game grabs you like a great book, and you keep on going like ""Oh boy, oh boy! What will happen next?"". Characters are likeable and well modeled. Level design is top notch too. In general the game goes easy on you, it want to tell you a story and not irritate you with too much logical puzzles or advanced combat system. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you expecting from a game. Anyhow I am sure that being able to  'posses' a person and catch a glimpse of what they thinking is a big turn-on for a lot of gamers. Overall I am very glad to have the chance to experience this game and I totally recommend it.			"

												You’ve been murdered, it’s a real bummer. But now you get the chance to find out who it was and seek justice from beyond the grave. Or you would if you played this.Enter Ronan a bad guy turned good trying to stop a murderer on a killing spree but wouldn’t you know it you wind up just another one of their victims. But with unfinished business to attend to you hang around for a while and haunt the halls of Salem city searching for clues that could lead you to solving your own murder and ascending to heaven. Or at least that’s the plan but as the recently departed not many people will talk to you. Enter the one witness to your death Joy who also happens to be psychic, after a lot of convincing the duo team up and take down the evil together. The story is certainly an intriguing and unique one. I have not seen a murder mystery from a dead person’s perspective before and with the amounts of twists and turns that come flying at you as you progress it will get you enthralled right to the end.The game is stacked full of collectables, over a hundred of them to be precise, each with its own story. They all fit seamlessly into the town of Salem with its terrible past and not too stellar present. The world is more or less open world with you being able to travel from one location to another through the hub of the down town area. Each part of the world is beautifully designed and looks great mixing an old ghostly past with the present to make something new.The game also features a huge amount of side quests and cases to solve. Speaking of which the detective mode is also something of an oddity, find a crime and solve it with clues found in the environment and placed together like pieces of a puzzle, I found a lot of pleasure recreating crimes to try and figure out what had happened and who the culprit was.Now onto the main meat of the game combat…. There is none. Well that’s not true, there are a few enemies and by few I mean around 12 in the whole game and the only thing that happens is when they see you a QTE begins, win and you can proceed, lose and you have to start a short ways back. I would classify this more as an interactive novel than a game. Not that it’s a bad thing, but just be sure that’s what you are looking for before you delve in.This game offers a lot and is a great distraction if you are looking for a unique experience that’s heavy on the narrative but light in most other places. At full price I can’t really recommend it but on sale you should pick this up and just enjoy your time in purgatory.Have Fun ^_^			"

Exploration is not forced but recommended if you want to know a bit more about the world around you and lore is not that hard to find. the fights are few and far between but you won't mind as thegame itself is engrossing enough.

												Great game on sale, got it dirt cheap not expecting too much but it ended up surprising me.  Would not buy it for full price though.  The only thing that sucks about the game are the demon encounters, they just feel out of place and unnecessary.  The game has a good enough story and investigation/exploration sections that it doesn't need the demon sections at all.  It's a real shame because the idea had potential too.  I was hoping for something in the vein of demons being disguised as regular ghosts trying to trick you into making bad decisions via dialogue options to steal your soul but instead they're patrolling enemies that you have to avoid and stealth kill.  The most annoying thing is when they detect you for no reason whatsoever or when you are in exactly the correct position to execute them and get no prompt to do so.  These sections are a pretty small portion of the game though and there's only a handful of them.  Anyone whose played any stealth oriented games will have no problems with them outside of the issues mentioned above.  Overall, it was a great story with a couple twists on the end that I just didn't see coming.  The game is worth a playthrough if you're looking for something different that's story driven and not action packed.  Voice acting was great too, Ronan and Joy are both likable characters with tons of personality.  Will probably play this again at some point to get all the collectables and do the side missions that I missed.			"

												Get on sale.Good detective story, pretty gripping, and in fact my time played was split across two sessions only.It did what it wanted to do quite well. Pretty tense as well at some points. Bit like L.A. noire if you're looking for that sort of thing. Shorter, mind you. People are right in saying that what little ""combat"" there is gets tiring after a while, but thankfully it's not at all the main focus of the game.			"

												Overall, the game is solid. The investigative parts are interesting, the story is decent, and the mechanics were fun. I kept moving right along. The characters aren't amazing, but they manage to keep the story engrossing long enough to keep you hooked.This game isn't perfect though. For one, it's short. I mean real short. I spent my time looking around for clues and the like and it still only took me about 7 hours to finish the main story. I would recommend this game, but I should point out that I only spent $5 on it. If you spend more than that, you might not feel like you got your money's worth.			"

												It starts very smoothly and promising a lot of different interactions with NPC a lot of different stories ,but none of them playable . The story Climaxes insanely fast from a point after. The Ai of enemies is intriguing and a bit unfair that makes it so Good. You will spend a lot of time finding the missing clue that was quite obvious but the shading made it like a non important item. In general it could be a better game but it's ok 7/10			"

												Is this a good game? No. Is this a Bad game? Again no. This is a middle of the road game that doesn't do much new, but does try for the most part. The story is maybe 6-8 hours long it's padded by a lot of side quests some good. The helping other ghost asend. Some bad my god they went overboard with the item collection.  Persoaly I enjoy clue based mysteries, but the clues were all stright forward so not a lot of abstract thought will be needed here, And the game give up about half way though. Those good side stories where you help other ghosts dry up about mid game. Which is sad because it's clear there were plans for more they just dropped them for some reasons. The special item collection is also kind of boring collect 6-20 of this area items and you unlock a short ghost story. Do I recomend this game in the end? Yes IF and only if you like clue based mysteries and exploreing for pointless items. Try to get it on sale i would not recomend it at full price.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is actually a really good game. Okay, maybe that's an overstatement, but I really enjoyed it's approach to detective work and solving the mystery of your own murder as well as the recent string of murders in Salem in a single night.You play Ronan O'Connor, a former petty criminal/turned detective who is hot on the trail of the Bell Killer, only the opening cutscene is your own death. The game picks up right from there as you search for clues and get used to being a ghost. The devs handled the ghost mechanics rather well as far as being unable to walk into buildings from the outside unless there's an open doorway or window. But you can move through walls, bushes, benches, etc.The story is really intriguing and it seemed like it was going to be predictable, but I was wrong. I didn't know who the killer was from the get go. So, I tip my hat to the devs for pulling a decent M Night Shamalamadingdong. Sound design is eerie, as it should be. Unnamed NPC's that walk around Salem that you can possess, well, a lot of them looked the same and had the same responses when reading their minds, that bugged me. And for being an open world town, it seemed more restricted than anything because of the ghost walls that you can't pass through. It just made the town section of the game seem a lot more linear, but like a maze.The graphics were decent enough, but it's clear that the game was held back due to last gen consoles. I mean, some of the modeling and textures look like games from 2010.The mystery work was a lot of fun though, searching for clues and whatnot. Good game.7.5/10			"

												I've played a lot of games, and I've died in a lot of games, sometimes quickly, but this is the first game where I died during the opening cutscene.  Kinda refreshing to just get that out of the way right off the bat.In Murdered:  Soul Suspect, you play a ghost.  You can walk through walls, affect things like lights and TVs, and blow papers on the floor.  You can possess people, but you can't really make them do very much.  Mostly, you just access their memories or influence them a little.This is a murder mystery, and you're trying to solve not only your own murder, but a series of murders you were investigating before you died.Along the way, you'll meet other ghosts, and some of them will help you, some will haunt you, and some will need your help.  Many of the ghosts have stories that they want to tell, and in a few cases, you will solve other murders.This is a beautiful and emotional game with a LOT of depth to it.  It was creative.  It was original.  It was intelligent.  Not flawless.  Not perfect.  But beautiful, and I don't mean graphics.  I mean this is a game where someone put some real love into developing it into something unique.There were only two things I didn't like about this game:1.  The name.  I think they should have just called it ""Murdered"".  More mysterious and dark that way.2.  The demons.  There are these demons that float around, and if they see you they will attack, and then it's game over.  I went into the config file and blinded them all.  I felt they went against the tone and feel of the game.  It's spooky having them their, but this, in my opinion, is not a game that needed action or combat.  So I essentially turned them off, and they became just more creepy atmosphere.Overall, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third person thriller detective game where you will be exploring various locations in Salem for clues on your case. This game feels almost as if it were an interactive movie, which is a great thing; in addition the graphics, sound and voice acting are all superb. The game has tons of collectibles which add a lot of background information to the stories, locations, and characters. It took me 10 hours to complete the game and collect everything.  If you are a fan of thriller or mystery games, I highly recommend this one!			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect was a game I've been heavily anticipating ever since I saw it in action. I expected something along the lines of Ghost Trick mixed with L.A. Noire. What I got instead was essentially a much better Beyond Two Souls and that in of itself isn't a bad thing.Taking place in Salem, Massachusetts, you play as the deceased Detective Ronan O'Connor. Murdered by a mysterious serial-killer, he finds out that the only way to pass on to the afterlife and reunite with his dead wife is to figure out the murders identity identity so he may leave this mortal plane. It's a decent Whodunit story with a lot of interesting side-stories unlocked through collectibles.My biggest problem with this game is the gameplay or lack thereof. For what it's worth, I did enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect when you realize the game isn't trying to be Ghost Trick or LA Noire, but this is something you'll notice more and more as you'll go along. I actually think it starts out pretty well. You walk through walls, talk to fellow ghosts, discover their stories through detective work. It all seemed fine until you find out that's that where it stops. It never gets any harder, better more complex, better. The game doesn't offer much depth and at worse, becomes less interesting for the player. All you do is press X to evidence. There are no fail states in the investigation sections. There are no incentives to actually think logically and not randomly guess at what the game throws at you besides meaningless tokens and even then the game is incredibly easy. ""Oh, I wonder what memory will remind this witness of the killer. Hmm... could it perhaps be this thought bubble right here called THE KILLER?"" I admit, sometimes possessing a human and hearing his thoughts can be kinda cool, but it really doesn't enough with the concept. You never manipulate their actions unless it's for something incredibly mundane, never use them to walk around, there are no puzzles to solve, it just feels like a missed opportunity.Besides there's not really much to talk about. You can occasionally posses cats to find a new path to your objectives, you can try to find these loads of collectibles or.... fight random demons? Yeah, even though it's not relevant to the plot at all, you have to sneak past these dementor-like creatures or take these things down from behind stealthily, the latter being the most common. This isn't even a rare occurrence, this happened more then I could count. It's not all bad and sneaking past them does sometimes work, but why is this even here? This has no point other then to waste my time! The combat in this game couldn't be more tacked on even if you tried. I also thought using quicktime events to defeat them was incredibly annoying, because the buttons you need to press are randomized every time, but at the very least, you're given a surprisingly large amount of of time to get the right ones down so if there's one thing to praise them for it's that.It's with this that I realized that the game isn't trying to deep in terms of gameplay and that it's going for a specific audience who don't really want to put much thought into their gaming. With that said, I still had a good time with Murdered: Soul suspect. Like I said before, the story is good and that's really what they wanted to tell here. The lightning effects and shading are some of the best I've ever seen in a computer game however this comes with the unfortunate side effect of your game for thirty seconds just to load the next area. This isn't exclusive to the PC version, even the next-gen versions suffer from frame rate drops, stutters and others but technical hiccups aside, I'd say the game is still worth a purchase, but not for full price obviously. If you're still not convinced: all I'm saying is that I'll take a Murdered: Soul Suspect which simplifies a lot of aspects about its genre then the latest 6 Final Fantasy games or so.			"

												So MURDERED: Soul Suspect was such an amazing game that I decided to write a little review... At first the story is so good because you get everything told in the first few minutes. The story is interesting and will be unexpected and different the whole game. You're shocked, thrilled, scared and even sad with the characters. This game doesn't have an open world or big levels to explore and the gamer has to follow straight the story more or less. Very, very much things can be collected, like memories, part of ghost tales and pieces of the past of the main character. An easy gameplay leads you through MURDERED and it's easy to learn. So something about the main characters: Ronan O'Connor is great designed. A taff, sometimes joking but at the same time a heartwarming person exploring the reason of his death and the murder. A little negative point: For the ghost tales you need to collect in one level around 8-14 things and when the story is told you just see a picture. Something like a simple and small film after 15 minutes seeking would be better. BUT it's a great, game and it was very cool to play. A BIG I LIKE :))			"

But this game doesnt need that, you are supposed to figure out your murder and other murders aswell, And thats done really well!!I also enjoyed the story alot, i love how you walked around and found story about the city, Ronan himself and his wife.I didnt feel like the game was scary but i did have alot of goosebumps playing through this game, and that for one thing tells me it was an amazing game!!This game is a 10/10 for me.

												Being an old-time fan of the venerable Scapeghost by Level Nine, I grabbed this one with high expectations. And it's all there: You get to walk through walls, read people's minds, interfere with TV Sets and solve your own murder case. All that with Unreal-Engine powered graphics, a teenage punk medium and evil demons chasing you - what could possibly go wrong? The intro sequence showing the protagonist's past being inscribed as tattoos on his body was nice storytelling as well, so I was really, really ready to like and recommend this after like ten minutes.The setting is also fitting, with run-down buildings, a creepy cemetary and, of course, an asylum, all set within Salem which drips with atmosphere all by itself.And then it feels like the guys or girls with the nice ideas went to do something else, or got fired, or had no more time left.First, after being introduced with a rich background and ambiguous personality, the characters put all their dimesions aside and do exactly what you'd expect them to, in a mildly stereotypic way that makes them feel like copies from a couple of similar movies you just can't remember right now. This is especially true for side characters. No one expects brilliant writing for every single one-line (to be exact, two-line) character, but whatever chance for creepy, humorous or kinky or otherwise interesting background was given by the setting, nearly none of that was taken. And apart from five relevant persons and a couple of side-quest givers, everyone is a two-line character.Second, the game mostly progresses through you doing ""police work"". In itself, that wouldn't be much of a problem, as ghost stories and crime stories usually go quite well together. But this game relies more on your stuff collecting skills than on any form of crime puzzle solving. Any hint you may find has a generic one-line description but you won't ever read one, as you get an informative clip once you found 9/9, 15/15 or 20/20 hints, I think you can guess the mechanics. Any combination or deduction is done by the game itself by letting you choose from some heavily hinted options.Apart from the main story, there are bonus tidbits scattered everywhere. Once you found x/x of these, you get told a ghost story and go on. Some of the tidbits require jump-and run episodes, some the use of ghost abilities, but there is no other interconnection between them and the rest of the game. Same goes for side quests.The plot actually does not feel that bad, but the shallow, ""consoley"" approach to it, repetitive gameplay and thin dialogue, the tedious fights, the linear progression and the lots of walking didn't do it for me. It is an action game without action trying to be an adventure without puzzles. Which is a real pity because it does have production value. "

												This game was one I wanted to play when it first came out. I loved the game don't get me wrong...was a great game...just not worth the full price. Its a game you will want to pick up on sale. If you love collecting everything, there is plenty of that in here. Many small items to be found all over the city, and in each of the main spots you have to travel too to progress the game itself. The story is great, even though you may see most of it coming a mile away.  My one downfall I felt on it was the demons. They weren't used often enough, with that being said it made it feel they were more to just in your way, as well were the only enemy you had in the game. When trying to kill them it puts up different button presses, so be quick, or you will need to start running then play a game of musical chairs hiding till they go away. I do wish as well that your ghostly powers were more so needed to be used, but it was a bit of a let down as well.  Other then that I do hope that there will be another game, just hopfully they will add more too it. It was a great concept, but more could have been done. Once again its one I would say buy, just wait till its on sale.			"

Adventure RPG game set up in modern Salem.You are Ronan O’Connor, a badass detective chasing the infamous Bell Killer, but when you find him, seems he was more than you could chew, so you end up dead, finally you can rest in peace... Or so you thought, until you realize, you're now a ghost that can't move on, because of some unfinished business, but, what could that be? You can only think on finishing your last case, so you start tracking down your killer, now that you're a ghost, how hard could that be?Do note, real men don't need a map.

Its a video game and you have to draw a line somewhere.  The plot was amazing and shocked me.  There is a few twists that made me go,""no way."" It has great plot, and smooth gameplay.

												If your dream has always been playing an undead fedora-wearing douchbag neckbeard solving criminal cases like some try-hard Maltese Falcon reject who can't come to terms with the fact that he neither lives in the 1940s, nor understands the actual era (dress code included) - this might just be the game for you. Douchehat McNeckbeard might be laughably slow in how he connects clues, but he comes with a full package of mangst in the form of a fridged (of course) Manic Pixie Dreamgirl wife, and the attitude you'd expect from a 40-year-old basement dweller. If that is what you enjoy in a game, this will be a dream for you - albeit an admittedly short one, since the game is as the most 10 hours, and that's when you take your time as I did.On a more serious note, this game did have potential, and I really wanted to like it. Tuning out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist and his ridiculous and frankly embarrassing fashion sense (which is explained away in the most ridiculous 'didn't even try' manner possible in the game), parts of the gameplay, particularly in the beginning, were fun. Sadly the really fun parts are tragically underused, and for the course of the game following the opening mission, you experience practically nothing new. The first bigger investigation was fun especially through learning all the things you could do to get clues - connect existing clues in your head for new revelations, possess people and prompt them to reveal what they knew by triggering the right clues in their heads, seeing through their eyes into computer files, etc - but there it ended. You acquire a few more fine-tuned skills later on (teleporting, most notably), but nothing that really stands out. The fun experimental trying and testing which witness might have seen what and respond to which clues turns into a tedious button-smashing 'where's the one tiny object in the room that I keep missing?' adventure. Gameplay stagnates and turns into the same thing over and over and over again, only for Mr Fedora to finally come to a conclusion that quite frankly you could have told him after or even before entering the building.The worst part by far is the writing. Not only are the main characters (most notably the supposed 'tough cops' who only come across as petty, ♥♥♥♥♥y, and whiny) utterly unlikeable, but the main story itself lacks any originality. For the sake of avoiding spoilers if you are for whatever reason still interested in playing, I won't go into the details further, but whatever 'twists' were apparently thought up by the writers have been done before and repeated to death, were foreseeable to the point I don't even want to call it foreshadowing anymore, and - due to the absolutely flat character writing - lacked any sort of emotional impact. I never thought a game centring around a murder investigation done by a GHOST in ♥♥♥♥ing SALEM could be boring, but this is. It's plain and simply boring, with slightly awkward, incredibly repetitice gameplay, and with the added disadvantage of the most obnoxious, annoying, self-centred, whiny wannabe-tough guy fedora-wearing neckbeard Gary Stu of a protagonist I have ever seen. It's like a bad '40s film noir rip off (BUT IN SALEM, WOOO SUPERNATURAL THINGS) gone completely wrong. And not even spectacularly wrong, just underwhelming, tedious, and most of all - disappointing.There are worse games, of course, but this game stands out mainly because it doesn't - it's all been done before, been done better, and there is literally nothing that this game has to offer. It's not the worst, not a spectacular train wreck, but it's poor, and it's sad. Good for a few minutes of fun, and if you really have to kill time and have absolutely nothing else to do.Overall, 2/5, and that's me being nice, because I enjoyed parts of the early gameplay. Suggested time to buy: at 90% off.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an interesting game. The gameplay mechanics are quite unique but the premise is fairly typical of a story with paranormal themes; a ghost partners up with the living to solve a series of murders. It's not mind-blowing but the way its handled in Murdered works quite well, mainly due to the decent voice acting, the supernatural abilities, and the clever art style that blends reality with a ghostly dimension.The majority of the game is quite fluid and offers little challenge (in a good way) but I have to say that the action sequences feel forced and really bring down the quality of this game. They break the flow of the story and the combat itself is often imprecise and sloppy for what are essentially quick time events. I figure that what happened to Murdered is the same as with Deadly Premonition in which this is something that the publisher demanded of the developers, who reluctantly and haphazardly complied by shoehorning in some janky action sequences in the final hours of development.If you're aiming for 100% completion I suggest collecting everything BEFORE entering the abandoned and decrepit house near the end of the game, as the final sequence will prevent you from collecting any more items within its level and there is no free-roaming afterward. I found this out the hard way, fortunately you can start a new game, collect what you've missed, and the relevant achievements will still unlock even if the collectibles counter has reset to zero.

												The game is great, the mechanics are ok. But the concept of walking through walls wasn't something easy to grasp in my first few hours of gameplay. The STORY IS GOOD, I got hooked to it like a rat to a trap, it's very rich in story. Has history of the setting where you play at, very good direction when it comes to the story and I can't deny that I wanted more, the game just gives you a new atmosphere, surrounding, gameplay that isn't really common. Though I liked the stories about witchcraft in Salem it has a linear story line. But it's a good linear story kek. I REALLY WOULD WANT A SEQUELThe gameplay is a bit meh-ish, the demons weren't really that hard, puzzles were just too easy. But the thing that got me the most is the new environment, mechanics, and overall theme of the game, I wish they make a DLC or sequel eh, I recommend you to buy this.An intriguing game where it makes you think about what happens to a person after death. Very story rich like square enix's mangas and animes kek.			"

												+ Graphics is awesome+ Reasonably good voice acting+ Nice story+ The side quests are nice touch+ The plot twist + You get to possess a cat- NPCs has repetitive dialogs and doesn't really do much, if anything- Sometimes Ronan has weird / awkward reactions to some situations. - The invesitgation part is too easy, you just collect evidence and pick the most relevant ones.- The demons is the only combat you need to do.- You can't fly; coz you're not a plane.I really looked forward to playing this game, I mean, who wouldn't want to investigate their own murder, right? And I really enjoyed it, even with its little flaws.Get it when it goes on sale.My Rating: 7/10			"

												Good procedural detection sim. The gun in the detective's hand is not part of the game, fyi. This is about exploration and storytelling, not shooting things. Walking through walls is fun... when they let you.The story is alright. Nothing too moving. The metaphysics are wonky - while they give the Catholic Church a good character in the priest, they clearly didn't worry about keeping the theology of life after death in the traditional understanding. Took me out of the game a bit as your character tells lost souls to forgive themselves and they whoosh off in a bright light lol. Also, I wish the detective was more likable instead of some fedora-wearing clown. The graphics are ok, basically what is expected nowadays. However, some of the character models are pretty bad and voices randomly match up to models to hilarious results. I didn't encounter any gameplay issues. All around a competently made game.

												An excellent game! It's short like people have said, but it was satisfying nonetheless! The game is priced correctly for such a short game (~8 hours), at 10 dollars off a normal priced one. It's not something you'll be playing for weeks and I am actually refreshed by that. It's totally story driven and doesn't pretend to be something it's not. The creepy atmosphere always had me wondering what was around the corner (or what was through the next wall!). I tried my best to guess who the killer was and by all accounts I failed at that. If you want to take a break from that FPS and sit down with a good story-driven game, pick this one up! Totally happy with every aspect!			"

												I bought the limited edition at € 35 (has a nice little book in it). It's a decent price for a decent game, I wouldn't have paid more for this.The game reminds me of LA noire sometimes, because of the way you find leads during a crime scene. What i reaaaaally liked about this game were the perks you get by being a ghost :D .The story itself is good, I didn't expect the ending, although some ppl might, but i didn't :) I did find little ""mistakes"" in the game that i find odd, but it didn't ruin the game for me: sometimes if i run too fast i get stuck in a dumpster for example and half of the people in Salem are exactly the same person.. :s I saw some criticism about the game due to the looks of the main character and the way a ghost works, but i find these comments just annoying. I think the guy looks cool and has a good personality in the game + nobody really knows how ghosts work because they are not real! I ignored these comments and had a good time playing the game :) Overall a good game but glad i didn't have to pay €50 for it.			"

												NOCLIP - The Game is a game about the ghost of a man who attemps to solve the mystery of his own death.Story - 9/10 Fitting uncountable cliches but is very well written. Being a mystery story, I suggest that you avoid spoilers. Atmosphere - 10/10 Very tight and immersive atmosphere.Graphics 9/10 - Looks like it should look in 2014, but a little edgy at some details.Sound 10/10 - I have nothing to complain about. Excellent voice acting.Playability 9/10 - No plotstoppers for me. NOCLIP - The Game has some minor issues, but does not desperately need a patch.Gameplay 2/10 - That is the reason for all the scathing reviews. In NOCLIP - The Game you play as a ghost. You can walk through walls and people - hence the name. You can also possess people to read their thougts, solve some puzzles and get your clues. You can even possess the cats and control them to access some areas. Later you get the ability to teleport.Clues - they are basically just collectibles with an occasional tiny puzzle attached to them. You cannot fail the puzzles, it is always just trial and error. Each investigation just consists of getting all these clues.The game is full of other collectibles. They unlock some background info and additional ghost stories.In attempt to make NOCLIP - The Game a bit challenging, there are fights against demons. You can beat them with a QTE or sneak your way around them. These fights are very repetitive and annoying. And that is basically it. No other gameplay elements. This is not an adventure game, this is just an interactive movie with a boatload of collectibles.At least the level design is very open and nonlinear, partially due to NOCLIP. You can also return to old levels for the collectibles you missed. Sadly, you cannot do this if you complete the game. there is only one save slot and the last savepoint is just after a point of no return, luckily the only one in the game.Conclusion: Do not buy NOCLIP - The Game for the gameplay, buy for the story and the atmosphere. But you can get that as well if you watch a decent walkthrough, which saves you some money. Actually playing it only benefits you with achievements and trading cards.Frankly, To The Moon has the same issue as NOCLIP - The Game: excellent story, but awful and repetitive gameplay, kind of like collectible hunting as well. Yet To The Moon is praised by the press. I understand the bad reviews for NOCLIP - The Game, but I can hardly understand the difference.			"

Dull. Disjointed. A collectible-based game with permanently missable collectibles.The investigation mechanic should be great, but its implementation is usually just okay. Other times, the game is weirdly picky about which facts contribute toward a conclusion, and on more than one occasion the expected answer to ""what do I know about [thing]?"" is just ""[thing]."" In grainy, prerendered cutscenes, the main character will react with astonishment at details he's already stared at and committed to memory. The investigation into his murderer starts at square one, despite the opening scene showing he knew enough to track down and confront the killer. At no point does this police detective seem to understand how, why, or even that he did.Since the game has only about eight level maps, the transition between well-developed, fully funded zones and ""we're out of money, just make a maze with some combat arenas"" is stark. One level (toward the middle, surprisingly enough) is unique in having items that can be examined and generate a little popup description like clues do, but aren't clues and contribute toward nothing. The stealth combat is slow and frustrating; the only way to win is to walk up behind enemies one by one, hiding as necessary if spotted. And you will get spotted, because your movement speed is low, the enemies can turn around instantly at the end of their patrols, and the kill move requires you to hold a button and complete a simple QTE, leading to a surprising number of failures (though maybe that has something to do with using mouse & keyboard to play what is a painfully obvious console port). If you're killed, you get to attempt to sneak-walk behind the whole group again, one at a time. Fortunately, the enemies come in small groups, but even a small group is too large when each kill is so laborious, and the stealth options so minimal.ALSO: You can't use the mouse to confirm in menus, but you can (must) use Q, E, 1, and 3 to navigate them. The villain's identity, motives, and MO don't make sense when taken together, but the main character has no trouble reaching the right conclusion after you point out [thing] three times. Extras are the same six character models repeated over and over. There is one (1) enemy type. You can walk through walls, but not ghost walls, which apparently have unfinished business. I don't know if it's even possible to fail the escort puzzles; the hardest part was remembering to talk to the character being escorted after every step. You defeat the villain using abilities that are unexplained and have been established exactly once prior to the final showdown. I don't like this game. Ghosts are a bummer. "

												Absolutely no spoilers in this review.*Edited review now that I have finished the game. It took me about 7.5 hours(played it offline and steam doesn't track offline play) to complete this game and that is including time spent searching for collectibles and finding probably about 85-90% of them. So the complaints that the game is short are pretty valid. Had I skipped the collectibles I probably would have completed it in around 6 hours. That said, I loved every second of this game. The game probably doesn't have a lot of replay value either unless you want to go back through to finish the collectible stories or help any ghosts you passed up on your original playthough (there are only 3-4 of them though I think unfortunately.)So I played this game until 3 am and could barely drag myself away from the keyboard to go to sleep. I am absolutely enthralled by this game and I love it. If the rest of the game is as good as the first 4 hours I've played of it then it will easily be contender for my GOTY.The voice acting is awesome. A lot of the random civilians share the same voice actors but thats a minor thing. I recognize most of the random civilian voice actors from other big budget games. They are all great voice actors. So it seems the devs went with quality over quantity.The visuals are great. I feel like most unreal engine games have models that look like they are made of clay, but this game does not. The ghostly effects are really cool. The way the demons move is absolutely terrifying. Animations are great all around with the possible exception of some lip syncing here and there on the minor characters.The gameplay is fantastic.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the demons and being forced to run and hide until they lose your scent is pretty terrifying. Finding collectibles is awesome because once you find all of a set you unlock an audio short story with a piece of art and the stories are really REALLY good so far. Your ghost powers are pretty freaking awesome and the game rewards exploration with collectibles littered all over the levels. Helping other ghosts solve questions regarding their deaths and helping them move on is a great feeling. These little side mission stories are very well written and acted. Finding clues is somewhat similar to but much more enjoyable than it was in LA Noire. Once you find all the clues you do a little solving... puzzle I guess. You get three attempts to solve the puzzle. I don't know what happens if you fail all three attempts yet. But they are generally pretty self explanatory for the most part. It asks a question on the screen and you answer it by selecting the proper clue(s), sometimes in a certain order too. The game actually makes me feel like a ghostly detective. And the story itself is amazing so far. The 63/100 metascore completely baffles me because this game is great and easily one of the best gaming experiences of the year so far.I loved the ending. It wraps everything up in a smart way. I immensely enjoyed this game. If you have any interest in ghost stories or detective mysteries then you will love this game.			"

												Not a perfect game by any means, but well worth a sale pickup for the story, atmosphere and visuals.This wasn't a game at the top of my wishlist, but I have been eyeing it since it came out, and when I found it on sale at the HB store for $15 I jumped at the opportunity.  I wasn't disappointed - personally I really enjoyed the game.  The story is engaging, the acting is very good, the visuals and mood of the game are great.  I think a lot of people hating on it are either bandwagon-jumpers who haven't played it, or were just expecting a different kind of game.  A lot of complaints seem to revolve around a lack of action - you just sort of walk around and click where it tells you to.  And in reality there's not too much more to the gameplay, so if you want more then you probably won't like it.  I went in treating it as more of an interactive story - a glossed-up point-and-click adventure, if you will, and I wasn't let down.  The game does have legitimate problems, but for me none of them were deal-breakers, and were outweighed by the pros:Cons:- suffered from performance issues and fairly frequent frame rate drops, which got worse as the game went on- no ability to remap keys- the mouse didn't work for all the menu items- no chance to go back and finish collecting items once you've entered the final level, meaning you'd have to play through the game again in order to try and get everything.  As much as I like the game, I'm not interested in playing it all again just to finish up a few achievements- the demons were really more of an annoyance than anything - they should have played more of a roll or just been pulled altogether- a lot of the investigations were far too simple to solve, while a small few were unreasonably obscurePros:- Great voice acting- Great camera work- Great atmosphere- Great story- NOT too short - I put 12-13 hours into the game by taking my time, doing the side missions, collecting artifacts, and generally immersing myself into the really good story.  I'd rather play a really enjoyable 8-12 hour game than spend 2 or 3 times that on something I end up barely able to finish because I've gotten so sick of it (L.A. Noire springs to mind).  Besides, at 12 hours I spent barely over a buck per hour on it - that's pretty good value in my book.So overall it's probably not worth full price, but easily worth $15-$25, as long as you enjoy story-driven adventure games.

												Spoiler Alert: The main character dies. The good news is that it happens right at the start of the game. Then the game gets going. However, unlike some God of War clone this isn't a revenge fueled bloodbath of carnage and destruction. There isn't an ocean of ""enjoy to destroy"" cannon fodder to kill/loot on the way to the final boss. This is a supernatural redemption story in the vein of Ghost or Always with a dash of The Frighteners thrown in for a bit of fun.The bulk of the game will be exploring mutliple crime scenes as you piece together not only the reason for your own murder, but the deaths of many fellow spirits that you encounter along your main quest. In some regards I am reminded of the forensic analyst role from Heavy Rain. Once you have gathered enough clues in the crime scenes you can attempt to discern the next location that your journey takes you. The good news is that, unlike Heavy Rain, this game does not rely on timing based quicktime events to tell the story.However, the only real combat in the game does rely on a tried and true quicktime mechanic. This involves sneaking up behind the occasional demon and performing a stealth kill sequence to banish it. This involves a random quicktime sequence where you a flashed a direction to press along with an appropriate button/key. Not that deep.TL;DR version: If you are a casual gamer that isn't looking to mindlessly button mash your way through a plotless demon horde this is a nice change of pace. If you want some thing procedural like the Kings Quest, Monkey Island or Quantic Dream created games (Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain, Beyond) then you'll enjoy the storytelling. It would really fit in nicely with that friend that owns all the Telltale Games titles. Just don't expect a lot of white knuckle fragging.			"

												I really wanted to like Murdered: Soul Suspect.  The pun in the name alone gives it a couple of points straight off and I found the story enjoyable, with a well constructed supernatural mystery.  While the plot doesn’t break any new ground, it does make good use of its setting and archetypical characters.  But the game side of things really holds the experience back.  The puzzles are rather boring and quite easy, with most of the challenge being little more than a pixel hunt.  But what really ruined the experience for me were the tedious stealth sections that become longer and more frequent as the game goes on, without any variation to how they play out; they really interrupted an otherwise enjoyable story.Honestly, I wish this was a TV show or movie as it unfortunately doesn’t make for a terribly good video game.

												Although I do like this game, I would not recommend anyone to pay full price for it. I purchased it from Humble Bundle when it was part of a $1 bundle and that's honestly about how much it is worth.The gameplay is okay. While the storyline is interesting, general mechanics of moving your character around can be quite a pain. You only play in third person and the camera moves way too fast; apparently mouse sensitivity only seems to affect cursor movements on selecting clues. The demons, though 2spoopy5me at times, seem like an unnecessary add-in to the game. Also, your LMB/RMB and any keyboard function will randomly stop working. The game also only auto saves, so if you end up having any issues like that, go ahead and prepare yourself for any progress you may lose when you have to restart the game.			"

												- Investigating a murder scene involves picking up a certain amount of clues (walk around and click) and then pick out the 3 most relevant ones (Why yes, 'Dead Girl' is indeed a good clue in said girl's murder...). TL;DR: short, boring, doesn't make you feel like you solved anything.- Some people in this game get killed for the dumbest reasons.- 'Fight' sequences with demons are nothing more than QTEs that will slow you down and don't add much to the game.- Even though this game is only 5-6 hours long, I've had to convince myself to keep going and finish it.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Murdered Soul Suspect 

			Views: 109		

			Murdered Soul Suspect proclaims to be an deactivate game while being a ghost with a rich story. Available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/233290/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if...		

	Murdered: Soul Suspect is a console port detective game with a horroratmosphere that plays more like an interactive movie than a game.  Right off the bat, I was unimpressed by the whopping 30 frames per second that this game runs at, followed shortly by the delayed lineup of subtitles to speech.  	The story was cheesy and doesn't fit with the objective of the game;  starting out by stating that your ultimate goal is to reunite with a lost love,but then not mentioning that relationship for the bulk of the game.  As for the gamebeing a detective game, I would disagree with that and state that it is morelike a hidden object game that requires you search out 'clues' in a predeterminedlocation.  There is no deduction needed; all the clues are in one place, and the game holds your hand by leading you to the next clue and askingrediculously obvious questions.  	The ghosts, while contributing to the atmosphere, did absolutely nothingto add to the game.  For the most part, they were all from the same time period,and were supposed to add a spooky element, but as you are also playing as a ghost, and they disappear when you get close, they were more of a waste of timethan anything else.	I enjoy watching movies, but I buy games in order to, oh I don't know, play a game!  This game played like a cinematic movie, with about 20-25%of the game actual gameplay, and the rest being cinematic movies or dialogue.  Being made to move all across the mapp to get to the next action point does notcount as gameplay;  it is wasting time.	If you are interested in the story of this game, I would recommend goingto YouTube and watching the cinematics strung together rather than buy this game.It treats you, the player, as if you are an idiot that can't figure out anythingfor yourself.  Graphically the game gets by, as well as the level design.  The story is acceptable, but what little gameplay there is designed for thosethat can't deduce anything for themselves.  As a game, I cannot recommend this, if it can even be called a game.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												Got this in the humble bundle so I don't regret it entirely BUT within 10 mins I experienced two glitches that meant I had to restart from checkpoints. Other than that the game is basically a long cutscene with gameplay elements strapped on to make you feel like your doing something. The most annoying thing as that crimescenes can be pretty easily figured out but some mockingly require for you to locate every peice of evidence no matter how completely useless.Do not buy unless you like pressing 'x' when you're told to press 'x'			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a story-driven third-person investigative adventure game with some stealth elements. You take the role of Ronan O'Connor, a former bad boy turned good guy. Everything begins seconds after you've just been thrown from a fourth story window by the game's primary antagonist. The fall almost kills you and the subsequent bullets to the chest finish the job, meaning you play through the entire game as a ghost. Murdered: Soul Suspect plays out like a puzzle game along the lines of L.A. Noire. As a detective Ronan must uncover clues and evidence to track down the Bell Killer. As a ghost in limbo, Ronan has a number of abilities at his disposal. Although he cannot walk through external doors unless they are opened by someone else, once inside a building Ronan can walk through walls and other obstacles. He can fall great distances and not get hurt and he is able to possess people to read their thoughts, influence their actions and peek at their notes or at their computer screens. He can even possess other creatures such as cats to get to hard to reach areas. In addition to the primary plotline being very interesting, the game generally has a very well-designed backdrop, numerous side quests, and superfluous opportunities to discover more about the characters and places featured in the game.Another part of Murdered that works pretty well is the look of the game. When Ronan walks through the streets of Salem, he sees a mixture of how it is now interspersed with what it looked like during the witch trials of the 17th century. The modern Salem is in full color, but the old Salem is in blue and white, and the contrast is striking. The character models and cut scenes are also rendered well. Really, the production values for Murdered are about as good as you’re going to see in a game. The audio multiplies the eerie feeling as well, with some haunting background music. The music, combined with the sound effects works marvellously.I really liked the look, the atmosphere, and the story behind Murdered: Soul Suspect.Although at times the pace of the game can seem a little slow, I have found that Murdered: Soul Suspect to be an enjoyable detective experience – even if it is somewhat simplified detective work.If you’re a fan of mysteries, Murdered: Soul Suspect would be a worthy purchase. Overall 8/10.			"

												Right....first things first, this isnt a title you should get for full price but at least it was only half of that when it came out so I can respct that....but still think its not worth the price unless its on sale. This game has alot of mixed reviews but none great ones, this is because it falls very short on some expectations gameplay-wise because its freaking boring and empty. What isnt boring and empty is the story....I could go so far as to compare this as a story driven game. It can be very much enjoyble if you are not bothered by the ""run everywhere and pick everything up"" <basicly all the gameplay in a nutshell for this game. Of course there are some ""detective"" work though its basicly click on the words or events which are related (somehow) or that describe this scene by clicking words like ""Panic"", ""Begging"" or ""Happy"". Its impossible to fail the game, you could get caught by demons, click on all wrong ""detective"" events and it will just keep giving you chances to try again unles you do it. For my overall opinion I guess I can call this a relaxing game with basic puzzle-solving elements that you can stare at and let your mind go blank, its not a bad game even though its no challange and one time I nearly got stuck possessing a woman walking outside of a gas station. I enjoyed the story and there is a hell of alot of stuff collectables you can pick up and read. Thought its always worth finding all the collectables to unlock a ""ghost story"" audio, they can be a little cliche but damn they are entertaining to listen in. Oh and one last thing, sometimes its hard finding stuff to click on like clues, the detection on some of these are really small but they are always in the tiny area you search in....though just a heads up for the last thing you do near the end of the game where you only have 3 seconds to find something to click on... clue: ""hand"" Literally impossible with the 3 seconds you have to click on this tiny♥♥♥♥♥thing, I had to google it after clicking everywhere. >.<			"

												The best way to describe this game would be to say it's a mix of Ghost Trick and Silent Hill with a little Ace Attorney in there.  I enjoyed my time with the game, mostly to see how the story unfolds. The gameplay is nothing too special and mostly linear unless you are going for collectables (there are a lot). The writing is good for the most part but the delivery can be a bit strange sometimes. It took me just under six and a half hours to beat the game and I would recommend if you enjoy the games mentioned earlier. I also recommend going in without knowing too much about the game, which is why I don't want to write too much here.			"

												Nice Game, good story.Reminds me a bit of ""The 6th Sense"".Fans may like this either.If you start the game it feels like yourself being in a movie.At the beginning you see yourself dieing, while falling out of the window your breath stops.And you find yourself quite fast in the story. (+)Interesting fact in this game is the lead character, whom you identify yourself with - or try to, has a kind of standardish background. (-)For me this background thing is the only negative critics I can tell you about this game, because the riddles and cases to solve redeem the background.(++)Cases: Logically, not frustrating.Clear recommendation to buy !Thank you for reading.

												4/10  Murdered: Soul of Garbage CollectorI rated the gameplay with 5 and the story with 5. This game got 1/5 for gameplay 3/5 for story.-The game basically holds your hand through the whole game. There is no punishment for getting anything wrong, and some clues are really stupid. I figured out the run button long ago and the game tried to teach me that after a while.-Gameplay sucks, basically you run around and collect garbage. That is what you do, the only thing that made it even get that score was the story which isn't that great.-Characters are all have the same faces with the same thoughts. Salem had too many people with the same faces that if the killer was one of them, we wouldn't find him.-Demons are just in the way, they didn't make the gameplay any better. It made it worse since the design for the Ghost things to hid in was far away from you, or covered by a wall, or all of them in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ room which the demons don't even go in. Ravens that supposed to help you are either far away or the range of their screams doesn't reach the demon that you wana kill. And quick time event is not my idea of a fun game. Wish they didn't created the so called demons because they always delayed me from continuing the storyline. Boring @ss obstacles on the ground, forcing you to go around them because they are demon pits or something.-All the cats have the same color which is black in Salem.-Some places you think it should be possible to teleport to but you can't even though you did it during a story mode.-Some escorting missions are stupid and  HOW the hell would July sneak into the church without the police even noticing her?- there is a Ghost train, so how the hell does an object have a ghost? Why doesn't animals get ghost too, since objects with no soul can have ghosts.  Throw the logic on the ground when you play the game.- You can't recollect the other stuff once you reach a check point in the game. I tried to see the story about the (Need Gas) but with the game desgin you MUST reply the whole thing once you enter the Judgment house. Another example of  terrible game design (wish they had the chapter saving to return to the point you need to finish any achievement you missed during your first play through) instead you have autosave.+ The only thing I liked about this game was the graveyard thief story and nothing else.I pre-ordered this game and just got to play it. Wait for a sale to buy it, and don't waste more than 10$ on it.			"

												This game is quite fun, but totally not worth 30€ or how much it was without sale. It has a great potential, but it has not been fully utilised. (reading mind is not as fun as you would expect, you cant control people as ghost, etc.) I dont expect another Watch Dogs game with a ghost theme, but it would be more fun if there were more options what you can do as a ghost.Pros:+ interesting story+ interesting gameplay+ exorcising demons+ fresh ideaCons:- too short- sound bugs- too easy final scene- no save files (you cant play the game again if you dont want to delete your first progress)- you cant go back to the town to search for things after you finish the main storyIll let you know if i come up with some other pros/cons, this is it for now. After all its a good game, just too short.scrore: 75/100			"

												Just finished the game and I really enjoyed it. While it doesn't take long to play it through (I needed 8 hours and I took my time) it was fun while it lasted. I am not sure about the replay value, though. The game heavily relies on its thick atmosphere and the story twists to drive you along and I imagine it will be less fun the second time around. If you don't care for pages after pages of story or lots of cut scenes or do expect a certain amount of fighting in your games you should skip this one, though. There are a few ""fight"" scenes but you have to solve them through misdirection and stealth. No open combat. Still, if you do enoy a good story and an atmospheric game you should give this one a try. I recommend playing it at night or in a darkened room - both for the atmosphere and to see all the details on the screen. You should also take the time and gather as many clues as possible, especially for the small side quests. The stories are delightfully spooky.			"

												Murdered is an interesting yet flawed game. It has some good ideas but fails to execute them in a coherent fashion. Like all games created by numerous development houses spread across the globe it lacks a singular vision. Triple A games need painstaking pre production in order to succeed. Apparently the Ghost theme was pitched at Airtight by one of Square's creative directors.The game isn’t unholy bad. It runs well on my basic PC. The voice work and plentiful cutscenes flesh out the story. Which is an standard detective yawn with Salem trial overtones. There’s a whole host of collectables which unlock side story narratives. These are a strong point of the game and pad out what would be a rather limited experience.There is one striking feature / bug that the game has. Once you finish the main story arc, you cannot go back into the town and complete / solve any of the side missions you may have missed without starting a brand new game. This soured my overall opinion of the title. A shocking oversight that could have been fixed by a small patch. Unfortunately this will never happen as Square shuttered Airtight soon after the release of the game.Its a pity Airtight aren't around to make a follow up. I enjoy a good adventure story and for the most part Murdered delivers.			"

												Intresting idea with medicore execution.The game revolves around the idea of ghosts who are trapped amongst the living people and you try to help them to get a piece of mind. Main story is you (the ghost detective) trying to solve who killed you and why. World and story itself is kinda intresting and will surely suck you into the game, but NPC's make the game world seem very bland.There are couple side missions, but thats all there is, and combat is almost non-existent.WORTH: <10€Buy it if you want something different, but only if you can get it less than 10euros.

In this case there are no choices to make, but there is a lot of detective work do (which is pretty basic, you just have to find objects scattered around the crime scenes)!If you like these kind of games (and if you liked the Telltales games for their narrative focus), get it now!

												As a HUGE adventure fan that almost always prefers a classic 2D click'n'point adventure, Murdered: Soul suspect is a breath of fresh air to everything the adventure genre has to offer. The graphics are just amazing, and thanks to the Unreal engine, the game runs smooth as butther with everything maxed out.V-sync limits the game to 30FPS, but you can switch that off and just enable V-sync in your GPU options (Catalyst Control or Nvidia center) which gives you all the smooth awesomeness of 60FPS.The story of this game is brilliant, and the spooky atmosphere just adds to the overall setting of the game. The way you interact with your surrounding and figure out the clues is great, but I was hoping getting stuff wrong would give you a penalty of some kind... Then again, it is an adventure game and most of them are very linear.There is no combat apart from banishing demons witch can be really difficult at some parts but nothing an average gamer can't figure out.I was afraid that the ending will be a dissapointment compared to the massive build up of the story (and the bodies murdered) but the game really delivered. After YEARS of trying to find something different and new in the adventure game genre, Murdered: Soul suspect finally brings tons of new mechanics, great voice acting, an amazing story and a beautiful engine to finally burst life into a slumbered genre.Hats off to the devs and the writters.

												The game is really captivating while you are playing...it is a little bit short but the entire action is very exciting along with his good plot.If you play just following the story then you should be done in about 6 hours and this could be the only negative fact about this title.On the other hand the game has an intense nighttime amtosphere,captivating story and some kind of mystery on every level.Anyway the ghost story has something related to a thing which existed long time ago(has a thing related to reality but I'm not going to make spoilers).To conclude this is not just a simple detective game...is all about the souls trapped in our world because of bad things they have made and in the end you find why and what killed you.

												If the ghost fits...Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of those games I love to hate, the writing is pretty silly, the things you can do are pretty silly, things are all a little bit silly, but that's why I seem to find it so enjoyable! I will say the voice acting is pretty good and somewhat holds the silliness together, but as long as you don't take the game too seriously there's a lot(ish) of fun to be had. Soon you can be poltergeisting hoovers, fooling demons and talking in bridge metaphors. Only in... Murdered: Soul Suspect!Ps.

I was pleasantly surprised, as I kept delaying myself from playing it as I wasn't expecting it to be that great but it held my attention through the whole story and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen at the end!As a note, however, if you're more into really challenging games, this won't be for you. This is a game the focuses much more on the story unfolding and not so much on skill.			"

												This is a game where you are a police detective and you have to solve your own murder and can solve other cases in the meantime (while you're a ghost). The game takes place in Salem, Massachusetts and uses the Salem Witch Trials as the premis for the story. The game appears to be educational on the subject, but I can't tell you if everything they reference is fact; I did learn that Germany also had witch trials decades earlier.I had no technical issues with the game and I completed the game over the weekend in around eight hours. I enjoyed it enough that I played through it over two days. It's not at all a difficult or challenging game, but I feel like it was different enough to make me want to play through, help people, and find out what I could regarding the story and I was pleased.The replay value is very low to me, but it was definitely worth the one playthrough.

												just finished the game and got to admit, it got me addicted to the story like a drug. Couldn't think of anything but wonder what the next clues will add to the story. To sum it up:Story: 9/10Although it's a typical murder investigation, playing as a ghost trying to uncover clues makes the mystery more interesting. The side stories obtained by finding all the hidden objects on each map are very spooky and a good bed time story to wet the bed.Gameplay: 6/10Although it's nice to find clues and unfold the mystery, it's veeery repetitive and lacks diversity. Not much you can do but run through walls, teleport short distances and kill a few demons. other than that, you get bored fast from gameplay and you just want to finish the story faster.Graphics: 8/10I can't say it's bad, i can't say it's good. For a 2014 game, objects are edgy, characters lack emotions, but still, it looks ok. It's the bad textures from clues that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.Overall, i enjoyed the game very much, considering i got it on sale. I recommend it just to unwind from stressful multiplayer games and submerge in a story filled with mysteries. PS: could play a cat.			"

I hated the demons, because I was interested in the investigation and doing the side quests and finding about about the other ghosts. Still, despite the problems, I liked the game. The story was interesting and I liked exploring the town. It would have been fun to have more chances to play as a cat. Not having a chapter selection in the menu was a really bad choice from the developers, so if you're aiming at 100%, make sure you have everything before the point of no return where the final act starts (the game warns you about it).

												This is an amazing game. It felt different from other games I d played mainly thanks to the ghost walk through normal walls mechanics that create a unique path. Overall time to beat is probably shorter than mine, I have replayed quite a couple of levels to hunt for collectibles, some of them more than twice. I highly recommend it: it s got ghosts, witches, demons, murder solving. Why play this game: you wont get to shoot anything, but you ll get to destroy a handful of demons (damn these QTEs)			"

												Not a perfect game but worth your time.  The story is good and there is decent character development. It would have been noticably better without the demon segments though. It could have also been improved by highlighting clues when in ""ghost vision"" since some clues and collectables were way too hard to find.			"

												A pretty cool third-person detective mystery game set in Salem and influenced by the historical witch trials that happened there. You spend your time examining crime scenes trying to solve the mystery of your own death and the deaths of others. Graphics are really good, but it's a little bit short, and the gameplay is not so challenging. Its fun for a while.			"

												Writing this review immediately after finishing the game.Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third person adventure, with quite a few aspects of the horror genre. The game is rather short (Roughly five hours), and the combat in the game is simply sneaking up behind the enemies and pressing a combination of buttons. Although the combat was a bit repetitive, the story itself was rather interesting for me. You play as a recently murdered detective named Ronan, who is has been left behind as a ghost in the mortal world, because he has unfinished business, which won't allow him to join his wife; who has already moved on. In order for Ronan to move on he has to find out the mystery behind his killer. As he is a ghost, he can only tamper with very few things in the mortal world, so with the help of a young girl named Joy, they work together to unravel the mystery between the Bell Killer murders, as well as the identity of the killer.7.5/10			"

Final rating: $8.00-$12.00I was not impressed with this game. Being a story and visual based game, immersion is an important factor in the overall quality of my gaming experience. Graphical glitches aren't common, but there is some bad design. NPC character models were clearly designed to be standing all the time, because when you find them sitting it looks like their legs are growing out of their stomachs. Walking through walls in third person is fine until they start hiding traps on the other side for you to stumble blind into. First person renders you immobile for the duration of its use, which is bad if you accidentally pop it while being hunted. There's really not much gameplay, especially if you take the time to collect artifacts instead of progressing the plot. The only enemies are quite frightening until you realize that they don't change their patrol routes unless they see you, and reset if you hide for a while. Fighting them is all patience and quick-time events. The would be shining point of the game, the investigations, are all multiple choice questions that are either too obvious or too obscure. You can guess as many times as you want, losing marks from a three-star rating until you only have one left. I suspect the total number of these marks you have will determine the ending you get, if there even is more than one ending. Obviously I haven't finished the game. Running between objectives should be quicker for a ghost with no heart to give out or body to get tired, but the quickest you can go is a jog. The other characters you interact with are a waste of time. The wandering humans look alike and say the same things, and any conversation you get into with a ghost is choppy and slow. If you use a gamepad to play, your mouse will still pop up in the middle of your screen from time to time. Those are my gripes. It's a detective game for dummies.			"

												To be honest, I feel that this game got a lot more flack than was deserved. Is it perfect? No, but I think the criticisms were a bit extreme. Mind you, most of the criticisms I read were during the time that it was initially released and some of it had to do with bugs.I'm guessing that by the time I bought the game (4 months after release) all those bugs were fixed because I didn't really have any of the issues that they were talking about. There were times, however, I noticed that the narration would cut out. This happened in maybe 3-5 different cutscenes were there was just no sound at all - the only way I knew what was supposed to have been said during the scene was because I always have subtitles on.I think what hurt the game more than anything else was the story. It was okay, but I feel that it could have been better - more developed maybe. Also I feel like the characters were poorly written.I say this because I felt no emotion towards any of them whatsover. The wife was annoying, and there were too many random collectibles of her memories with him - I'm guessing like finding pages of her diary or something scattered around. I felt myself annoyed with all of these and couldn't care less about her or their relationship.The friendship or, partnership I guess, between Ronan and Joy felt really shallow. Since Joy is the character Ronan interacts with the most throughout the game, I was hoping for more development in their friendship.  Also the way Joy treated Ronan after he saves her from The Bell Killer is ridiculous. I'm not expecting her to want to help him right away but it was a bit much imho I couldn't even find myself caring about Ronan himself. None of the characters in the game were developed enough for me to root for them or care about them in anyway. Also I felt it was strange that all the events in the entire game takes place in one night. Why on earth was that one couple getting married in the middle of the night / wee hours of the morning? The demons in the game were laughable. It felt like it was just thrown in at the last minute to give the game some kind of combat in it. They should have either given the combat more diversity or taken the demons out completely, in my opinion. I didn't play the game with combat in mind so I wouldn't have cared if there was no combat in this game. There are perfectly good Adventure Mystery games with absolutely no combat in it (the majority of Sherlock Holmes titles for example).With all that negative out of the way now for the positives: I appreciate the game trying to do something different. I'm a big fan of Adventure Mystery type games and one that approaches it from the perspective of a ghost is innovative and interesting. I enjoyed walking through walls and possessing adorable felines, as well as the people around town.It would have been great if they expanded a bit more on this - more animals to possess, control over individuals in town like how Abigail was able to control humans to do her killings  , as well as being able to poltergeist more items.To sum up my review, I would recommend people to give the game a go. It's enjoyable and fun and I definitely don't think it deserved 59 on metacritic. I would rate it more of a 6/10. It's worth a play through to get to play and experience something different. The mystery is also relatively engaging.I just wouldn't get this game at full price - wait for a sale. I was able to scoop it up during one for 4.99.			"

(reading mind is not as fun as you would expect, you cant control people as ghost, etc.) I dont expect another Watch Dogs game with a ghost theme, but it would be more fun if there were more options what you can do as a ghost.Pros:+ interesting story+ interesting gameplay+ exorcising demons+ fresh ideaCons:- too short- sound bugs- too easy final scene- no save files (you cant play the game again if you dont want to delete your first progress)- you cant go back to the town to search for things after you finish the main storyIll let you know if i come up with some other pros/cons, this is it for now.

I'm not sure why people feels the need to write a review without finishing the game, if I had judged the game after an hour of playing it I would have turned it down too, but after an hour you're not attached to anything, if you're looking for instant gratification in a detective game, you should have never even installed it.At first the fact that its a console port nearly turned me off to it but I trudged on and found that its not all that bad.  I would recommend the game for those who likes the detective style game.PROS------------------------------* Well made storyline* Wealth of history about Salem during the Salem Witch Trials* Ronin and Joy are pretty memorable characters* Pretty original gameplay elements, such as modern infrastructure infusing with past infrastructure.* Great sudden turn of events often* Fair amount of collectibles to learn about side missions and such* Cinematics and voice acting are very well put togetherCONS------------------------------* Console port, you can't rebind keys which leads to mistakes sometimes, especially during QT events* Quick time events are annoying when you're trying to do them with a keyboard/mouse* Some glitches, but nothing game breaking* Not well optimized for PC, often stutters a little			"

If you're a fan of games like Heavy Rain, Indigo Prophecy, Beyond: Two Souls, Alan Wake (minus a lot of the action) and you like ghost stories in general, then you really ought to check this game out! I was pleasantly surprised, as I kept delaying myself from playing it as I wasn't expecting it to be that great but it held my attention through the whole story and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen at the end!As a note, however, if you're more into really challenging games, this won't be for you.

												Let's get one thing out of the way: ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" is not your normal action game. Actually, it is actually not an action game at all; it is more a story-driven adventure focused on exploration and (very logic) puzzle-solving that centers around clue finding and logic implications among them; the plot is thick, with lots of twists and turns all along the way which will nail you to your chair until you're done. There's only one caveat: it's rather short -- I managed to complete it in under 10 hours.There are also ""combat"" sequences against demons (ghosts that turned evil after forsaking what they were meant to ""fix"" in the living world before leaving it) that are more annoying than anything else as they involve hide-and-seek mechanics; I think that there is a lot of room for improvement in that area but I am not complaining too much.There is one more thing that I dislike though: the whole collectable item craze that the game is so soaked with. Some are in obvious places, others in less-obvious ones, while others are really unfindable unless you comb the town of Salem systematically -- and it's rather hard to do it without a map of the place. Through the collection of clues and items, you either go forward with the main story or unlock sidequests or insights about the protagonists and the town itself.When it comes to presentation, graphics are really good (locked at 30 FPS but there's no sensation of lag at all), the audio acting is well done and the music hits the spot without being particularly memorable.I recommend this game if you're into ghost stories (or well-written stories in general) and like to enjoy a slower-paced game that requires a minimum of thinking.My vote for the game: 7/10 (with a gameplay vote of 5.5/10 and one for the story of 8.5/10)			"

												TL;DR; 7/10This game is done very well. The features they implemented in it (like going through stuff, blocking off places thus hiding object from you, etc.) are good.However the controls are a little bit wonky. Sometimes you need to perfectly aim your sight to get what you want. One of the main features of the game is introduced late and not used as often as they could have.The story is is entertaining, but not the best. Eventually everything's coming together and there's a big surprise at the end. However if the bad guy had more role throughout the game, it could had a better score.I really can't tell anything on the graphics, my computer can't handle it on full details.

WELCOME TO SALEM, THE CITY OF THE UNEXPECTEDI had high expectations for this game, and even though it disappointing me for being kind of linear to play, actually the mystery involved in the game, and the way the narrate it, its quite good and it will make you wish to finish it till the truth is discovered. Pros: - Amazing plot.- Very cool narrative.- Ghosts stories about how they died, its quite human and realistic. A pleasure to read.- Good voice actors.- Music its ok, but I think it should been better.- The ending, if you are clever maybe you will figure out at some point of the game who is the culprit. But when you discovered the truth, there is some shocking stuff you will not foreseen. Cons:- The game its kind of linear, it gets easy sometimes. - The game have some bugs, so far I experienced the follow bugs:   * The game froze out of the blue sometimes.   * Sometimes the bots get stuck when they are supposed to move.   * The game closes by itself, just because. - _-Luckily, this bugs happens just rarely, but still, a game which was released a year ago, should've all of this already fixed.8/10, I had a lot of fun with this game. but I recommend to buy it on a sale.

												Enjoyable story-driven murder mystery. Not really exceptional in any way, but the story and mechanics are interesting. You play a detective who becomes a ghost and thus can walk through walls and do other ghostly stuff while investigating a series of murders. While item collection is heavily featured, it doesn't seem simply shoehorned in to increase the game's length. Each item you collect contributes in some way to the story background/context. The only part that got repetitive and predictable was the demon mechanic: I felt it only interrupted your progress while you dealt with them essentially the same way in every level. Recommended for its enjoyable story and original mechanics.			"

It might be a play it once type of a game but for Square enix to try something diferent i think they did a spot on job.			"

												What does it feel like to be staring down at your own dead body, lying helplessly in the street? To see police agents discussing what might have happened to you, without being able to tell them? The first thing you might notice is that being a ghost actually renders you painfully limited in your ability to interact with the world. Thankfully, there are advantages as well. And, as you will soon discover - what you can't do, someone else might be willing to do for you.I imagine some people are holding off on buying this game due to the moderate-to-bad reviews it has received. I'd like to argue differently. It is by no means perfect - I ran into a few bugs and the game even crashed on me in the final chapter. I was also not happy about not being able to change the key bindings. But the story and its two main characters made it easy to overlook these issues. A unique idea for a video game - not perfectly executed, but more than well enough to warrant a playthrough.			"

												As a game, there not much to this one. The puzzles aren't hard, and even so it's still trial and error without any repercussions. But still I really enjoyed this one. What it lacked in challenge, it made up for in story. And it's one of the few games nowadays where finding collectibles gives you a nice reward.So in short, if you want a nice laid back detective story, get this one. If you want a challenging puzzle/detective game, avoid.			"

												I just finished this game yesterday and it was pretty much everything I expected. It was story rich with some nice cut scenes, interesting plot twist and wasn't very difficult. Perfect since I was sick in bed all week with the fever, and this is the perfect game to play when you're not completely there. If you're looking for anything of a challenge though this is definitely not the game for you. There are also no choices that you can make that influence the game; so no replayability.I thought I would finish all side quests since I had read that they only add about 10 minutes extra per side quest. Actually now that I think about it I did finish all the sidequests, I just didn't find all the items that tell you some extra stories from salem. Unfortunately the game has a sort of battle system in the game with demons that look for you and try to eat your soul or something like that. Personally I hated these areas of the game the most, it didn't feel scary or add anything to the game, it actually just seemed really annoying, so I always rushed through the demon areas executing them as fast as possible (which just means walk behind them and press the execute command that was on screen). For me they could have just left the demons out and I would've enjoyed the game more. Or they could've made it hella scary and borrowed the run and hide system from ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"". Oh well there aren't that many demon areas so it was ok.Conclusion: It's a fun, easy, detective game that lasts about 6 hours  (10+ hours if you want to 100% the game) filled with fun cut scenes and an interesting storyline. However if I look at the price this game is goin for in the steam store (30 euros) I can't recommend you get the game for that price even though I do understand why they market it at that price. If this is the type of game you love it's probably worth it since the cut scenes are well done and yeah theres enough of salem to discover/investigate. But let's be honest, once you finish this game you will never pick it up again, so you're probably better off waiting for a sale. I paid 6 euros for this and other games (Square Enix 2 humble bundle) and I think games are worth it as long as you get 1 hour per euro. This game fits that rule for me so I give it 4 stars out of 5. If you paid more than 10 euros for this game however, I can imagine feeling screwed, so be smart and wait for it to be cheaper than 10 euros or get it in the humble bundle now! while you still can :)			"

												If you like the Blackwell series (and I would heartily reccomend the Blackwell games, I bought them on GOG not Steam), you will likely enjoy this odd beast. I got it in the half price sale and consider it worth the 12 some quid, but I wouldn't reccomend buying it at full price since it's a fairly short game and like most adventure games, low on replayability.This is a good game with some terrible game mechanic design decisions.Pros:Decent storyEnjoyable charactersInteresting ideas explored throughout - enough to overshadow the cons, for my money.Cons:Clatty interface, probably made worse by poor porting to keyboard and mouse. If you use a pad on your PC, you may have no issues.Some really annoying QTE's bracketed with unskippable cutscenes - especially the finale which should have been exciting and ended up being an exercise in impotent rage management.Unskippable end credits that run for 15 mins  - laughably bad decision.

												A very nice take on the point and click adventure games. It has what make those a games great. A great story, with plenty of supernatural, and creepy atmosphere to pull you into it. The acting is fenomenal, you do want to know what happend to this cop, and what will be the end. Sadly like most adventure games, suffers from the same weeknesses, and I am talking about the gameplay, just like other games of this kind, like The Walking Dead, great story but not much gameplay. The same thing happens here, I think that the game would have seen more success as an episodic game. Even with these problems, and it depenps if you consider this issues a weekness, you will enjoy the game. The story is more than capable to drive you  into it. If you still have doubts, wait for a price drop, but don't miss the chance to play it. Too bad  the studio behind the game, Airtight Games is no longer around. Hopefully there will be some sort of sequel, one can hope, after all, hope dies last.			"

												This is really a different type of game unlike any I have played before.  Basically you go around collecting items (alot of optional items) to get stories to read and unlock.  Often times you have to find clues and piece them together so the evidence tells a story helping you in your search for the serial killer.  While the game looks pretty decent graphically, there are times where things just fell off.  For example the killer could have just murdered someone in the town yet some of the peoples mood in the town does not reflect that.  There are times when some townspeople say the same exact thing by the same voice actor or actress.  One time near the end of the game I read this old ladies mind and had the voice of a teenage girl.  There are somel moments in the game where you have to be stealthy to avoid demons and you do have the option of killing them .   As the game progressed I was more interested in how the story would develop and there was a nice plot twist towards the end.   Its a fairly short game which was the main reason I played this game after reading alot of less than positive reviews.  I'll give the game 5/10  and recommend buying it if you can get it really cheap.			"

												For those, like me, who enjoy problem solving games, this was great. It wasn't an intense action game, but simple observation which I enjoyed.Over the course of the game, you can uncover ghost stories as well that aren't even critical to the gameplay, just bonuses. That little mechanic made it feel more immersive considering the story wasn't riding on backtracking or extra digging.Something that stood out for me in the way of dialoge was that everyone who speaks doesn't necessarily talk one at a time. Characters will get cut off and complete their thoughts later in a way that doesn't sound like a script nor rehearsed, with exception to the protagonist's classic-detective style inner monolouges.However, the quick-time controls felt awkward, the game was too short (beat it within twelve hours with a majority of the achievements done), and many ""clues"" didn't seem to make sense when trying to piece crimescenes together. The promise of unique abilities (""personal strengths becoming abilities) was limited to maybe one or two involving revealing information (which felt closer to the protagonist's job rather than his actual strengths). Even only one other ghost displayed only one unique ability that didn't seem to connect to their character. All of the other abilities you gain belong to the other ghosts you find as well, making the protagonist (and the other ghost with a unique ability) possess very cookie-cutter characteristics.Very little direction is taken towards obstacles you run into like the demons, spiteful cops, or paranoia plaguing the area, thus leaving much more to be desired in character development.""Extra"" characters aren't even kept within the game for very long, making it feel as though there are only four real characters, and many filler characters.I ""did"" enjoy the game and do recommend it for those who enjoy dark, investigative, or easy-paced games. Sadly this has little to no replayability and would wait for it to go on sale for $15 or under given it's short story and neglect to several details I mentioned earlier.			"

												A very interesting history makes you want know more about the protagonist's passed life and his murder. The story about the city makes some links between facts in the game (now days) and the past. There are a few combats, but all are easy. I got a very few bugs ( one or two, I think), but nothing important. An easy game, easy cases to resolve. The game runs in AMD Eyefinity very nice w/o any mods. The end of game is very reflexive. Vivid atmospheric, complementary narrative of protagonist, large exploration areas, makes a fun game.			"

												First thing first. Is it worth buying this game full price? Well, story is quite nice. The ending even surprised me, which is good, but in the game there is nothing challenging. Ok, there are few demons, who try to collect your soul, but meeh. Those things are easy to kill.If you like detectives you, then you should buy this game. Im one of those guys who run around the map to collect all thing you can collect. Well, this time I didn't collect everything, so mostly main story + fast roaming around to search other stuff is about 7h of gameplay. So think if you want to pay full price for 7h of gameplay.This game is not perferct, bet there' s something to think about.7/10Take it on sale. :)			"

												MURDED: SOUL SUSPECT (apparently the CAPSLOCK key of the developers is broken!) is a really good game. Really good. Repeating for emphasis!Of course, I'm going to complain about something, so lets get the irrelavent bit out the way first.I'm playing this on a PC. So tell me Airtight, where is the Start button? I really hate the consolification of PC games. I don't need a silly screen where I have to ""Press Start"" to continue. When I want to quit the game, I don't want to be returned to ""Press Start"" so I can then choose ""Exit Game"" from the menu. I thought I made my intensions clear when I initially said ""Exit Game"" from the in-game menu. Meh, who am I kidding. Might as well wish that developers didn't include stupid not skippable logo's and videos each time the game starts.And... CHECKPOINTS? This was almost a deal breaker. MSS is an adventure game. Since when did adventure games need checkpoints? This leads to my major crisitism of the game, but as I'll defer that until the end where it belongs.So, what's good about the game? Well, pretty much everything. Atmosphere is brilliant, I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of the ghost world ontop of the real world, past mixed with the present. It worked amazingly well. Graphics and environment design top notch.Audio is generally good, but there's a few places where you had ""what is making this sound"" puzzles and two of these the proported sounds didn't really match the clues, but no biggy. I also confess to jumping out of my skin on more than one occasion when the demons annouced their arrival.The investigations were nicely done and nothing too complex (which is both a plus a minus, sometimes it felt a little easy, at other times I was greatful I wasn't trying to work out some insane and illogical inventory puzzle), and the story was engrossing. Each major area in the game also has a themed set of collectibles, which once all obtained give a nice little backstory to the area.The checkpoint system generally works, but take heed - when you get to the final act, the game mentions if you continue you can't go back. By this point I was treating MSS as a open world type game, running around picking up things I'd missed and so on. I assumed, like all open world games, that once I'd finished the main mission, I'd be free to find the last missing side quest in the town center. Nope, I was wrong. When it said you can't go back, you really can't. And there's only a single damn save for the entirely playthrough.Fortunately I have a backup from a couple of days ago so I can at least replay the latter half of the game to find my missing items rather than the whole game, but I did think this a pretty dumb design decision.One other astoundingly bad design decision is the very final act of the game. Remember that MSS is an adventure game - you play it at your own pace, looking around for clues, collectibles, backstory etc. There's a few semi-quick time events involving demons that spawn. These aren't too bad, just annoying as each event uses a randomized key combination. There are similar QTE for demons that come through the floor but for most of the game you'll avoid these.The final scene however involves two very brief timed events where you have something like 20s to do one thing then 10s to do another. This made me pretty angry actually, I've spent hours playing this lovely creation, then you force the last 30 seconds with no time to do anything but try and do the right actions.Combine that with the fact that I couldn't return to the open world, meant my last memories of the game are negative, which is a shame because the climax of the story was excellant, and the little twists amazing. This is a game with an excellant story! What a shame a couple of silly design decisions have offset that.I've just read on a wiki that Airtight closed a month after releasing MSS, which seems a travesty along the lines of TTLG closing after Thief 2. Disappointing news, as I was greatly looking forward to the possibility of further games in the series.In short, excellant game, buy it, play it, enjoy it! And commiserate over the fact that they might not be any follow ups. (And probably spare a curse for the publishers that probably cause the shuttering)			"

												I can't recommend this. I don't mean to diminish the efforts of those who worked on this game. I want to acknowledge it, clearly a good bit of work was put into this game, but in the end if someone was to ask me ""Should I spend my money and time on this game?"" I would have to say no.GraphicsReally great. The models and textures are finely detailed. The environments are beautiful and cluttered, as they should be. You can really have a lot of freedom when your character doesn't care about most collision. Only one texture stood out to me as bad: the police badges. It was sort of distracting when it was right in the camera sometimes. The engine runs beautifully as well, I was able to turn everything to its absolute maximum and run with only a few hitches, even with the anti-aliasing at x16 and HBAO at high definition. I don't think I've had any other game run so well with similar graphical settings.What really confused me was the pre-rendered cutscenes, they were everywhere! This game probably would have been a couple gigabytes smaller without all the unnecessary pre-renders. I don't know if it was for consoles or something, but they never did anything in the cutscenes that they didn't also do in live render. The most baffling cutscenes were the dialogue trees where characters would just sit in their idle animations waiting for me to select something, then pop into a pre-render. They were actually rendered at worse settings then encoded with Bink Video, resulting in a pixelly mess that just made me confused and annoyed.Sound designVery good with some few nitpicks. Stumbling into the little spirit traps on the ground makes an annoyingly loud orchestral sting, which isn't really necessary when Ronan's gasping in terror and the screen is doing everything it can to make me feel attacked. There was a weird bug where sometimes cutscenes wouldn't have audio until I restarted. Overall however, the ambient music was subtle yet evocative.StoryWell-paced and keeps you interested. Unfortunately it's kind of short. It's not that it needed to be any longer, I felt it wasn't rushed at all. The main characters are well written and voice-acted and the random citizens are well voice-acted, but the stories you unlock for collecting all the things are not so good. It was sort of a letdown after running all over the place, only to be rewarded with the actors sighing and pausing and ""ohh what a terrible experience"" when somehow they all sound like the same person being told how to be scared rather than feeling it.GameplayThis is a large part of why I can't recommend this. It's a murder mystery where you run around collecting clues at various scenes and putting them together to come to conclusions, but it wasn't done all that well, really. I felt quite often that a clue I had to pick didn't really make any sense, because I HAD to pick three or I apparently couldn't come to a conclusion. Sometimes I knew what the game wanted, but was able to pick out several other clues that could lead me to the same conclusion, that I could see people picking and being annoyed that they got it wrong. Sometimes the conclusion didn't make any sense. Are you sure she's being taken to that gallows in particular? Salem, Masseschussetts has no other gallows sitting around? All the other murder scenes were improvised and scattered everywhere, it didn't have to be right there and it didn't have to be a hanging anyway.There's no real consequence to being wrong except that you don't get ""three out of three badges"". Frankly, I wish there was just no consequence at all. The game doesn't need to tell me that I have to solve the murder, I know I have to solve the murder because I'm invested in the character and I care about the story. The annoyance of the game telling me I'm not perfect at its flawed system really dragged me out of the investigations. The only real consequence happens at the very end of the game in a terrible timed sequence that isn't really timed anyway because it pauses while you make your selection.CombatOkay, but ultimately pointless. Demons float around on limited paths and you have to execute them from behind. They can't see you through walls, but you can see them through anything. If they see you, they'll start sucking out your essence which works through walls, even walls that you can't normally walk through. It doesn't even matter if you get really far away from them, you'll die. However, sometimes I could break the drain for seemingly no reason by running through a bunch of walls or going down stairs. What you're supposed to do is hide, but that system sucks because the demons just go straight to the spot you're in, despite ""not being able to see you"". If you don't move to another one, they'll push you out and then your camera will probably get stuck in them, so you can't hide again. If you are able to, they'll immediately go back to searching for you even though they just saw what you did.That ended up being kind of a mess, but that's the whole logic of the combat in this game. It makes zero sense. They can't see you when you're behind a wall, hiding, or just more than ten feet from them, but they can ALWAYS see you if they're draining you, but not if you hide, even if you were just about to die and they're two feet from you. Other demons won't notice you killing their ""friends"". Ronan instantly knows how to kill them even though he can't do things as basic as teleportation (which he also instantly learns when he decides to 'figure it out') and it doesn't seem remarkable that he's able to kill them with ease, even though everyone else is scared of them. So basically, it was slapped into the game to pad the length and fill out the environments.AnimationGet a facial animator! Please for the love of God get a facial animator, Squenix! Every game that you make is played by terrible over-body-animated mannequins! I wish I was exaggerating! The models are great, but the fact that they rarely move their eyes, eyebrows, nose, cheeks or even lips to do anything that isn't lipsyncing is so frustrating. A few scenes had me watching the characters' backs while they talked, which was really immersive. The good acting, writing, sound design and rendering, all of it worked together, just to be ripped apart when I saw their faces.The endingLiterally every resolution in the ending happens offscreen. Deadlines, budget cuts. I don't know. Joy gets her own self out of the noose and bindings somehow, despite that these are devices made to require someone else's help. Rex is fine but we never see him get up or say a word about literally being possessed. He's not accused of anything and nobody thinks that this is strange. The two officers that were forced to murder-suicide are never mentioned, not that they should have known he was there, and also it was only the two of them and no backup for the freakin' Bell Killer, who's been known to have superhuman strength and abilities. Joy meets her mother, but we never see more than the back of her leg and hand after she's the centerpiece of the plot. Baxter is ignored. Ronan gets his peace but we don't even get to see Julia again. There is no mention of the resolution to the Bell Killer case. The ending is all of thirty seconds long, but they're more than happy to force you to sit through the credits for five minutes.In the end it's just a letdown of an experience, even if it is pretty.

												Playing Murdered: Soul Suspect is akin to watching a tugboat wreck into a freight train.  It shouldn't be happening, it's the most ludicrous scenario you could possibly imagine but somehow you just have to watch the tragedy.  This game is FAR from perfect and a once n' doner.  IMO it's absolutely not worth the 29.99 price tag and I find it hard to believe it was going for over $50 for quite sometime.  I got much more value from budget games like Curse: Eye of Isis or Hard Reset than I did from this disasterpiece, yet Soul Suspect is enjoyable and I couldn't seem to put it down for the 8 and a half hours it took me to reach my goal.  I think the game performed so poorly with professional reviewers because it's simply not what you expect.  At heart, the game is like an old school point and click, detective adventure with some demonic combat and fetch quests thrown in.  In the game you play as Ronan O'Connor; a sleuth murdered at the hands of the Bell Killer...a sort of Jack the Ripper type serial killer stalking the infamous town of Salem.  The plot of the game is interesting if not somewhat predictable, mish-mashing together a bit of ideas from film (Seven, Silence of the Lambs) with the hard-boiled whodunnit atmosphere of LA Noire.  Some of the plot twists you can see from a mile away, but there's some that were at least somewhat of a surprise.  The story is told at a brisk place with cut scenes between present and past (the Salem Witch Trials) with the voice acting being strong enough to keep you involved and invested.  Ronan is voiced well enough, but sometimes the writing is a little untentionally cheesy.   Thankfully, in the context of a hard-boiled, noir style mystery it works and causes a chuckle or two without being too too flat.  Gameplay/atmosphere wise you run around the town of Salem which is setup as a mini-sandbox.  If Airtight Games had more time and money to put into the project, one could only wonder just how amazing this game could have been.  You can't enter alot of the buildings, leaving you to run around between finding various collectibles, taking on a scant few side quests and finally going to one of the city's main locations for the main action.  The graphical detail isn't overly impressive, but it's solid with decent characer models, appropriately dingy gothic design and some cool locales to explore.  Animation is stiff, the framerate is sometimes choppy and sometimes the items you need to collect will glitch in and out of existence making it a royal s.o.b. to pick them up.  The voice-acting as stated earlier was well-done although the ambient effects (besides the sinister demons you take on in stealth combat) aren't anything particularly special.  The gameplay slides between sleuthing, stealth action, fetching and exploration.  You'll come across numerous crime scenes and points of interests where your main goal is to search, examine and interrogate for clues.  Everything plays out like a stripped-down, beginner's version of L.A. Noire.  Sometimes your ghostly abilities will come into play such as possession to get inside people's heads, teleportation to get where you need to go, passing through walls, etc.  Initially, the gameplay is fun but as the game progresses you can see how basic it is.  You shouldn't need a walkthrough at all for this sucker because everything is laid out just how you need.  Once you've collected enough clues you can solve the crime scene by selecting the appropriate hints and picking the order of their importance.  It's a shame that your'e a ghost with such cool abilities but they feel second nature.  You will not be punished, nor will anything change even if you screw things up.  The game is linear to a fault.  Yet, these sequences are enjoyable enough in an old school point n' click style that it's fun.  If you can think past how the game always seems to cramp and rope you into doing what it wants you to, you'll be interested in how solving each puzzle advances the story.  To break things up you'll get the chance to possess a cat and use it to explore hard to reach areas.  The other main shake of the gameplay is stealth combat where you take on floating demons that look like monstrosities culled from Clive Barker's Undying.  They are actually pretty creepy in the way that they scream and hunt you down if they spot Ronan.  The only way to kill them is to engage them from behind, entering a quicktime button combo that will take 'em out.  Once alerted they can be tough to escape as your only means of protection is to hide in spiritual residue left behind from poltergeists.  You can jump from one residue host to another, leading to a cat n' mouse game where you try to get the upper hand on the beasties.  It's a fun addition to the gameplay variety but like most things in Soul Suspect it's awkward and feels undercooked.  By far one of the most enjoyable parts of the game were the sidequests, where you help dwelling spirits find out the manner in which they died.  These murders have somewhat of an emotional, human element to them (as stated by a few reviewers) that makes you want to help the poor schleps get some eternal rest.  Each quest is set up as a mini-mystery where you canvas a crime scene and put the clues together.  The only problem is that there's about 5 of them total.  If more were added it would have been a great thing.  Once again this represents just how much of a missed-opportunity Soul Suspect is across the board.  For those after Steam Achievements there's a ton of stuff to collect, but some of it's level specific, so if you miss it...too bad.  You have to start the game over again from square one and give it another shot.  Maybe some of you will but I sure won't.  I got 73% on a first try and I nodded afterwards saying to myself, ""Good enough, good enough.""  It would have been cool if you could start the game over as a new game plus.  I started it over briefly and it seemed to reset everything.  From a technical standpoint things aren't perfect either.  The game ran fairly smooth most of the time but several drops in framerate got me killed by demons about 2 or 3 times, I had about 4 game freeze crashes and I also got the end of cemetery level glitch.  None of these are game breaking, so you can get through them without losing too much progress.  To break it down:Pros:-Salem is a killer game setting.  -Involving storyline with great atmosphere-Fun mix of sleuthing, adventure, stealth combat and pick a path gameplay-Side quests and collectibles are a plus-Strong voice acting-Decent graphics and soundCons:-Pseudo sandbox gameplay is too linear-Easy puzzles and difficulty-Cool ghost powers but all of 'em are quite restricted-No branching paths for messing up the detective gameplay-Can't carry over collectibles that I saw-Some minor annoying glitches-Undercooked combat-Once you beat it, there's really no reason to go backThough I have alot of qualms about what Soul Suspect coulda been, what's there is worth playing through once.  Somehow for all of its flaws, there's a charming veneer lurking behind the game's black tooth smile.  The story in and of itself makes it worth a playthrough.  Whether you'll want to pick it up a second time is going to be an iffy, p2p decision.  I'd say this game is worth no more than $15 if you're going to pick it up.  I got it on a holiday sale for a few bucks and it more than exceeded my expectations in terms of value.  I'm pretty sure I paid $5 and could have seen paying as much as $15 for it.  But for $30?  No way Jose!    Final score:  7/10			"

												Quick Summary: Murdered Soul Suspect is a mystery game more than an action game, so if you’re looking for a shooter or platformer, you won’t find much of that here. I haven’t really played many mystery games so the closest that I can compare this game to is the “investigation” portions of the Batman Arkham series, where you’re in a room with crime scenes trying to piece together what happened. The game has a ton of collectibles, both quest related, and for background on the story, making the experience immersive and decently long if you actually stop to read everything.You play a police detective named Ronan, killed during an investigation into the “Bell Killer,” a serial killer terrorizing the town of Salem. Yes, it’s the Salem with the Witch trials from hundreds of years ago, and the history of the town will play into your investigation. You’re not alone on your quest though, since a local “medium” who can see ghosts such as yourself, has her own investigation to follow and it happens to coincide with yours. Good thing too, since being a murder victim means you can’t interact with most of the living world.As a ghost, Ronan has access to certain powers such as the ability to move through solid objects, “possess” random people (you don’t really control them), “reveal” memory remnants, and later on you can teleport short distances.  The game is played in third person perspective with a lot of narration by Ronan, giving it a sort of noir feel (reminds me of Alan Wake, but with no shooting). The town of Salem is pretty small in this game, and despite being a ghost, a lot of areas are off limits to you because of walls and buildings being “consecrated.” There are 2 worlds that you can see at the same time, the real world (that you can walk through objects in) and a ghost world (mostly walls and objects that block your movement). The town is also littered with ghosts other than yourself that you can talk to. Some of them have mini quests (investigations) that you can take part in, but most of them are just there for short conversations, adding to the game’s atmosphere. I actually stopped talking to random ghosts about 1/3 into the game since most of them don’t have anything story related to tell you.As I mentioned before, this is not an action game so you don’t really fight anyone, however there are a number of “demons” roaming the town in story related areas. You can either avoid the demons by stealthily sneaking around, or you can try to banish them by sneaking up behind them and executing a quick time event. You can see the demons through walls, so it’s possible to get around them if you have ninja hiding skills. Frankly, I suggest banishing them all so you can roam freely and pick up all the collectibles in each area. Pros:+A decent, slow paced mystery story with some twists and turns. You’re playing this game for the story more than anything else.+The investigations are kind of fun, searching for clues and piecing together events after you’ve gotten the hang of it.Cons:-If you’re mostly into shooting games, you may find yourself bored. There’re some stealth sections, but the majority of the game is puzzle solving and searching for clues.-The game uses an autosave system that isn’t very well explained.  There are times where it shows the “saving” icon, but if you quit and reload you’ll be missing a bunch of progress/clues.  I recommend completing side quests separate from main story sections (don’t go back and forth between side quest and main quest) and then move on to the story section. The only time I could be sure the game had saved was when I entered a new area in the story.Overall, I’d recommend this game if you’re looking for a moderately easy “thinker” game, and are taking a break from action/shooting. If you’re just going through the main investigations of the story and not bothering with side missions or collectibles, you can probably finish in about 7 hours.  "

Rating: 7.5/10Short thoughts:Overall, I very much enjoyed playing Murdered: Soul Suspect and would definitely recommend it for those who are looking for a cool story about a ghost detective in the town of Salem looking to crack the case of his own murder. Longer thoughts:The story is based around a murdered detective named Ronan who is a pretty cool and has the outfit to match (and never ending cigarette). Ronan travels around the town of Salem investigating his own murder case as well as those of other townsfolk. Main story was enjoyable, as well as the side mini-stories fueled by the collection of 'evidence' around the town. The ghost aspect was neat, as you could walk through walls, possess people and animals, influence their thoughts and more of that nature. Could have used some variety in the options of interacting with NPCs, but I didn't mind it much. The game has a simple combat system which I found to work out great in the end as it allowed you to continue focusing on the story rather than get distracted and spending hours sneaking by monsters as some other games have you do. In the end, I am very satisfied with how this game played out and do not regret purchasing it one bit. However, I would not recommend purchasing this at full price (~$30), but if it can be found on sale below that, I would definitely suggest picking it up.			"

												Spent 14 hours to finish this game and get almost all of the collectibles, except the Ghost Girl Messages because they were hard to find and I was too lazy to backtrack and find them all. So here's my take on the game.Gameplay:Many people compare this with L.A. Noire but I think the two games are vastly different. This game leans more towards an adventure game, if I have to find another game to compare it with, this game is pretty close in concept to the Blackwell Series (which is awesome, go grab it) in that the game asks you to solve a murder mistery and also help other spirits move on by helping them to know why they died and resolve their situation. In a way, it's almost a 3D version of the Blackwell series, with the emphasis on adventure, finding clues and solving puzzles.Some people complained that the stealth action parts of this game (exorcising demons) are too difficult and annoying. I think it's not that difficult, but if you DO find it hard and it breaks the game for you, there's a simple cheat/patch out there that you can use to completely nullify the stealth action parts and turn it entirely into an adventure game, which might help make this game infinitely better for you.Story:Personally, I think the story is the main strong point of this game. As a lover of classic supernatural adventure games, such as the Gabriel Knight series, this IS the game for me. I also love games that are based on history or cult stories (such as the Assassin's Creed series), and knowing that this game mixed some real history (the Salem witch trials) to the plot just makes it more immersive for me. There is even one character from the Salem witch trials history that appears here, which might surprise some that are in the know of this story.But as with any story out there, like when watching a movie or reading a book, this section is entirely subjective and either you like it or you don't. If you find out that you don't like the premise, then you have no reason to play this game at all, as there is nothing else to find here if you dislike the story. It will quickly get boring for you.Graphics:Played this game on my ASUS laptop with GeForce GT650M 2GB DDR3 graphics and the game runs fine on mostly high settings (see the screenshot I posted of this game for more details) with no stuttering framerates or slowdowns. The graphic quality is awesome and totally realistic, from the facial expressions of the characters to the textures and clothings. Ronan, especially, is rendered with truly amazing detail, I was a bit speechless when I saw his semi-transparent ultra-detailed character model during the opening moments. If you have a decent graphics card, this game can render truly amazing details for your enjoyment.Sound:Voice acting is very good, especially for the lead character Ronan. The music and ambient sounds successfully brings out the haunting and crreepy atmosphere of the story. The sound effect is carefully designed to great effect, especially the shrieks of those demons which can literally get you jumping out of your seat if you're playing with headphones on during the middle of the night.Weakness:There is no in-game map. But the town of Salem is not that large and pretty soon you will be able to get your bearings around town by memory alone. The only difficult route to remember was probably the one that leads to the church, because you need to take a specific route to get there. If you're worried about getting all the collectibles, there are a lot of guides and videos out there that can help you, so you don't have to worry about that at all.Verdict:7.0 - A must buy for mystery/murder/detective adventure game lovers out there, especially those who loved the Gabriel Knight or the Blackwell series.TIP: Don't buy it with the full price. This game often goes on sale, so better wait for it to go on sale and grab it. I got it for just $3.99 during the most recent Square Enix sale.TIP #2: Play with a game controller, not with a keyboard and mouse. It will make a whole lot of difference and can make or break the game for some people.			"

												The game is really captivating while you are playing...it is a little bit short but the entire action is very exciting along with his good plot.If you play just following the story then you should be done in about 6 hours and this could be the only negative fact about this title.On the other hand the game has an intense nighttime amtosphere,captivating story and some kind of mystery on every level.Anyway the ghost story has something related to a thing which existed long time ago(has a thing related to reality but I'm not going to make spoilers).To conclude this is not just a simple detective game...is all about the souls trapped in our world because of bad things they have made and in the end you find why and what killed you.

												A very nice take on the point and click adventure games. It has what make those a games great. A great story, with plenty of supernatural, and creepy atmosphere to pull you into it. The acting is fenomenal, you do want to know what happend to this cop, and what will be the end. Sadly like most adventure games, suffers from the same weeknesses, and I am talking about the gameplay, just like other games of this kind, like The Walking Dead, great story but not much gameplay. The same thing happens here, I think that the game would have seen more success as an episodic game. Even with these problems, and it depenps if you consider this issues a weekness, you will enjoy the game. The story is more than capable to drive you  into it. If you still have doubts, wait for a price drop, but don't miss the chance to play it. Too bad  the studio behind the game, Airtight Games is no longer around. Hopefully there will be some sort of sequel, one can hope, after all, hope dies last.			"

												I thought this game was just another 'chase the killer' filler game with the only difference being that now you are dead, but this game is so much more. Of course it's not near LA Noire in the detective stuff but the story is so well written and the plot so good you don't even care if the dude who voices the nords in Skyrim plays 90% of the npcs, it stills good. Also be prepared this game has PLOT TWIST AFTER PLOT TWIST and its awesome! It's like playing into an movie full of terror tropes but yeah no scary party. 09/10 Gonna go play again and get all the achivments this time!			"

Short version:+ Amazing detective story + Background stories of characters to uncover+ Possess cats and never ending cigarette+ No need to use doors, just walk through walls- Obviously made for consoles-- Boring and linear gameplay-- No action, apart from demons= 6.5/10Long version:First of all, this game has a Metascore of 59/100 and I can kind of understand why. This is not about the story or the characters, but mainly because of the gameplay.WARNING: minor spoilers (not really spoilers, but just in case, you know). Marked them.Story: The story is simply ah-ma-zing. In my opinion, it’s a great murder mystery in which you have to solve your own death (and prevent others from dying too). The whole ghost-idea is greatly elaborated in the story and makes the whole thing quite original: you’re not the usual cop who has to solve the usual murder mystery. The game has some great (and by that I mean unexpected and mind-blowing) plot twists. And, honestly, I didn’t expect the actual murderer to be the murderer, if you know what I mean.Characters: I LOVE how the characters’ stories become clear throughout the game. Most of the characters’ stories are quite vague when you start the game, but as you progress and collect artifacts, you learn more about each one of them. It made me want to keep playing, not only to know who my killer was, but also to know more about other people’s lives and deaths (and Ronan’s tattoos, for example). The side quests are nice additions to the story; they aren’t very long, but quite interesting, too. The main characters aren't really stereotypes, in my opinion. For example, the fact that Ronan was a gangster himself while he was young, doesn’t make him the stereotype cop (not really sure if spoiler, but marked just in case). It makes the game much more interesting than your usual detective story. The side characters, on the other hand, are much more flat and typical.Gameplay: Not great. Even boring, after a while. You walk around in Salem, investigate surroundings to find clues, possess people (and cats!), hide from and defeat demons, poltergeist stuff, and, well, that’s about it. It’s the same thing over and over again, for the maximum of 15 hours of gameplay the game has to offer (one playthrough). No real puzzles, just looking around and finding things. No real action, I believe there’s a maximum of 20 demons to defeat throughout the game. The combat is boring: you have to sneak up to them and kill them with nothing but your bare hands. You have no defense apart from some hiding spots. The demons are in my opinion unnecessary and only a burden to the game. The game’s pretty linear, too. You have no choice but to follow the storyline. Between cutscenes, you can walk around freely in Salem and the areas you’ve already visited throughout the story.Also, it’s obvious this is a game made for consoles, not for pc. I mean, “Press START”? You’re joking, right? You’re unable to change the controls, so if you’re playing with an AZERTY-keyboard, you’ll have to change the language settings of your pc. I really recommend playing this with a controller, if you have one: it suits the overall gameplay much better.Other: Great graphics. The creepy music fits the atmosphere and story perfectly. Good voice acting. Achievements are relatively easy to obtain, apart from some artifacts. Also, DO NOT ENTER THE MUSEUM IN THE END OF THE GAME before you’ve collected all artifacts! You won’t be able to return, or play the whole game from the start to collect the missing ones.Conclusion: I was doubting whether I would go for recommended or not, since the gameplay is such a disappointment. I did go for recommended, because I haven’t seen such a great and original detective story in all my life.I wouldn’t recommend buying this game if it’s not on sale: €30 ($37.5?) is way too pricey in my opinion. Like detectives, murder mysteries and story-driven games? I guess you can give this a shot. Want action, adventure and shooting? Not the right game for you.			"

												If your entire gaming life does not evolve around; no scoping, noob tubing, running and gunning and you would like to play an adventure game with a dark side then you will enjoy this.Its one of those games that you can kick back with a controller, play it and get some enjoyment out of it. The game does have an eerie feel to it, but nothing that’s going to ruin your trousers.The cases are a little easy to solve. But I think the goal was to make a game that was fun to play and not something that you would get frustrated with and stop playing half way through.  "

												If you like the Blackwell series (and I would heartily reccomend the Blackwell games, I bought them on GOG not Steam), you will likely enjoy this odd beast. I got it in the half price sale and consider it worth the 12 some quid, but I wouldn't reccomend buying it at full price since it's a fairly short game and like most adventure games, low on replayability.This is a good game with some terrible game mechanic design decisions.Pros:Decent storyEnjoyable charactersInteresting ideas explored throughout - enough to overshadow the cons, for my money.Cons:Clatty interface, probably made worse by poor porting to keyboard and mouse. If you use a pad on your PC, you may have no issues.Some really annoying QTE's bracketed with unskippable cutscenes - especially the finale which should have been exciting and ended up being an exercise in impotent rage management.Unskippable end credits that run for 15 mins  - laughably bad decision.

												First things first: the game is really short. You can get 100% without any guides in about 10 hours, even less if you just rush the main story. Yet the game (or should I say ""the movie""?) is also fun and well made. Not an AAA-title, but it's definitely a game I sincerely enjoyed.I liked the dark setting, the overall style and visuals and all the little details here and there. Also the detective story is not bad. The first half of the game is the best because you don't really understand what is going on. After that the rough outline of the story becomes more and more clear which made it a bit less interesting for me. This game may also be for you if you like to just wander and see all what there is to see in the world (though it's definitely not Skyrim).Also it is an easy game. You can't fail even if you try really hard! The gameplay is linear as a stick, the investigations can be brute forced (although they are not difficult anyway) and there no story choices to make at all, even cosmetic ones. Action sequences (the demons) become a chore rather quick. Overall it was not a problem since I played not for challenge but rather for relaxation.			"

												During my time with Murdered: Soul Suspect, it felt like a spark of unique features in the sea of games that feel like we are recycling the same ideas and concepts over and over. It was definitely an interesting title combining LA Noire's use of interacting with objects and no hand holding while you piece the scene together and choose the correct action from a list that is revealed once you reveal parts of what happened. However I would have liked to see more of a choice in how you progress making some choices lead you down the wrong path and some that if you dig deep enough into the scene it could progress you closer to the killer. To a trained eye a lot of the story becomes easy to pick up but still has some twists like any good murder mystery would. In all I enjoyed my time with the story and ghost/investigation mechanics even if it felt a little short (I think an extra 1-2 hours would have been about perfect for time spent in the game).			"

												For those, like me, who enjoy problem solving games, this was great. It wasn't an intense action game, but simple observation which I enjoyed.Over the course of the game, you can uncover ghost stories as well that aren't even critical to the gameplay, just bonuses. That little mechanic made it feel more immersive considering the story wasn't riding on backtracking or extra digging.Something that stood out for me in the way of dialoge was that everyone who speaks doesn't necessarily talk one at a time. Characters will get cut off and complete their thoughts later in a way that doesn't sound like a script nor rehearsed, with exception to the protagonist's classic-detective style inner monolouges.However, the quick-time controls felt awkward, the game was too short (beat it within twelve hours with a majority of the achievements done), and many ""clues"" didn't seem to make sense when trying to piece crimescenes together. The promise of unique abilities (""personal strengths becoming abilities) was limited to maybe one or two involving revealing information (which felt closer to the protagonist's job rather than his actual strengths). Even only one other ghost displayed only one unique ability that didn't seem to connect to their character. All of the other abilities you gain belong to the other ghosts you find as well, making the protagonist (and the other ghost with a unique ability) possess very cookie-cutter characteristics.Very little direction is taken towards obstacles you run into like the demons, spiteful cops, or paranoia plaguing the area, thus leaving much more to be desired in character development.""Extra"" characters aren't even kept within the game for very long, making it feel as though there are only four real characters, and many filler characters.I ""did"" enjoy the game and do recommend it for those who enjoy dark, investigative, or easy-paced games. Sadly this has little to no replayability and would wait for it to go on sale for $15 or under given it's short story and neglect to several details I mentioned earlier.			"

Final rating: $8.00-$12.00I was not impressed with this game. Being a story and visual based game, immersion is an important factor in the overall quality of my gaming experience. Graphical glitches aren't common, but there is some bad design. NPC character models were clearly designed to be standing all the time, because when you find them sitting it looks like their legs are growing out of their stomachs. Walking through walls in third person is fine until they start hiding traps on the other side for you to stumble blind into. First person renders you immobile for the duration of its use, which is bad if you accidentally pop it while being hunted. There's really not much gameplay, especially if you take the time to collect artifacts instead of progressing the plot. The only enemies are quite frightening until you realize that they don't change their patrol routes unless they see you, and reset if you hide for a while. Fighting them is all patience and quick-time events. The would be shining point of the game, the investigations, are all multiple choice questions that are either too obvious or too obscure. You can guess as many times as you want, losing marks from a three-star rating until you only have one left. I suspect the total number of these marks you have will determine the ending you get, if there even is more than one ending. Obviously I haven't finished the game. Running between objectives should be quicker for a ghost with no heart to give out or body to get tired, but the quickest you can go is a jog. The other characters you interact with are a waste of time. The wandering humans look alike and say the same things, and any conversation you get into with a ghost is choppy and slow. If you use a gamepad to play, your mouse will still pop up in the middle of your screen from time to time. Those are my gripes. It's a detective game for dummies.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a different kind of game, but that doesn't mean its a bad game.  I never got around to playing it when it came out, money reasons mostly, but I was able to play it through a friend's library.  The game is based in Salem and follows the story of a cop who dies at the very start of the game (not a spoiler).  The ""combat"" in the game is mostly stealth based, there are demons, who you have to sneak up on to kill, and if they spot you, you must flee until they resume their normal patrols, but asides from that there is no real combat to speak of.  That is not a bad thing though, as the story is really nice and has a few pretty good twists in it.  The sounds in the game are really nice, and the screech that is made when demons pops up could catch you off guard, I know it did to me a few times.  There are papers, and different things to collect throughout the game, including area specific items that unlock hidden ghost stories to flesh out the town even more.  I played with my xbox one controller so I don't know how good or well the key binding is, but the controls were really nice.  I was actually quite surprised by this game, as I wasn't expecting the good story that I got.  This is not a game for everyone as there is not a whole lot to speak of for combat.  I really enjoyed the story, the somewhat unique combat system and the atmosphere.  Not much in the way of replay value, as I am not sure if there is a difficulty option, unless you wanted to 100% it there is not a whole lot of reasons to replay it.  8/10			"

												An amazing game if you know what your paying for..It's not a 3rd person adventure game like Assassin's Creed or Sleeping DogsIf you go into the game realizing that it's a new take on the old point and click adventure games where you solve puzzles and experience a narrative, then your much more likely to enjoy yourself.That being said, Murdered: Soul Suspect, does a few things really well.- Great Characters, they're very well done and you'll find yourself really caring about what happens to them.- Voice work is top notch- Extra items / Side Cases come with their own ghost stories that will have you scouring the area to make sure you collect all of them.- Setting is dark and creepy yet it feels alive thanks to all the townspeople spread throughout salemAs with any game though there are negatives of course- The demonic / exorcism dynamic of combat feels more like an afterthought meant to draw in more gamers than a mechanic that was developed to really add depth to the gameplay.- While the voicework itself is excellent.. the characters lip syncing is not as great.  Not terrible, but it's something you'll definitely pick up on from time to time.- Even though there are plenty of citizens walking about and interacting with the enviroment; there is a lot of dialogue that's used on multiple people.  Also once you decide to read their thoughts and the voiceover starts; you have to wait for it to finish before  you can listen to the next or disposses them.If you see it on sale definitely pick it up.  I managed to find this on Gamer's Gate for 13.99			"

												This is one of the most underappreciated games I have every played - an absolute must to any detective/noir genre afficionado.The gripping story takes you on a fun journey through a town oh so well known to be a setting to many a horro stories, and does that in a great manner.The main strenght of the game though is that it cuts the action part to the bare minimum ( just to keep you doing something else for a change from time to time ), and lets you focus on the detective work.9/10 from me ( they could get rid of all the action parts to even greater benefit - that's where the one point goes ).

												I just finished this game yesterday and it was pretty much everything I expected. It was story rich with some nice cut scenes, interesting plot twist and wasn't very difficult. Perfect since I was sick in bed all week with the fever, and this is the perfect game to play when you're not completely there. If you're looking for anything of a challenge though this is definitely not the game for you. There are also no choices that you can make that influence the game; so no replayability.I thought I would finish all side quests since I had read that they only add about 10 minutes extra per side quest. Actually now that I think about it I did finish all the sidequests, I just didn't find all the items that tell you some extra stories from salem. Unfortunately the game has a sort of battle system in the game with demons that look for you and try to eat your soul or something like that. Personally I hated these areas of the game the most, it didn't feel scary or add anything to the game, it actually just seemed really annoying, so I always rushed through the demon areas executing them as fast as possible (which just means walk behind them and press the execute command that was on screen). For me they could have just left the demons out and I would've enjoyed the game more. Or they could've made it hella scary and borrowed the run and hide system from ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"". Oh well there aren't that many demon areas so it was ok.Conclusion: It's a fun, easy, detective game that lasts about 6 hours  (10+ hours if you want to 100% the game) filled with fun cut scenes and an interesting storyline. However if I look at the price this game is goin for in the steam store (30 euros) I can't recommend you get the game for that price even though I do understand why they market it at that price. If this is the type of game you love it's probably worth it since the cut scenes are well done and yeah theres enough of salem to discover/investigate. But let's be honest, once you finish this game you will never pick it up again, so you're probably better off waiting for a sale. I paid 6 euros for this and other games (Square Enix 2 humble bundle) and I think games are worth it as long as you get 1 hour per euro. This game fits that rule for me so I give it 4 stars out of 5. If you paid more than 10 euros for this game however, I can imagine feeling screwed, so be smart and wait for it to be cheaper than 10 euros or get it in the humble bundle now! while you still can :)			"

												As a game, there not much to this one. The puzzles aren't hard, and even so it's still trial and error without any repercussions. But still I really enjoyed this one. What it lacked in challenge, it made up for in story. And it's one of the few games nowadays where finding collectibles gives you a nice reward.So in short, if you want a nice laid back detective story, get this one. If you want a challenging puzzle/detective game, avoid.			"

												This game was missing quite abit of challenge to it, demons are easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥to kill, avoiding spawn pits is easy, piecing together clues is SOOO straightforward its nuts. Sometimes i started overthinking the clues and got them wrong because so many could be interperated as viable information for given murder.I was dissapointed in the problem solving, it didnt test me nor did the combat (if you call it combat). The story did have me interested, but mostly i was too distracted searching far and wide for the many MANY collectable side story items/collectable intel.Loved the idea of being able to walk through walls, i've never played a game with that kind of mechanic and i liked it. It added a good twist to finding clues and collectables, not to mention you can walk through freakin walls like a boss.			"

												Just finished the game and I really enjoyed it. While it doesn't take long to play it through (I needed 8 hours and I took my time) it was fun while it lasted. I am not sure about the replay value, though. The game heavily relies on its thick atmosphere and the story twists to drive you along and I imagine it will be less fun the second time around. If you don't care for pages after pages of story or lots of cut scenes or do expect a certain amount of fighting in your games you should skip this one, though. There are a few ""fight"" scenes but you have to solve them through misdirection and stealth. No open combat. Still, if you do enoy a good story and an atmospheric game you should give this one a try. I recommend playing it at night or in a darkened room - both for the atmosphere and to see all the details on the screen. You should also take the time and gather as many clues as possible, especially for the small side quests. The stories are delightfully spooky.			"

												Solid game that I definitely didn't think would be this fun. The graphics are nice and the voice acting is really, really good, much better than I thought it would be. It doesn't pull punches when it comes to death cut scenes however, so if you're adverse to gunshots, spontanious screaming and the like, put it on mute and turn on subtitles.The only complaints that I have is the fact that there is no adjustable difficulty level, which isn't super important unless you are playing on the PC and find it hard to properly exorcise demons. Pressing and holding R plus A and right clicking all at once while only being given less than 5 seconds gets super frustrating after a while.  "

												Once you get past the fact that this is a port and has no configurable controls (stuck to wasd), its a very enjoyable game. I played it with the xbox controller in the end. The story is interesting, though maybe let down a little at the end. The collectables add little bits of information and stories on their own which I enjoyed finding. Playing as a ghost, you are able to walk through most walls and furniture, possess people and read their thoughts (the latter not as good as it sounds, basically generic two liners for each person, not all different), find clues and piece it all together. The bit I enjoyed most was helping other ghosts discover what had happened to them, collecting the clues and setting them at peace. I wish there'd been a lot more of that. I enjoyed every minute of it and will undoubtedly play again.			"

												This game has a great concept, a captivating artstyle, and a fairly interesting story. The voice acting is good, the characters are overall quite believeable, and you get quite invested in the game's narrative.On the negative side, the game gives you a huge sandbox to play in with a bunch of new toys, but what few activities you are able to complete within this open world are fairly lacklustre and are basic extensions of the same game mechanics you use during the main story. It would have been a lot more engaging if you were free to roam within this world, and had interesting things to do in it. Overall, recommended for its mechanics, artstyle and interesting story. Suitable for fans of L.A. Noire, and similar detective games.			"

												This is a game where you are a police detective and you have to solve your own murder and can solve other cases in the meantime (while you're a ghost). The game takes place in Salem, Massachusetts and uses the Salem Witch Trials as the premis for the story. The game appears to be educational on the subject, but I can't tell you if everything they reference is fact; I did learn that Germany also had witch trials decades earlier.I had no technical issues with the game and I completed the game over the weekend in around eight hours. I enjoyed it enough that I played through it over two days. It's not at all a difficult or challenging game, but I feel like it was different enough to make me want to play through, help people, and find out what I could regarding the story and I was pleased.The replay value is very low to me, but it was definitely worth the one playthrough.

												The main problem with the game is that it tries to be a bit of everything. I hated the demons, because I was interested in the investigation and doing the side quests and finding about about the other ghosts. Still, despite the problems, I liked the game. The story was interesting and I liked exploring the town. It would have been fun to have more chances to play as a cat. Not having a chapter selection in the menu was a really bad choice from the developers, so if you're aiming at 100%, make sure you have everything before the point of no return where the final act starts (the game warns you about it).

												just finished the game and got to admit, it got me addicted to the story like a drug. Couldn't think of anything but wonder what the next clues will add to the story. To sum it up:Story: 9/10Although it's a typical murder investigation, playing as a ghost trying to uncover clues makes the mystery more interesting. The side stories obtained by finding all the hidden objects on each map are very spooky and a good bed time story to wet the bed.Gameplay: 6/10Although it's nice to find clues and unfold the mystery, it's veeery repetitive and lacks diversity. Not much you can do but run through walls, teleport short distances and kill a few demons. other than that, you get bored fast from gameplay and you just want to finish the story faster.Graphics: 8/10I can't say it's bad, i can't say it's good. For a 2014 game, objects are edgy, characters lack emotions, but still, it looks ok. It's the bad textures from clues that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.Overall, i enjoyed the game very much, considering i got it on sale. I recommend it just to unwind from stressful multiplayer games and submerge in a story filled with mysteries. PS: could play a cat.			"

(+)Interesting fact in this game is the lead character, whom you identify yourself with - or try to, has a kind of standardish background.

I'm not sure why people feels the need to write a review without finishing the game, if I had judged the game after an hour of playing it I would have turned it down too, but after an hour you're not attached to anything, if you're looking for instant gratification in a detective game, you should have never even installed it.At first the fact that its a console port nearly turned me off to it but I trudged on and found that its not all that bad.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is engaging and enjoyable.  The atmosphere and graphics are great.  You explore Salem and 'ghost Salem' as a ghost and as a detective, solving your case and many side cases along the way.  Ghost Salem physically exists for ghosts, as a barrier which prevents you from accessing areas of Salem too easily and as a mode of access to collectables in areas you wouldn't have access to in normal Salem e.g. ghost stairs.There is a lot to engage with: collectables (too many, in my opinion), stories to unlock, ghosts hanging around (they say the best things in the graveyard).  It does get repetative and there isn't a challange.  The game is easy to beat but there's still a small amount of action such as dealing with demons.  I find the game satisfactory for entertaining, easy gameplay but I wouldn't pay $30 for it.  Maybe if it was more challanging, everything down to the puzzles are simple.			"

I do however feel that the game could have been so much more. It could have been a lot more difficult to figure out however. I think most players felt a lot more competent at detective-work than the protagonist.If you don't mind a linear game about mysteries and supernatural events then you should give this game a go. It has a great atmosphere, looks good and the voice acting is top notch. I liked that the game doesn't care much for combat and having crazy encounters. There are some enemies but they are more like decor than obstacles. The game lets you focus on the mystery.You can also possess cats and use them to solve puzzles. Major plus.			"

												During my time with Murdered: Soul Suspect, it felt like a spark of unique features in the sea of games that feel like we are recycling the same ideas and concepts over and over. It was definitely an interesting title combining LA Noire's use of interacting with objects and no hand holding while you piece the scene together and choose the correct action from a list that is revealed once you reveal parts of what happened. However I would have liked to see more of a choice in how you progress making some choices lead you down the wrong path and some that if you dig deep enough into the scene it could progress you closer to the killer. To a trained eye a lot of the story becomes easy to pick up but still has some twists like any good murder mystery would. In all I enjoyed my time with the story and ghost/investigation mechanics even if it felt a little short (I think an extra 1-2 hours would have been about perfect for time spent in the game).			"

I am not sure about the replay value, though. The game heavily relies on its thick atmosphere and the story twists to drive you along and I imagine it will be less fun the second time around. If you don't care for pages after pages of story or lots of cut scenes or do expect a certain amount of fighting in your games you should skip this one, though. There are a few ""fight"" scenes but you have to solve them through misdirection and stealth. No open combat. Still, if you do enoy a good story and an atmospheric game you should give this one a try. I recommend playing it at night or in a darkened room - both for the atmosphere and to see all the details on the screen. You should also take the time and gather as many clues as possible, especially for the small side quests. The stories are delightfully spooky.			"

												Don't judge a book by his cover.A good game with a scenario that seems straight-forward but isn't. If you like history, a rich-story -- well, for the price I bought it, it was well worth -- and not too complicated to enjoy. I don't say it's the game of the year, but it's a great game to relax, enjoy a nice evening and satisfy your gaming needs.Plus there's a buttload of things to collect and achievement. Gotta love it.

												This game got a bad critic score. i give it a 7/10 rating. The problem with the game is yes it is repetitive yes you only kill the same type of demons, however the story and twist is really good. It might be a play it once type of a game but for Square enix to try something diferent i think they did a spot on job.			"

												Worth $15? yes. So wait for it to go on sale. Really enjoyed this game. Just a tip if you're going for the collectibles, when you get to the museum make sure you get all collectibles in there at the same time, as you won't be able to go back. That was a painful lesson to learn. Now go have fun being a Super ghost cat detective!			"

												Its sort of like the tellatale games , only you interact more. There are some things that you can collect around the map that tell you some stories from salem and some such , it was a chore for me , but maybe youd like that(its not like you need 2 do it). The combat is kinda lacking , the story is very very interesting tho. i REALLY liked it. All in all 7.5/10 , the games averages a 5/10 on everything exept graphics/astetic and story , but man do they carry it bythemselves.			"

												Writing this review immediately after finishing the game.Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third person adventure, with quite a few aspects of the horror genre. The game is rather short (Roughly five hours), and the combat in the game is simply sneaking up behind the enemies and pressing a combination of buttons. Although the combat was a bit repetitive, the story itself was rather interesting for me. You play as a recently murdered detective named Ronan, who is has been left behind as a ghost in the mortal world, because he has unfinished business, which won't allow him to join his wife; who has already moved on. In order for Ronan to move on he has to find out the mystery behind his killer. As he is a ghost, he can only tamper with very few things in the mortal world, so with the help of a young girl named Joy, they work together to unravel the mystery between the Bell Killer murders, as well as the identity of the killer.7.5/10			"

												Story 8.5/10 - If you have the patience to wade through the tedium, there's an interesting story here.Story execution 6/10 - Voice acting was good, usually.  The cutscenes were choppy and low quality.  The dialogue would bounce between statements in a way that made you feel like... like they were prerecorded then cut and pasted together.Atmosphere 8/10 - I consider myself pretty judgmental when it comes to this sort of thing, cause I feel like people have to resort to cheap thrills to make something interesting and horror-oriented.  Although there are a few such cheap tricks, the majority of the game creates an atmosphere that is genuinely interesting, scary, and unique.Unique Mechanics 7/10 - The puzzle aspect is nice, but not impressive.  It would be awesome, except that after a few minutes it starts to feel like a game of ""Where's Waldo"", in which you just look for little details that feel very pre-defined.Gameplay 4/10 - The game feels sluggish and awkward.  Getting your character to face a clue can occassionally be problematic.  Much of the game felt like overcoming the tedium of moving your character through the environment in order to find hidden objects.Level design 3/10 - The maps feel very chaotic and disorganized.  While the general layout may be right (Here's a church, up front there's a chappel, in back there're some other rooms), the execution of the specifics feels pretty awkward and staged.  It's made worse by the ""ghost obstacles"" that artificially block your path basically everywhere.Graphics 6.5/10 - The main character has the best art of anything in the game.  The overall feel fits the atmosphere, but neither the graphics nor the art are particularly gripping.Bugginess 3/10 - Had the game crash 5+ times in 10 hours of gameplay.  Once it required me to force-powerdown my computer, since even the task manager couldn't come up.Overall 6.5/10 - The twisty, creepy story makes up for an otherwise poor game.  I bought it in the humble bundle, and don't regret the purchase.			"

												I picked this up on a sale for 1,99€ and it was worth the money.It's a point and click detective game with a supernatural story.It's not much to the detective part in the game, you mostly answer questions by clicking on clues you have found.The game have some kind of system where if you guess something wrong you lose a ""badge"" and you have three badges for each mystery but it will not effect anything in the game as far as I could tell.It feels like it was meant for a achievement but they never put it in or that the detective part was supposed to be more complex but got scratched later on.The game have a nice old detective movie feeling to it and the story keeps you interesting.The story is about a detective that have to solve his on murder as a ghost to move on. The two main characters are good written and works well together. It's a nice spooky feeling throughout the game even tho it's not a horror game.In addition to the main story you can solve a handful of side cases for lost spirits around the world to give them peace and in addition to that there is a lot of collectables scattered around.The collectables tells you about the town, the murderer, your character and ghost stories. The ghost stories is a really nice addition, I appreciated them a lot.It took me around eleven hours to finish and I did most of the side stuff, I missed some collectables.If you see this game on a sale I would recommand you to pick it up but not for the current pricetag (29,99€).

												Was a gift from a good friend of mine (Humble Bundle)A mix of adventure, detective mystery solving game.  Seriously, just don't hover near the spoilers if you haven't played the game yet Pros :  - Interesting storyline - The town looks great with the mix of  a past (ghost) and present theme  - Voice Acting - Plot twist!  - A game that  lets you play as a cat   - Being a ghost is somehow fun - Unique playstyle Cons :  - The story is too linear.  Putting routes on stories and additional mini quest is fine  - Demons  Stealth in a detective mystery game sounds good but really, screeching demons who chase you but they leave you once you move in a specific spot. Also, sometimes annoying...  - Save slots would be fine. You have to replay the game once you finish/restart to the last checkpoint (A bit of a hassle when it comes to achievement farming) - Point and click. Investigations are kind of easy since they already tell you where the clues are. You can just spam E in the map and you'll probably find the clue   - NPCs - just remove some of the  mind reading  or just  keep them silent . It's confusing  when you're looking for clues   - Locked to 30 FPS....  - Cutscenes...  A skip button would be nice if you die or restart from another checkpoint  - Too short (Finished within 9.6 hours - including breaks)Needs a lot more improvement still. Would buy a sequel if there is one Better buy it on sale.Rating : 7/10			"

												Good adventure, detective-murder-mystery-solving game with a gimmick - you're trying to find out who your killer is, Despite all the low scores from major publications, I think this is a great game. It doesn't overwhelm you with too many mechanics and most of the time what you have to do is pretty straightforward (some might see this a con but it works for me). Looks pretty and sounds alright (the demons do some pretty wicked shrieks). Throughout the game there are also collectibles that, when found, grant you flashbacks to various spooky story from Salem's past - I found these to be a really nice way of immersing you even more into the game's world.Also, you get to play as a cat with a dedicated ""Meow"" button, so go buy this game right now.

												This is really a different type of game unlike any I have played before.  Basically you go around collecting items (alot of optional items) to get stories to read and unlock.  Often times you have to find clues and piece them together so the evidence tells a story helping you in your search for the serial killer.  While the game looks pretty decent graphically, there are times where things just fell off.  For example the killer could have just murdered someone in the town yet some of the peoples mood in the town does not reflect that.  There are times when some townspeople say the same exact thing by the same voice actor or actress.  One time near the end of the game I read this old ladies mind and had the voice of a teenage girl.  There are somel moments in the game where you have to be stealthy to avoid demons and you do have the option of killing them .   As the game progressed I was more interested in how the story would develop and there was a nice plot twist towards the end.   Its a fairly short game which was the main reason I played this game after reading alot of less than positive reviews.  I'll give the game 5/10  and recommend buying it if you can get it really cheap.			"

												Get it when it is cheap - it is short and has no replay value beyond collecting things, and you cannot revisit earlier areas after reaching the finale. Overall, it is a pretty decent unfinished business ghost story. It comes equipped with the ex-con cop, lovable scamp sidekick, some plot twists, and posessing cats and people to get to locations your short-range ghost teleport can't reach. The setting was interesting to me, and there were some small jokes in a few levels such as ghost hunters in the cemetary, and a ghost right in front of the camera smiling and waving - that nobody can see.The levels are fairly well designed, although some clues require more accuracy in placement with how close to other clues they are. The demons were interesting at first but quickly became just an annoyance once you near the end of the game. Most areas are once and done, although you do revisit one of the opening areas as part of the plot and can return to areas up until the finale.This is mostly an adventure game - the only notable action sequences are exorcising demons, a single section where you have to deal with a ghost train ( which was pretty neat ), and the finale, and even then they are more or less quick time events. The rest of the game is spent navigating the hub You are unable to change the controls if you use the mouse and keyboard. The game itself doesn't have too many poor performance spots aside from some area transitions and, at least in my case, antialiasing smoke/fog during the opening sequence.The collectables were mostly pointless - the story parts, such as the water tank, rifles, saws, gas tanks, etc. were brief ghost stories - generic, but not poorly written.Overall, I feel the main issue is how short the game is - the entire plot encompasses a single night and will only really take three or four hours at most, and feels like a large chunk of that time was exorcising demons and getting to the next area. If you remove the travel time and scavenger hunt, it was rather short and would probably fit inside two hours.			"

												Let's get one thing out of the way: ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" is not your normal action game. Actually, it is actually not an action game at all; it is more a story-driven adventure focused on exploration and (very logic) puzzle-solving that centers around clue finding and logic implications among them; the plot is thick, with lots of twists and turns all along the way which will nail you to your chair until you're done. There's only one caveat: it's rather short -- I managed to complete it in under 10 hours.There are also ""combat"" sequences against demons (ghosts that turned evil after forsaking what they were meant to ""fix"" in the living world before leaving it) that are more annoying than anything else as they involve hide-and-seek mechanics; I think that there is a lot of room for improvement in that area but I am not complaining too much.There is one more thing that I dislike though: the whole collectable item craze that the game is so soaked with. Some are in obvious places, others in less-obvious ones, while others are really unfindable unless you comb the town of Salem systematically -- and it's rather hard to do it without a map of the place. Through the collection of clues and items, you either go forward with the main story or unlock sidequests or insights about the protagonists and the town itself.When it comes to presentation, graphics are really good (locked at 30 FPS but there's no sensation of lag at all), the audio acting is well done and the music hits the spot without being particularly memorable.I recommend this game if you're into ghost stories (or well-written stories in general) and like to enjoy a slower-paced game that requires a minimum of thinking.My vote for the game: 7/10 (with a gameplay vote of 5.5/10 and one for the story of 8.5/10)			"

												Murdered is an interesting yet flawed game. It has some good ideas but fails to execute them in a coherent fashion. Like all games created by numerous development houses spread across the globe it lacks a singular vision. Triple A games need painstaking pre production in order to succeed. Apparently the Ghost theme was pitched at Airtight by one of Square's creative directors.The game isn’t unholy bad. It runs well on my basic PC. The voice work and plentiful cutscenes flesh out the story. Which is an standard detective yawn with Salem trial overtones. There’s a whole host of collectables which unlock side story narratives. These are a strong point of the game and pad out what would be a rather limited experience.There is one striking feature / bug that the game has. Once you finish the main story arc, you cannot go back into the town and complete / solve any of the side missions you may have missed without starting a brand new game. This soured my overall opinion of the title. A shocking oversight that could have been fixed by a small patch. Unfortunately this will never happen as Square shuttered Airtight soon after the release of the game.Its a pity Airtight aren't around to make a follow up. I enjoy a good adventure story and for the most part Murdered delivers.			"

												Not terribly far into the game, but more than enough time to give a thumbs up.   The gameplay, story, and atmospehere are very well done. Reminescent of LA Noire's investigations and Heavy Rain/Two Souls.  Metacritic is so horribly wrong on this one, steam reviews have it right as usual.Play at night with the lights off, it's even better :p			"

												There's a noticeable lack of good detective games out there: LA Noire, Sherlock Holmes series, a bit of Batman - and that's it. And there're even fewer concepts as interesting and original from the gaming perspective as this one. However, you must clearly understand what you're getting yourself into: this game definitely is a walking simulator, with the only gameplay being two-button fatalities against demons (which are not all that hard) and the actual detective routine, which consists of loooking for clues, analyzing them and being led to even more clues as a result.Also, Murdered: Soul Suspect is a dream game for any munchkin: there's an abundance of different collectibles in every area of the game and, to the developers' credit, all of those actually contain some story. Those stories (as well as the main one) are obviously and heavily influenced by Stephen King's styled ""creepiness"", and are well told and fairly unpredictable. In addition, voice acting is surprisingly decent for a not-AAA project.---Summarizing, Murdered: Soul Suspect entertained me for three whole evenings, which is definitely worth those $15 it's asking for right now. The gameplay simply doesn't have enough time to become repetative, and the story is being told with good pace and plenty of intrigue, concluding itself right when it should. Great voice acting gives the finishing touch to the game. Enjoy.			"

												I was put off this game initially due to negative reports about its length, and so the base price of £20 was enough to give me pause. However, when it appeared on sale for £5 I decided to give it a chance and I am very glad I did. The star of this game is its story, where you play as the ghost of Ronan O'Connor, a detective in modern day Salem. For a large part it feels like a point and click adventure game where the emphasis is on finding the pieces and putting them together rather than on any sort of direct action. Gameplay revolves around investigations that are heavily reminiscent of L.A. Noire (another game I really enjoyed) except you can walk through walls and interrogating people is mostly replaced with possessing them to influence their mind. Perhaps owing to the length of the story (it only took me around 8hrs to complete the main quest, all side quests and most collectibles) both the story and gameplay never outstayed their welcome and remained entertaining to the very end. The main negative in this game is the repetitive forced stealth segments where you are forced to sneak up on demonic spirits before a simple quick time event is entered in place of combat. I felt even after the first of these that it was an unnecessary mechanic designed as a buffer between me and the enjoyable parts of the game. I would commonly find myself sweeping an area of these ""enemies"" before returning to start the section proper. Thankfully, they don't take too long and aren't difficult, but this just emphasises how needless they are.I would definitely recommend this as a sale pickup if you are even remotely curious.			"

I didn't want it to turn into some action game halfway through and it would have probably ruined it if it had.In fact, the 'avoid / destroy the demons' parts almost came close to that and were more irritating than adding anything to the gameplay IMO.If a sequel came out I'd probably be willing to pay £15 for it.

												Its still as amazing as ever! I had originally gotten this on my Xbox360 and it was a ton of fun. I saw it on sale during the Halloween 2015 sale and picked it up pretty cheep, considering the original price. I love ghost stories, horror, and killing demons (Diablo). This game has ghosts and demons (which you can choose to avoid or execute, depending on where you are), I found I actually had to execute them to continue at some spots further in.The game begins with Ronan falling through a window and narrating a bit, you also get to learn more about Ronan's (life/ backstory). Considering the fact that he's the main hero and the playable character thats a good thing and its also important.Gameplay is what really got really got me hooked. The town of Salem has areas for doing detective work and its freeroam in the Hub section and the areas (To an extent, its not Final Fantasy or anything, but you do get to explore). The character is always seen in the third person point of view (camera is behind the character).Interactive- You can go around and talk to certain people or listen in on their conversations. You can ""investigate"" and search for clues- which you'd then use to solve a case or continue on in the story. Collectables are always fun, but can be a pain to collect as they are actually hiding and not always in a typical spot. Cutscenes are interactive! You can usually choose what you want Ronan to say or ask next. Nothing major, but heck its something.Powers, well you get to do a lot of stuff later, but when you just start off you can already possess people and cats (no, seriously). You can also mind read or try to manipulate their thoughts. Story? Spoilers! You die first thing and become a ghost- woot! You're also a detective of the Salem police department. You also have to try to solve your own murder and many others. The game is great and recomendable, but I do have one problem. I had chugging/ lag while on my Xbox and was hoping that'd be fixed on the pc version. That was not the case, and I still have the same annoying chugging/ lag. Its not always while going to a different section of the Hub town, but it does happen a lot in the Hub area. It also happens in other spots, but it rarely happens in places like the graveyard or appartments. So, thats a bit of a bummer, but its still a great game.			"

												This is actually quite a fresh and intersting idea for a game. You play a cop who gets killed by the serial killer he is investigating only for him to become a ghost. Even worse for him he can't move on until he finds out who the serial killer is and then stop him. Playing a ghost is actually quite fun as you can walk through walls and objects as well as possess living characters and listen to their thoughts and influence them. The gameplay is a bit lacking though as most of the game involves investigating by searching for clues and then concluding the investigation by picking the most important clues thus moving the story along. The only enemies you encounter are demons which are easily dispatched by sneaking up behind them and killing them and the encounters with them are too few and far between to be a problem. The biggest dissappointment with this game is that they could have done so much more with the ghost stuff to make the gameplay better.The Good:-Interesting idea for a game and it works quite well.-Decent story which is the games main strength. Also the setting of Salem is brilliant and the atmosphere is great.-Playing as a ghost is quite fun even if they could have done so much more with it.The Bad:-Game is really easy and doesn't provide much in the way of a challenge.- Pretty short and padded out with having loads of collectibles.Overall this is a decent game if not perfect.Worth picking up on sale.

												I was really surprised with this little gem. It wasn't the most amazing game I'd ever play but it was unique for its genre. Square Enix does a good job of finding games that aren't like every other game you find. The story was good, I liked the characters, the collectables are good. Just remember that if your going for 100% guide then don't forget to get to use a collecable walkthrough for the museum level as you can't redo that level. I almost went for all the collectables but decided against it at the end. I like the mystery elements mixed with the ghost side. The combat system was a bit dull but at least it doesn't affect the game as a whole. The mystery could have been better but the ambience of the whole thing was still good. All in all, a good game for the 4 bucks I spent on it.			"

												You're a cop, you just got killed and you have to investigate your own murder and the case of the serial killer 'The Bell', who's going around killing young women in barbaric ways and slaughtering anyone who gets in his way. You'd think being dead would put something of a cramp on your investigative abilities, but no, it seems all the best cops are the dead ones. Maybe it's because it's late at night, but everybody except you seems to be doing about as much police activity as can be accomplished by standing around rubbing their noses.You run into a teenage medium called Joy who's looking for her missing mom, and she comes in really handy for opening drawers, crossing glowing holes into hell that try and suck Ronan down, and so that Ronan's musing is cut by about 20%. The rest of the time she's a regular whiny teenager you have to play daddy wolf to and pretend you give a pooper about her mom. The game revolves around investigating crime scenes - yours and other people's - talking to the many ghosts in Salem, uncovering lost memories, being the cause of poltergeist activity and posessing people to read their minds.Occasionally to try and make you feel like there's more to the game than prodding at a crime-scene and musing over a cigarette, Demons spawn. Since they just float around on a set path looking for something to kill, and you creep up from behind to kill them, it feels very tacked on and a really crappy attempt at adding any challenge to the game.All in all, the game feels a lot like an interactive horror movie, but it's a GOOD movie, and it feels like worthwhile interaction. Voice acting and character animation of faces is great. Is it worth full-price? That's a personal thing, seeing as it's quite a short game. But if you can get it at a discount, it's definitely a worthwhile way to spend some game-time.Get it if you like: Detective games, Violent murder, Interaction, Creepiness, A good movie, Collecting stuff.Don't get it if you like: Action, Challenge, Long games.7/10			"

												I rather enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the story, and the level of player engagement seemed spot-on for this quick, story-driven game.On the other hand; I did encounter some repetitiveness in the dialog after a bit. The puzzle solving felt a little forced, and didn't have alternative scenarios if you chased down the wrong lead.Gameplay: I usually don't like the over-the-shoulder gameplay style. I found it gave me some issue when trying to interact with some objects, but it wasn't too obtrusive. Combat: The enemies were laughable, all you had to do was sneak up behind them and perform an action - a random button/mouseclick which is a direct port over to the button/paddle on the console. I found these enemies to be more of an obsticle than an actual challenge. But I belive this is intended, as to keep the game story focused and not combat driven. I actually salute the developers for remaining story focused and not bogging down the player with ubsurd mechanics or prolonged battles... or health bars for that matter (You're already dead! No health for you!)Collectables & Achievements: Many players have complained that they were unable to go back and complete the collectable achievements, as this has a very linear progression in the story. This will often require a second playthrough, stopping at each location, and clearing the zone to ensure you have collected everything. I kept catching myself thinking in normal gameplay rules, where I would walk around walls and objects. Just remember, you can walk through that. There are still barriers - ghostly walls and santified buildings - that prevent you from passing through everything.Due to a bug in the final fight, I didn't finish the game. After many many attempts, I kept starting the scene in a void zone, where I couldn't escape, or didn't have enough time to complete my objective after I escaped. I have not read of this bug happening to other players. YMMV. I did see alot of weird, creepy stuff in this game, but this is the only only thing I would call buggy.			"

												have you ever find yourself thinkin' ""gosh this movie is sucks but I would play it if it was a game"" or ""now that game is fun but if they would make the same story as a movie, noway that I would watch that""? now that's the game of that type. it start in a really geuine way. story-tellin' part is so cool but then it keep gettin slower, routine, stereotyped. if it was a movie, it would be one of these cheap♥♥♥♥♥scary movies which only lads and easy girls on your class watchs. however it's a game (and a great one) with attractive gameplay. you do some detective stuff, hunt demons, doin' cheesy things etc... but also you go deeper and deeper in the story. bad part is you might get bored as you proceed to end because of non-chancing play style but you might not if you wont try a whole-run on game. my personal thoughts on game is it's really worth to play and witness to story.

												First thing first. Is it worth buying this game full price? Well, story is quite nice. The ending even surprised me, which is good, but in the game there is nothing challenging. Ok, there are few demons, who try to collect your soul, but meeh. Those things are easy to kill.If you like detectives you, then you should buy this game. Im one of those guys who run around the map to collect all thing you can collect. Well, this time I didn't collect everything, so mostly main story + fast roaming around to search other stuff is about 7h of gameplay. So think if you want to pay full price for 7h of gameplay.This game is not perferct, bet there' s something to think about.7/10Take it on sale. :)			"

												Used to love the trailer, until it released and played it I believe lot of flaws in this game is making this game less fun that it was supposed to be.1. Investigation mechanic is dull, while you're investigating in the game by looking at clues all over the place, you didn't actually investigate anything. Unlike games like Sherlock Holmes or LA Noire, you just look for items and press the action button.2. Open world mechanic wasting time too much. While I like walking around the place to know more about it's world, Salem is the city that's seriously flawed in time and space. While it looks like a big city, you can get anywhere in just few minutes. And why there's lot of people in the creepy night potrayed in the game. Even the presentation of some people dating in graveyard just plain creeping me. (In a bad way)3. Story just making non sense, I believe I supposed to find the clue about the klller... In 1 night? I don't think I can laugh more after looking people are just pushing their activity in 1 night.4. Fighting demon is stupid.5. Cars in the game modeled for dwarf.Overall, I'm glad I can teleport later in the game.			"

												So you are a tattooed loose cannon detective that no one likes and with some chips on your shoulder. You get killed early in the game and you become a ghost with a ghostly cigarette that never extinguishes; The point of the game is to solve your own murder.Has a Quantum Leap feel about it. As well as doing your own stuff you help others solve their murders too so they can 'move on'.The graphics are perfectly fine, quite good actually. Voice acting is good. Dialogue generally pretty decent. The story is just about interesting enough... sometimes its a bit weak. The 'ghost lore' that you are introduced too early on is quite interesting.Some gameplay elements are dull, such as the collectables (are they interesting in any game though?) You do a lot of walking around considering your ethereal. Although the exploration is okay mostly, and you are rewarded usually by a collectable. Collectables are all blocks of text that I didn't bother reading - Some collectables actually give you a spooky short story not related to the main game but related to the town it's set it in, which are actually quite good to listen to. The story about a man complaining his shower water was a brown colour to his landlord for months, when they eventually find a rotting body in the water tank was my favourite.The exciting (or what should be exciting) gameplay elements are not used enough or not done that well. For example, you can possess cats, which allows you to get into different areas but this is presented to the player on a plate - As in the area you need to get to is ahead and here is a cat purrfectly placed next to it so you can just possess it and move on.... Developers could have expanded this and purrrhaps forced the player to think for themselves a bit and actually go find a cat.The detective investigations.... I can only compare it to LA Noire as its similar but its no where near done as well. Clues are obvious and all you are doing is walking around pressing a button on every clue - The game even tells you there are 7 clues or 8 clues so you know when you are finished and can conclude the investigation, unlike LA Noire where you may have overlooked a vital clue and actually♥♥♥♥♥♥up the investigation entirely - So there is no risk for the play basically - So investigations are boring and are purely there as plot lines.Then there are some fun gameplay elements. Walking through walls is brilliantly done. Hiding inside people, listening to their thoughts (although many NPC's only have 2 thoughts in their head at any one time) poltergeist-ing TV's and radios.Banishing demons is quite a nice break from the normal walking around too - Although its just a quicktime button press (which you get ample time to do) it at least slows you down and makes you think a little bit about how to progress.So even though it doesn't challenge the player at all, or break any gaming barriers down I'd still recommend it to anyone who likes a story driven game with a mildly disappointing ending.

												MURDED: SOUL SUSPECT (apparently the CAPSLOCK key of the developers is broken!) is a really good game. Really good. Repeating for emphasis!Of course, I'm going to complain about something, so lets get the irrelavent bit out the way first.I'm playing this on a PC. So tell me Airtight, where is the Start button? I really hate the consolification of PC games. I don't need a silly screen where I have to ""Press Start"" to continue. When I want to quit the game, I don't want to be returned to ""Press Start"" so I can then choose ""Exit Game"" from the menu. I thought I made my intensions clear when I initially said ""Exit Game"" from the in-game menu. Meh, who am I kidding. Might as well wish that developers didn't include stupid not skippable logo's and videos each time the game starts.And... CHECKPOINTS? This was almost a deal breaker. MSS is an adventure game. Since when did adventure games need checkpoints? This leads to my major crisitism of the game, but as I'll defer that until the end where it belongs.So, what's good about the game? Well, pretty much everything. Atmosphere is brilliant, I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of the ghost world ontop of the real world, past mixed with the present. It worked amazingly well. Graphics and environment design top notch.Audio is generally good, but there's a few places where you had ""what is making this sound"" puzzles and two of these the proported sounds didn't really match the clues, but no biggy. I also confess to jumping out of my skin on more than one occasion when the demons annouced their arrival.The investigations were nicely done and nothing too complex (which is both a plus a minus, sometimes it felt a little easy, at other times I was greatful I wasn't trying to work out some insane and illogical inventory puzzle), and the story was engrossing. Each major area in the game also has a themed set of collectibles, which once all obtained give a nice little backstory to the area.The checkpoint system generally works, but take heed - when you get to the final act, the game mentions if you continue you can't go back. By this point I was treating MSS as a open world type game, running around picking up things I'd missed and so on. I assumed, like all open world games, that once I'd finished the main mission, I'd be free to find the last missing side quest in the town center. Nope, I was wrong. When it said you can't go back, you really can't. And there's only a single damn save for the entirely playthrough.Fortunately I have a backup from a couple of days ago so I can at least replay the latter half of the game to find my missing items rather than the whole game, but I did think this a pretty dumb design decision.One other astoundingly bad design decision is the very final act of the game. Remember that MSS is an adventure game - you play it at your own pace, looking around for clues, collectibles, backstory etc. There's a few semi-quick time events involving demons that spawn. These aren't too bad, just annoying as each event uses a randomized key combination. There are similar QTE for demons that come through the floor but for most of the game you'll avoid these.The final scene however involves two very brief timed events where you have something like 20s to do one thing then 10s to do another. This made me pretty angry actually, I've spent hours playing this lovely creation, then you force the last 30 seconds with no time to do anything but try and do the right actions.Combine that with the fact that I couldn't return to the open world, meant my last memories of the game are negative, which is a shame because the climax of the story was excellant, and the little twists amazing. This is a game with an excellant story! What a shame a couple of silly design decisions have offset that.I've just read on a wiki that Airtight closed a month after releasing MSS, which seems a travesty along the lines of TTLG closing after Thief 2. Disappointing news, as I was greatly looking forward to the possibility of further games in the series.In short, excellant game, buy it, play it, enjoy it! And commiserate over the fact that they might not be any follow ups. (And probably spare a curse for the publishers that probably cause the shuttering)			"

												I can't recommend this. I don't mean to diminish the efforts of those who worked on this game. I want to acknowledge it, clearly a good bit of work was put into this game, but in the end if someone was to ask me ""Should I spend my money and time on this game?"" I would have to say no.GraphicsReally great. The models and textures are finely detailed. The environments are beautiful and cluttered, as they should be. You can really have a lot of freedom when your character doesn't care about most collision. Only one texture stood out to me as bad: the police badges. It was sort of distracting when it was right in the camera sometimes. The engine runs beautifully as well, I was able to turn everything to its absolute maximum and run with only a few hitches, even with the anti-aliasing at x16 and HBAO at high definition. I don't think I've had any other game run so well with similar graphical settings.What really confused me was the pre-rendered cutscenes, they were everywhere! This game probably would have been a couple gigabytes smaller without all the unnecessary pre-renders. I don't know if it was for consoles or something, but they never did anything in the cutscenes that they didn't also do in live render. The most baffling cutscenes were the dialogue trees where characters would just sit in their idle animations waiting for me to select something, then pop into a pre-render. They were actually rendered at worse settings then encoded with Bink Video, resulting in a pixelly mess that just made me confused and annoyed.Sound designVery good with some few nitpicks. Stumbling into the little spirit traps on the ground makes an annoyingly loud orchestral sting, which isn't really necessary when Ronan's gasping in terror and the screen is doing everything it can to make me feel attacked. There was a weird bug where sometimes cutscenes wouldn't have audio until I restarted. Overall however, the ambient music was subtle yet evocative.StoryWell-paced and keeps you interested. Unfortunately it's kind of short. It's not that it needed to be any longer, I felt it wasn't rushed at all. The main characters are well written and voice-acted and the random citizens are well voice-acted, but the stories you unlock for collecting all the things are not so good. It was sort of a letdown after running all over the place, only to be rewarded with the actors sighing and pausing and ""ohh what a terrible experience"" when somehow they all sound like the same person being told how to be scared rather than feeling it.GameplayThis is a large part of why I can't recommend this. It's a murder mystery where you run around collecting clues at various scenes and putting them together to come to conclusions, but it wasn't done all that well, really. I felt quite often that a clue I had to pick didn't really make any sense, because I HAD to pick three or I apparently couldn't come to a conclusion. Sometimes I knew what the game wanted, but was able to pick out several other clues that could lead me to the same conclusion, that I could see people picking and being annoyed that they got it wrong. Sometimes the conclusion didn't make any sense. Are you sure she's being taken to that gallows in particular? Salem, Masseschussetts has no other gallows sitting around? All the other murder scenes were improvised and scattered everywhere, it didn't have to be right there and it didn't have to be a hanging anyway.There's no real consequence to being wrong except that you don't get ""three out of three badges"". Frankly, I wish there was just no consequence at all. The game doesn't need to tell me that I have to solve the murder, I know I have to solve the murder because I'm invested in the character and I care about the story. The annoyance of the game telling me I'm not perfect at its flawed system really dragged me out of the investigations. The only real consequence happens at the very end of the game in a terrible timed sequence that isn't really timed anyway because it pauses while you make your selection.CombatOkay, but ultimately pointless. Demons float around on limited paths and you have to execute them from behind. They can't see you through walls, but you can see them through anything. If they see you, they'll start sucking out your essence which works through walls, even walls that you can't normally walk through. It doesn't even matter if you get really far away from them, you'll die. However, sometimes I could break the drain for seemingly no reason by running through a bunch of walls or going down stairs. What you're supposed to do is hide, but that system sucks because the demons just go straight to the spot you're in, despite ""not being able to see you"". If you don't move to another one, they'll push you out and then your camera will probably get stuck in them, so you can't hide again. If you are able to, they'll immediately go back to searching for you even though they just saw what you did.That ended up being kind of a mess, but that's the whole logic of the combat in this game. It makes zero sense. They can't see you when you're behind a wall, hiding, or just more than ten feet from them, but they can ALWAYS see you if they're draining you, but not if you hide, even if you were just about to die and they're two feet from you. Other demons won't notice you killing their ""friends"". Ronan instantly knows how to kill them even though he can't do things as basic as teleportation (which he also instantly learns when he decides to 'figure it out') and it doesn't seem remarkable that he's able to kill them with ease, even though everyone else is scared of them. So basically, it was slapped into the game to pad the length and fill out the environments.AnimationGet a facial animator! Please for the love of God get a facial animator, Squenix! Every game that you make is played by terrible over-body-animated mannequins! I wish I was exaggerating! The models are great, but the fact that they rarely move their eyes, eyebrows, nose, cheeks or even lips to do anything that isn't lipsyncing is so frustrating. A few scenes had me watching the characters' backs while they talked, which was really immersive. The good acting, writing, sound design and rendering, all of it worked together, just to be ripped apart when I saw their faces.The endingLiterally every resolution in the ending happens offscreen. Deadlines, budget cuts. I don't know. Joy gets her own self out of the noose and bindings somehow, despite that these are devices made to require someone else's help. Rex is fine but we never see him get up or say a word about literally being possessed. He's not accused of anything and nobody thinks that this is strange. The two officers that were forced to murder-suicide are never mentioned, not that they should have known he was there, and also it was only the two of them and no backup for the freakin' Bell Killer, who's been known to have superhuman strength and abilities. Joy meets her mother, but we never see more than the back of her leg and hand after she's the centerpiece of the plot. Baxter is ignored. Ronan gets his peace but we don't even get to see Julia again. There is no mention of the resolution to the Bell Killer case. The ending is all of thirty seconds long, but they're more than happy to force you to sit through the credits for five minutes.In the end it's just a letdown of an experience, even if it is pretty.

												I really enjoyed this game. It had a very nice balance between the ghost and the detective parts. The story was interesting although a little predictable. Great characters and voice acting. One issue was that the color pallet made it kind of hard to see and then navigate the city. While it was very pretty, there wasn't much variety and one place tended to look like every other place.  But my main criticism is that I wanted more of...almost everything. More things and people to interact with, more choices when you possess people but mostly more gameplay. I would have played this game for fifty hours if I had been able to.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Murdered, I felt that the story was gripping, and the characters intriguing, and get this: a likeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a main character! In other words, he is your archetypical d-bag with a sense of justice, but he is very intriguing, you’ll find out more about that as you play the game, since I don’t want to spoil anything, even minor details….I will say that the “combat” is the weakest part of the game, but thankfully those are generally few and far in between, all it is, is a twist on cover based stealth system that is quite frankly very annoying and frustrating to say the least.But by far the strongest point of the game is the investigation scenes, during which, you find clues and develop several inferences, thankfully the game doesn’t really hold your hand much in the way the Sherlock Holmes game does.To keep this short, I do recommend the game, it isn’t perfect and certainly isn’t worth the asking price of 40-50 bucks, as the length leaves something to be desired.... I do encourage you to pick the game up if you happen to see it on sale for <$20Happy Gaming :D "

												I had my worries of the game especially considering how multiple gaming review sites just loved to tear it a new one. I found however a particular repeating element and pattern that struck me the wrong way in most of them. The major complaints often revolve around repetition and easy difficulty structure. The learning curve is rather flat while taking the time to solve mysteries and crimes is often called child's play at that. I hate to use this term but it just feels so rather Meta in the face of the pace the game seems to give off. Salem just looks so ghostly inviting and everywhere has the potential for you to take the time and admire the lives of the still living. At the same time it just doesn't feel like a burden to get to the next part of the story and become all the more curious of the world around you. Even the collectables have merit in the stories they tell. It just seems that a great number of people expected a rather explosive and mind bending experience. Murdered: Soul Suspect is like a brisk walk through the undead and spiritual park. It's a pleasant walk. It has a great way of not stifling the flow it has set up and the characters you come to find along the way give a curious nuance to the atmosphere. Would I say the game is flawless or addictive? No, I do not believe it is an extreme grabber that you can't let go of. It's more like that book you've been wanting to read for awhile and you just finally got down to reading it. Take your time, appreciate the attention to details, and you'll feel all the more rewarded for the investment. If you're more set on something more fast paced and hectic then perhaps another title may be up your alley.  "

												It took me 8 Hours to Complete the Main Story. Playing through the game felt satisfying as you learn more about the Killer. It was a very good game for those who are interested into Detective and Mystery. The game has a little bit of Pointless running through the city at the start, but then I realised it was nice to have a bit of an explore and not completely confined to a small area. It's a shame there is no form of replayability unless you are looking for the 100% collect everything. Although good Story and as I said before, I enjoyed it regardless of what the more professional reviewers are saying. 8 out of 10.			"

												Good adventure game with a good story. Not a fast-paced game and with very few action elements, but it was never supposed to be an action game to begin with. Soul Suspect plays more like an adventure game with puzzles with an occassional fighting scene (which itself is presented like an action puzzle with a small amount of strategy involved). The atmosphere is great. Sound (voice and music) and visuals are superb and convincing and set the mood for the game right away. The story is classical detective story, obviously with supernatural elements, is well written and even though not mind blowing in its ""message"", it kept me completely immersed en interested through the whole game. The game world is not very big,but detailed and varying, and there are very many things to observe and find. Lots of collectibles, but these are done right: when found, they provide smaller details to the story, or tell separate smaller stories of their own.Gameplay puzzles aren't very difficult, and failing them doesn't give any penalty. The detective puzzles will remind a lot of LA Noire, but are somewhat easier. To sum up: not a game for people looking for action. It is rather a game for people who don't mind standing still occasionally in a game for a while to observe the surroundings and solve a puzzle or mystery. If you are one of those, you are in for a treat: the game is very convincing as a supernatural spooky detective.PS: almost no bugs found, except cinematics graphics sometimes appeared in much worse quality than actual gameplay (which are pretty good). Also keep in mind that collectibles you might have missed can't be collected once you finish the game (the game notifies about this in the last scene).			"

												I was very interested in a game where you play as a ghost detective solving your own murder, which made me jump on a preorder. I don't regret my decision, but it wasn't really what I expected.It's a third person Unreal Engine game, which you've probably played a million times before. What's special about this game is that it's more about solving murders and gathering clues than hiding behind cover and shooting at aliens. Also, you're a freaking ghost. You can phase through walls, possess NPCs to read their thoughts or influence them, talk to other ghosts and stuff like that. You're a little limited in what you can do, but it's still a novel twist.For the most part you're just walking around, picking up collectibles and looking at clues. Fair enough. I don't need complicated gameplay systems to enjoy my games. But what about puzzles? Detective work other than ""look at X""? Challenges?The game doesn't have much of that, and this is where it suffers. It tries to mix things up here and there with some ghost powers and some demons you have to get rid of, but it's not much. I'm guessing a lot was cut during development, to the point where the gameplay feels underdeveloped, or like this game would work better as a point-and-click adventure game or something more like an interactive movie. My thirst for collectibles (of which there are a lot in this game) and the well-paced story was what kept me going through most of the game.You're not the first to be murdered by this Bell Killer guy, so you're sent on a chase that takes you to different locations to uncover more connections. The game has a pretty big arsenal of cutscenes that are generally well-produced. It was easy to get invested and want to see more. I lost this admiration a bit at the end when things got super cliched, but I know that for the majority of the game I was really enjoying the way the game was headed and happily followed where it wanted me to go. You really need this when the gameplay itself doesn't provide much challenge. The main story is fleshed out with collectibles that relate to the town of Salem (this game is set in Salem, speaking of cliches) and to the relationship between you and other characters including your recently deceased wife (very cute!).The well-produced story and the novel twist on third-person exploration made this game worth playing for me. The part where it's supposed to be a detective game falls flat when the gameplay systems have been either underdeveloped or just assumes that the player is a child, so keep this in mind. Still, the good outweighed the bad for me, so don't be too scared by the lackluster reception.			"

 Murdered: Soul Suspect  Very cool game with nice storyline, interesting characters and with a lot of collectibles. We play the detective Ronan O'Connor, who was murdered and our goal is to find out who is the serial killer and the game takes place in the town of Salem. In my opinion the plot is cool and has a very charismatic main character but in terms of gameplay it is monotonous and repetitive. When visiting some of the places in a open world which is the link between the major sites we will meet only  4 ghosts that they need our help and a large amount collectibles. As for the ghosts, these are a interesting side missions, but there are not many, and as for collectibles they are generally interesting and show us a different stories. Cool title for people who like to finish the game on 100%.  "

Great characters and voice acting. One issue was that the color pallet made it kind of hard to see and then navigate the city. While it was very pretty, there wasn't much variety and one place tended to look like every other place.  But my main criticism is that I wanted more of...almost everything. More things and people to interact with, more choices when you possess people but mostly more gameplay. I would have played this game for fifty hours if I had been able to.			"

Also may I point this out, not sure if the creator intended or or if it is a bug, some events that requires ""Reveal"" or ""Remove"" are automatically respawned again after moving from a place like for example the church then the streets. It's already recorded that you got them but it confuses me sometimes. Pretty easy to beat to be honest. It would've been better also if there was a Free-Roam Mode after you beat the game as to complete the collectables I've missed/complete my steam achievements.So yeah, overall it's not a bad game and pretty much I would recommend you to buy this especially if it's on sale.

												Well, a lot of what you've heard about this game is true. There is a lot of clunk to its port (the menu has no mouse support and doesn't even use arrow keys). The ""combat"" amounts to a random key press alongside a random mouse button click. And the mystery isn't that complex. So why am I recommending it, you ask? Because it never lost my attention. Between the atmosphere, the unlockable ghost stories, and the main case (albeit not Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stuff) it was just a lot of fun to play. I even got into the random key sequences of excuting demons (and was a bit suprised that in the beginning my nerves would betray me and I'd fail at times). It was Airtight's swan song, and you can almost feel it in there what with the brevity and all, but it is a nice tune for those seeking an atmospheric haunted noire vibe. Definitely not for everyone, but much better than the critics have given it credit for, that's for sure.			"

												This is a great game for those who like stories. It is very cinematic and its storytelling involves the player in Ronan's story. It's more a mystery story than a horror one (even though it has some elements). I'm going to start reviewing from the negative stuff to the positive:- Not being able to change the controls in PC is a joke. This will prevent left-handed people from playing and makes the only difficult spot more difficult by choosing ridiculous key controls - That said, the game is not difficult at all (it's almost an interactive movie), though in certain spots the difficulty spikes due to the controls- There's plenty of reading if you want to know the whole stories that make the side quests, but there's a bug in the game: if you want to read the stories of the items on the menu, press Enter, not the mouse- There's plenty of stuff to do and to collect in the city and you have almost complete freedom to move around. Still I'd have liked the option of finishing the side quests before ending the game.- The game design works great to make you feel like a ghost. I soon realised that even though I was dead I still tended to try to walk through doors instead of walls""- The experience is great.Oh, and as someone said, you can posses cats. And meow.			"

												I played through Murdered: Soul Suspect back in 2015 and I remember this being a very unique game with the story. Its basically a first person adventure/action type game where you solve you're own murder case. I thought it was well-made and had a lot of fun playing this. I would recommend this game and would give this a 9/10.			"

												By all accounts, this game should have never been made in 2014.  The market for AAA games demand experiences much different than this one.  This is a niche game, and throwing so many resources at it is a terrible, terrible business decision.The game has almost no combat, and is driven by dialogue, information gathering, and narrative.That said, I am writing this after just completing it, with a huge grin on my face.  The story in this game is STELLAR.  It evokes the slower pacing and murder mystery elements of games like the Blackwell franchise and LA Noire.  It's also compounded with supernatural elements and a heavy influence from the Salem Witch Trials.At it's heart, it's a murder mystery (your own, in fact.)  But once it starts unfolding, there is an incredible narrative to be experienced, one I highly recommend, if you don't mind slow pacing in video games.I can't recommend this to everyone, but if you love a good mystery, and prefer dialogue to gunplay, then I cannot recommend this game enough.  Like I said, it's a niche game, and if you fall into that niche, then please, please, play this game.			"

												Worth playing and highly recommended, I personally enjoyed it and the story wasn't all that bad.Should be noted the controls can be sometimes cumbersome but honestly wasn't something that bothered me. Also, yeah there's a lot of 'search and collect' but everybody needs to realise it's OPTIONAL but it does bring some light and backstory details.			"

												Good atmosphere, music, and story. I think the ending was worth the time. Also, it's fully dubbed into Spanish, which is great.Now, I would only recommend buying this game on sale (it's 3€ now at some sites, which is quite fair). The puzzles are basically ""Mysterium"" in a nutshell, which means they sometimes make sense, and some other times you just random-click through all of the clues until you get them right cause they make absolutely no sense except for the guy who made the game lol.Some people find demons stupid. I think they're a nice touch. Repetitive, indeed, but they create some sort of fear that you wouldn't feel without them, cause you never know when ""exactly"" they are gonna pop up (but you can mostly guess). Most ghost hiding places are unnecessary, though, since you won't ever use them at all.Collectibles, collectibles everywhere. I found most of them naturally because I inspect all the stages before moving on with the story, so that I don't have to interrupt it later on to find them. I missed all the graffities, tho. Had to find them with a guide. No idea how to find all of them otherwise, except by luck. IMPORTANT: make sure you find everything before Judgement House. Otherwise you will be unable to do it later on, since the game locks you out of the city at the end (no free-roam after the credits).NPCs are repetitive as hell. Mind reading is useless, since they all think pretty much the same things. Ghost teleportation and possession come in handy in few occasions for the plot, and that's about it. Also, there are only like 5 side missions, and the most interesting one was the first one at the apartment.On the bright side, you can possess cats, xD. Press Y to meow.			"

												It has been awhile since I’ve played an adventure game. An honest to god adventure game, where you play the character to pass a few simple puzzles to unlock the next part of the story. And Murdered: Soul Suspect developed by Airtight Games scratches that itch. Albeit it does have its flaws.Lets get the basics out of the way, you play a cop by the name of Ronan and in the first seconds of the game you get to see your character die. But unlike a lot of games this isn’t the end, because you become a ghost. Who in order to move on has to find out who murdered him. That’s the basic plot of the game, and the main story line. And so you will spend roughly 8-12 hours going through all of Salem’s locations hunting down the clues to discover your murder. Along the way you’ll befriend some people and learn some very unsettling secrets about the town.While the story isn’t the most complicated or even the best it still is written and presented well enough to be enjoyable. Along with the side quest and collectibles that fill in the background details about the town and the various characters it kept me enthralled for the nine hours that I played it, but then some peoples mileage may vary. The one complaint I will have is that the developers didn’t put more background in, or even more interesting stuff. As in very early in the game you help a young girl discover what happened to her and why she was dead, you barely ever come close to that type of detail again. And that is sad because of this the background environment in terms of engagement is inconsistent, because at one end you find a piece of the map full of history and maybe a doctor who was performing experiments on his patients then at the other end you have a boring area that you have to navigate constantly to get to other locations in the game.  Seriously it gets tedious having to run the same gauntlet over and over again, with nothing changed just the same old Salem with the same old random NPC’s.As for the gameplay mechanics, you will have learned almost everything within the first hour of how to play this game, except for a couple of “powers” you learn later on. You’re a ghost, you can pass through physical real world barriers, except for ghost barriers and all the houses in Salem are blessed or something so you can’t get into them without there being an opening of some kind. You can manipulate real world things like tv’s, phones, and printers, but except for missions these abilities don’t rouse a response out of the people in Salem. You can possess people to hear there thoughts, which there are not many of them. You can influence them to advance the case and you can view the world through there eyes to once again advance the case. Pretty nifty thing, but only actually used in the missions and have very littler bearing on the game.And that is pretty much the sum total of the game in mechanics other than the bad guys. Which are demons and floor demons as I will call them.Just like most adventure games of the past the bad guys pose little to no challenge and are merely there to present a hurdle to bypass. For being called demons if its 1V1 I’m going to win all the time. You hide in shades wait for them to turn there backs and then rip them apart. Also you can use ravens to distract them, but ravens ain’t used a lot. As for floor demons just side step them. Graphics wise, the game is pretty good, not the prettiest in terms of background environment and the character models look a bit dated, they remind me of XCOM the Bureau, or even LA Norie, but that’s not a bad thing as those games had good graphics as well. And as with anything graphics are not everything as the recent trend in PC gaming can attest to.  So you may be asking why I seemed to be praising this game in the beginning but point out a lot of flaws in it. Well because in truth there are very few actual adventure games made by triple A developers anymore so anything coming out in this genre that isn’t a bug ridden mess, it will be enjoyed by those of us who like adventure games. Where you play a guy or women trying to unfold a story, either by solving puzzles or piecing the story together . Where you don’t have to gun down an armies worth of bad guys to move from one area to the next. Where the bad guys have to be planned around as you really have no actual defense against them. Where you know you can’t lose but hate the fact that you screw up sometimes. So for an adventure game, Murdered Soul Suspect is a fine addition, its has a fairly strong main storyline and some pretty interesting side storylines and background storylines, but as I said before could use a few more to liven the area up even more. (Maybe some DLC?)For a game it is pretty average to mediocre though, with most gameplay mechanics discovered and mastered in the first hour it leaves little advancement in that area. The NPC’s are uninteresting, the graphics compared to top of the line are dated, gameplay is pretty linear, and replayability, well to be honest there is none. I’ve played ten hours and the game will probably sit there unless I have an itch to find those 5 pieces of background info/collectibles. So final verdict? If you are a fan of adventure games and smooth easy gameplay, then Soul Suspect is the perfect game for you. But if you are new to adventure games, or expecting something different then I wouldn’t suggest this game. And even if you are a fan of the genre this will slot into, wait till it drops to under $20 for it to be worth the money.			"

												If ever a game was underrated, it's this one. Fantastic story from start to finish, unique gameplay, sure it is a little rough around the edges in places but honestly it is worth playing.I play many single player games and whilst they are enjoyable a lot of them are forgettable copy and paste jobs, this is one of those games that 5 years from now, I will still remember playing, such is how unique the concept is and how good the story was.Also, the voice acting is top notch.

												This is a ghost story, About a abused misunderstood criminal, who meets his soul mate and turns a new leaf on life by becoming a detective with the help of his brother-in-law, He places the story of his life in tattoos that cover his body. His wife dies and he becomes reckless, and winds up geting killed. Now hes a ghost, searching for his killer. Theres alot to do in this game, through fairly easy. you have your main story, about 7 additional ghost stories to uncover, history on salem, and many other artifacts, something like 200 Items to search for. As a ghost you get abilities as the game progresses. The game really does not punish for wrong choices except you lose your gold badge status if you mess up. Steam has achievements to earn. There are demons and demon traps so you need to be carefull where you step, or if your running from demons not to step into traps. You can kill demons by getting behind them. or you can try to avoid them. I perfer just to kill them and get them out of the way. The game is not set up so you fail, it relies on the story telling and requires you to scour areas with a fine tooth comb to unlock all the stuff thats needs to be found. Just running through the main story makes for a short game, But trying to collect everything makes a very long game. So the choice is yours. The graphics are very good, I have not found any glitches or bugs in my two play throughs, the controls are responsive. I'd recommend this game for anyone who just wants a casual interesting story to sit back and relax and play. With that in mind the critics scores on this game is unjust. It's not a 10, but more like a 7.			"

All around its a decent buy if you're into this kind of game (puzzles and exploring) or have money lying around waiting to be used. I'd highly suggest waiting for any kind of discount or sale though, since it's still a bit much to pay for this amount of content in my opinion.			"

												(I know it says it only have 5 hours on the clock but it's closer to six, around 5 hours and 45 minutes in all..that's how long it took me to finish it.)First thing i'll say is you should half ignore the paid critic reviews the only thing they got right is when they say ""It lacks a challenge"" Because that's true, this game is straight up easy from start to finish. the investigations are fun but pretty much handed to you on a plate. There is little to no combat in this game save for taking out roaming demons wit the equivilant of a stealth kill...or..stealth...banishment i guess? you have hiding spots to evade and avoid detection from these demons, there are also crows scattered around that you can use to distract them, making it easier for you to sneak up behind and take them out.That really is the only form of challenge you will find in this game and even then..it's only a challenge when there are no hiding spots around and no crows.....and even then it's still easy as hell to take them out. The story and characters are what will keep you playing here.The story is interesting, gripping and just down right fun to experience though you could easily just watch the story play out on youtube. If you want to experience this game for yourself then i suggest picking it up on sale. i'll give it a 7/10 for being short and just way too easy			"

												This game is really fun. The story hooked me in right from the start and never let go until the 'yell at your tv' ending. I find the gameplay mechanics refreshing and fun. You are a ghost so you can't directly interact with most things, but you can look and piece together clues leading you through the games story amazingly well. I don't think i ever got frustratingly stuck or bored of the gameplay. The story and gameplay flow together nicely. And the characters! I found them all to be believable, with no cliche cardboard cutouts among the main characters. The collection of all the items in the game adds more reason to search through the levels and adds a nice layer onto the story with collectables about the main character, the enemy, and even the town itself. The world feels very historic. Some might argue that it is too linear, but I personally liked that places were blocked off or I would have spent hours rifling through large buildings, getting lost XDMaybe my only complaint about the game is that there is no map, and since you can go through walls, it can get disorienting. I get that a ghost cant really carry around a map haha, its just a little nitpick, overall I loved the game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great story and a fun time :)			"

												Finished the game in one sitting. I found it quite short but I also didn't complete all side strories, only 4 of them.The remaining stories would require a lot more, find the hidden item on the map, which I don't find that exciting to do.The playstyle was a nice change of pace from other games. Playing as a ghost and learning your abilities was cool.The storyline was ok and very LA Noire voice style. Finding clues didn't flow very well at some times since it was very obvious what happened but the detective character sounded like he didn't have a clue which was strange coming from an experienced detective. Maybe I have just watched too many detective movies.I recommend playing it but at a discounted price like I was able to get, thankfully.			"

												Two important features this doesn't have: Multiple saves and letting you complete side-missions after you finish. The issues are linked, since there's an auto-saving checkpoint maybe three minutes before the end that doesn't let you go back for no good reason (and you can't turn toggle autosave). At least there's a warning but it's still far less than ideal.If I'm not mistaken the collectibles in the museum area also become unavailable once you enter the judgement house, this time without warning.Otherwise it's decent, but not for 40€. 30€ maybe, since the game is just not that long. (I completed the side missions but not all collectible hunts, and I'm not going back since my save is effectively wrecked, which is definitely in part my fault but not something I expect to be an issue in a good game.)

It was obviously a filler.The dectective bits are fun but VERY simple, I was expecting to use my brain more.Also there is no in game map, which can make collecting those abundant collectibles VERY annoying. In fact, the game does rely you to collect them as a crux, which is a bad decision by a dev.Overall, wait for a steam sale, for now, a weak 7/10.			"

Murdered: Soul Suspect Review - NihoesI know what you're thinking. Is the game a detective game? Is it like L.A Noir? These two questions are the most common asked ones, and it's a little bit like L.A Noir, but that is only because you can take choices on what to ask other dead persons. Since you're gonna meet others like you, each one of them, have their own story. You can travel into living persons mind and read them, or you can ""posses"" them. Not making them do things for you, but you can make them think thoughts that you kinda implant in their head, You can't make them do things for you, as like you ""posses"" a police officer, and then control him, nope not gonna happend.The game not only got the whole detective genre going on, but also a good old thriller.If you like mystery, thriller, action, then this is game for you. You're Ronan, a former gang member who gets tattoos for each and every 'great' memory in his life that he wants to remeber for his very own personal reason.Visit my profile to see screenshots of the game.-Nihoes			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic! I've been playing it throughout the weekend and i've just finished it. I thought it was great. I found the story to be very interesting and everytime I was left with a cliffhanger I wanted to know what happened next. The fact you play as a ghost makes the game all the more interesting to play. You cannot pick up objects and normal people cannot see or hear you. It's a very interesting way to play a game but I really like it and I think it adds a hint of uniqueness to the game.  If you've ever played L.A noire you'll probably be fairly familiar with the concept of this game (finding clues and solving cases) but gameplay wise they are completely differnet, you cannot pick up and examine clues you find for example.Don't let the negative reviews for this game turn you off from buying it. It's a fantastic game with a great story and for £24.99 (even lower on other sites) it's a bargain! I highly recommend this game to any fans of the genre.			"

												For those who don't want to read a wall of text; I give the game a 6.5/10The Short review:Pros+Main story pans out rather well+Collectible ghost stories are great+Unique concept+Intriguing secondary characters (pretty much everyone but Ronan)+Diverse game world+Despite the limited/focused gameplay, it did not get repetitive+No bugs/perfect performance, especially at launchCons-Very short (7hrs to 100%)-Limited side missions-Small game world by modern standards-Ronan, and the investigation system, can be really..really stupid-The facial expressions for pretty much every character in the game sucks**-Limited number of character models, despite how few ghosts you can interact with-Probably would have been received better if it was at a cheaper price**My long review was actually way too long, but the rather awkward facial expressions throughout the game are the most important part of the review that I had to cut outThe (Really) Long review:STORY 6.5/10 - Chances are, you already realize the Murdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure game based very heavily around a story, and that story quite often falls flat on its face in terms of portraying the sense of whodunit type mystery you would get from anything Sherlock Holmes, or from similar games such as LA Noire. The main story starts off kind of rocky, but as it pans out, and you learn to ignore the hand-holding that occurs during the investigations and some of the sillier plot points (where the game screams THIS IS IMPORTANT), it actually becomes quite intriguing. I found myself actually ruling people out as the Bell Killer, with my mind firmly set on one person from very early on in the game. To my pleasant surprise, I only partially anticipated the ending, and it wasn't something from way out in left field as you would find in an M Night Shyamalan movie. It worked (eventually).What didn't work in this game, are many of the aforementioned investigations that hold your hand throughout, often making it obscenely clear exactly what happened without ever even looking at any of the evidence at the scene. In most cases, you needed to guide Ronan to each piece of evidence (generally around 10 items), at which point he would make a remark that is often idiotic (and very often the complete opposite of what the item clearly gave me the impression of) about how it may pertain to the case, and after you have collected sufficient evidence, you would choose the items Ronan deemed important in closing the case. Since chances are you already know what happened, you would then need to find the two or three items that Ronan needed before you could move on to the more enjoyable parts of the game. This burden is frequently increased by Ronan's tendency to ignore VERY important evidence, that could immediately close the case, to focus on items that don't really help his investigation..at all. In general, what could have perhaps been the main draw for many people in this game, ended up feeling trivial and even, at times, tacked on as an after-thought. This became especially apparent when comparing the investigative stories to what was probably my favorite part of the game.Perhaps the most redeeming quality of the game in terms of story, is sadly the part of the game that most people are likely to overlook. Each area of the game has a set of collectibles that you can gather to get a better understanding the lore surrounding that part of Salem, as portrayed through a spooky ghost story. Between these and the investigations, it definitely appears that the ghost stories took a backseat in terms of time spent working on them in the production process, as they consist of a single voice actor describing a very short ghost story, while you look at a spooky picture related to the story. It sounds lame, sure, a cinematic would have made more sense, but at the same time I think it allows you to focus more on the story itself. The ability to successfully portray a spooky story with what seems to be as little effort as possible makes me wonder why this wasn't more of a horror-based adventure game, than a detective-y investigation-y game. Perhaps the most depressing part of the story is the fact that it is so short, clocking in at only 7hrs from start to finish, getting 100% of the achievements at the same time. I would have liked to see more side missions (I'd say investigations, but there wasn't really any of  that going on), and a generally longer story than the game had to offer.CHARACTERS 7.5/10 - Ronan is basically a walking cliché for a bad guy gone good guy cop who does more than just toe the line between cop and criminal when he works cases. You can pretty much ignore his character entirely for a good portion of the game as his comments tend to only point out the other flaws in the game. Joy, the teenage medium, even comes off as a rather cliché young pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but her character does evolve rather well. When it comes to characters, the game really shines with the secondary characters, such as Baxter, and some of the Bell Killer's victims that you meet along your journey, who have all interacted with the killer in one way or another, and you get to see how that experience has changed them - for better or worse. The same split between really good and really boring characters can be seen in the all-to-few number of side investigations that you can find scattered across Salem, where someone may have a problem that you offer to investigate, and inevitably fix. In the cases where the characters are lame, it is often because of the same thing the investigation part of the game suffers from, the answer being too blatantly obvious to not think that character is an idiot for not seeing it. In other cases, it is clear that the character is in a literal limbo, and they need your help getting out of it. GAMEPLAY 8/10 - First off, the game as a whole  works beautifully, both as a game being played on launch week, and a game in general, as I found no bugs of any kind while playing through the game. Chances are, part of the reason the game runs so great is because it is just so simplistic. The combat in the game is about as basic as you can get, and would most likely have become very redundant had there been more combat sequences in the game. I had only just started to get sick of dealing with demons by the time I reach the last half hour or so of gameplay. It is very clear that the focus is on story and investigating the crimes of the Bell Killer (see the story section for why that is a letdown).The world around Ronan becomes increasingly impressive, and creepy, as the frequency of ghosts increases, but in general I got a very Twilight-zone-empty-town feel from Salem, and the ghosts flat out reminded me of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disney World. Ultimately, the living people that populated Salem ended up feeling even more empty than their ghostly counterparts, which I think actually gave me an even creepier vibe from the game, although I don't think that was totally intentional.While making the world feel a bit more lively is kind of optional, since a gloomier look does make sense to me as you are playing a ghost, I think Salem definitely should have been larger than it was. By the time you reach the credits, you will have only explored just over a half dozen different parts of Salem, and the streets of (a rather small) Salem itself. Sure, the areas are diverse, consisting of everything from a Church, to a Police Station, and a Mental Hospital, but none of the areas are very large, further adding to the small-world feel of the game. On the other hand, with how tedious the combat had become by the end of the game, and how pointless the investigations were (they weren't quite tedious, but certainly would have been soon enough), I think focusing more on other aspects of the game first would have been more important than expanding the world around Ronan.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect was easily the biggest surprise of 2015 for me, and I think the last game that really blew away my expectations to the same extent was the psychologically assaulting trek through the sands of Spec Ops: The Line. Now of course that comparison gives Soul Suspect a lot more credit than it deserves, it’s a far from perfect game and certainly won’t be looked back on as a game design milestone. But while I expected a more or less point and click hidden object game with fancy 3D graphics and bizarrely contrived QTE’s, what I got was a decent story entwined in a fascinating and well fleshed out word with fantastic mechanics to handle action sequences.Honestly, yes. If I had to boil this game down into a single genre I would have to go with a point and click adventure. The main backbone of the game is walking from crime scene to crime scene and pressing X when you spot a clue. There is certainly nothing revolutionary about the mechanic but the content of the clues- and to a much larger extent the collectibles- brings to light a remarkably well imagined world. Now I’m not well versed in the history of Salem and the details of the witch trials, but I think the writers put in a good amount of creative effort bringing an engaging fictional story into a very real place and time. Typically the little factoids littered around the game world only appeal to completionist minded individuals like myself, however I found myself on a multitude of occasions scouring the town for that last entry to figure out the end of a story.The visuals of the game are adequate, nothing that I didn’t expect after looking at 2 or 3 screenshots. I was able to run the game mostly maxed out on my 680 and the framerate was stable and consistent.Here is the thing that made the game for me: the “final boss”. Don’t worry I will not spoil a thing, and it was actually the absence of something which made it utterly refreshing and a huge relief. Aside from a handful of action-y stealth segments with demons, the game is slow and narrative driven. As I felt the story come closer and closer to a close I got this feeling of dread. You see I know how AAA games go nowadays, every fiber of my being was expecting this dreadful quick time event unfair boss fight that has no continuity with the entire rest of the game. I was even tempted to not finish the game myself and watch the ending online because I didn’t want to walk away from such a great experience with a terrible taste in my mouth. Yet the developers NAILED it. No it’s not a spectacle and no it’s not brutally difficult, but it was satisfying and conclusive to the narrative. The amount of relief I felt at the ending was overwhelming.I’ve harped a lot on a very little point of the game, but it was a big reason this game left me with such a positive view of it. Murdered: Soul Suspect is not perfect but it’s a breath of fresh air for narrative centric games and it kept me engaged and entertained the whole way through.			"

												Such a great game that is a perfect escape from the everyday shooters, this is fantastic and works seamlessly with 'Big Picture' on my TV with an Xbox controller. I Highly reccomend this title, Soul Suspect will sit in my game library as one of the few that actually complete. Great single player game to chill out to and be part of the story!			"

												Basically a watered down LA Noire with ghosts. Storyline was somewhat enjoyable, although you can compare it to some amateur detective novel. Gameplay mechanics and the world are shallow and very linear. It has one of the worst clunky controls I've ever seen, even playing with a controller didn't help much.If you get it for a few euros, it's alright for a couple of hours of enjoyment, otherwise stay away.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect developers have implemented completely new type of investigation games. 'What is it about?', you may ask, so the answer is below:You are local of Salem, Massachusetts, the place which is mostly associated with XVII-century's history about witches, that people were hunting at and then, after catching them, they were burned at the stake. In game, there is mystical climat exposing supernatural skills of Ronan O'Connor, the main character, who had been killed at the beginning of the game and then he transformed to a ghost, who had to face demons, solve a mystery of his death and find out, who had killed him. Ronan, while getting the 'new himself', gets new skills, which allow him to move through the walls, be invisible to people, read in people's minds and even control them! During investigation he meets some demons hunting for souls, so he needs to eliminate them, or move around the place to get safer way. The game reminds me of L.A. Noire, because you need to solve problems by getting some details and then connecting them into one, making sense trace. If you complete it successfully, you'll see what happened before.Graphic effects are nice, the gameplay is happening during the twilight, so colours are darky, but they keep you even closer, because of usage them in thrilling details around. The Unreal Engine 3 is helping the game to get high details of buildings, models and characters, as well as good animations. The last thing I want to mention about is sound - thrilling music showing overwhelming atmosphere of Salem and live comments of O'Connor's adventures, which lead us to equating with Ronan even more.Murdered: Soul Suspect and its story completely touched my heartstrings and that's one of the reasons, why my note is very high! Great compilation of story, graphics and sound is forcing me to put 10/10. Hope you enjoy!			"

												Plot: You have been Murdered (DURH), you being the Soul Suspect (get it, cause you are dead...) have to find the Bell Killer who is responsible for your own and other peoples deaths.Gameplay: Look cool in a fedora and badass cop clothes as noclipping allows you to go through just about everything, that is not blue.You can also posses people and lisen to their thoughts, help read their memory look through thier eyes.Also you can detect stuff with all of your neat detective skills that are now much better in death apparently.Graphics: Puppies dont even look this good.Optimisation: Obviously inteded for use with a controller.The actual game runs decent enough and will actually work *cough* Watch_Dogs *cough*Pre-order bonus items: Online = A puzzle game, digital map / Retail = Boxed game, Digital map, Ronan's Diary replica.Overall score: 9.5/10 (yes, its biased)Final Thoughts: If you love walking through everything, a good mystery here or there, wearing fedoras in life and in death and smoking more cigarettes then Solid Snake then this game is for you.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is superb. This is the best criminal case game that i ve ever played. Maybe at the beginning around 20% early gameplay you will feel boring because you just walking and press button (too repetitive) but keep on goin' until this game gonna be addictive such as reading John Grisham's novel. Don't wanna stop playing untill case closed (finish the game). I bet it is not too hard to complete all achievement on this game if you replay new game again.The worst point is this game capped on 30 fps! I use MSI afterburner to monitoring and capture screenshot after i got probem cannot take any steam screenshot and open steam page (SHIFT+TAB). Maybe mod version will fix that.Of course we will hear the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason from developers to protect market on next gen console is 30 FPS MAKE THE GAME MORE CINEMATIC, such as Dark Souls 2 and other 30fps game.

 Murdered: Soul Suspect  Very cool game with nice storyline, interesting characters and with a lot of collectibles. We play the detective Ronan O'Connor, who was murdered and our goal is to find out who is the serial killer and the game takes place in the town of Salem. In my opinion the plot is cool and has a very charismatic main character but in terms of gameplay it is monotonous and repetitive. When visiting some of the places in a open world which is the link between the major sites we will meet only  4 ghosts that they need our help and a large amount collectibles. As for the ghosts, these are a interesting side missions, but there are not many, and as for collectibles they are generally interesting and show us a different stories. Cool title for people who like to finish the game on 100%.  "

												Wouldn't recomend.The camera is terrible. It's too sensitive by default and it glitches and 'spazzes' out when you walk through walls or multiple walls.The game's clues are WAY too hard to find. The puzzle solving seems stupid seeming as though there is virtually no punishment for getting wrong guesses.The game's story felt alright at first but as soon I started in the second investigation I just found my self running circles getting absolutely no where. The game doesn't let you progress until you find EVERYTHING in that investigation even though it's not relevent at all.Plus the guy wears his fedora like an idiot and the graphics look DREADFUL on medium and even with a fast computer the game runs like rubbish to say it is on the unreal engine.

												I stumbled upon this game as I was checking out the Square Enix webpage because I am a huge fan of Life is Strange and wanted to see what other titles they had that may be just as interesting. I read the information on Murdered Soul Suspect and figured I'd give it a go. I am so glad that I did. This game kept me wanting to come back to it more and more. I grew fond of Ronan and wanted to see this to the end. His ghost to medium relationship with Joy kept me amused throughout the game and their conversations back and forth lifted the darkness from the game itself. The history also was interesting as it is obvious the creators researched the Salem Witch Trials as well as other newsworthy incidents in Salem, Mass. It was well thought out on how to incorporate these details into the game without it coming across as a boring history lesson. I would have loved to have seen more helping of other ghosts around town (I think there were 4 or so?). The side quest portion I really enjoyed while continuing through the main story itself. It was fun running around Salem tracking down all the collectables. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in the Salem Witch Trials, the paranormal, and who enjoys detective work. An enjoyable game!			"

												I saw this on the Halloween sale, I took the gamble and bought it, even after hearing mixed to negative reviews about this game.Let me put one thing straight, anyone who says this is a bad game have bad taste in video games. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a great 3rd person game that involves excellent crime solving elements. The game jumps straight into the action, revealling one of, if not the biggest plot twists in the entire game. After that, you must follow the notorious Bell Killer case around Salem and catch the serial killer, however, just when you thought there wouldn't be any combat in the game, you will face demons that will eat your soul when they find you. This now kinda makes this game like LA Noire + DmC + the detective bits from the Arkham games, which makes it well worth buying.			"

												The effect of the game by the end is TV Drama soaked! You'll feel LIKE YOU WATCHED an exciting, not too modern [GET THIS] TV Drama! The game feels so RETRO (think max payne)! It is 3rd person (FPS is possible for viewing objects up close) , & you do battle ""DEMONS"" and CAN beat them! But, OH; the setting-Salem - T.H.E. world's witch capital (even for modern-day witchcraft or mysticism of the highest curiosity) as it is present day! If you need a little idea of what Salem is like; there are little stores selling witching wares (potion ingredients/recipe books) all over, Helloween is a frequented celebration and marked on the calendar! The quality of the game is good for what the story has to say! It had me guessing about this CHARACTER being in the ""OTHER WORLD"". The if's were coming to mind, if this is so then that, and so on! The main protagonist is likable (definitley in a max payne and mona sax way)! The plot does have a few twists and turns, some may find it not excitable enough, but if you can appreciate SALEM, you may then dig a little deeper in!  Hell or the reverberating idea of an after-life comes around and the realm OR influence this character has in a sort of purgatorial state until certain issues get resolved to either GO TO HEAVEN or GO TO THE -OUCH WHERE PLACE! He does avoid fiery pits to be taken pre-maturely!There is also a lot of detail that CAN be tragically left out! Game on!			"

												Good premise and atmosphere, but some of the gameplay is mediocre.It's basically an interactive story point-and-click game but with a mainstream 3rd person view, some basic stealth and QTE mechanics, and a larger budget to make it more appealing to the masses. This combination of niche and mainstream works well enough, if you have modest expectations. The story is quite enjoyable, but a bit short. Voice acting is decent, and the music fits the mood well. Graphics are fairly modest on a technical level, but some environments still manage to look beautiful, and the effects look slick. While I was expecting some rough edges with gameplay, the core mystery solving mechanics also have some flaws - the answer was sometimes too obvious or seemed inconsistent or illogical. As a console port there are some issues - flawed mouse sensitivity, clunky PC controls you cannot re-bind and a prohibitive autosave system. All these issues are annoying, but they don't ruin the game completely. Possessing cats and solving crimes as a ghost was pretty cool at times.This game reminds me a bit of Alan Wake and LA Noire. While not as good as either of those games, it was better than I thought it would be after seeing the professional reviews. Its sad the developer went bust one month after making this game.If you have modest expectations and some patience, its an enjoyable interactive-story game.Recommended, at sale price.tip: add “-nostartupmovies” to the game's steam launch settings.

												This game, just this game.I have so much praise for it that I don't even know where to begin, but I'll try to sound it off.-The gameplay is a breath of fresh-air because it's this unique blend of third-person action game with occasional stealth elements and exploration based adventure game with some crime scene investigation and mild puzzle-solving thrown for good measure. I have trouble really classifying it because I've never played anything quite like it, and it really managed to form it's own gameplay identity instead of being a clone of something else or fitting neatly into a pre-defined gameplay genre.-The graphics are also really pretty relative to how easy on the hardware it it. I was able to max it out (with AA turned off) at 1080p on a 750ti and it was rare that it dropped under FPS.-The story is brilliant and actually managed to have a couple twists that I really didn't see coming because of the way it played with my expectations near constantly and intentionally set itself up for common tropes only to subvert or play with them.-The art design is great and does this thing where it creates interesting eviroments by blending the real-world with ghostly left-overs of the past.-It was interesting how it turned no-clip into a game mechanic.-The bonus stuff like the side-missions and ghost stories were cool.I guess there is some cons, though:-The stealth sections can get tedious because the Demons tend to be a little to smart and aggressive, I often found myself trapped because they got stuck in the alert state and wouldn't go back to the posts no matter how well I stayed hidden.-Some poor optimization, I know I said it runs well but it does tend to suffer from really inconsistant framerates, it can be at 55FPS one minute and 100FPS the next and the Vsync is useless because it looks it to 30FPS instead of to your screens refresh rate.-Some of the items are to well hidden, I missed out on two of the Ghost Stories because I just could not find the last items for either, and one location even locked me out of room that the levels last item was presumably in.-No kind of map, even though the ""hub"" area is pretty huge and maze-like.-Short, I spent just over 10 hours on it and that was a playthrough with a lot of messing about and finding A LOT of the bonus items. I imagine it would be under 5 hours if you ignored the side-missions. -Price, I think $30 is pushing it. I paid $4 during a sale and I'd say it's not worth more than $15, so wait for it to go on sale.			"

												This game had a great idea, but fell so short... I played this game over several months and got to the next to last case. The ""gameplay"" was so bad the idea of spending another hour or two to complete the game was like working a job you don't get paid for. Which is a shame as there is a story and some okay characters... The gpx/controls/sound/engine/etc... were all  decent, but this should have been a pure puzzle/story game with more quests and logic puzzle type gameplay rather than the ""demon"" sections which ruined the flow and feel of the game.Needed more story and puzzles... while removing the stupid ""demon"" sectionsPS: This is a game which should take 6-8hrs to beat... the fact that I left it on my HD for so long just goes to show how little the story mattered when related to the boring gameplay... Again, good concept, poor execution...			"

												The game is ok. Detective stuff, ghost stuff, poltergeist stuff. Fine. Among these stuff, there are collectibles stuff. 170+ collectible stuff. I collected as much stuff as I possibly could, and I figured before finishing the game I can watch a video of the missed stuff, so I can recover those stuff. Well, the last stuff I needed to collect are in the museum. The same museum that you enter at the end of the game to finish the game, WITHOUTH having the chance to collect your museum missed stuff. I can't unlock the last 2-3 achievments because of 3-4 missed collectibles stuff. I deleted the game without even seeing the end, seeing who is the murderer and seeing the bright light (I presume), because frankly...without all the stuff, I don't give a sh*t how this game will end. Don't get me wrong. I'm a story kind of guy. I like story games, but the rage I just got towards the developers of the game is so huge, that I don't care about their story. And don't judge me...I like the word ""stuff"". I hope some day I will have the chance to permanetly remove this game from my library.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect, the supernatural detective thriller from Square Enix and Airtight Games. Murdered takes place in Salem, Mass and stars the newly deceased Ronan O'Connor, who sets out to learn the identity of his killer.It's an adventure game, basically, right down to the often frustrating hunt for clues. This makes up a good chunk of the gameplay and tasks you with finding a certain number of bits of info by exploring a tightly defined location, examining everything. Moving the story forwards requires you to find and identify the most relevant clues. It's not the most graceful representation of the detective's art, but it is a more compelling take on the genre than the rummage sale of irrelevant detritus that typified LA Noire.So the game is absolutely amazing The visuals, the gameplay, are all spectacular and it's refreshing. they have completely redefined storytelling in gaming with this masterpiece.

												Enjoyed this game a lot. It has a very specific gameplay, which, of course, may seem a bit boring for those, who like action. But for the seekers of an interesting detective story with spooky atmosphere and plot twists this game is ideal. Graphics is very nice too, eyecandy. The ability to possess a cat is awesome experience.			"

												A got premise doesn't make a good game.Pro:+ A very interesting concept behind the game (solve your own murder, be a ghost that can walk through everything else)Con:TL;DR: everything else-VSYNC limist the game to horrific 30 fps. disablign VSYNC leads to a lot of screen tearing (GTX 970)-Random performance issues on some maps-Video sequence graphics have worse graphics than actual ingame graphics... wtf-Extremely linear game-Horrible controls (e.g. you always have to look at stuff in a VERY exact angle while the normals XBOX controller controlls are much to sensitive, so you randomly happen to skip past this point...)-inaccuracy in opject / enemy targeting worsens the above issue-> if you LOVE having to redo a stage because of random targeting issues... or simply bugged targting... this is agame for you!-Only autosave, no normal save- Gathering achievement stuff feels unrewarding since the unlocked ""story"" for each part is sually less than 4 sentences and that's it...- You can ""Poltergeist""-stuff to distract people... but unless it's story relevant they don't give a flying f()ck whether that coffee machien nearly explodes... but if you need to disctract them for a story mission they suddely notice a fan beign switched on 3 rooms away....-THE GAME IS EXTREMELY SHORT. I think I spent as much time as I spent playing in order to avoid the stupidly placed save points.... and redoing the same stuff again.... the game already is repetitive enough..-NPC dialogues are limited to very few lines which you'll get annoyed to hear over and over if you use the ""possess"" feature-Very few sidequests- F()cking overwhelmign amounts of product placement (Essentially every God damn computer in the police station is running Deus Ex Human Evolution... Once would have been a nice Easter Egg, so many are just annoying. Well, maybe the devs wanted to show that their company at least made one good game...)Summary:The idea behind the game is GREAT. It's a good damn shame that essentially everything else went wrong. This game was a pain to play through... To bad I also hate leaving games unfinished... Let me tell you: It's simpyl not worth it...Sidenote:Why does this game have a horror tag? Because it features ghosts? Finding out you already ate the last cookie is a bigger horror...			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a pretty good game, as long as you recognize it for what it is and what it isn't. It's essentially a mystery adventure game but entirely lacking in inventory. The game play is fairly simple and most of the game is fairly easy and can be finished rather quickly. A lot of it is going from point to point, looking for clues, answering a few questions based on the clues, and moving onward. In that sense its got a lot of ""novel as game"" elements. It has a small semi-stealth-like action element that crops up a few times, but it is in no way an action game. While in some sense there's not much to the game play, it has a pretty good story and a lot of atmosphere. In addition to the main plot, there are a few side quest mysteries to solve, and a large number of collectables to find if you enjoy that aspect of games.Because the game play is fairly simple, moderately short, and its almost more of a game novel at times, the game is likely not worth full retail price, but if you can get it on sale and enjoy supernatural murder mysteries, it's a worthy pick up.

The childish easy storyline ? Stupid npc missions? The glitches since the port is  bad (at a few points of the game v sync should be on , on others off to complete it) ?The fact that even the subs are not the same as audio?The fact that the ♥♥♥♥in Salem is smaller than my neighbourhood?The 'riddles'?  Only positive here the original  idea of a ghost cop. And thats all. Have a second copy of the game which i will give it for free to a guy i hate .Playing it will be his punishment .

												This game has a very interresting concept and nice graphics. First, if you are planning to get this game, do not expect explosions, gunfights or whatever about action scene. There are none. You may avoid or kill some demons sometimes, but that is all. It is all about discovering and investigating, so if you are the kind skipping everything related to the story, this game is not suited for you, you will get bored very quickly. You will need a lot of reading and story comprehension to  get throught this game. The good thing is that, I personnally find the story awesome and intriguing, I have not finished it yet, but I will. I defenately want to see how it ends. I am not sure it is worth 50$, so wait for a discount or a cheaper price. I paid it 15$, I think it is a fair price. Again, it is all about the story, I recommend it.			"

												So no idea why it's online reviews were so bad. I've been looking forward to this game for a long time and I wasn't disappointed at all. Think of it as LA Noireish with ghosts. It's got the whole detective thing going for it which I like a lot and wish was found more often. Pros: -Compelling story, made me sit down and play though it in one sitting, amazing.-Gameplay, if you like to walk around and discover everything then this is the game for you. It never gets dull, slow or too fast. Demons are there to change up gameplay and overall I enjoyed being a exorcist.-Graphics, beautiful game, love the art, everything looks great.-I found a few Just Cause 2 posters in the game.-Even though it's supernatural it doesn't feel fake/childish.-Writing, for the most part, was done very well.-Made me want to help the lost souls and feel rewarded for doing so.-Examples about people who throw their life away.-Good ending.Cons:-Short, only about 5 hours if you stick to the story and probably close to 6-7 if you want to 100% the game.-Character development, sometimes it felt like characters weren't developed enough for me but I like to know full blown backgrounds, I wouldn't say it was bad though.-Occasional frame drops.Overall: Solid game, would definitely recommend. Good luck in the afterlife!! Morals:Don't do drugs.Don't kill yourself.Don't hold grudges.Do something with your life.			"

												""You have the right to remain silent. Any cop you throw out a window will hunt you down and kick your♥♥♥♥♥""I really enjoyed this game, a dark supernatural murder mystery. I'm not sure exactly what the critics got upset about though looking at the Metascore, but it's not as bad as they have made it out to be.As others have mentioned it is very LA Noire-ish but it's more forgiving if you make a mistake during your investigation. The story is interesting, voice acting is good, and the atmosphere/music is very similar to an early Silent Hill. The game has you spend most of your time investigating your death and tracking down your killer. Along the way you can also collect items that tell you ghost stories, interact with living and dead, and help others that have also passed move on. This isn't a hard boiled action game like Max Payne, however you will run across demons during your travels that can be exercised. It is short yes, but for what it is I think it was probably the right length.   I didn't experience any major bugs or issues, and it is possible to 100% it on the one play through.A heads up though, the interactive map has some major mistakes in item locations, other users however have kindly corrected these with their own markers. So if you choose to use the map check out the Global Flags. So to wrap it up, if you are after ghost stories, dark settings and something a little different, check this one out.			"

												I will agree with some of the reviews, that this is more like a movie, than a game. And this game gets negative reviews because people are expecting a game, not a movie. But if it was soemthing like ""Wolf Among Us"" (""The Walking Dead"" is a bit off, sicne it's not a detective story), noone would have complained, I think. And if there were more choices, that influence the game, if collectibles did not only tell you some background, but also influenced the ending somehow, if saving ghosts influenced the story... There are a lot of ifs, that could have been covered if this was an episodic game and if it did not feel like pieces were cut off of it. And if it actually had a map IN the game, not on a web-page.But if you forget about all these, it's not a bad story. Yes, if the background told by the collectibles were more integrated in the main story, characters could become more... Real. Less flat. But overall, I actually enjoyed it. It has good dynamic: not too fast (since it's not an action game), but not too slow (as some detective quests can be), it has motivation, it has mistery.I think I'll give it 7/10. Maybe 7.5/10, since it kinda reminded me of Dreamfall (although Dreamfall had more gameplay). I wonder if Airtight Games can make something in similar fasion, while covering some negative points. Or they can simply try an approach closer to Telltale Games, I guess.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is more of a point-and-click adventure game but with actual WASD movements. There isn't really any combat besides exorcising demons rarely from time to time (there aren't many throughout the game). You mostly look around spam clicking for clues and progressing through the story. A mentally challenged 2 year old monkey can beat this game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. If you want to just turn your brain off and enjoy an interesting story then this will be great! Think of it as an interactive movie.This game is rather short and linear even the ""hidden"" collectibles aren't very well hidden and tend to be right next to each other. But if you enjoy a good story and interesting characters it's a good game to play through once.			"

												Is this a perfect game? No, not by a long shot, but then again, are there any perfect games which aspire to the complexity of narrative and gameplay as Murdered: Soul Suspect? As a narrative exercise, Murdered is very enjoyable. The stories of the various ghosts you encounter are always interesting and sometimes quite haunting. Ronan, the dead detective whom you play, may seem one dimensional at the beginning, but he is 'fleshed out', so to speak as you play, to at least TWO dimensions. But to mitigate this issue are some really interesting characters and stories, i.e. the aforementioned ghosts you meet. Some are quite affecting.The game is, for the most part, solidly built and I experienced no bugs or glitches while playing the game. Glimpses of Airtight Game's puzzle pedigry show through in several sections, though there is never an explicit focus on that kind of gameplay. Yet nor is there a focus on action. This a much more quiet and reflective gameplay experience, which I wonder is not an explanation of the game's poor reviews thus far. Certainly, it is not a blockbuster, but it feels more like an independent, more closely focused affair which I think many will enjoy if they are open to it.In many ways, I kept thinking about similar games I played in the 90s. Perhaps it was the interface itself or the mood or the package as a whole. The game is a throwback, so yes it does have obvious shortcomings. The living world which it hints at is very quickly revealed to be smoke and mirrors, but as already explained, I was fine with that. I liked the characters and the ideas and the game played smoothly. I do not regret slapping down the cash for this one.			"

												The gameplay is repetitive -- just walk around and find some stuff and sometimes kill some demons. The game itself is buggy. I was able to play the same cinematics twice. Also, the war room mission title keeps popping up on the right hand side when I start the game and then says that it's completed no matter at which point of the game I'm at. The story is not so original. The twists aren't that shocking and you can see it a mile away. The way they try to close all the loose ends just seemed so convenient. I didn't thoroughly enjoy the game and I wouldn't recommend it to friends, but if you're looking for something to pass the time with, this may be worth the while.			"

												I tend to give a game a lot of points if the idea of it is good and it looks good. This totally does, it's a cool film noir thing that's written like a paranormal TV show, in a good way. The 'detective' puzzles can be a little...wonky sometimes, abd a lot of them come down to trial and error. But even then it only takes a few minutes to really sort out which clue you need. The ""combat"" is kind of a sore spot, it's basically a stealth/reaction puzzle thing where you have to sneak up behind a demon, hold R, then press the WASD+mouse1/2 combination it shows you. Luckily the demons are pretty sparse. The focus is really on the atmosphere and the writing, which is actually super good.			"

												As many of you know this game has issues, issues square enix aren't in a hurry to fix.. mainly related to the game not launching on many PC's. Luckily there are people out there who have fixed this.. and the link at the bottom is a youtube video that also links in its description to the files needed to sort it all out. :)Onto the review... This game was very enjoyable from start to finish. The story is great and the whole idea of playing a dead character solving his own murder is one I haven't seen done before and it was excuted perfectly in this game so welldone to the developers for that as in the wrong hands an idea like this just wouldn't have worked as well I feel.The games graphics and look were great. I ran it maxed out at 1080p on my Radeon 6870 with a quad core Athlon II cpu and 8gb of memory. I didn't experience any framerate issues that others have mentioned in the forums.. tho there was one part of the story that seemed to repeat itself at one point and I'm pretty sure that wasn't meant to happen as it made no sense, but the story continued fine after that little hiccup, not a major issue.Controls on the 360 controller were great, very easy to get into and layed out well. I never tried the keyboard/mouse for this game as I felt no need to, so can't comment on some comments form others about it not suiting keyboard/mouse.. considering the price of even a 3rd party wired 360 controller these days its not a problem worth moaning about and as i said, the 360 controller is fully supported and ideal for this game.The game is quite short compared to most large companies titles these days and can be completed in between probably 7 and 10 hours depending on whether to stick to the main story or want to collect everything and complete the side stories. I clocked a bit more than that as I was playing the game on a day I was ill to pass the time lol, so game was paused for periods of time while i was .. well... attending to being ill lol.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games with a good story to unfold.. also its a bit different to the norm thats released these days. I hope Square-Enix and Airtight Games work together again on a similar title as I'd definitely buy it.. and hopefully they will learn from their game launching mistakes with this one.As stated the game launch problems are easily fixed using the files the guy links to on youtube for anyone that needs them.. (link below, view on youtube to see description and files link)I'll give the game 8/10 despite the shorter than usual gameplay and the fact I had to fix its launching problem. The score reflects the game itself and it was great.

												Now the game isn't inherently bad for what it is.  I just don't think it's my genre game.  Some people like the seek and find Where's Waldo games.  But at least those allow you to plot your own course to a degree.  I'm good with games keeping you on a track provided it doesn't feel like you're chilling out in a train car being taken for a ride.  They call those movies.And that is what this game is, a interactive movie.  Good dialogue, decent graphics, but the cat thing took me a few minutes to figure out.However you're not likely to get that frustrated.  That's how linear it is.			"

That being said, this is realllllly story heavy, if you are looking for action, the most you get is stealth section in which you can hide and excorise demons by sneaking up on them. The side stories are as good as the main story, I actually stopped doing the main story to find collectibles and solve some of the side cases. If you want a nice story, great atmoshpere, this is a game I highly reccomend. If you are looking for something that is not story heavy, and just want mindless entertainment, stay clear cause you may not enjoy it.			"

												Oh man, this game. Right from it's release, I somehow knew this game would really capture my interest. I picked it up at the Humble Store when they were doing a Square Enix Sale for $15. I do not regret paying that much, as this game really caught my attention.As far as gameplay goes, L.A. Noire players will find that it's a lot alike in terms of clues you must find and mysters that have to be solved. Of course, if you fail to connect the clues to the pending question of ""who dun it"", the game is more forgiving in that regard, as you get as many tries as it takes. Get it on your first try, however, and you get a better rank for that mission.There is ""combat"" in this game, but this is the one and only thing about this game that really was shallow. The ""demons"" that all of the ghosts within the plot are afraid of are nothing more than easy prey for the protagonist. What was supposed to be a game of cat and mouse where the demons were the cats, actually felt very flopsided, as every demon encounter I had within Murdered: Soul Suspect felt like mice, and I more than likely felt like the cat in multiple situations. I really felt like the purpose of having demons within the game was really undermined, thus, it fell very flat on it's face.The overall plot to this game is where it really shines. Within each level, it's a consistent game of ""who dun it"" as I mentioned earlier. Each solved case supposedly brings you one step closer to unmasking a pertty good villain: The Bell Killer, keyword ""supposedly"". I found that whom I thought it was all this time turned out to be completely and utterly wrong, and the game laughed in my face for having me think it'd be whom the clues all pointed to.As an added bonus, within each level you can find these artifacts that, when you collect them all, tell a ghost story about the specific surrounding that you find yourself in. Because of this, I will happily be replaying Murdered: Soul Suspect so I can listen and bask in the ghostly horror of these stories.Overall, this game was great, although a bit short. At it's current price tag of $50, one might be a tad disappointed. Wait for a sale, however, and you'll truly enjoy the ghostly world that is Murdered: Soul Suspect.			"

												Extremely short (8.2 hours, with 140/242 items found), with a barely interesting story where the twists can almost be seen from a mile away. Basically, possibly the most expensive hidden-object game.Was expecting LA Noire. Got a hidden object game where matching the correct objects lead to a cutscene, leading to a sense of not having agency. It's competently executed, but that's the most I can say about it.5/10			"

Posted: April 1
												So, by this time I'm done with the game. Having done most but not all side missions. Worth mentioning that I got it via the Square Enix's mystery box for March which was 10$. For those looking for the punch-line of the review on if it's worth your money or not (29,99$), here it is guys and gals: If you like point and click adventure games, sure, go ahead, it's one of the better of it's kind, you don't see tripple A point and clicks that often. If not, I'd wait for a really good sale. Also keep in mind that the replayability value is low, if any.Now, into the depths: *The Plot* : You're a badass detective under the department of the Salem area, an active serial killer is around and you just happen to pick to have your badass moment going-in without back up moment in the wrong place and in the wrong time, getting killed. Surprise, you're now Casper and you get to be a detective in the afterlife trying to solve your own murder while trying not to get killed (again) by demons in the ghost town. The concept in itself is marvelous- who wouldn't want to be a ghost detective? But the execution.. Don't get me wrong, it had it's moments and a few great twists, but for the most time the story felt predictable, the characters felt very shallow and generic and they certainly  did not make me to want to know more about them. I really wanted to buy into the world, but I just could not feel it. Overall, the world building felt weak, if not rushed. It's like reading one of those books that you thought they were okay, but you just wished there was more to them because their description made you expect more. In short : -Average*The Gameplay*: As I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is point and click for 90% of the time. Those interested in L.A Noire/Sherlock games are out of luck, no observation needed what so ever, your only penalties are that you lose 'ranks' each time you make a mistake, that's pretty much it. Outside that, you go from area to area, you point and click at clues, you get clues, you point and click clues into a sequence and tadam, you're the Sherlock Holmes of the Underworld. Is it repetetive? Very. Is it a criticism? Not in this genre. Outside the point and clicking, you'll get to jog around the world for quite a bit from place to place with occasional simplistic puzzles that for the most part -you guessed it, require you to click on something and see magic happen. I gotta point out that the navigation after some point gets tiring and as a result of the world not feeling very lively, the game would have benefitted greatly from a fast travel option at some point. The devs put some interesting 'invisible' walls around the game so that as a ghost, you cant go through everything, you gotta go through the simplistic puzzles, of course and on top of that, those invisible walls and obstacles which make the world look 'cooler', also make it harder and pointlessly longer to traverse. The side missions around the world although they sometimes have an interesting backstory, are not very engaging for the most part. At some point, the invisible walls get very frustrating, especially once you get your teleport power as they get nonsensical. The weakest part of the gameplay is the combat. It's tedious and clunky. I wish I could demonstrate. There are demons, chasing you around, you have no weapons to fight so you have to hide and execute them from the back. The number of times I was spamming the execution button till it responded  but I left it (you gotta hold it) and failed the quick time event (YES, QTES BOIZ) which most likely resulted to my death or running around for 2 minutes as a result is immense. Not only that but the execution animations remain the same every time and its the same, over, and over, and over.. If you're adding combat, even stealthy combat into your game, you gotta be more creative. A huge spike of irritation comes in the last sequence of the game which becomes unforgivingly hard and 'timed'. I got so frustrated at that point that I finished it on another day. But that's literally the last 5 minutes. Overall, the gameplay, aside from the point and clicking is very average, with the combat being a gigantic unpleasant pain for the player.*Graphics* : Unimpressive. Although the main character model looks good, the world itself looks mostly uninspired and bland. The textures are pretty outdated and the effects were generic mostly. The character models outside the main character are mediocore. Your enemies are always the same kind, looking exactly the same like someone performed a kage bushin no jutsu (Yep, a Naruto reference). This unfortunately is the same also for the peope around you such as cops and even some ghosts are just so, so uninspired. Overall: Average (probably) for it's time, below average for what it is now.*Sound, Music, Voice Acting* : The sound of the game is actually good, I found myself enjoying each cutscene after an investigation was over as a result of the robust sound they provided. Its not ground breaking, but it felt more effortful. The music is very repetetive, its definitely not getting any 'extended' remixe's anytime soon, if ever. The voice was okay, the lip syncing was fine but if you were expecting L.A Noire, well, that's not the one.Is it worth your buy? For 29.99 I'd probably only recommend it to die hard point and click fans that wished for big publishrs to release point and click titles. For the rest, just wait for a good sale. The only thing the game has going for it is it's story which is not as interesting as the cover makes it to be. It's a missed opportunity for a game that would have great potential if you added better combat, a more fleshed out world and made people care for the characters.			"

												The game is actually pretty good. Short, but good. The story is absolutely fantastic - well written, well presented. There are a couple of problems I encountered - keyboard controls felt awkward, so I had to switch to xbox controller, the whole ""investigation"" thing is pretty linear. But what saved this game for me was the sheer amount of LORE and background for everything happening and what happened. Hell, even the town and some of it's past events are real. But also not only you can ""read"" newspaper articles or you dead wife's diaries - you can also poke around the city to find some ghostly remains of city's past, reveal some well-narrated backstories and so on.It is pretty linear in it's investigations, but outside them you have your town which is kind of open-worldish, but not really. Nice little touch is the ability to read people's minds - and even though they sometimes repeat - the amount of ""thoughts"" is pretty big and also reveals some lore.The ""ghost"" mechanic is great and executed well - the only bad thing I can name is that in tight spaces (there are not a lot of them, but still) you can easily lose your sense of space because of your ""ghost noclip"" ability. Oh, and demons are kind of annoying, but not too much, and they are pretty rare.The real bad thing is that this game is pretty short. If you ignore all nice details you can possibly complete it in 6 or 5 hours. With all the poking around it will take around 9-10, but not more. Though the story is good, really good. The whole story made me not regret buying it.8/10			"

												While I have said I wouldn't recomend it I do have some positive points as well as negative ones.I will admit the concept is quite a fun one, a dead cop investigating his own death however I feel this game suffers from Remember Me syndrome. A good, interesting concept with bags of potential that has a half arsed delivery. It also feels like a dumbed down L.A Noire, that maybe a bit harsh actualy but anyway it still holds your hand through the investigations that are implemented a lot like L.A Noire. The twist is ok and frankly I was quite a head of the investigation before that point anyway and the rest of the game was basicaly confirming my theories. The controls are also very odd. Exorcising demons, which I swear is never explained how the main character and only him can do it however I may have just missed that or didn't pay attention, involves holding the R then pressing either W,A,S,D and the left mouse button. Now I'm sorry but this is just too much, a 3 button QTE is just too much, it's a QTE not a think for a bit to make sure I have the right button because if you don't your going to have to run fast. These demons are quick and kill quick too, they also freak me out a lot but that might be just me. The mouse is also super sensitive and it took me a while to get used to it even on the lowest setting. The cat controls are ridiculous too and seems to be slightly less broken than Radscorpions, which is saying a lot as they are the most glitchy animals in a game, ever. Oh and the game is too short, and the escort parts are silly as the people your escorting won't move till a distraction happens to lead the person away....who is standing still at the time, not actively searching...so those being escorted are never in any real danger, so it's a tad pointless. On the whole, good concept, average delivery and worth £10 on sale, definatly not full price though.Check out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Fridayhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg "

												I REALLY wanted to like this.  The premise was unique (you're a detective and you need to find out who murdered you).  But this was just not enjoyable.The game is short.  By itself, this isn't a big deal, you don't need to put 40+ hours into a game to get your money's worth.  My playtime was 9 hours.  But I'm guessing 4 of those were spent fighting with the game's poor systems:1) No Map.  Seriously?  What is this 2004?  In a 3rd person exploration game this is unheard of & seems like it was omitted to add unnecessary time & difficulty.  Wandering about town, there is a series of intermediate waypoints that lead you to the next target, but those get broken & send you through areas that aren't available, so unless you're a navigational expert, you're stuck randomly wandering until you luck into the next target.2) Combat.  It's basically added as an afterthought to add time in between the ""investigations"" (which are generally well done, once you figure out the game's systems).  There's one monster type & it's pattern is easily identifiable.  But the controls are difficult & even if you do everything right you still might get caught & have to redo the area.  The game is using poor controls & frustration to again add extra difficulty & time, instead of giving the enemies useful AI.The graphics are fine, but suffer from overusing a ""dark & hazy"" theme.  Considering the story takes place entirely at night, this is probably expected.I was engaged enough with the setting & story enough to want to finish it, but definitely won't be replaying to get a 100% finish.

												Criminal turned detective stumbles upon a killer and end up dead. Insted of going into the light, he becomes a ghost, resolved to reveal who murdered him. It's an adventure game, most similar to LA Noire. You go around, detect and inspect clues, listen onto the conversations, talk to other ghosts, walk through the walls, think, make hypothesis, solve mysteries, and reveal the story step by step. There's no much action, but there are stealth sequences, where you have to detect demons, and destroy them before they find you. A lot of optional content (side quests, world information, character info and all that) to be found. Nice graphics and sound, a bit weird controls but one can easily get used to them. I like it.			"

They tried to make this linear game as intereactive as possible with useless button presses to do the most common things, in a 1 on 1 conversation in a cutscene they want you to press E to continue the conversation. Also did I mention it's extremely boring? The graphics are nothing special. The intro to the game is a unskippable 5 minute cutscene.			"

												To start off there is only 4 hours of gameplay here and no replay value. It is basically an interactive movie. It is a murder mystery. For me this game/movie was kind of boring... Not very fun for a video game. I feel sorry for those who paid full price. I guess I got my $12 worth out of this game since it's cheaper than going to the movies to kill 4 hours. This is a Crime, Drama, Murder, Mystery. I'd say I've been bored for 4 hours since I just wanted to finish the story. It wasn't worth it for myself. There was no challenge at all... Just go here investigate this and that help this person do this get here blah blah blah.... Just boring.Killing demons isn't even satisfying and it's also a very small part of the game to add a challenge... It's not challenging at all. Just get behind the demon hold R then you will have to hit W, A, S, or D with left or right click, it's completely random which is cool but i'd rather actually battle the demon with something more interactive. But yeah do that and the demon is dead YAYYYY!!! Or you can just skip killing demons and go to your next location... doesn't matter.This game is only worth $12 or less. For a single-player only game for $50 when it released and only 4 hours of gameplay if you don't care about finding every stupid hidden piece in the world. I just went where I needed to go and picked up what I could along the way. Most single-player 3rd person / 1st person games have around 8 hours average if not a little longer and also have replay value majority of the time.Bought it, played it, completed it, never playing it again, the end.

Игра катуальна для ачиво♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ов+ Воспоминания. Разные воспоминания ключевых персонажей : Ронана,Бакстера,Рекса и т.д Минусы. Ну их и почти нет. :- Боевка,ну или атака против демонов. Называйте как хотите,но это минус. Быть может кто нибудь даже согласится со мной,что маловероятно.- Весьма короткий сюжет. Не сколько локаций,пара воспоминаний и миллион артефактов. Вот и вся игра. Во всяком случае,я бы вам не рекомендовал покупать данную игру за полную цену. Ну и все на этом. Всем удачи :)			"

The crime solving mechanincs were good but a little glichy, wallking a round as ghots was fun and felt new to me.My problesm with the game is that they played it safe, short and simple. They could have doulble the game if they had added time travel to it. You all ready see stuff from the past but only small stuff but with time travel you could have ,witneses, much better under standing of the wicht trails from exploring the past town and the people from that time. the murderers, (spoilers) You could all so see the past bell murders and victims. The side quest would alse be better with it adding the murder , plan or thougths and reasons for it as well as seen the even unfold.  Possessioning people was very boring and not that  usefull, you had alot of copy and past npcs. Would be better if you could contol them which would make it possible to enter more building increassing the game.The town was very small and cluster together with random hinding spots all over town.Its a good game and stands out from many other games.

												This game starts oddball, but settles in quite quickly. I suppose you could call it an adventure title – it's kind of like a modern cop detective game, without the sort of action you'd assume to be stuck in as a timesink filler padding out a story. It is *much* more like a modern third person shooter without any of the shooting, just the investigative minigames, the scavenger hunt collectibles and the plot. Does this make sense? Designwise it simply does not feel like an adventure game.I do recommend it.Last note on the Steam version – getting it to run on my PC was an absolute, horrific chore. For some reason, the Steam integration .dlls kept the game from starting. It kept crashing right at the start, stating that it can't contact the Steam client. Well, eventually I got it to run by some dark magic steps that I'm not going to publicly enumerate, at the cost of losing most of the benefits Steam bestows.			"

												I picked up Murdered: Soul Suspect because a good friend kept stressing how good it is (in spite of all the negative reviews), and I wasn't at all disappointed with the game. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot more than I ever thought I would! The game relies largely on its characters and the murder mystery that's central to said characters' lives. If you're looking for a fast-paced, highly action-driven game, it doesn't deliver on that front - but that's what made it such a great ride for me as a player.I wasn't sure what to expect of the game from the premise alone, but it does atmospheric horror really well, along with the splashes of detective fiction and noir, too. Investigating, gathering clues, questioning witnesses, and making deducions are all important to the game. It even has an historical angle that I first thought would be somewhat canned, but actually surprised me a bit by the end.Collecting is an important part of the game and, although it's ""optional,"" a lot of the story content depends on how well you can scour a map for all of the items - some hidden and some not. Even with ~10 hours play time into my first ""completed"" game, I still didn't track everything down! So if you're a completionist who enjoys searching and interacting with maps, M:SS definitely appeals on that front.The other main challenge of the game is demon encounters, and they can be tricky to master at first, since some of the combinations are a little awkward. Still, by the last few maps it seems easier (as the difficulty doesn't really go up much during the course of the game) ... but it's definitely anxiety-inducing sometimes! All in all, the demon encounters kept the game from feeling extremely linear (i.e., like a visual novel).So if you're into mysteries and crime fiction, love spooky stuff, and enjoy a game that burns a little slowly, definitely give it a try.

												After hearing bad reviews about this game, I was a bit hesitant to even buy it. But the more I read into the reviews, the more I realized that this game was just never given a fair chance from the start. A lot of people came off as jaded as to what they wanted and expected with ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"". In truth, I feel as though they were wrong.""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" is what you expect out of a good ghost story, or even a Noir movie. You have many different characters that fit the roles they were supposed to play. The story keeps you guessing until the very end, and manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. While it is not like a sandbox game like many had hoped and desired, you still have plenty of places to explore and little nooks and crannies to find within the game's structure.This game is not for a player who wants a sandbox world, who wants to shoot up bad guys, or that has to really put some effort to unlock, discover, and solve the many puzzles within the game. This is the kind of game that is for those who enjoy the journey it takes you on. For those who loved games like ""Gabriel Knight"" or ""7th Guest"". Good horror stories that make you want to discover everything that happened and why.While the replay value may not be as good as some other games, it is the sort of game you will play, try to find all the artifacts in the first run through, and then put away when you are finished. You will then pick it back up after awhile, and play it once more for the amazing story it tells.			"

												This game is very similar to LA Noire but instead you are a ghost detective in the present day instead of an LAPD detective in the 40s. The gameplay mainly consists of walking around and examining objects in the environment to help solve cases. If that bores you, don't get this game because there is not even much of a combat system aside from sneak attacking demons once in a while. It is kind of open world in the sense that you are free to walk around town and collect objects to solve side cases, but the lack of any sort of map or minimap makes exploration a hassle. With all that being said, I enjoyed the story and atmosphere of the game, which is surprisingly a bit lighthearted for a game about ghosts. It took me about 7 hours to complete the game and I also took my time to grab most of the collectibles as well.Verdict: Definitely get this on a sale, it is short but sweet. 6/10			"

The story is pretty good, although far too short. Voice acting is top-notch, although the game does suffer from 'Welcome to Corneria' syndrome at times.If you hate collectables, this is not the game for you, but unlike many other games, you actually get nice rewards for finding stuff here. The side stories are quite interesting.All in all, this game is clearly low-budget and unpolished, but there are still many endearing and fun features.

												Murdered is a game with an interesting idea and showed a lot of promise before it was released; a game where you play a deceased detective hunting down his murderer whilst solving crimes and using ghost powers, what's not to love? Well the problem is that the game is ultimately short and, frankly, boring - there is nothing to do outside of the main quest aside from FOUR side-quests and a bunch of collectables no one really cares about; the use of ghost walls, while a good concept, are only present to hide how small the environment is; and the biggest problem? This game is far too easy. It has a points system depending on how well you solve the crimes, but this doesn't actually have any impact whatsoever, and there is no penalty for making a wrong judgement, sure you lose a point but even after you lose them all you can keep on guessing. Oh and this game can be painfully short, if you're good at it you can complete in under 4 hours (or if you want to speedrun and miss the cutscenes - the story is the best part of the game, mind you - you can complete it in about 2). So yes, Murdered is an OK game, but it's one that will be played once and probably be forgotten about soon after playing it. However I do recommend playing it, but get when its on sale.			"

												Worst game I played all year so far.The game plays as a point and click detective game where you can guess clues to continue on.At first I was all into the game, but you soon realize it is the same thing everywhere you go. The side missions was more interesting than the real story and so many clone NPC's, if you really look at some of their walk cycles you think that you were not the only ghost in the game. I know I watched a woman walked through a building with me before and I was like is this multiplayer lol.The game twist ending at the end is very lame and I was into collecting the stuff in the game and when you get close to the end you just wish the game would end please.Ok if you want a fisher price detective game, but if you want play a Noir like game, just play LA Noir or something else.

												Terrible game. Predicted the final solution within the first five minutes of the game and spent the next four hours screaming in frustration at the stupidity of the main character. Feel like this game smacks you round the face with every answer, leaving no detective work to do and no mystery to think of. You can typically think up answers with one clue, but have to find a dozen arbitrary things - mostly irrelevant - before you can progress.Slow, no replay value, and definitely not worth the money.

												To be honest I expected better with this game. Better story, better mechanics, better gameplay, better graphics.  The story is probably the best part. It wasn't too obvious and had a lot twists and turns to it. That being said it does have some glaring flaws.  Some of the gameplay is fun for a while but the problem I found is that you begin with almost all the powers you will have at the end. This leaves no room for a feeling of character progression and development. It has some buggy mechanics such as having to stand at the exact right spot to interact with certain things. The graphics seem very last gen. I also HATE the stupid demon killing thing. It's very repetitive and an all round pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to have to take them out. Negatives aside, I wouldn't say the game was terrible. If you enjoy story based games, in particular, ghost/horror/noir based games. You may enjoy those aspects enough to warrant you buying it. I would say, buy it if it's on sale.			"

												While there are some things that I liked about this game and are really interesting, almost none of those take place in the gameplay.  Gathering clues and evidence is neat.  The game's mechanic for putting those clues and evidence together for a solution is terrible.  When it's not the most obvious puzzle ever, it's a complete guess and luck.  The action sequences are not terrible.  They simply aren't fun.  Wait till the enemy turns his back and then walk up and do the QTE.Gameplay aside though, the environment and story are interesting and the conclusion, though a bit hokey, is pretty good too.			"

												This game is a nice break from the extreme combat oriented Triple A titles. A game where your sole purpose is to find your killer and move on to the next life, the game doesn't requre the necessity to fight every single person you see. Instead, you get a story-driven, investigative (and sometimes stealthy) gameplay. The narrative behind this game is spectacular. You'll just have to see for yourself. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone, no matter how old you are or what kind of games you like. PLAY THIS GAME.			"

 So, Hear Me Out, I'm Going to Do Something A Bit Different Here I bought this game for next to nothing on Humble Bundle a while ago and played it awhile ago. Now I'm giving this a positive rating because I enjoyed it for what it was for how cheap I got it at. That said, I am going to give you a dual opinion here. You will hear the side of me who got it cheap and you will hear a side of me who bought as if it were 60 dollars. So, to be fair, I will ♥♥♥♥♥ for both sides. Let's begin.Legend1 - 60 dollar opinion2 - 2 dollar opinion (around the price I bought it for)(1)ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME!!!! 60 dollars for less than a 5 hour experience? I forgot this was an interactive movie. This David Cage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off where game developers think a good short story is enough to justify a 60 dollar purchase for a ""Video Game"" as in you play the ♥♥♥♥ing game. Sure, the story is decent but the game play is♥♥♥♥♥♥ No wonder so many people were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about this interactive story, it lacks meat, it has almost no game in it. Now you have to follow some teen girl around because shes the only one that will put up with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or rather is the only one who can since no one else can hear you since shes psychic that has to listen to whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like your character who can't handle being dead so he has to find out which ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killed him. Of course, I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥since the main character is easily forgetable, hell there's interesting side characters I remember more than him that are in this game.(2)The game will start off with your character, Ronan, literally dying in the first 2 minutes after starting. The game had a good story and even though lack of game play was present here, at least for the price I got a worthwhile experience and an interesting concept of a story. While the game play does lack, it does have pretty entertaining parts to it at times. These times being the investigation parts where you, as the ghost, investigate crime scenes finding things that humans can't quite find. The game makes you pick 3 evidence that you found to match up a story but there's really no penalty here, the game will just move along and that's that.(1)Speaking of the ""game play"" there is ""stealth"" sections but they aren't stealth, its just waiting for someone to turn the ♥♥♥♥ around or setting off a printer so that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can check it for eternity while you guide a teenage psychic around. You can also possess this teen or other humans so you can pass certain sections you can't get through by yourself. Yeah, this is the first Triple A game where it encourages you to go inside a teenage girl, ♥♥♥♥ing perverts. You also can possess animals as well, so now for 60 dollars I can go inside a teenage girl and a cat, was this concept straight out of Jared Fogle's computer history? You also can read their mind and hear what they're thinking if you're a nosy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game also presents you with a linear open world where you can't travel through certain walls, cause ♥♥♥♥ it, right? They came up with some sort of an excuse but I forget what it was.(2)The game play, or what is there rather, consists of stealth sections, while linear, are more like puzzles you have to solve. You guide the teenage psychic through a dangerous area, like, a Police Station or a Mental Hospital. You just distract somebody one certain way and you move her on. Sometimes they might switch it up but essentially its the same kind of pattern. There's also collectables...(1) Who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the stupid collectables.(2) ....That I can agree with. So, they're not hard to find but with a game with little content in it, I doubt it'll reward you in anyway besides giving you behind the scenes videos to watch. The open world is hard to traverse at times since its got a lot of invisible and visible walls up to block you way. It can be a boring and confusing process but for being a slow game in the first place, it won't affect the flow too much unless you are on your way to a dangerous event taking place. You also have to use these ghostly hiding places where you can hide from demons when they are hunting you down. You can go about two ways of taking care of demons in most situations, one: You ambush all of them and send them back to hell or you take out who you have to and move on leaving the others alone.(1) The voice acting is meh, but I'm not here to listen to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing game. Why is that for 60 dollars that out of my 3-5 hours I have to sit here and listen to an hour total of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? This game is like the Order 1886 before the the Order 1886. Sure, the atmosphere is creepy and the demons you have to hide from are scary, however, the story is decent, like I said. But there's still no game here. I don't get why this game got a 9/10 for 4 hours of story and almost no gameplay. The game play itself isn't even innovative, why is no one else♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about this?(2)I thought the voice acting was pretty good and the scenes were shot well, although not perfectly. I did enjoy the story and the characters moving around were realistic looking, like they're actually just human beings, they have casual movement and the lip syncing isn't even that bad. Overall, it makes it more believable of a story.(1)Overall, for 60 dollars, its an over glorified movie and its game play is almost non-existent. Its a sad attempt at a game but a good attempt at an interactive movie. Of course, it should be this expensive, you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s over at Square Enix need to stop ruining the game industry damn it. You ♥♥♥♥ing ruined Deus Ex Mankind Divided cause of your ♥♥♥♥ing greed you mother..(2)Unless you can get it for the price I got it at, which is dirt cheap, yeah, just look it up on YouTube or something if you don't wanna buy into it since its just a movie and not much more than that.

												A little bit too linear to be a proper detective game, Murdered: Soul Suspect still has some very interesting mechanics and even manages to be a bit spooky at times. Gameplay is not its strength, the puzzles are simple and/or make little sense but if you like crime stories, you will easily get to the ending of this, admitedly, very short game.Enjoyable, glad I played it but probably won't be thinking about it in a year's time.

With just the right amount of skill for anyone to keep the story moving along.Great voice overs and dialogue that had me smiling and laughing at times.If you like to find hidden objects there are 247 total artifacts to find if that's something you'd be interested in .Having missed 3 artifacts I proceeded to the final chapter and couldn't go back. So unfortunately I will have to do a second play through to get the game to 100% . Game does allow you to skip dialogue.So as I play the game over I can fast track many scenes and also leave the artifacts I don't need alone saving time.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of the best detective/interactive fiction games I ever played. The story is quite compelling and dark, since you play a cop who was murdered and has to find out about his killer. Taking place in the legendary small town of Salem, which you can freely traverse, you head from one crime scene to the next. There you have to solve single cases, all of which are interconnected and eventually will lead to reveal the big picture of the main mystery. You will find clues to other side cases everywhere and can interact with a lot of people, dead and alive. The presentation, utilizing the Unreal 3 engine, is very adequate to the story, creating very dark and gritty ambience. Everything is nicely modeled and really good animated and also the sound design is excellent and facilitates the gloomy atmosphere.The only critique that I have is that there is little to no replay value. Once the cases are solved, you will hardly touch this game again.All in all I had a great time playing this game and I do recommend you give it a try. My verdict: 9/10 points -  great game			"

Sometimes they might switch it up but essentially its the same kind of pattern. There's also collectables...(1) Who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the stupid collectables.(2) ....That I can agree with. So, they're not hard to find but with a game with little content in it, I doubt it'll reward you in anyway besides giving you behind the scenes videos to watch. The open world is hard to traverse at times since its got a lot of invisible and visible walls up to block you way. It can be a boring and confusing process but for being a slow game in the first place, it won't affect the flow too much unless you are on your way to a dangerous event taking place. You also have to use these ghostly hiding places where you can hide from demons when they are hunting you down. You can go about two ways of taking care of demons in most situations, one: You ambush all of them and send them back to hell or you take out who you have to and move on leaving the others alone.(1) The voice acting is meh, but I'm not here to listen to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing game. Why is that for 60 dollars that out of my 3-5 hours I have to sit here and listen to an hour total of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? This game is like the Order 1886 before the the Order 1886. Sure, the atmosphere is creepy and the demons you have to hide from are scary, however, the story is decent, like I said. But there's still no game here. I don't get why this game got a 9/10 for 4 hours of story and almost no gameplay. The game play itself isn't even innovative, why is no one else♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about this?(2)I thought the voice acting was pretty good and the scenes were shot well, although not perfectly. I did enjoy the story and the characters moving around were realistic looking, like they're actually just human beings, they have casual movement and the lip syncing isn't even that bad. Overall, it makes it more believable of a story.(1)Overall, for 60 dollars, its an over glorified movie and its game play is almost non-existent. Its a sad attempt at a game but a good attempt at an interactive movie. Of course, it should be this expensive, you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s over at Square Enix need to stop ruining the game industry damn it. You ♥♥♥♥ing ruined Deus Ex Mankind Divided cause of your ♥♥♥♥ing greed you mother..(2)Unless you can get it for the price I got it at, which is dirt cheap, yeah, just look it up on YouTube or something if you don't wanna buy into it since its just a movie and not much more than that.

												A little bit too linear to be a proper detective game, Murdered: Soul Suspect still has some very interesting mechanics and even manages to be a bit spooky at times. Gameplay is not its strength, the puzzles are simple and/or make little sense but if you like crime stories, you will easily get to the ending of this, admitedly, very short game.Enjoyable, glad I played it but probably won't be thinking about it in a year's time.

												this game is an absolute disappointmentbut before i start raging i must pause and give a thumbs-up to the interesting plot that this game has. and that's about it what can anyone enjoy the game. maybe some shallow gamers could also enjoy it for the graphics but don't get me even started on those.anyways, there is absolutely no gameplay. the whole ""game"" consits of boring pixel hunting, after which you are asked absolutely dumb ""detective"" questions, which often don't even make sense and would make even CSI-miami look like a decent detective movie (which it is not). basically, it has absolutely nothing to do with playing a detective.the hours of boredom spent by pixel hunting for ""clues"" and collectible artifacts are accompanied by an absolutely ridiculously primitive ""stealth action"", which consists of walking behind a wall with ghost infravision or whatever and just killing these demons with a press of a button. and the game does not even punish you for getting noticed because you just run away, hide and return later, and try to press the ""KILL GHOST BUTTON"" again. and if you are incompentend enough and manage to get killed somehow, i don't know, maybe a dog jumped in your face or something, then you respawn 1 milliseond and 1 millimeter before the enemy encounter, because the checkpoints and saves are almost literally made after your character makes a step. (honestly, i have not gotten killed a single time during the game, except for once when i wondered what would actually happen if i got killed on purpose)honestly, just reading these few paragraps written with my terrible english will probably be a time spent better than trying to enjoy the gameplay of this excuse of a modern ""press x to win"" game. but as i said earlier, the story is cool and the little ghost tales told for collecting items during the abrasive pixel hunting are interesting as well. i would much rather watch a 1 hour long B-movie made from this story than die in agony wandering through the streets of the boredom town to get to the story.this was a terrible experience, and screw the money but i want the time back. the time. give me back my time.PS. before you dismiss the review because i have 0.1 hours of the game played on the record, i played it with steam in the offline mode and it just didn't register my playtime			"

												Even though I am recommending this game, it is only a recommendation *IF* you can get it very cheaply (and I am sure you will be able to)You play the ghost of a cop who was killed and you have to solve your own murder. Good premise, and a pretty good story too, the problem is the gameplay. You are lead by the hand through the whole game, go from point A to point B and when you get there find a few things. It doesn't matter if you get anything wrong, there are NO penalties, just try again.The game is also VERY short, so to try and pad things out, the programmers have added a couple of ""collect random objects"" quests to make things last a little longer. You don't have to collect them and they add nothing to the story if you do (or don't) There are a couple of smaller ""mysteries"" to solve along the way, which are fun, but overall this game is just bland.

												Save your money. I was pretty excited to play this game, but after completing the main story-line in under 9 hours I am severely disapointed. Difficulty: This game is incredibly easy. It's basically point-and-click. You can't make any mistakes, really. You walk between locations and look for clues, which are very obviously highlighted for you.  I thought I'd have to be solving puzzles, piecing together clues, but everything is spoon-fed to you. The main character must be the worst detective in history, because I was figuring things out way before he was. There's no real threat or doom in this game. I mean, you're already dead, so you can't exactly die. The only obstacle (if you can call it that) are the soul-sucking demons (Which look like Dementors from Harry Potter) which pop up and must be vanquished (Which is also very easy to do. Just sneak up behind them, click three buttons and POOF! Gone).Story: The story could be interesting if it wasn't painfully dummed down. There are no complex intertwining stories, no in-depth characters. Everyone is exceptionally bland and cliche. *Spoilers ahead* So you play a detective called Ronan in Salem who has just been murdered by the ""Bell Killer"". Ronan is exceptionally slow. It takes most of the game for him to figure out that this ""Bell Killer"" preys on ""witches"". (It's Salem. That was obvious.) He discovers who the murderer is with the help of a ""Medium"" who can see/communicate with the dead.  Graphics:Even the graphics themselves aren't that good. The characters mouths move at random, not really forming any real words. They move their arms and heads around as if they're puppets being pulled by strings. Even the cinematics are poor; clothes have jagged edges, and character's faces have no emotion.Glitches: There are glitches in this game which don't allow you to complete current objectives. Also, it's a checkpoint save game, so if you encounter a glitch you must reload from the last save-point (wherever thay may be). I also had a problem of cinematic scenes repeating themselves if I walked into a location where the objectives had already been completed. World:There is a very small area of game play. No map needed. You are in a tiny town and you are able to enter the museum, the church, the graveyard, the police station and the hospital (but only when the game calls for it). No free-roaming or exploring. Just walk to the next location (the arrows show you the way) and complete the objective. Then it's on to the next location.  Overall: This is a VERY boring, VERY easy game. Utterly dissapointing.  Rating:2/10 "

												I just beat this game and I can safely say that I loved it.(I have tried to avoid spoilers at all costs, but I'd still be wary of them)I have actually been following the development of this game since it's first announcement, and when I saw the bad reviews I was kinda sad that a game like this would do so poorly.Luckily, the reviews didn't put me off enough to not play the game. I did play it and well, it's fantastic. The story is definitely the highlight of this game. Playing through it and see all the events and twists kept me immersed that I nearly forgot about real life. Was a long time ago I had an experience like that.The gameplay, while most reviewers said it was bad, I enjoyed walking around finding things and exploring. I also liked the ""stealth"" element with hiding around enemies. You don't actually fight, and if you get seen they hunt you down until you die. You have to get behind them and execute them through a QTE (which is pretty easy, but I messed it up a bit because I got stressed like crazy when those things were around)The game is open-ended and Salem acts like a sort-of hub for the game. Doesn't mean that it's not shockful of collectables Also, the game has loads of those. Around 200.All-in-all, I loved this game. It's not the perfect game, but the story is just amazing. The game is relatively short, but in my opinion the story makes up for it. I would recommend you to buy it, but if around 8-10 hours doesn't cut if for you, you should wait for a sale.			"

												I'd only recommend this game for its story only - in no way is this game worth the full price and it doesn't live up to what a game should be (some good gameplay elements but not used very well).This game is more fitting for a movie than a game since the whole ""clue"" thing is very much compulsory to proceed in the story line. The investigation aspect is forced on to you on each level and spoon feeds you on what you need to do, meaning that the harder-to-find clues aren't even necessary and have no impact in the game, making it a linear story. Side quests are almost non-existent despite it showing some potential with some of the ghosts you talk to - most of which, there is nothing to persuade them to move on from the living world. It has much potential but it dies down and you realize that everything you thought was cool, becomes repetitive and or unnecessary. Gameplay/Story aside, there are annoying technical issues with this game - only one save file is allowed and the autosave is terribly planned. If you're unlucky, like me, you'd have spent some time and lose all your progress with side quests (did two side quests and quit the game, only to find out that the game didn't save). The game's vsync is garbage, your video driver's vsync produces better results.To sum things up, the game aspects of this game are great but not used well to keep you entertained for long. The only things that could keep you entertained would be the story and that depends per user's preference. The autosave feature sucks, it only saves during main quest and when you enter/exit places. It doesn't save on the town map at all.[Possible spoiler regarding gameplay]The teleport and remove abilities are barely used in this game, making you wonder ""whats the point of having this?"". In the end, you only use the teleport ability for travel conveniences rather than to get past obstacles like how it was originally introduced to you. Remove ability is pretty much dead in the game, there's no point of having it. I'm quite ok with the monsters but other people may have issues with them. The demons need more variety. There are only 2 types of monsters that get in your way and it's those same 2 from beginning to end. Their availability in the game are very rare and illogical - you don't see them in the open map and only during story related quests. The investigation/clues - some answers are stupid and doesn't fit well in what you are observing, others are so obvious. As mentioned before, the important clues are in your face and you're forced to use them as your evidence. You won't be able to proceed unless you use those set pieces.The AI ... at first, you think it's cool but as you play on and interact with the non-quest related AI, it all becomes repetitive. They all say the same things and they don't react when you use poltergeist... they're there for decoration and nothing more.  "

Posted: December 29, 2014
												I'm going to begin by voicing my displeasure at the fact that steam has only a two means of reviewing a game. The bright blue thumbs up or red thumbs down is the first thing people see and it is criminal that I'm forced to open my opinion with either a blatant recommendation or condemnation, as it is often never that simple. Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of those games that I feel very ambivalent towards. It gets a thumbs down though for reasons I'll gladly expound upon here but I'll start by saying that If you do want to buy this game, go ahead, but do it at a discount as there isn't enough of it to warrant its full price by a long shot. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a supernatural intrigue game where you play as Ronan O'Connor, gangland warrior turned detective and wandering samurai warrior, who is tracking a mysterious serial killer. Ronan is about apprehend the killer in the opening cutscene when the killer decides he's had enough of the law and reenacts the opening scene from Watchmen all over Ronan's face before shooting him seven times in the chest. So Ronan is dead, but you knew that already. Ronan now has to endeavor to do in one night what the entire police force couldn't do in years worth of time and solve the case of the Bell Killer. M:SS reminds me of two very specific games I actually liked, the first of which is Alan Wake. Like Alan Wake, this game is about supernatural dealings with a distinctly traditional American feel. Also like AW, the rules for the supernatural stuff in this game are very well defined.The supernatural lore being dealt with this time is ghosts, exploring all the traditional facets of what you might think ghosts are like, but before you go hog wild there is an exception to each of your abilities. You can pass through walls but not consecrated or ethereal walls, which mark the level boundaries. You can jumble electronics, but not to any meaningful degree. You can possess people but not control their actions. You can teleport, but not over demon holes so you still have to circumvent those on foot. Also like in Alan Wake, there isn't a whole lot to do in between plot points except hunt for collectibles. This leads me into the real issue I had with this game: its design.Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game of extra steps. I kept a running list of things the game took more than one step to complete without needing to: Often the game will end a cutscene just to have you press the interact button to continue the same cutscene. When questioning a suspect, you have to press a button for each option you want to explore but the interrogation doesn't end until all options are explored, so it might as well be one long cutscene. You can read the minds of people you possess but each person has exactly two things to say and you have to press the button twice to hear both things when they could just say them both at once. When piecing together the clues of an investigation, if you pick a wrong option you get booted from the screen, having to reenter the screen to continue. When grabbing collectibles, you have to reveal the object first before picking it up. The collectibles are half hidden but the game tells you where they are so there's no need for hiding them. Speaking of collectibles, there are a plethora of them, all of which have very little to no bearing on the actual game. Each area has a unique object that, once all are gathered, will unlock  a spooky campfire story unrelated to what you are doing. There are a series of over arching collectibles including diary pages from Ronan's dead wife (really the only means of character development), handy info blurbs copy-pasted from the Salem tourism comity website, and newspaper clippings reminding you how creepy and invincible the serial killer is.While Alan Wake also felt the need to boldly announce the appearance of an enemy so that there is no way for you to be caught off guard, at least it had engaging combat. Every once in a while the game breaks up the monotony by presenting you with enemies to sneak up behind and quick-time-event to death. Once or twice a level, there will be demons that half-heatedly wander around in an enclosed area. You have to hide in the hiding spot and wait for the monster to turn around so you can slowly walk up behind it and kill it. This ends up being tedious and non-threatening, unit you mess up. If you manage to not properly dispatch your spectral foe, the backlash is absurd. Demons will kill you within a 3-5 second window unless you can scurry back to a hiding spot. However, once detected, the demons can see you in hiding spots; forcing you to shift between them as fast and erratically as possible until they give up. This turns what little combat there is into a game of Red Light, Green Light. These sections make no sense to the lore of the game either as there is no reason given as to why Ronan seems to be the only ghost that can dispatch the demons. No introduction is given to the power nor is it explained that Ronan is the only one capable of it, leading me to wonder why the other ghosts all flee in terror when the demons show up.The second game I'm reminded of is L.A. Noire, because the investigation sections are reminiscent of the ones in that game. You have to walk around the crime scene and collect the clues, using them to piece together the motive of the criminal. There are six to fourteen clues per scene but only three of them at most are ever necessary to continue. It's no secret that detective work is not as flashy or intriguing as it is portrayed in popular culture, but no where is this more obvious than video games. L.A. Noire had a good mix of action and detective work, due (I think) to it's structure. All the clues were relevant because solving the case was the goal of the mission and everything unfolded naturally. Murdered, by contrast, has you investigating glaringly obvious crime scenes which, more often than not, inform you of something you already knew. For example, one crime scene later on in the game has you investigating a room full of people the Bell Killer murdered all at once. At the point of investigation, however, you have already been made aware of what the killer did afterword, so the reason for killing the room full of people is obvious. Then, once you investigate the room, Ronan stands there and tells the the reason the killer did it, even though you already knew. Really the investigating is just being a master of the obvious. It's also impossible to fail to find all of the clues, because the game tells you how many are present in the scene.Murdered, like many games these days, would have probably made a better book or movie. The game play really just consists of different kinds of walking around and looking at things. Despite being a game made by an established developer and publisher, this is something any indie dev could have made, if not made look quite as good. In the end, games are meant to be interactive; that is what the medium excels at. Yet more and more it seems like games are being made with interactivity at the bottom of their priority list. Once during the middle of a cutscene I caught my self replying to text messages. It was then I realized how bored I was with the game; how absolutely unengaged I felt. The story was really not all that bad but being set in Salem, you can bet with reliability that it will have to do with what Salem is famous for. I would rather them have just made a movie out of it and cut out the game play entirely. At least then it would have taken me only 120 minutes to get through.			"

												WELL! just finished it (12 hours gameplay... really tryed to enjoy it).... WELL...where to start?first: was waiting for this game 2 months... big expectations.... preordered and waitedsecond: limited edition - there was a small journal (i have a phys. game DVD limited ed.) - nice small book, interesting reading.... no spoilers... just some ""background"" info... nicethird: the game.... well... the story is great i think, the end surprised me. Nice twist. I guessed another ending :) The story, i mean the IDEA of this game is great/unique. The afterlife and etc. Many ghost NPC - some interesting, some useless. The living NPCs on the streets.. .well... the city was a bit dead .... empty. (many repeatitive toughts and lines, etc...) not enought side quests.The gameplay.... not bad, but not superb...  I think the action passages were..... the fighting part was for 3rd time boring. But the demons were great (mean the design, not their skills or AI)I think 2-3 months more for betatesting to correct flaws and changes in gameplay, this game could have been PERFECT  (9 from 10) but maybe next time!But now... one playthrout and I think I never play it again. There are flaws for me I cant never forget....Dont buy it for full price or you become angry. Trust me.  (10-15 euros, or sale)In past, Ive played fahrenheit (indigo prophecy) and both Alan Wakes (game and expansion)... I think this game is first for me, then Alan Wake, and then fahrenheit. Didnt liked the Alan Wake supernatural part, and fahrenheits either. But this was more believable. I really want to try Beyond 2 souls and heavy rain, but i dont have a ps3 and they never make it for PCs.I can tell Im satisfied... And I think theyve made a room for a sequel maybe...I give it a 7 (i dont care for the reviews) this game is: you love it or hate it... no other way. And I loved it more like hated it.Fans of deep story adventures are welcome... the others... well.... you can try (but dont forget, not the full price) :)7And one more thing - the MC was great. He played it very well(he had a great style and personality). And all others too. Like a theatre.			"

												'Always be careful with overhyped games that even gets attention by common news media!' ... would be an advise I would give to my children.Too bad Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of the games, that I would put in that category. But why do I recommend it then? Easy answer: This game isn't a total desaster, but it is not worth its full price.The gaming magazines criticize its length, its combat system (btw there is no combat system ... you more or less only hide from the few enemies) and absolutly no replay value. These three things I can confirm.It is also annoying, that while the main characters are very detailed, everyone else looks way worse and there is nearly nothing to do beside the 'main' quest.But that main quest is the thing, that keeps you nonstop playing till the end. The story with a relativly unused setting is well executed and the gameplay elements are simple enough to give you more of a interactive movie, then an (action) adventure.So if you like (gameplay simple) mystery thriller, go grab this game, when it is on big discount.

												Graphics are nice, but the control system is limited and a little forced (obviously intended for a controler). the only 'Action' is when you interact with demons and try to kill them from behind, in which case you have to quickly push a randomly chosen WASD key+mouse button combo while holding down another key to initiate. If they see you first, or you miss the key combo (EG because you're moving when you initate and the key your holding isn't the right one) then the only thing you can do is run away untill their not searching for you anymore and try again. Other than that it's a really simple detective game where you atempt to move your character into just the right spots to be able to interact with clues to get really obvious hints. (you get flashes of information when you find the clue, then you have to watch it all over again anyway once you 'solve' the crime)If you enjoy 'Tell me a story' mode games and can get past the controls it's alright. but get it on sale.

												The game has a good story, nice environments and believable characters with solid voice overs. Actually, it could have been one of those interactive movies if not these two things.First of all, it's completely linear. The main story and a few side quests. The only variable is whether you find all the collectibles (they are all related to the lore) or not. More likely, not - looking for every collectible is just too boring and doesn't provide much new information.Secondly, for some reason the creators tried to add more depth to gameplay and introduced demons that you need to hide from or kill stealthily. And it just doesn't work. Too easy for any Thief (Splinter Cell, Hitman, etc) player and too boring on top of that. Thankfully, those moments with demons are really short and sometimes you can simply run through them and then hide.Despide the flaws, I still recommend playing it. Basically, it's like watching a good movie. Perhaps you can even be surprised in the end!			"

												A hidden gem or a rusty stone To some players, this game popped up from nowhere in the Square Enix's catelogue. However, some players has been following this game from E3 2013 and has been building up alot of anticipations and pre-release hype. Based on the original concepts, authentic setttings and unique mechanics, this game definitely delivers.In this epic detective meets criminal adventure heavily inspired by the likes of L.A. Noire and Alan Wake players takes the role of detective Ronan O'Connor who happens to find himself being killed by the mysterious 'bell killer'. He then not only find himself dead in the real world but simultaneous alive in another dimension like the movie 'ghost'. Determined to find out who the killer was, Ronan embarked on a endless investigation to solve the mysteries behind his death and discover the dark secret behind Salem's ancient history of witchcraft.By playing as a ghost, you gain awesome abilities such as no clipping through walls, possessing people, poltergeist electronic devices to attract attentions, and if these aren't enough you can possess a cat and go 'meow'.By poeessing common folks around the town, you are given the options mind read their thoughts. However, most of the things they say provide little to no useful information at all which makes it pointless at any point of the game. Some NPCs such as police officers will allow player to obtain useful clues regarding the cases often by means of eavesdropping, peeking through their eyes and influence their decision making.By possessing the cat, you gain access to platforming sections of the game which often will help you to get to a upper level.The detective elements of the game was not as good as L.A Noire, investigation can help you gather clues and the amount of clues needed for each case was given to players. Interrogation can only be done on other ghosts and it involves picking from limited options and are way too easy most of the time it is just common sense. With enough clues gathered, players can conclude the current investigation by chossing pieces of important information. Players are given 3 chances and even if you selcted the incorrect choices, the game will give you infinite tries leading to eventually picking out the correct information by trials and error.This idiotically defeats the purpose of giving 3 tries and has way too much hand holding throughout the story. Whereas, in L.A noire inability to solve crimes often can have consequences and investigation cannot be done again once it is concluded.The combat is however interesting as player gain ability to see demons through walls to allow advanced planning of strategies and make decisions to whether encounter or avoid. Most of the battle requires player to teleport between human remain souls to get behind the demons to perform execution called 'exorcism'. However, the game has only one enemy type and every encounter feels the same and after a while it gets repetitive.The environment is also quite boring with little open world elements, no interactive NPCs, and bland design choices that players often just walking around for collectibles, side cases or towards the next objective. Speaking of side quests and collectibles. It can be a real chore as the game has little replay value so you gasically back tracking for the sake of it. There are no incentives or rewards for doing it apart from some achievements for completing a side case or a set of collections.Characters have little personality development throughout the game, most of the time I find it hard to relate to most of them. If the story wasn't decent enough to make me continue playing I just cannot think of much selling point in this game.Techniquelly, there has been occassional frame rate drop issues and stuttering problems which is annoying but still playable. When booting up the game for the first time, the screen also flickers a few times but I won't rate a game based on these minor issues as it can be simply fixed with a update or two.Is this a good game?I think overall, yes it is a good game if you like story driven adventure that doesn't involve all out shooting and straightout combat. Its appeal really comes from a real life location and interesting depiction of Salem's ancient history and traditions with a unique play style, it can be really appreciative. If you can ignore the problems present and look at the good side of things plus the price they are asking for, I would say it is worth a try.Final verdictMurdered: soul suspect is far from perfect or a masterpiece if you compare it to similar games such as L.A noire and Alan Wake. But it borrows what is good from both titles and add its own twists which some think it is good and some simply may not like it.Finally, I think it is one of those game that should be played but just don't expect 100% perfection and a fully immersive world and rather expect a rough around the edges unque title to try in 2014.7/10			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of the best detective/interactive fiction games I ever played. The story is quite compelling and dark, since you play a cop who was murdered and has to find out about his killer. Taking place in the legendary small town of Salem, which you can freely traverse, you head from one crime scene to the next. There you have to solve single cases, all of which are interconnected and eventually will lead to reveal the big picture of the main mystery. You will find clues to other side cases everywhere and can interact with a lot of people, dead and alive. The presentation, utilizing the Unreal 3 engine, is very adequate to the story, creating very dark and gritty ambience. Everything is nicely modeled and really good animated and also the sound design is excellent and facilitates the gloomy atmosphere.The only critique that I have is that there is little to no replay value. Once the cases are solved, you will hardly touch this game again.All in all I had a great time playing this game and I do recommend you give it a try. My verdict: 9/10 points -  great game			"

												Despite being a short game, I found the presentation and mechanics to be compelling. Unlike most games I've been playing lately, I was completely drawn into the story and trying to figure out what was going on. I was just familliar enough with town history that I guessed the majority of the plot pretty quickly, but the ending took me completely by surprise. I hope the people who put this together have more games in the future.			"

												I'm going to begin by voicing my displeasure at the fact that steam has only a two means of reviewing a game. The bright blue thumbs up or red thumbs down is the first thing people see and it is criminal that I'm forced to open my opinion with either a blatant recommendation or condemnation, as it is often never that simple. Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of those games that I feel very ambivalent towards. It gets a thumbs down though for reasons I'll gladly expound upon here but I'll start by saying that If you do want to buy this game, go ahead, but do it at a discount as there isn't enough of it to warrant its full price by a long shot. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a supernatural intrigue game where you play as Ronan O'Connor, gangland warrior turned detective and wandering samurai warrior, who is tracking a mysterious serial killer. Ronan is about apprehend the killer in the opening cutscene when the killer decides he's had enough of the law and reenacts the opening scene from Watchmen all over Ronan's face before shooting him seven times in the chest. So Ronan is dead, but you knew that already. Ronan now has to endeavor to do in one night what the entire police force couldn't do in years worth of time and solve the case of the Bell Killer. M:SS reminds me of two very specific games I actually liked, the first of which is Alan Wake. Like Alan Wake, this game is about supernatural dealings with a distinctly traditional American feel. Also like AW, the rules for the supernatural stuff in this game are very well defined.The supernatural lore being dealt with this time is ghosts, exploring all the traditional facets of what you might think ghosts are like, but before you go hog wild there is an exception to each of your abilities. You can pass through walls but not consecrated or ethereal walls, which mark the level boundaries. You can jumble electronics, but not to any meaningful degree. You can possess people but not control their actions. You can teleport, but not over demon holes so you still have to circumvent those on foot. Also like in Alan Wake, there isn't a whole lot to do in between plot points except hunt for collectibles. This leads me into the real issue I had with this game: its design.Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game of extra steps. I kept a running list of things the game took more than one step to complete without needing to: Often the game will end a cutscene just to have you press the interact button to continue the same cutscene. When questioning a suspect, you have to press a button for each option you want to explore but the interrogation doesn't end until all options are explored, so it might as well be one long cutscene. You can read the minds of people you possess but each person has exactly two things to say and you have to press the button twice to hear both things when they could just say them both at once. When piecing together the clues of an investigation, if you pick a wrong option you get booted from the screen, having to reenter the screen to continue. When grabbing collectibles, you have to reveal the object first before picking it up. The collectibles are half hidden but the game tells you where they are so there's no need for hiding them. Speaking of collectibles, there are a plethora of them, all of which have very little to no bearing on the actual game. Each area has a unique object that, once all are gathered, will unlock  a spooky campfire story unrelated to what you are doing. There are a series of over arching collectibles including diary pages from Ronan's dead wife (really the only means of character development), handy info blurbs copy-pasted from the Salem tourism comity website, and newspaper clippings reminding you how creepy and invincible the serial killer is.While Alan Wake also felt the need to boldly announce the appearance of an enemy so that there is no way for you to be caught off guard, at least it had engaging combat. Every once in a while the game breaks up the monotony by presenting you with enemies to sneak up behind and quick-time-event to death. Once or twice a level, there will be demons that half-heatedly wander around in an enclosed area. You have to hide in the hiding spot and wait for the monster to turn around so you can slowly walk up behind it and kill it. This ends up being tedious and non-threatening, unit you mess up. If you manage to not properly dispatch your spectral foe, the backlash is absurd. Demons will kill you within a 3-5 second window unless you can scurry back to a hiding spot. However, once detected, the demons can see you in hiding spots; forcing you to shift between them as fast and erratically as possible until they give up. This turns what little combat there is into a game of Red Light, Green Light. These sections make no sense to the lore of the game either as there is no reason given as to why Ronan seems to be the only ghost that can dispatch the demons. No introduction is given to the power nor is it explained that Ronan is the only one capable of it, leading me to wonder why the other ghosts all flee in terror when the demons show up.The second game I'm reminded of is L.A. Noire, because the investigation sections are reminiscent of the ones in that game. You have to walk around the crime scene and collect the clues, using them to piece together the motive of the criminal. There are six to fourteen clues per scene but only three of them at most are ever necessary to continue. It's no secret that detective work is not as flashy or intriguing as it is portrayed in popular culture, but no where is this more obvious than video games. L.A. Noire had a good mix of action and detective work, due (I think) to it's structure. All the clues were relevant because solving the case was the goal of the mission and everything unfolded naturally. Murdered, by contrast, has you investigating glaringly obvious crime scenes which, more often than not, inform you of something you already knew. For example, one crime scene later on in the game has you investigating a room full of people the Bell Killer murdered all at once. At the point of investigation, however, you have already been made aware of what the killer did afterword, so the reason for killing the room full of people is obvious. Then, once you investigate the room, Ronan stands there and tells the the reason the killer did it, even though you already knew. Really the investigating is just being a master of the obvious. It's also impossible to fail to find all of the clues, because the game tells you how many are present in the scene.Murdered, like many games these days, would have probably made a better book or movie. The game play really just consists of different kinds of walking around and looking at things. Despite being a game made by an established developer and publisher, this is something any indie dev could have made, if not made look quite as good. In the end, games are meant to be interactive; that is what the medium excels at. Yet more and more it seems like games are being made with interactivity at the bottom of their priority list.

												this game is an absolute disappointmentbut before i start raging i must pause and give a thumbs-up to the interesting plot that this game has. and that's about it what can anyone enjoy the game. maybe some shallow gamers could also enjoy it for the graphics but don't get me even started on those.anyways, there is absolutely no gameplay. the whole ""game"" consits of boring pixel hunting, after which you are asked absolutely dumb ""detective"" questions, which often don't even make sense and would make even CSI-miami look like a decent detective movie (which it is not). basically, it has absolutely nothing to do with playing a detective.the hours of boredom spent by pixel hunting for ""clues"" and collectible artifacts are accompanied by an absolutely ridiculously primitive ""stealth action"", which consists of walking behind a wall with ghost infravision or whatever and just killing these demons with a press of a button. and the game does not even punish you for getting noticed because you just run away, hide and return later, and try to press the ""KILL GHOST BUTTON"" again. and if you are incompentend enough and manage to get killed somehow, i don't know, maybe a dog jumped in your face or something, then you respawn 1 milliseond and 1 millimeter before the enemy encounter, because the checkpoints and saves are almost literally made after your character makes a step. (honestly, i have not gotten killed a single time during the game, except for once when i wondered what would actually happen if i got killed on purpose)honestly, just reading these few paragraps written with my terrible english will probably be a time spent better than trying to enjoy the gameplay of this excuse of a modern ""press x to win"" game. but as i said earlier, the story is cool and the little ghost tales told for collecting items during the abrasive pixel hunting are interesting as well. i would much rather watch a 1 hour long B-movie made from this story than die in agony wandering through the streets of the boredom town to get to the story.this was a terrible experience, and screw the money but i want the time back. the time. give me back my time.PS. before you dismiss the review because i have 0.1 hours of the game played on the record, i played it with steam in the offline mode and it just didn't register my playtime			"

												I LOVED this game. But I'll confess to having a bit of a bias due to how firmly this game dug into a favorite subject of mine storywise - laying the dead to rest/bringing peace to the restless dead. The story is dark, intriguing, and I count it among those rare ones where I couldn't figure out where plot twist was going ahead of time.PROS:-Superb storytelling-Excellent quality voice acting-Graphically gorgeous and expressively animated-Tons of exploration-Tons of stuff to collect as a reward for exploring-Interesting story-related things unlocked by finishing collections-Controls overall translated well from controller to keyboard-Intriguing puzzle system.-Very good 'beacon' system to get you from goal to goal along the mainstoryline.Cons:-Barely-there combat system. It fit the feel of the game (I'm serious about this), but anybody looking for more than light stealth sections are going to be disappointed.-No map whatsoever. This can be particularly frustrating when trying to track down collectibles.Verdict: Very, very good, excellent game, just not for everybody. "

												I was genuinely surprised by this game. I had my doubts when the hype around this game began to wane when it got closer to launch. Glad I was mistaken.The story starts with a bang and keeps you interested with a plethora of sidequests and lore. There's a lot to find in Salem, as there are over 200 pieces of different collectibles you can, uhm, collect. Bits of info about the town, witch trials and the characters themselves. All of them well written.Graphically the game looks good, but then again I'm really not that into graphics when I play. Voice acting is quite nice, though the budget seems to limit the amount of voice actors on NPC:s, as you tend to hear the same dialog often. But at least you don't hear Nolan North arguing with Nolan North (looking at you, Mafia 2).Story is great, in my opinion, and the ending was good. No cliffhangers or anything, everything is resolved.The gameplay is okay, although the ""stealth combat"" seems a bit out of place. It's only padding, really, they should have let that on the cutting room floor. The UI is very console-like, with rather odd button bindings. Nothing major, though. I played this with keyboard & mouse with no problems.All in all, it's a good game, definitely better than its metacritic score. Sure it's not a masterpiece by any means, but it sure has a spot on my underrated gems -list.			"

												It is not so often, when I get lost in a game like I did with Murdered: Soul Suspect. Everything about this game roars quality and adventure & mystery. Tons of questions must be answered, and here comes you, playing as Ronan. It is not an open world game, true, but you still can play it in your way and doesn't try to constrain you. You can solve tasks without having all of the clues discovered. You are even allowed to return previous locations to finish the side quests there, if you've skipped them through the Main Storyline. A lot of collectable item awaits you in the game, that unlocks so exciting extras such as other murderous stories has happened in Salem, even it's History. You can get more informations about Ronan, Jul.This game means something like Dishonored to me. Where an immersive story meets great graphics. And just not talking about Ronan. He is AWESOME.			"

												This title looked fantastic when I first read about it and watched the teasers. Then I watched the first few minutes of gameplay, coupled with reviews, and (wrongly) came to the conclusion that is was a hidden object game/single-room puzzler wrapped in a 3rd person Unreal Engine. Not the case at all. While the puzzling is not brain taxing in the slightest, the story is interesting and the setting can be almost beautiful in places. There is no horror to be found, unless you found Peter Jackson's Frighteners scary. Were it designed for grown-ups instead of E for Everyone it could have been so much more.Despite it's flaws, I found it enjoyable and sometimes hard to put down.			"

												I need to point out a bias, and that's that I love games that dare to be different. I have no heavenly idea whether it's the optimism or the bias itself speaking, but I really like this game! I'm sure you know what the game is about, you're an ex-""bad boy"" who wanted to change your life, so you became a cop. Now, during an investigation, you got shot by a mysterious man who seems anything BUT normal. You now need to solve this wicked mystery of who that man is, to get your redemption. Don't worry, you won't get to hold a gun, exactly, so it's not your ""average COD-clone"".My personal opinion of the beginning- and middle parts of the story is that they were good.  The ending was the most disappointing part of the game, however. Extremely cheap and weak way to end the game.. and even if it was ""cheap and weak"", it left you with a whole lot of questions afterwards. I won't spoil anything But story was overall quite good.The world in itself, that you walk around in, is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic! It is soooo cozy to walk around in a very Italian-like village during the night! But there's a huge flaw.. hugeeee flaw. The voice of the main character is painfully bad. He tries to do something Batman-like and deepen his voice way too low that it ruins everything. I don't know how to demonstrate this exactly, but when I was playing and heard him talk, my stomach hurt.. that's how bad this situation is!Other characters are somewhat lovable, and their animations & voice acting are all well done. HOWEVER, despite this game being ""open-world"" the elements that show this are abscent. There are missions you can do when roaming around such as helping a ghost solving their deaths, but I've only found three or four. Pathetic! And the collectibles aren't even worth thinking about. It does get quite scary at times as well, however, for you horror-lovers. I definitely recommend this game, in the end, though!7,5/10			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect - Spoiler Free ReviewFirst off, I'd like to point out that I like both pulp noir and ghost stories both of which are heavy influences on the general feel of this game.  If you do not like either the cinematography stylings of pulp noir (in which case, you won't like the cut-scenes and may dislike the characters on occassion) or think ghost stories are dull, then this is not the game for you.  For those of you still with me and looking at potentially buying this game a bit of background is in order.  The studio that released M:SS closed down despite really ploughing everything into this game.  Part of it is odd in places, which I'll get to, but mostly they'd been struggling for a while due to releasing a couple of games which were bombs a while back.  Any future updates to the game will have to be community driven but that at least is one piece of good news - after multiple playthroughs I only came across one minor glitch, once, and it was a graphical one that I couldn't replicate.  The game runs really well so future patching should not be necessary.So, where to start?  How about the story.  It's pretty standard fair, almost straight out of a ""Randall & Hopkirk: Deceased"" episode.  You're a detective in Salem when a call is put in about a strange hooded man breaking into an apartment building.  As you are an emotional loose cannon after your wifes' death (it's actually nice to play a character who's irrational behaviour gets some explanation for once) you chase after him alone only to find that he's too strong for you, the eventual fight resulting in your death.  Your purpose is to stop the killer from beyond the grave so that your spirit can move on and be reunited with your wife.  This opening is actually really impressive as it's almost entirely done using the in-game engine and graphically looks superb, the sweeping camera shots and the slow-motion work really well giving a strong movie quality feel but rather than just have you as a passenger watching the opening the developer makes you take part in it, trying to first catch the killer and even trying to survive the attack.  The sound is excellent too and is nicely understated, something that carries throughout the whole game.After this you're left, dead, in Salem trying to figure out how you can stop this killer.  There's a tutorial which covers the controls and then you're given objectives to complete but you are left to wander through reasonably large parts of Salem without being stopped.  As you're dead you come across other spirits and left over memories of Salem in it's past, which just helps to make the world more interesting and full and the contrast in design is really well realised, especially when it ties in with the sidequests and main stories.  The more you progress the more of Salem opens up to you, allowing you to find out more about Salems past and revisit areas you have already explored.  The team have been as historically accurate as possible, considering that the game is a work of fiction, and you'll get to pick up on a real flavour of Salems darker past as you wander town.Character design suits the mood of the town too and there are characters in period dress in certain areas, although they are very few and far between, I'd have liked to have seen more of them.  They are reasonably realistic to look at - not ultra-real - which would feel out of place in a ghost story, but real anyway with very good motion capture and facial expressions especially on the main ones.  One that stood out to me is a point where a character manages to pretty much lie with just their face for a split second near the end, you'll know it when you see it, but the technology is well utilised without being overdone, it does not take you out of the story or gameplay very much if ever.As a ghost you get to travel through walls but presumably due to hardware limitations this pretty much is only really used within enclosed spaces, though this is explained within the game-worlds mythos itself well enough and it can be quite good fun.  These sections really can make you feel like a running, screaming spirit.  I felt less like a spirit and more like I was going to have a seizure due to swoosh noise everytime you select a conversation topic.  It's fine in short conversations but they can be long and a little grating if you want to find out everything.There's some disturbing bits in this game too.  Some pretty nasty deaths of young women, some ghosts have some surprisingly harrowing and well-acted lines, almost mini-stories, of their own if you come across them and there are collectables that unlock urban legends, a couple of which are genuinely quite creepy.  There are places with a lot of extra details added in which build up a wonderful sense of dread and oppression too, a lot of which can easily be missed and overlooked as it is just there for scene-setting.  Controls are pretty tight, the camera is good but can be a bit awkward when you are possessing something or trying to get through a wall slowly.  But there are two elephants in the room and these are what most reviewers scored the game so harshly on.1) Pointless Sort-of Forced Combat/Stealth Sections.You do combat, you either have to go for it whole-heartedly or just don't do it.  In for a penny, in for a pound!  M:SS feels like it's dipping it's fingers into the collection bowl and wondering if it can get away with giving a two Christmas old chocolate coin.  You get an enforced stealth section, taking you out of the more interesting portion of the game which feels jarring, so you can try to sneak past these demon-monsters which look like the Nozghul if they'd been drinking sheep-dip.  It hardly ever works so you have to try to stealth kill them, which is only a temporary fix.  2) Escort MissionThe escort is at least useful but these are really badly designed - it barely matters if you get spotted because the spotter sub-routine is so badly programmed.Both of these things feel tacked on and out of place.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they received orders from their publisher that if they wanted a Triple A advertising budget then it had to have those things in it because they feel completely at odds with the rest of the game.  And yes, I will be doing a video rant I am that annoyed about it.Mercifully, there's only a handful of those sections and apart from that and one point with a truly stupid portrayal of mental illness (completely different to an earlier scene with a ghost in a bath), the rest of the game is pretty much excellent.  If you can stick out those few parts you will find a good to look at, engaging murder mystery, with an excellent twist and interesting backdrop and characters.I recommend it, but have to dock it marks for 1) & 2)        Total Score:  7.5/10  Well above average and definitely worth a play if you want a murder mystery that's a little different or a slowly paced adventure game.

												While I do recommend the game overall, I have one major gripe with it: the demons. Having to fight them was, for me, a total distraction from the story. In short, they were supremely annoying. IMHO, the game would be much better without them.I have one other, less serious, gripe: the navigation system. At various times there is a pointer displayed that, supposedly, tells how far, and what direction,  it is to the intended destination. It's practically useless; truly annoying.On the positive side, the story is really good. The way the graphics are handled is also pretty clever. Some say it's similar to L.A. Noir. I've never played it so I can't compare. The movement mechanics for keyboard were good. It is a little slow at the beginning while trying to figure out what to do, and how to do it, but it picks up as you get into the story.			"

												This game is another example, approving that Square Enix releases good solid games, but not AAA level. I waited for it, and although it did not meet all my expectations, it left me satisfied.First of all it a game of a rare genre nowadays - Adventure. Get rid of the demons and demon hands - and this is a pure non-combat quest. The closest example which appeared in my mind is Indigo Prohecy. Sometimes it's really pleasant to drop off your swords, guns, explosives, tanks, etc. and just listen to a good (mystic in this case) story, or since we're talking about the game - become a part of the story.The plot doesn't bring something new (or maybe it's me getting older), but it's interesting and keeps you involved till the end of the game, with a small twist. Thankfully, game is pretty short and does not get you bored - 16 hours in my case, BUT, this is becasue of the greatest minus of the game - it's terrible, random, sadistic check points. I had to exit the game after several hours of playing, and when came back to it about 30 minutes were gone. I had to rush into several side quests again aaand....caught a bug with Ronan falling through textures, reloaded, and repeated those 30 minutes.As far as I understand this is first succesfull project from Airtight Games. If they had more budget, city would be bigger, there would be more side quests, more reasonablo thoughts in the citizens' minds and more interactive objects. So I wish developers all that for their next project so it can become a real AAA game. For now, it's 7,5/10 (not enough for 8, better than just 7)			"

												This game starts oddball, but settles in quite quickly. I suppose you could call it an adventure title – it's kind of like a modern cop detective game, without the sort of action you'd assume to be stuck in as a timesink filler padding out a story. It is *much* more like a modern third person shooter without any of the shooting, just the investigative minigames, the scavenger hunt collectibles and the plot. Does this make sense? Designwise it simply does not feel like an adventure game.I do recommend it.Last note on the Steam version – getting it to run on my PC was an absolute, horrific chore. For some reason, the Steam integration .dlls kept the game from starting. It kept crashing right at the start, stating that it can't contact the Steam client. Well, eventually I got it to run by some dark magic steps that I'm not going to publicly enumerate, at the cost of losing most of the benefits Steam bestows.			"

The other option is to use ""AutoHotKey"" and create your own bindings, probably the simplest way to go.Have not been able to actually play the game due to the bindings so it might have a good story or whatever but in current condition is not playable. Now starting to use ""WASD only"" tag on all game I find like this.			"

												It is not so often, when I get lost in a game like I did with Murdered: Soul Suspect. Everything about this game roars quality and adventure & mystery. Tons of questions must be answered, and here comes you, playing as Ronan. It is not an open world game, true, but you still can play it in your way and doesn't try to constrain you. You can solve tasks without having all of the clues discovered. You are even allowed to return previous locations to finish the side quests there, if you've skipped them through the Main Storyline. A lot of collectable item awaits you in the game, that unlocks so exciting extras such as other murderous stories has happened in Salem, even it's History. You can get more informations about Ronan, Jul.This game means something like Dishonored to me. Where an immersive story meets great graphics. And just not talking about Ronan. He is AWESOME.			"

												I will say no for now mainly because of it's early game crashing. This has nothing to do with the game itself, It's just not functioning well yet. From what i've seen the game does have a really interesting story and concept behind it, so I look forward to when it's fixed. Until then, i'd wait.			"

												Interesting mechanics and story don't save this.  When it tries to be an actual game, it's absolute garbage.  Don't bother putting in stealth mechanics if your engine can't handle it.  Also you can't skip the credits and they are 10 minutes long.  Screw this game.			"

												I liked the game, good graphic, nice soundtrack and immersive storyline (so far). I guess the only problem I found with the game was the lack of depth in gameplay (e.g. lack of difficulty settings, engaging combat systems and side quests). However that said, I really dig the story and aesthetic of the game as well as the classic who done it vibe. I reccomend this game for people who are looking for a interactive movie experience with a solid plot and expectionally good voice acting (IMO). I'd give this game 7.8 out of 10, because whilst the fundamentals of the game perform well, the lack of gameplay depth and overall quantity can take the shine off what is a generally wonderful experience.

												This game I feel appeals to people who enjoy story rich games. The gameplay is satisfying but nowhere near as enjoyable as that of LA Noire. Though it draws many comparisons to it I would say a gameplay format such as The Walking Dead would have done this game justice. The low score doesnt reflect the well written and intriguing story which this game relies on, but rather the repetitive and simple gameplay. Going into this game with the right expectations I feel you will definitely enjoy it. The concept is good just needs some difficulty improvements and the next installment in this series, in the hope there will be one, could easily become a popular franchise. Supplying 8 hours of gameplay, with some side missions which are just as enjoyable as the main storyline, I feel this is a game which all should experience assuming you are someone who just enjoys a good story.

												I was genuinely surprised by this game. I had my doubts when the hype around this game began to wane when it got closer to launch. Glad I was mistaken.The story starts with a bang and keeps you interested with a plethora of sidequests and lore. There's a lot to find in Salem, as there are over 200 pieces of different collectibles you can, uhm, collect. Bits of info about the town, witch trials and the characters themselves. All of them well written.Graphically the game looks good, but then again I'm really not that into graphics when I play. Voice acting is quite nice, though the budget seems to limit the amount of voice actors on NPC:s, as you tend to hear the same dialog often. But at least you don't hear Nolan North arguing with Nolan North (looking at you, Mafia 2).Story is great, in my opinion, and the ending was good. No cliffhangers or anything, everything is resolved.The gameplay is okay, although the ""stealth combat"" seems a bit out of place. It's only padding, really, they should have let that on the cutting room floor. The UI is very console-like, with rather odd button bindings. Nothing major, though. I played this with keyboard & mouse with no problems.All in all, it's a good game, definitely better than its metacritic score. Sure it's not a masterpiece by any means, but it sure has a spot on my underrated gems -list.			"

												6 hours game playAfter having finish this game, I would rate this 6/10. The score are deducted as follow.-2 for game lengths. having to wait for a year, I would have expected the game to last for more then 6 hours of game play. And for the amount that I am paying it is not worth getting. heck there isn't even a start new + where we can do more side quest or something. Major disappointment. -1 not challenging enough. I have play many other detective rpg games but this one seems to be really dumb down. the clues were very easy to get and conclusion was very obvious. I was expecting more of a challenge and a little bit more action. -1 no charctor build. there were no real charactor background relating to the game.  for example there were no solid explanation as to why the antigonize went out of its way to hunt the so call ""witch"" in the game. overall it feels  like the charactor are introduce as if they were made up on the spot. overall conclusion, i believe this game has more potential and hope that there are some sort of free dlc for customer who paid at $49.99. I would not recommend to get this game at a full-price. If you are really interested, then try waiting for the price to go down like say 19.99 or something (well, if you waited for a year, might as well wait a little longer).			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a typical Square Enix title story-wise, however it falls short on game length, suspense based on its genre and some pretty slow controls. What do I mean by slow controls? I mean that walking is more like shuffling and the run option is nothing more than a fast paced walk. Granted you get a power later on that helps with that problem, but only to a point.The story is well presented but it still feels rushed and boring at times. The only thing that would make the gameplay any longer is by aquiring all the collectibles which I feel has had more time spent on than some more important parts of the game, both finding them and reading/watching them. This game is portrayed as a thriller and it hasn't failed on that part. However it also implies some horror elements that aren't really present, even with the ""spooky"" spectres.As my activity time shows, I've not spent long on this game. I'd say that the campaign is only around 3-4 hours long and all other time is spent simply getting the collectibles or completing the tiny amount of sidecrimes/cases that you can solve.All in all, this is getting a thumbs down. While the story is good, I can't help but feel that this game was rushed out to help with the new gen consoles rather than be a good game. I also don't think that with the small amount of time spent on thisgame it is worth the £24.99 price tag.			"

Then I watched the first few minutes of gameplay, coupled with reviews, and (wrongly) came to the conclusion that is was a hidden object game/single-room puzzler wrapped in a 3rd person Unreal Engine. Not the case at all. While the puzzling is not brain taxing in the slightest, the story is interesting and the setting can be almost beautiful in places. There is no horror to be found, unless you found Peter Jackson's Frighteners scary. Were it designed for grown-ups instead of E for Everyone it could have been so much more.Despite it's flaws, I found it enjoyable and sometimes hard to put down.			"

												So... I love the idea of the story. Investigate your own murder, help other ghosts along the way. Superb premise. I play games for the story. I personally am not a fan of fight driven games, or games that constantly interrupt the story due to fights and battles inbetween. If the difficulty could be changed to ""walk through the fight, so I can go on with my puzzles and story"", then that would be ideal for me.As is, however, the controls are so infuriating that I stopped playing it in first chapter. Randomised-button-smashing-after-on-screen-prompt as a ""battle"" is not my description of fun, particularly when half the time the game doesn't react at all to the button usage even though you KNOW you have hit the right ones. In the right order. (edit: there is a function that lets you make the demons be completely unaware and they won't bother you. That at least let me play the game through to the end...)So, if you are after action, and battle and that tiresome interruption of the story, then yes, that games if for you and I can recommend it, because the graphics are amazing, and the idea behind it is great.Either way, if you are like me, a casual gamer that doesn't have a world of time and plays for exploration, story, puzzles, then no, this one is way too infuriating and I cannot recommend it. (Though, playable with Demon's off, it's bearable and I enjoyed it a tad bit more).Meh... Guess I'll stick to my ""simple games"" like Myst, Riven, Obduction, etc.			"

Posted: September 28, 2014
												Murdered: Soul Suspect - Spoiler Free ReviewFirst off, I'd like to point out that I like both pulp noir and ghost stories both of which are heavy influences on the general feel of this game.  If you do not like either the cinematography stylings of pulp noir (in which case, you won't like the cut-scenes and may dislike the characters on occassion) or think ghost stories are dull, then this is not the game for you.  For those of you still with me and looking at potentially buying this game a bit of background is in order.  The studio that released M:SS closed down despite really ploughing everything into this game.  Part of it is odd in places, which I'll get to, but mostly they'd been struggling for a while due to releasing a couple of games which were bombs a while back.  Any future updates to the game will have to be community driven but that at least is one piece of good news - after multiple playthroughs I only came across one minor glitch, once, and it was a graphical one that I couldn't replicate.  The game runs really well so future patching should not be necessary.So, where to start?  How about the story.  It's pretty standard fair, almost straight out of a ""Randall & Hopkirk: Deceased"" episode.  You're a detective in Salem when a call is put in about a strange hooded man breaking into an apartment building.  As you are an emotional loose cannon after your wifes' death (it's actually nice to play a character who's irrational behaviour gets some explanation for once) you chase after him alone only to find that he's too strong for you, the eventual fight resulting in your death.  Your purpose is to stop the killer from beyond the grave so that your spirit can move on and be reunited with your wife.  This opening is actually really impressive as it's almost entirely done using the in-game engine and graphically looks superb, the sweeping camera shots and the slow-motion work really well giving a strong movie quality feel but rather than just have you as a passenger watching the opening the developer makes you take part in it, trying to first catch the killer and even trying to survive the attack.  The sound is excellent too and is nicely understated, something that carries throughout the whole game.After this you're left, dead, in Salem trying to figure out how you can stop this killer.  There's a tutorial which covers the controls and then you're given objectives to complete but you are left to wander through reasonably large parts of Salem without being stopped.  As you're dead you come across other spirits and left over memories of Salem in it's past, which just helps to make the world more interesting and full and the contrast in design is really well realised, especially when it ties in with the sidequests and main stories.  The more you progress the more of Salem opens up to you, allowing you to find out more about Salems past and revisit areas you have already explored.  The team have been as historically accurate as possible, considering that the game is a work of fiction, and you'll get to pick up on a real flavour of Salems darker past as you wander town.Character design suits the mood of the town too and there are characters in period dress in certain areas, although they are very few and far between, I'd have liked to have seen more of them.  They are reasonably realistic to look at - not ultra-real - which would feel out of place in a ghost story, but real anyway with very good motion capture and facial expressions especially on the main ones.  One that stood out to me is a point where a character manages to pretty much lie with just their face for a split second near the end, you'll know it when you see it, but the technology is well utilised without being overdone, it does not take you out of the story or gameplay very much if ever.As a ghost you get to travel through walls but presumably due to hardware limitations this pretty much is only really used within enclosed spaces, though this is explained within the game-worlds mythos itself well enough and it can be quite good fun.  These sections really can make you feel like a running, screaming spirit.  I felt less like a spirit and more like I was going to have a seizure due to swoosh noise everytime you select a conversation topic.  It's fine in short conversations but they can be long and a little grating if you want to find out everything.There's some disturbing bits in this game too.  Some pretty nasty deaths of young women, some ghosts have some surprisingly harrowing and well-acted lines, almost mini-stories, of their own if you come across them and there are collectables that unlock urban legends, a couple of which are genuinely quite creepy.  There are places with a lot of extra details added in which build up a wonderful sense of dread and oppression too, a lot of which can easily be missed and overlooked as it is just there for scene-setting.  Controls are pretty tight, the camera is good but can be a bit awkward when you are possessing something or trying to get through a wall slowly.  But there are two elephants in the room and these are what most reviewers scored the game so harshly on.1) Pointless Sort-of Forced Combat/Stealth Sections.You do combat, you either have to go for it whole-heartedly or just don't do it.  In for a penny, in for a pound!  M:SS feels like it's dipping it's fingers into the collection bowl and wondering if it can get away with giving a two Christmas old chocolate coin.  You get an enforced stealth section, taking you out of the more interesting portion of the game which feels jarring, so you can try to sneak past these demon-monsters which look like the Nozghul if they'd been drinking sheep-dip.  It hardly ever works so you have to try to stealth kill them, which is only a temporary fix.  2) Escort MissionThe escort is at least useful but these are really badly designed - it barely matters if you get spotted because the spotter sub-routine is so badly programmed.Both of these things feel tacked on and out of place.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they received orders from their publisher that if they wanted a Triple A advertising budget then it had to have those things in it because they feel completely at odds with the rest of the game.  And yes, I will be doing a video rant I am that annoyed about it.Mercifully, there's only a handful of those sections and apart from that and one point with a truly stupid portrayal of mental illness (completely different to an earlier scene with a ghost in a bath), the rest of the game is pretty much excellent.  If you can stick out those few parts you will find a good to look at, engaging murder mystery, with an excellent twist and interesting backdrop and characters.I recommend it, but have to dock it marks for 1) & 2)        Total Score:  7.5/10  Well above average and definitely worth a play if you want a murder mystery that's a little different or a slowly paced adventure game.

												Played about 2 hours of the game so far. This is basically a much better and well produced version of the god awful Daylight. This in not your action game but more of a cinematic, story telling, puzzle, and mystery video game. The only real element of danger are the ""demons"" because if you didn't have that then there would be no way to ""die"" in the game.Once again, if you are looking for action, this is not your game. If you want a game that revolves around a plot, puzzles, and mystery with good cinematic production, then this is the game for you.			"

												You play as the ghost of Ronan O'Connor as he investigates his murder and attempts to find the identity of the serial ""Bell Killer.""  There are several investigations you must perform through the game, plus a number of optional side cases where you can help other ghosts resolve whatever issues are keeping them in the world.  The story is really interesting, especially when you discover the identity of the serial killer, but the game is just okay.Finding clues to solve the investigations is kind of difficult.  There is only a narrow margin in the view angle that will allow you to actually examine each clue, and there is nothing to indicate what can or can't be examined other than the ""Examine"" option that appears when you look directly at a clue.  Piecing together the clues to solve each case is not at all intuitive, and often doesn't even make sense.  The soundbite clues were my least favorite; the game plays a sound as the menu appears (and the menu has its own sound clip), then you have to choose which object in your sight makes the most sense for the sound you may have not even heard.  There is no way to make the sound replay.Thankfully, there is no punishment for selecting the wrong clues when solving a case.  Unfortunately, there's also no reward for perfectly solving a case.  After solving a case, the game tells you exactly where to go next, which makes for a very linear experience.  You do revisit a few locations, and you can sidetrack to perform optional cases or discover collectibles, but the game really holds your hand the whole way through.  This makes the game pretty easy to complete, but I didn't feel like it caused me to enjoy the game any less.The ghost powers are nothing more than arbitrary game mechanics that change for each situation depending on what the game needs to let you do in order to progress.  You have the ability to possess people and listen to their thoughts, which results in you hearing the same small selection of dialogues over and over.  Sometimes cases will make you possess a person and ""influence"" them to provide more clues.  You are prompted, ""What will make this person remember _______ event?"" and then you choose something from among the clues you've found thus far.  You also have the ability to teleport a short distance, interact with electronics as a poltergeist (which only draws peoples' attention when the game needs it to), and reveal ghost objects of events from the distant past (which doesn't ever seem to do anything useful except allow you to find optional collectibles).Each case only requires you to find a handful of available clues, so you need not collect all 362 pieces of evidence (189 of which are for the main story) if you aren't the completionist type.  Failure to collect all the clues will not affect the outcome of the game, so don't expect a Heavy Rain type of game where information you do or do not find affects future revelations.  However, collecting all of the clues does reveal a lot of information about the locations and characters, so you are actually rewarded for picking up the ridiculous amount of collectibles.Despite these flaws, I did enjoy the game.  It holds up as a solid detective game even if the clues and cases are somewhat arbitrary.  This is certainly not the best detective game I've played but it is far from being the worst.			"

												When PC gamers complain about console ports, this is what they're talking about. The mouse and keyboard controls are terrible. It's full of quicktime events and unskippable noninteractive sequences. The dialogue between characters is full of weird inflections and unnatural pauses, like the dialogue was stitched together from people who weren't in the same room (which it almost certainly was).The first puzzle is ""find 8 objects you can click on in this scene"", and the gameplay is completely linear. With so many cutscenes, it's more like watching a terribly edited movie than playing a game.I wish I'd listened to the 59 on metacritic and avoided this stinker. I'm only an hour in, but I really can't take any more of this.			"

												I heard good things about this game, and it's an interesting premise, but after three or four sessions I'm losing interest.  The gameplay typically involves wandering a room/area and picking up 16/16 random glowing points, for each you'll get a mostly uninteresting sentence to read ""A police report.  Witness says the killer was wearing a hat."".  Then he'll come to a conclusion to move you to the next scene.  The dialogue is also typically very uninteresting.  You can read NPCs thoughts which should be cool, but each NPC has 2 useless dialogues, and they share the same dialogue with the other NPCs.  ""It's so cold outside"" ""I don't feel safe with a killer on the loose"" etc.  And everyone else who has unique dialogue is some kind of secret psychotic serial killer.  The demons are getting annoying.  My favorite part was a bit where you can ""posess"" and become a cat to access an area you otherwise couldn't.  The main character's backstory was interesting, but just poor implementation so far.  I'll probably push through and finish it, but I'm disappointed.			"

												So... this game...Well, I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, so I cannot complain about it as such - it was an interesting experience.HOWEVER, had I bought it as a stand-alone game on Steam, I'd be very dissapointed.Visually impressive (to a degree at least) the game is filled with a bit too many collectable quests (get X of Y to unlock something). The investigations are sensible 50% of the time - the other half just felt I was wrong becuase the scriptwriter went for a really surreal story. Finally, the ending... well, I don't wish to spoil things, but what a cop out. On the gameplay side of things... someone decided that to build tension they need to throw in demons into the mix (either in the form of demonic ""pools"" on the ground or ""sentries"" that patrol the area). Suffice it to say it doesn't build tension, but it does slow the pace even more, and is purely annoying. Oh, and speaking of the pace - I really wish the character could make a like a ghost and move faster. Getting anywhere is a pain.PS. The game is also buggy. Because the developer is long gone, don't hold your breath for a fix for any bugs you may encounter.			"

												There's a lot of good to be found in this game, but it is ultimately let down by its length, scope, and incredibly frustrating 'combat' mechanics.You play as Ronan, a newly-deceased detective on the trail of the same serial killer that had just taken his life. In his new ghostly form, he possesses powers of teleportation, x-ray vision, and some other supernatural capabilities in addition to his police skills.The game is fully linear in nature with some detours (small side stories), but ultimately railroads players down a single, short path. Taking my time to look around, I ended up clocking just under 10 hours on my playthrough, but your mileage may vary here. In addition to basically being a one-track experience, the game heavily relies on collectibles to flesh out its characters, setting, and lore; a bad design decision as not everyone may be inclined to seek out every little hidden detail. All Steam Achievements are tied into this as well; if you collect all 242 collectibles, you have 100% completion outside of surviving the final 'boss battle'.Nonetheless, if you are a fan of murder mysteries, point 'n click games, and supernatural stuff in general, Murdered might be worth a look during a sale (you want to go for 90% off, like I did). That being said, don't expect a groundbreaking ride; interest in the aforementioned things will justify a cheap price tag on this game, but little more than that.If you have no strong interest in the above genres, steer clear of this game; short on content, zero replayability, horribly implemented and hamfisted combat, some bewildering design decisions, and suffocating linearity (with plenty of walls to stifle your progress) will kill most enjoyment you can get out of this game. Additionally, the developers closed down less than a month after release, which is pretty ironic considering the sense of wanting to get things over with the ending has about it. A shame considering the likable protagonist, but the closest the game comes to outright telling you you shouldn't have bothered.			"

												5/10Best Part: Playing as a cat!Game with a lot of good ideas that got made by people who didnt know how to craft them into a good game-------I have bought this when it was on sale and since i really like these adventure games especially playing as a detective I just could not get into it. I was so bored... soooo bored. I did not expect another LA NOIRE but c'mon.. the best part was the intro video. It does have a very good story with interesting characters but it is so dull when you play it.It is sort of like this. You get into a location where you run around and picking up some totally useless things for revealing some sidestories which are interesting (some of them) but after picking up 5(/10/25) whatever they want (saw/papers/photographs) you go ""OMG just give me the achievment and let me go"". And the game starts telling you the whole sidestory while looking at some picture or something similiarily cheap.Some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥in the location where you run around belongs to the main story. But the point is same. You runnin around like an idiot and then go ""HA! it wants me to push E"" then you push E and then continue to run around. Then it asks you some totally dumb question and you got to connect some clues which would be interesting if the game would punish you for a wrong choice... You picked the wrong clue? Nevermind.. Pick another! So you can just click around cause it doesnt matter and answering questions like ""Why did she go to church?"" with an answer ""I think she did go to the church"" summs up the dullness of the ""detective mechanics"".Overall Murdered Soul Suspect looks like a game by someone who knows what makes a good game but doesnt know how to put it into his game. I can imagine somebody can get into this game and actually like it but I was so bored after 2 hours playing it.			"

												A first impression here. It's not bad as some of the review sites out there might want you to believe. It's and adventure game, think LA Noire without the action and driving. It's a slower paced game where you'll have to look around for clues to solve puzzles to move to the next area, so if you're looking for an action FPS or something like that, it probably won't be for you. It's a good looking game with better graphics than watchdogs that I picked up last week, and has alot of graphics settings to play with, runs smooth on ultra/high on my HD 7870, although the frames per second seem to be locked to 30. I'd give it a 7 out of ten, it is kind of pricey though for what it is, but would definitely reccomend it at say $25.			"

												Blah. Story is alright, gameplay pretty weak. Starts on a high note. Introduces you to the variety of methods of interacting with characters. Peek through eyes, read what they are reading, eavesdrop on conversations, get clues, influence thoughts of others... ya that's cool. After the first investigation which is mostly a tutorial, one could easily think the stage is set for a game where investigations deepen and interactions get more complex. It doesn't. Infact it gets more linear. Anyways..... 10hrs is enough. Was happy to beat it and call it quits.			"

												Got this game for free when I purchased my video card. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective game set around the site of the former Salem Witch trials where you are a ghost stuck in limbo until the you can resolve everything in regards to your death (namely, identifying the killer). The story is moderately enjoyable, and the ending twist regarding your death genuinely surprised me. Didn't care for the time spent in between crime scenes, as things tended to drag, and the collectables are more of a hassle than anything. Since the story only lasts for 7-8 hours and the game doesn't have much replayability, I can not recommend buying at the $50 price. Look into playing once it hits a major sale on Steam.			"

												Right then, I just finished the game.Let me start by saying that I like playing detective and love trying to solve puzzles on my own. I don't even mind if the graphics are bad, as long as the gameplay works and the plotline keeps me interested.When the game started I thought it seemed alright. The whole ghost detective trying to solve his own murder wasn't a bad idea and had quite some potential. Woe is me now, having paid 40 euros for something that lasted for 17 hours, and only so long because I kept on exploring the extremely limited environments that seem to be a trademark of Squaresoft's games these days. The player is guided by both arms like a blind and handicapped elderly through the mediocre and predictable story. God forbid anyone who pays good money for the game should have to think for themselves.And it's not just that. The whole game was more like getting from one lengthy cutscene to another. The only times you can screw up or die is when ""battling"" demons, and by battling I, of course, mean pressing two keys that show up on the screen in the correct order when close to a demon. How exciting.There was really only one thing I enjoyed in this game, and that was the first time I got to possess a cat. The cat's animations were done nicely and it was a fun idea. But really - not worth 40 euros. Another thing that was ""ok"" was the lead male's voice acting. It was not great, but it didn't get on my nerves either.At some point you gain an ability that made me think I might be able to roam the map more freely, but again I was to be disappointed. Most times I didn't even need this new ability to reach any places that were meant to be reached.I won't be recommending this game for anyone with half a brain.			"

												When they say ""adventure game"", you expect puzzles there. This one's gameplay consists entirely of hunting the scenes for interactive objects and then picking one of them by guessing the scriptwriter's logic. This is not a puzzle game, this is a casual time-waster. A shame, because the characters weren't bad.			"

												MURDERED isn't really a game. It's more of an interactive story/movie with movement, It has a very interesting premise, but in my opinion it failed to deliver on that punch which it desperately needed and strived for.For the ""gameplay"" mechanics, you basically find crime scenes, try to find and examine every object, then have infinite tries to choosing the correct ones that apply to move the story along. Sometimes this involves influencing people by possessing them, but that's only during scripted moments and does nothing useful when you possess the NPCs walking around the world. It's the same when you ""poltergeist"" an object (turn it on/mess it up for a few seconds). Lifeless NPCs will not react unless it's a scripted moment for the story.There are enemies in the game, demons, and you can walk behind them and try your hand at a randomized QTE where you'll have to press one button from WASD and use the left or right click to destroy the demon. If you fail, which you will due to the poor controls of this, then you'll have to jump into ghost fragments around the level to avoid getting your soul sucked until the demon gives up. This is all of the ""action"" in the story and it's more of a waste of time than anything. There is no boss fight or no real reason for destroying demons. Their AI is on a predetermined route and they're just an inconvenience for scouring a level for the collectible items.Each area has a different amount of collectibles. These unlock urban legend/ghost stories that are just a picture and a person monologuing. That's really it for the entire game's mechanics outside of possessing a cat and following a predetermined route with no real obstacles/puzzles. There's literally nothing interesting to do in this game beyond solving the main storyline with its pre-determined deductivity.  All in all, I can't recommend this as a game. If you're looking for the great supernatural mystery thriller of our time this is far from that. But if you're looking to chance it for a story that you may (or may not) enjoy and you're willing to overlook about 8 hours of lacking gameplay, this one on the cheap might fit that bill. Treat it more like an average-grade movie than a game.			"

												This game has garnered criticism for being short and a simplistic combat style.Yes it is short but I don't feel it needs to be any longer, they may have been able to extend the gametime if they had added more and longer side-quests rather than condensing them to a small investigation area but I do think that this would require a larger map and a means of fast transport and you're not exactly gonna have the main character (a ghost called Ronan) drive around in a ghost car, are you?No, I think the formula this game has landed on is right for this game.As for the combat, (some basic stealth against actually rather scary demons), it doesn't NEED to be complex as this is not that sort of game.Are Telltale games critisized for the combat, no, they win game of the years awards, bottom line is they are story driven and so is this, if you can get it on sale definitely get it and if not probably still get it, it has a very good story and ending.

The minigames weren't relevant or fun to do and seem to be a vain attempt at making it seem like it's a game instead of just a movie.

												Murdered Soul Suspect is the last game made by Airtight games, Did the go out with a bang ? In Murdered Soul Suspect you play as Ronan o connor. Salem is haunted by a serial killer named the Bell killer. One day Ronan Finds the trail of the bell killer but gets killed in the process. Ronan returns as a ghost but hes unable to move on until he finds out who killed him. In the proccess he meets Jane who the killer is trying to hunt down. So its youre job to protect her from the killer while trying to find out who killed you. So how is Murdered ? Its actually a great game. The best way i could put it would be a supernatural LA Noire. The game is essiantly you interogating ghosts and people who can see you know as mediums. The game lets you posses people and cats. Mess with electronics and stuff like that. Theres also fighting segments where you have to fight ghost while trying to aproach them from the back. But if they see you you will have to hide because you cant fight them head on. So now for the pros and cons. The game has a great story and a great twist ending. The game is fun and simple. Great puzzles to solve and tons of collectibles to collect. The cons: the game is kinda glitchy and its also really short. Overall Murdered Soul Suspect is a great game and i suggest you buy it because simply put it its a great game and Airtight Games will be missed. I give Murdered Soul Suspect a 8/10			"

												Would have been okay if it came out 10 years ago. Key word being ""okay"".Average to bad story, bad acting, not as cheesy as it should have been (big missed opportunity there), and lots of 'collect all the♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is usually my jam, but even that feels messy and arbitrary.Speaking of 10 years ago, I would recommend something like Fahrenheit instead, which still blows this out of the water.On the other hand, if you want to play a $50 game that really takes ZERO brain cells to process, both in story and gameplay, this is the game for you my friend!update: Finished the game (which thankfully speeds up in pace at the end, but still doesn't get an upgrade to recommended from me), and saw that the credits feature a Japanese dev team! This actually explains a lot. It really feels like a eastern interpretation of a western crime story - they pick up every cliche and trope, the cheesiest characters, but approach it completely straight faced. No irony, no self awareness. I wish they'd felt more free to inject more of their own personality.Now it sits in no-mans land, the equivalent of a western attempt at an anime or a JRPG.			"

												So clearly not recommending this game, this Review is being written in 2016 and should be noted as such, if your thinking of buying this game just go for something else.This game is basically a detective story in 3rd person where you hunt for clues to piece together the bell killer murders and find out who the murderer is.The main part of the ""game"" part of this game, is annoying little demon sections where you have to go up behind a demon and exorcise them, these have really crappy AI and mostly just detract from the story (the main reason to play this kind of game), looking a little too low? these demons won't register, will turn around and notice you, and you will have to hide from them till they get bored and go back to doing their rounds, and this element just feels added for the sake of actual gameplay (even though the story does technically cover it, it's a really loose connection.As for the Actual main story, while part of it is obvious, the true answer is basically a massive cop out, and as this is spoiler free i won't actually be able to say why, but once you have played this game, you will be dissapointed by the ending.Other then this, it's basically a fetch quest where you look for clues and work out which few are actually even relevant (each section requires no more then 4 clues to do any one part, and you can then move on) and it mostly just becomes find the relevant spot and look at it.I finished this game in about 6 Hours (although steam doesn't seemed to have registered my play time properly) and was rather disappointed, i'm glad i bought this through a humble bundle, as i didn't end up paying the $20 price tag, which realistically is asking a bit much for something like this.Without all the filler stuff this could easily be a 2 hour game but you spend most of your time walking around and playing hide and seek with demons.

												MURDERED has a cool concept and plot: You have been murdered and trying to solve your own murder as a ghost. What is not cool, however, is how repetitive and confusing this game can get.The game is a glorified movie with a few cuts of brain-dead gameplay here or there. Your objective will tell you to go to a location. Then you will use to stealth to kill some demons, then you will pickup all the clues to solve a few ""questions"" which lead you to another location. Rinse and repeat a few times.The crux of the game should be solving hard puzzles, but most puzzles are just wandering around a small room and mashing 'E' on everything to 'reveal' it. Then you have unlimited tries to put the 'clues' together (there is NO penalty for guessing wrong, not even a special perfect ending). Additionally, the demon fighting game play is ridiculously easy. I realized half-way through that you could actually run past every demon without fighting them. In other words, there is no challenge.One final thing I didn't like: No mini-map in-game. It turns out you only could get a mini-map if you PREORDERED the game (for something so core you would think it would just come with the game). If you are a completionist this makes collecting everything a living hell. Every wall in the town looks the same. And some collectibles don't appear unless you go along all the walls and mash a button (in other words, this is near-impossible without a guide).			"

												This is easily the best game i've ever played! Granted, i am a strickly point and click gamer where there is a distinct beginning and end, and crime stories are definitely my favorite, but with that said, i have never played a game so incredibly clean and well-written. There was only one glitch that i ran into, and it didn't keep me from completing the game. It had to do with a side story, and although i usually like to be thorough in the games i play, i let it go and moved on (i had no choice unless i wanted to start over, which i definitely didn't want to do because i was well into the game). The graphics were amazing, the voiceover fantastic, and the story was intriguing and kept me interested to the very end. And to top it off, the ending surprised me.

												I've had this game in my library for like 3 years now and I haven't bothered to even install it once. Recently I figured that I would play it because I had nothing else better to do and I had seen a few short gameplay videos. It's a game by Square Enix, one of my favourite publishers and it's got moderately good graphics so I'm able to play it Ultra and in 4K resolution.Firstly the premise seems cool enough, but also pretty simple. You play a detective who's been killed and you have to find out who killed you. No problem there, as I always like a good 'whodunnit' story.The problem is everything else except the story.CONTROLS - The controls are so annoying to use. I had to turn the sensitivity down so low to avoid the camera spinning around like a tornado. You also walk so slowly, and are forced to constantly hold run 100% of the time if you even want to get anywhere within a reasonable timeframe; having to always hold shift also made my pinky get sore fast. All of these things make the game quickly feel very cumbersome to play and my patience really started to wear thin...GAMEPLAY - There's no 'crosshair' but you have to perfectly directly face an object so it is in the middle of your screen in order to interact with it. Due to being a ghost, you can walk through many solid looking objects which is cool until you realise that there is also no kind of map in the game at all. Paths are constantly 'hidden' bethind objects that you have to walk through, and it's very hard to remember where something is. If you missed something way back at the start of the area, you can go back provided you can find your way through the confusing and very narrow/linear path from one area to another. The game is also filled with pointless empty alleyways and dead-ends that I really could not understand at all why the developers didn't bother to make any sort of map. It would have made navigation so much easier. Finding clues and collectables in Murdered: Soul Suspect is a huge part of the game, but sadly it's very hard to spot some mission related clues do to the objects being absolutely tiny, and/or partially hidden.ENEMIES - There aren't really any except for these 'demons' that lurk around some areas of the game, and 'traps' that just force you to find a way around them. Demons are more of an annoyance than a challenge. Simply hide behind a wall or in a 'safe zone' until they come close enough, then when their back is turned press the right combination to kill them. The combinations are a total pain as you have to keep holding the 'R' button AND then press 2 other buttons at the same time which are often very close to the 'R' button. Getting it wrong means wasting a few minutes whilst the Demon chases you or looks for you. They're incredibly easy to kill as you can spot them through walls and there's often plenty of places to hide. Honestly I found them a pointless addition to the game and just something obviously added to try and increase the overall length of a playthrough.STORY - The story is good enough I guess. Some of the side missions seem stupid and some of the murder/death mysteries are quite boring really. I found it kind of hard to care about a few of the NPCs but at the same time I guess a couple of them were interesting enough. The main story seems interesting enough so far and so long as it's about the same length as 'The Wolf Among Us' I will be pretty happy. I still prefer TWAU's gameplay and smoothness to this game's by far.GRAPHICS - Not much bad to say here as graphics are pretty top notch. The game looks really nice in 4K, although I found that some of the floating papers got a bit distracting as I often mistook them for clues that I could interact with. Also the game is capped at 30FPS if you enable Vertical Sync which made it feel really, really choppy for me. A huge part of the game are also pre-rendered cutscenes which are also all capped to 30fps. So if you end up playing in 60+ FPS normally and then move to a cutscene you can end up getting eye fatigure and a general nagging feeling as the game changes framerates constantly. Finally I thought that it was kind of annoying that a lot of the NPCs don't have proper lip movements when they are speaking. This is something that Square Enix usually does really well, but in this game a lot of NPCs just stand there going through their limited behaviour animations with their mouths closed but they are still speaking.ABILITIES - These are actually pretty boring and feel really lackluster. The first ability you get is to be able to possess people in order to read their minds or try and jog a memory that helps uncover part of the story. Murdered: Soul Suspect has a lot of NPCs in some areas, and using the mind-reading ability shows really how little thought was put into the game. ALL NPCs only have TWO possible dialogues that can be uncovered through reading their minds. Specific NPCs have specific and more 'unique' dialogues however NPCs that do nothing except to just 'populate' the game world almost always all have the same ""I don't feel safe here"" etc. responses. It's really boring. As for the other features like Reveal, this is just used to uncover small side stories and Teleport is only used to get into 'consecrated' areas that would normally be off-limits.There's not much else to talk about but all in all I wouldn't recommend the game. The graphics are good and the story is interesting enough but the game quickly becomes a total pain to play. My fingers get sore, my patience runs thin and even the uniqueness of the game and the lingering mystery to uncover doesn't hold my attention for more than a few short hours at a time. More than anything I can't help but feel that a few changes or extra small additions to the game would have yielded a much smoother experience. Things such as a small map, faster walking and running, and increased amount of dialogue in the game would have added a lot of value.			"

Finding clues and collectables in Murdered: Soul Suspect is a huge part of the game, but sadly it's very hard to spot some mission related clues do to the objects being absolutely tiny, and/or partially hidden.ENEMIES - There aren't really any except for these 'demons' that lurk around some areas of the game, and 'traps' that just force you to find a way around them. Demons are more of an annoyance than a challenge. Simply hide behind a wall or in a 'safe zone' until they come close enough, then when their back is turned press the right combination to kill them. The combinations are a total pain as you have to keep holding the 'R' button AND then press 2 other buttons at the same time which are often very close to the 'R' button. Getting it wrong means wasting a few minutes whilst the Demon chases you or looks for you. They're incredibly easy to kill as you can spot them through walls and there's often plenty of places to hide. Honestly I found them a pointless addition to the game and just something obviously added to try and increase the overall length of a playthrough.STORY - The story is good enough I guess. Some of the side missions seem stupid and some of the murder/death mysteries are quite boring really. I found it kind of hard to care about a few of the NPCs but at the same time I guess a couple of them were interesting enough. The main story seems interesting enough so far and so long as it's about the same length as 'The Wolf Among Us' I will be pretty happy. I still prefer TWAU's gameplay and smoothness to this game's by far.GRAPHICS - Not much bad to say here as graphics are pretty top notch. The game looks really nice in 4K, although I found that some of the floating papers got a bit distracting as I often mistook them for clues that I could interact with. Also the game is capped at 30FPS if you enable Vertical Sync which made it feel really, really choppy for me. A huge part of the game are also pre-rendered cutscenes which are also all capped to 30fps. So if you end up playing in 60+ FPS normally and then move to a cutscene you can end up getting eye fatigure and a general nagging feeling as the game changes framerates constantly. Finally I thought that it was kind of annoying that a lot of the NPCs don't have proper lip movements when they are speaking. This is something that Square Enix usually does really well, but in this game a lot of NPCs just stand there going through their limited behaviour animations with their mouths closed but they are still speaking.ABILITIES - These are actually pretty boring and feel really lackluster. The first ability you get is to be able to possess people in order to read their minds or try and jog a memory that helps uncover part of the story. Murdered: Soul Suspect has a lot of NPCs in some areas, and using the mind-reading ability shows really how little thought was put into the game. ALL NPCs only have TWO possible dialogues that can be uncovered through reading their minds. Specific NPCs have specific and more 'unique' dialogues however NPCs that do nothing except to just 'populate' the game world almost always all have the same ""I don't feel safe here"" etc. responses. It's really boring. As for the other features like Reveal, this is just used to uncover small side stories and Teleport is only used to get into 'consecrated' areas that would normally be off-limits.There's not much else to talk about but all in all I wouldn't recommend the game. The graphics are good and the story is interesting enough but the game quickly becomes a total pain to play. My fingers get sore, my patience runs thin and even the uniqueness of the game and the lingering mystery to uncover doesn't hold my attention for more than a few short hours at a time. More than anything I can't help but feel that a few changes or extra small additions to the game would have yielded a much smoother experience. Things such as a small map, faster walking and running, and increased amount of dialogue in the game would have added a lot of value.			"

												A lot of the games that I rate ""thumbs down"" are just mediocre and still have redeeming qualities. This game, on the other hand, is literally the worst game I've ever played. Took me just over 5 hours to finish it and it overstayed its welcome.The story is actually OK - not great, but a decent B-horror-movie tale. It does have a pretty good red herring followed by a nice twist at the end. However, one aspect of the villain's identity is very clearly telegraphed. The plot is pretty simple - you're a homicide detected who is killed by the serial killer you're hunting. Now relegated to ghost form, you try to track down the killer.The gameplay, however, is abysmally weak. Gameplay has two phases - investigations and stealth. Investigations involve peeking into people's minds and observing supernatural objects. Stealth involves avoiding demons and helping your (live) AI companion sneak into locations by creating distractions. The basic problem with both is that they are essentially hidden object games - all you need to do to progress is to find the correct button to press. The game never gets any more complicated than this. There are a few sections where you have to do things with correct timing, but they're very easy. In reality, you spend the entire game walking around and clicking on things. Occasionally, you will be asked to identify the ""relevant"" clues out of a crime scene with numerous clues scattered about. If you pick incorrectly, you're just told you were wrong and given the chance to try again. So that means that your ""investigations"" can be beaten by simply picking clues at random until you get them right. That means this so-called ""mystery"" game has no actual mystery to it. What's the fun in a detective game where you aren't allowed to be misled? Calling this a mystery game at all is misleading - it's a glorified walking simulator. You couldn't possibly make a mistake. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has far more actual mystery than this.The game is so brainless and holds your hand so much that at times I felt like I was playing one of the simple educational games you find on Steam, like ""The Deer."" It's dumbed-down to the point of utter boredom, start to finish.Technically, I guess it's fine, runs fine and looks decent for a last-gen console title. Controls are OK with both M+KB and with controller, which is to be expected when the game has such a limited amount of interaction.The only reason I played this to completion was because I didn't want to feel like I wasted my money. That makes me a sucker. Don't be a sucker like me. Avoid this game. "

												It isn't that this game didn't have great elements - it did - but rather that they came together so poorly. Really, there was the making of a great game here, they just needed to write it better. I suppose the main reason I am giving it a 'no' is because of how bad this game is in comparison to the game it could've been, rather than judging the game on its own merits. It was disjointed, obvious and completely cliche; even while it had inventive and interesting game mechanics.			"

												If somebody asked me to describe Murdered: Soul Suspect in one word, I would say: Unfinished.It's evident from the start that this game was rushed out the door too early in order to meet a deadline. Many things that you'd expect from a modern, full-priced AAA game are not present here. I knew something was up even before I jumped into the actual game. The menu was just a static image. There were no flashy effects when you highlighted any of the options. No bells and whistles whatsoever. Of course, none of that is actually necessary, but it is odd to see a big-budget game cut corners like that.Unfortunately, this was just the tip of the iceberg.After the game's opening cutscene, you're immediately tasked with investigating a crime scene. Games like Ace Attorney and L.A. Noire have already demonstrated excellent examples of how to simulate actual detective work, so it's pretty baffling to me that Murdered: Soul Suspect would take the most basic, and un-intuitive route possible. You point. You click. You win.There's almost zero deductive reasoning involved in investigating these crime scenes. Gathering evidence presents no challenge, since the ""clues"" are ridiculously easy to spot in the environment. It's depressing that the biggest problem I ran into when solving the mystery behind these crime scenes was my tendency to overthink them. Turns out, the most obvious solution is ALWAYS the right one. Once you figure that out, the rest of the game is a cakewalk. So what else is there? Well, your ghostly character can possess people. This is a great idea on paper, but your enthusiasm will quickly wane once you realize that you can't actually control your posessee's. However, you can read their minds. Better than nothing, I suppose, but you'll be in for a rude awakening once you find that NPCs in the town only have a handful of phrases to recite, none of which are actually relevant to the investigation at hand. What could've been an excellent and inventive way to acquire information about the details of your case is squandered by the complete ineptitude of the developers. Soul Suspect isn't entirely without merit though. The story held my attention for the duration of the game, and even though the characters are archetypes that we've already seen before from the detective/mystery genre, it still managed to be a moderately intriguing tale. The pay-off is also decent, with a twist ending that even M. Night Shyamalan would be proud of.What saddens me the most is that Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very solid idea, and it could've easily been a great game with a little more TLC. It's painful to see a game with this much wasted potential. I liked the ideas here, but the execution left a lot to be desired. I'd love to see a sequel to this game where these ideas are more expanded upon, but as it stands, Murdered: Soul Suspect is half-baked, and it shows. "

I see a lot of idiots misread the genre and poured out their virginity in a form of a negative bs, learn to read, ffs. It's action adventure!There are no puzzles in traditional point-and-click sense. It's mostly about gathering stuff and making some obvious choices.Nice graphics, not top of the line but very nice.Had no issues with controls whatsoever. It is THE MOST standard keyboard layout for modern games (for a right handed people that is).The plot has a few holes in it but otherwise is pretty solid and engaging with a twist at the end.And not a single bug through the whole game. That's a rarity these days.So I just have no idea what those kids with their negative reviews are whining about.The game is good and it's well worth the price.			"

It functions much like one and the only reason it wouldn't work in the point n click format is the Demons sequences, which functioned for me a a quick jumpscare (that noise they make on spawn..) and then to slow my progress moving around. Moving the plot along feels very linear and I didnt feel any real motivation to deviate from the main plot. The detective sequences were also very simple, I wasn't challanged by any of the puzzles throughout.Again, great for point n click fans! Not so much for anyone else though.			"

												The graphics are beautiful, and the story seems interesting. Too bad the game has clearly been developed for a console, and so the game play is severely limited: you can't save the game freely, there's no map, and it's very easy to crap out side quests, because due to inadvertent advancements in the main plot you're incapable of getting back to the earlier game zone. This is really annoying, because due to the save/load limitation you can't go back.Another thing is the demons and traps in the game. Again, this seems to me more like an action console game, not a mystery adventure detective game.. Which might be OK with you, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect was surpsingly enjoyable game, despite it being very game-y (which is somehow odd to see in era of AAA MOVIE-LIKE BLOCKBUSTERGAEMS).Sure, it didnt have the most amazing new mechanics, but I kinda liked it. It has its problems and I can see why some could give it 80 or 70.´""Problems"" include things like: linear levels and narrow corridors, the animation is bit clunky and there is random stuff blocking your way without trying to ""hide it"" at all. Its really obvious that ghostwall (get it, hur?) is up there to block you. NOTE: when you finish the game there is no ""go back to get last achievements!"" thing. Once you get into ""last room"", you gotta start all over again if you missed achievements/sidequests.It aint AAA game by todays standards. If this was released early at PS3 or late PS2-era, it would fit right in. Now its slightly feeling like indie studio who is trying to get into deep story with still bit of clunkiness on the gameplay and design part.The story is a bit predictable at points, does have nice plot twist. But overall it was fairly enjoyable.But..you actually feel like playing A GAME.For me this is actually refreshing. It doesnt try to hide it I guess.

												MSS is pretty much a PNC adventure game masquerading as a modern cinematic AAA game (which I don't find any better, by the way).  While the game has merit for any adventure game fan, know that the story falls apart and I doubt anyone will be satisfied with it.  So with such a major hook of pnc games not really delivering, what are you left with?At its heart, MSS is your typical textbook modern game design, except the main character doesn't carry a gun and you don't run around shooting at pop-up targets.  Instead, you are tasked with investigating your own death, complete with spritely sidekick and canned TWEEST.  This in itself isn't bad as mysteries often need to have at least some sort of turning point and well, being dead kind of demands you have a real-world sidekick to help you out.However, being of modern game design, MSS falls into the trap of checklist design; that is to say, it takes no risks and does pretty much everything by the book.  Exploration?  Check.  Voice actors?  Check.  Cinematics?  Check.  Hidden objects?  Check.  Progessive ability unlocking?  Check, check, check.  None of this bad, really; just saying it brings nothing new to the table.  The worst offender is the checkbox for action - because why would anyone play a game without action in it, right?  Pfft.  From time to time you will be forced to deal with a completely useless and forced section where you sneak around bad guys and try to get rid of 'em (or circumvent them entirely once you're tired of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ because someone in development land has decided that under no circumstance should a game of this type be without an action sequence; problem is, it's stupid and provides nothing to the game other than padding and, of course, a checkbox.  Similarly, you'll be tasked several times to arbitrarily click on multiple clues to proceed through the game and it gets old fast - at least it's thematically sound what with the main character being a detective.  Whatever.Anyways, as far as fans of PNC games goes, this one isn't that bad.  The game has a runtime of approximately 8 hours, maybe 6.5 if you don't bother looking for all the hidden stuff (which is also pointless, but allows you to do some checklisting yourself).  I wouldn't recommend getting this at full price in any shape or form, but if you get a decent deal on it, say... $10 just to cover some of the production value, then why not give it a run-through?  It's kind of like watching the latest sci-fi space opera film just because you don't often see them being made and not because it's actually really good.  MSS is just a decent effort.tl;dr: Adventure game fans may enjoy this game on theme alone, but anyone looking for a meaty game experience will find that this offering is leaner than that girl you used to know whose bones could be counted individually when she had her shirt off.  So this remains a (meh) thumbs-up for adventure game fans, but a thumbs-down for anyone else.			"

												A fantastic idea yes. Does this make a fantastic game? nope. Not even close. How the managed to make something as awesom as this boring is beyond me. Giving us awesome ghost powers then limiting them. All the enemies are slowly moving around and easily destroyed with some boring steath sections. There is alot of emty areas so i guess the game was hurried to the shelf. Now the game only feels like slow transportation between rather dull story scenes. And after sitting through this borefeast, they even put up an unskippable text wall at the end. Jolly good times.			"

												I was actually enjoying this game until I encountered a game-breaking glitch near the end of Chapter 2. What I assume I was supposed to do was use my poltergeist ability on the vacuum to get the priest to walk over the vortex thingy on the floor so I could possess him and safely cross to the other side of the hallway.As it turns out, the priest decided to be a bishop, in the sense that he only moved diagonally. He crossed over and clipped into the wall opposite the vacuum cleaner, and when I possessed him he moved diagonally across the vortex, clipped into another wall, and walked in a courtyard where I could not unpossess him.I tried restarting the checkpoint. I tried letting the priest make a single trip and then using poltergeist on the vacuum a second time before possessing him. I tried starting the game over from the beginning. I tried reinstalling the game. I even tried starting the game from the beginning AFTER reinstalling, but nothing worked.So I checked Google for answers, but couldn't find any solutions. That's when I gave up. Even if there is a solution, I refuse to sit through the same unskippable cutscenes for a fourth time in the hopes that maybe I'll be able to get past the second chapter.If you're thinking of buying this game, don't. There's an old flash game on Newgrounds called ""The Dead Case"", which is similar yet vastly superior despite being from 2004. Not only is it free, but it actually functions like it's supposed to.

												This is my first review, so I'll try to keep it simple.This game is aggressively mediocre. For a puzzle game, the puzzles are never very engaging, but then again, not a lot of puzzles can be done if the main character can't touch things. Every brain teaser is either 'pick the obvious clue' or 'pick the obvious series of clues'. Sometimes you have to do them in the right order, wow.The combat/stealth is practically non-existant. Occasionally demons will jump out accompanied with the sound a piano might make if it were thrown through a window. It shocked me the first time it happened, then never again. You disable them by running up behind them and doing a simple qte. This is made incredibly easy since they cannot see through walls. You, on the other hand, can both see and walk through walls. Dissapointing.Oh, and the many hiding spots in the overworld kept me constantly wondering if I might get jumped at one point. Never happened. Why even have them there?The story itself is okay, but it suffers from the protagonist having never even heard of withces before, and he's lived all his damn life in Salem, of all places. Sometimes there are no excuses. And the ending, oh god, the ending was a major dissapointment. It lasted all of 5 minutes and most of that was cutscenes. That said, I really enjoyed all the interactions between characters. All the ghosts are kind of one note characters, but the humans were kind of special to me. The way they reacted to your death and subsecuent actions made them seem more real and alive then most other characters I can recall offhand. They all mourn and act in their own way and even though this is not a big game, I can't say that there are any living characters that I disliked.Ending... uh. Rent it, I guess? At least wait untill it goes down in price. A 10 hour game does not deserve a 40$ price tag. Definitely get it if you really, really like collecting stuff.			"

												Even though this game is just a 3D point and click, it really is a great game. The story is intriguing and I enjoyed myself the entire time. As far as replayibility value, there is little to none. However, I got this game as part of a Square Enix mystery box for 10 dollars. I would have definilty paid 10 dollars for just this game alone, and I recomend if it is on sale to snatch it up!			"

												I really liked this game. When i started playing i had no expectations and i didn't even know how the gameplay worked. So i was plesantly surprised to experience a good game with a solid story, lots of stuff to find in the town and i really enjoyed finding things from Ronan and Julia's life. The controls were a little annoying at times, and the music repetative after a while, but none of those things had any big impact on the game. The graphics and the overall atmoshere was plesantly creepy at times, but of cause this was mostly because of creepy sounds. The story wasn't complicated but it was still enjoyable, and all of the sidestories from finding collectibles were also really good. My personal favorite was the one from the asylum. All in all i really enjoyed it and it only took 11 hours to finish (and i found all collectibles but the wall graphiti and the ones in the museum).			"

												Best Part: You possess a cat.Worst Part: Combat and QTE.I was really expecting this game to be good, and I tried to enjoy it. I recently finished it (6 hours with 77% of achievements unlocked) and I only recommend if you really want to play for the theme.Note: UI is terrible, play with a controller if you have one. Pressing 1/3 and Q/E to change tabs is a no-no and shows that it's a port.First off, you don't really do any detective work, I often got the answers to detective questions wrong because I was over thinking and in the end, I sometimes tried multiple times until I got it right.The town is simply dull, some NPCs keep walking in the same path, really killing the atmosphere, they also have only two lines of dialogue, which are boring. Since there's no map/minimap, there was one time that I got lost and had to keep running all over the place trying to find my way. The barriers they added to limit the scope of the game are horrible, making the game feel more linear than it should have.Also, the combat is simply terrible, you can see they added this part only to make the game lengthier because it's not fun at all. The QTE buttons keep changing, making you sometimes fail and get annoyed.			"

												Pros:- Nice environment and atmosphereCons:- Very short. Feels like a DLC of a bigger game that wasn't released yet.- Closed map, not much to do besides the actual main missions.- Only one kind of enemy, the demons, and that's it.- Repetitive gameplay, you do the same stuff over and over again.- This cannot be compared to other investigative games, like L.A. Noir. It's not that good. We have a game with lots of potential, but it feels like the writers got lazy and ended it very quickly.I do not recommend this game at full price. Buy it, with caution, on steam sale.  "

												Paulliee TV ReviewMURDERED : SOUL SUSPECT, Is a Under rated game IMO, it has unique features and has a interesting fun story that involes you being a detective yet a ghost so of course it has investigations mechanics which is quite enjoyable, The downside to this game that stops it being a Awesome game instead of a Good game is the fact it is short maybe about 5-8 hours in length and at times the gameplay and story can be a bit meh, But most games have meh moments but due to the fact this game is short and the combat is quite repetitive and lacking i would have to ultimately say this game is a 7/10 game and a good game and worth a buyBut don't expect a GOTY + Good story+ Fun Investigation mechanics+ Filler content I.E Collecting stuff+ Voice acting --------------- Short- Poor combat- Linear

												There's a reason this game gets so many bad reviews.  It's not that it's necessarily a bad product, but it's a bad GAME.  Virtually all of the gameplay elements serve to do nothing but force interactivity; they don't really add anything substantial to the product.  There are little forced ""stealth"" segments, some elements of old school pixel-hunting games, a very Vampire Bloodlines-feeling ""open world"" hub section, etc.But, ultimately, I don't think they add anything to the product, and in most cases actually detract from it.  The plot isn't going to win any awards, but it's competent.  The voice actors are all at worst competent, the art direction is fine, and the setting is kind of fun if you like the supernatural stuff.The problem is that this could've been a movie for all the significance of the actual interactive parts have.  That's why I keep referring to it as a product, and not a game.  Because I don't feel like Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game for the same reasons I don't think Gone Home is a game.  Or, rather, because I feel like Murdered is cramming in a bunch of random gameplay elements to make us BELIEVE it's a game... when it's really not.I would never, ever recommend paying anywhere near full price for this product, but if you can get it for a few bucks on a Steam sale or in a Humble Bundle like I did, it's a decent enough way of using five or six hours of your time.

												I can't really recommend this one, as its a cutscene point and click adventure that isn't point and click with ""action"" that isn't action (sneak up behind something and press R).  The main plot is okay, but it would be much more enjoyable if you didn't have to stop and pick up the collectionables along the way.  Some places you can't re-enter, so waiting until the end (pre-finale) won't work.  There is also the not-too-hot save system, which is autosave after picking up a collectable or at a checkpoint in the main plot - side quests don't create an autosave.  There also isn't an exit save.  I'd give this a 5/10, if bought cheap.			"

In the end if you like crime solving games with a splash of supernatural... this game is well worth it.

												To be honest, I picked up this game during one of its deep sales, and still wasn't sure what to expect. Though after seeing ""Square-Enix"", I had some clue. (Those guys are the kings of cutscenes, after all.)That aside, it's hard to classify this game as much of an action game. It's defeinitely more of a casual one than anything else, and not that long of a game, either. I guess one could also think of it as a kind of roaming adventure game with a few side missions, plenty of collectibles, and plenty of 'Press X to Not Die' moments.The investigations in the game involve searching for clues, some of them obtained from thinking a little bit out of the box. Though personally, I'm surprised that weren't any 'match-3' or 'hidden object' puzzles in here. Maybe I'm a bit jaded in that respect. Really not all that hard to deal with.As far as action scenes, there aren't that many, and they're generally limited to Quick Time Events with maybe a little bit of strategy involved. Outside of that, there really isn't much that can kill you. Again.All in all, it was worth the discount price, though. Square-Enix can weave a decent tale, and the storytelling here was pretty decent, and not quite that predictable. Biggest faults, though, were that the game was too short, and the action rather limited in scope. "

												Interesting story but the game is unplayable on mouse and keyboard. First I had to MANUALLY change my mouse sensitivity in the config file because the lowest ingame setting was still too high. And then not only does my game keep getting completely stuck in the clues menu, it got stuck when I encountered the first demon. I don't want to tolerate such massive bugs throughout the entire game and repeat a lot of the gameplay when they happen because the save system is crap as well. Apparently the developers don't care about fixing any of these controls bugs so I can't recommend this game to anyone. For what it's worth my brother also got the game and finished it on a controller without any issues whatsoever. Yet another piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥console port.			"

												Not a bad game... Thought I feel like this could have been a much superior experience with a little more effort... The core concepts definitely work, and the interaction between a living character and a ghost make for interesting gameplay situations... The game's key failing is in its actual interaction during investigations - you essentially look at things, and click on them, with very occasional sections where you select the most likely explanation of a given situation. This is woefully inadequate for a game that is supposedly about solving the mystery of your own death. I'd confidently state that this is pretty much a zero-difficulty game with no significant challenge except that of avoiding the irritating demons.The game has decent voice acting, yet some pretty ropey cutscenes, interesting ideas and systems, but inadequate use of them, a dreadful cut & paste soundtrack, but reasonable sound design. It could have been better, but that said, this game is still worth your time, so long as you don't buy it full price.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect sees you take on the role of Ronan O’Connor, a felon turned detective. Roman is tasked with solving one of the most complex murders that he has come across… His! Yes, that’s right, the game starts as Ronan is killed by someone known only as ‘The Bell Killer’. I’m not going to spoil the story for you lovely people who are interested in buying it, but will stress that the story is enjoyable. Look out for Joy, who gets to become an accomplice of Ronan’s throughout the story. Their relationship is well scripted by the developers and really flourishes throughout the game as they help each other solve a mystery or two. I must say that when i thought i know who the killer is, I was genuinely surprised.Usually being dead in a game is not a state you want to be in. However, Murdered: Soul Suspect turns that statement completely on its head, giving you several advantages and powers. It’s fair to say that Roman is a better detective dead than he was alive LOL Well, I must say that I missed a game with a good and catchy story. And oh, we can possess cats!			"

												Murdered Soul Suspect is a game with a spiffing idea and concept but there are rather a few problems. The gameplay in general is wonderful and something I have certainly not seen before in a game. But it's about as easy as putting the kettle on, and apart from a few pesky demons who are out to spill your beloved Earl Grey, there isn't much of a threat or feeling that you will lose, but this may have been a challenge to pull off since you are dead already! The detective side of it all is similar to the wonderful game L.A. Noire but in Murdered: Soul Suspect there isn't as much of a challenge, as you will eventually solve the cases whether you muck it up or not. Having said this I believe it's rather worth a go anyway, as it is jolly good fun! The main story is very well thought out and the whole idea of it is entirely new and I tip my hat off to it for that very reason. I would also say that if the opportunity arises a sequel would be well worth a shot as they could improve on these hiccups and make a spiffing game! All in all I give this 3 and a half cups of tea out of 5 for it's originality, story and the rather spiffing attempt at bringing us something a little different. Tally-Ho!			"

The partership between Ronan and Joy was very Sweet cause they needed each other to do thing's the other couldn't do. Now down to business Murdered: Soul Suspect is a 10 out of 10 and I hope to see more game's like this from Square Enix, I do recommend this game and I hope it will get a sequel.			"

												I Pre-Ordered this game and was worried when I started to read reviews. I installed it Friday and decided to fire it up last night and see if it was as bad as I've read. Let me tell you that ""professional"" reviews don't know what they are talking about, some franchasies with annual releases continue to get 80-90% every year for the same game. New games with new ideas often get trashed.My initial trail was intended to be to check the opening scenes, I found myself getting pulled in and played for more than 3 hours straight. I can't wait to continue this game. They premise and story is very cool so far, the main character is well acted and the other actors are ok too. I can really see this game being a cult classic if it continues to be as good as the first few hours. It isn't perfect, there are some cheesy or wierd things. The possession stuff, especially the cats is very chessy and seems to be a step down in quality from the rest of the game. The side quests seem cool but usually are unrewarding, I find myself collecting all the items and I enjoy the spoken story at the end but the static picture feels cheap and it would have been awesome to have some animated stories, even animated comic frames would have been a huge increase. The jump to pre-renedered cutscenes isn't terrible but can be a bit jarring, it would have been nice to see it renedered in game since it does appear to use the game engine but the subtitles are a bit blurry becuase it appears it may have been recorded in a lower resolution like 720P.This reminds me of older point and click adventure games where you have to find clues but uses a modern 3D engine and it works pretty well. The game also looks pretty good, and runs well. I can easily max the game out at 1600P with no problem on my computer.I don't think I have ever written a Steam review but I had to for this under rated gem. The game so far is a solid 7.5/10 for me, it seems interesting and overall pretty fun. I've been getting bored with the same old games recently and it is nice to see a different take. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game, I think a lot of people would like it and I think the review scores are misleading.			"

												This a a really prity game. The story is well written and the characters are believable although more background about them would have been good. The game play is really good with either Keyboard or controller. With surround sound it definitely creates a spooky atmosphere. The one down side of this game is that it is a bit short at around 10 to 13 hrs game play. 9/10			"

												Loving the game so far, taking up most of my spare time the past few days so thats always a good sign!There's a lot to discover when you include the side quests and hidden clues.... not sure whether that's quite so good as my OCD kicks in and makes me want to explore everywhere.The ability to walk through walls etc can be a little disorientating, to me at least.... I naturally was looking for doorways or openings which I didn't actually need! It can make you lose track of where you are on the map, if you aren't careful.This isn't a shooter, most of the time you are tracking down clues or witnesses to help solve the case(s) but, to me at least, that makes a change as I've often stuck to the ""shoot your way outta here"" type games.I have an old system but this still runs smoothly and not had any dropout or issues.... not even any noticable loadtime issues during play.

												Metascore 60... well F*** metascore =)All the time I've spent on the game, was done discovering Salem's stories and Ronans own story as well, this game is amazing, from some scenes, by looking at them with attention I've even felt sort of sick to my stomach (or it could've been that burrito and cookies I ate too, but I'd say it was the game)L.A Noir should've had something like a ghost wandering a city discovering it's dirty secrets and it's hidden past, GOTY for all years.The detective take to the game is great and well done, also Ronan himself is pretty well done as a character from the ground up, all in all this game really draws you in. The best is that it can be a short game (if you just follow the story itself) or a long game (if you decide to uncover every little thing)Enjoy it!			"

												MSS is a very entertaining detective story, but very very short (4 to 8 hours). So you should buy it if the price is falling to 19,99 $. The concept of possessing people, eavesdrop their conversation and their thoughts is well made. It is more or less railroading, but you can walk freely through Salem, solve sidequests and find collectibles. There are many little ideas like possessing cats to avoid demons and find hard to get collectibles or teleport Dishonored-style. The demons are very annoying, but easy to defeat or to avoid. No variety, no intelligent. wandering from point a to point b.If you want an entertaining short detective b-movie you should play it.			"

												Rich story, great graphic(realistic but little plastic), good audio. Its typical interactive movie game. You enjoy it more by experiencing story than challangeing with enemies.I bought this game for myself but after intro my girfriend grab gamepad and spend with game 4h. I was only called to kill demons while she is not gammer so those elements are too hard for her. Defenetly great game for not only gammers.On my msi gt70-0nd game runs smooth on medium settings ( i5, gtx675m, 12gb ram, ssd) just dont forget to turn off vsync.I really recomand to play on big tv with gamepad - game is like movie.

Posted: June 9, 2014
												My review of Murdered: Soul Suspect:ATTENTION: This review is long, so you can just skip to the conclusion if you'd like.I always liked supernatural fiction.That's why I took an interest in Murdered: Soul Suspect when it was first shown, back in 2013.First of all, I have to say that this game is unique.Where else can you find a detective game where the main protagonist is a ghost? Answer: You can't.Murdered: Soul Suspect is more than just a detective game.It's a story about Ronan O'Connor, a detective that was killed at the beginning of the game during an investigation, and became a ghost.Now, as a ghost, he has to find his killer in order to finish his unfinished business in this world, and be at peace with himself so he can go on to the next world and be with his dead wife, Julia, once again.The killer is called ""The Bell Killer"", a serial killer that roams the streets of the town Salem.The killer was searching for something in an apartment building when Ronan interrupted him and wanted to make an arrest, until the killer overpowered him and threw him out the window, badly injuring Ronan. Ronan becomes a half ghost as he's about to die, and when he wants to get back to his body, the killer shoots him several times, thereby killing him.Ronan became a full ghost immediately after. Later, Ronan meets Joy, a medium who's looking for her missing mother.She helps Ronan find the killer because her mother is possibly connected to the killer in a way, and by finding him, they will possibly find her too, so they help each other.The story is an excellent detective story, with great characters that are well voice acted, but it's really short. It only took me about 6-7 hours to complete, which is not enough.So, after you die, you immediately jump into the ghost-detective action.Since you're a ghost, you can't physically touch anything, which could be a problem when you want to investigate further, but as a ghost, you can do certain things you wouldn't be able to do as a human, such as possessing people and eavesdropping on their conversation, or influencing witnesses into remembering what happened at the crime scene. You can analyze evidence which will give you more clues about the case as well. Ronan also has the ability to see the memories of victims through their ghost residue, which helps him see exactly what happened at the crime scene. All of these will help you solve cases, and it's executed pretty well in the game.On the other hand, the choices you make as a detective are meaningless, since you will eventually make the right choice no matter what, and there is no grading and EXP system to motivate you to do your best. It's really disappointing.As for the town of Salem, Massachusetts, it's a really, really small town. It's so small that it kind of makes it hard to believe that there's actually a serial killer in this town. Also, the game gives you the feeling of a semi-open world game, which in reality, there's so little to do in Salem when you're not playing through the main missions.The only side quests in the game involve helping other ghosts finish their unfinished business, which means finding the truth about their deaths. It’s pretty neat. Aside from that, there are a ton of collectibles scattered around for you to find, and if you collect enough of them, you will know more about the people that lived in Salem in the past.There's also a side case for Ronan's life with Julia, which tells a lot about Ronan's past.Lastly, there is a side case which includes special collectibles that are hidden in the main areas of the game, which, if you collect all of them, will uncover stories about ghosts that are haunting those places, and also each place has its own collectibles that tell you about the history of the place, but, that's about it for the side content.By the way, you can also possess a cat which will get you get to certain places you can't normally reach, which is pretty cool.One thing I didn't like in the game was the demon encounters.Demons, as the game explained, are lost souls that stayed in this world, and they're the only enemy you'll ever encounter in the game. They can only be killed stealthily by executing them from behind, and if they see you, they will chase you. The only thing you can do in this situation is hide from them in ghost residues. They will come looking for you in them, so you have to switch between one residue to another in order to avoid them, until they will eventually stop looking for you.Sounds exciting? I didn't think so. It's utterly boring, and I would prefer if it wasn't in the game at all.Luckily, there are only a few demon encounters in the whole game.When you play through the game, you are accompanied by a creepy, intense soundtrack, like one from a horror movie when there's a scary scene. It's fantastic, and it immerses you into the dark and gritty atmosphere, and the great number of ghosts haunting the town makes it even more immersive.Speaking of atmosphere, the visuals in the game are fantastic. Textures are great, although I did encounter a few texture pop-ins when playing the game, and I had a few frame rate issues at certain points, but that's it.The dark atmosphere makes the game look amazing, and the graphics looked great on my PC.Overall, the game is a good adventure game, but it had so much more potential, and it could have been an amazing game if it had been done right.While Murdered: Soul Suspect definitely has its unforgivable flaws, it tries to compensate for them with its great narrative and the amazing atmosphere, though with not great success.It's not a horrible game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not an amazing one either, and it certainly didn't live up to my expectation.Pros:+ Great story+ Incredible atmosphere and soundtrack+ Side cases are interesting+ Great graphicsCons:- The game is short- Boring enemy encounters- Choices as a detective are meaningless- The town is really smallMy final score for Murdered: Soul Suspect is 6.5/10.I would wait for a big discount before buying the game.

												Just finished the game. Over all, it was pretty neat. The graphics were nice and the story was pretty interesting. While I thought the dialogue might be a little cheesy, it was bearable and I have no real complaints about it. I enjoyed playing a ghost detective and getting to posess and influence people to get what I needed. Also, the demons you come across in this game are pretty terrifying. It seemed like the more you crossed paths with them the more they recognized you and then became harder to take out. It was a nice challenge to a game that doesn't really have many  hard obstacles apart from the demons.There are just a couple cons about the game:1. No map. While you can play and beat the game no problem without a map, it was still annoying at times trying to navigate without it. Since the game took place at night and a lot of the buildings look similar, I found myself lost a lot and running around in circles. The game DID come with a code for an interactive map, but I could never get that to load for me and thus never used it. 2. Retracing your steps. Partly due to the lack of a good map, you also have to retrace your steps a lot in this game. That can get tiring. You can also get a bit dizzy from walking/running through walls etc. while retracing said steps.So yeah. The game was pretty awesome and worth the money. I give it a 8/10.			"

												In my opinion, the metascore is way off on this one. Usually I feel the scores are about right but not this time. My only complaint is that this game was way too short. I completed the game in under 9 hours and got every achievement in that first playthrough. The story was good and the mystery stayed a mystery to me until the very end when all is revealed. The gameplay was solid (reminded me a little of L.A. Noire which I expected) and the story was great as well as unique (I don't know any other games where you solve your own murder). I would recommend the game and I think the metascore should be around and 80. Had the game been longer I would've given it a better personal score.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect Is 2014 Best game of the Year I had fun running around the City of Salem, Trying to stop the relentless serial killer. The story is Awesome, It look's Good too, Game control's are easy, The sounds are pretty good and music just as good. I could not stop playing once I started the game I just had to finsh playing it. The partership between Ronan and Joy was very Sweet cause they needed each other to do thing's the other couldn't do. Now down to business Murdered: Soul Suspect is a 10 out of 10 and I hope to see more game's like this from Square Enix, I do recommend this game and I hope it will get a sequel.			"

												The PC keyboard layout is unusable and non-configurable. I gave up after half an hour. As it stands, this is unplayable without a controller, which is a pity because it looked promising otherwise.Update:Ordered a Logitech F710 and tried again ... and the controls are even more confusing, convoluted and finicky than when using a keyboard. The pure adventure part is fine (with both input methods) but between the two of us we couldn't manage a single ""action sequence"" (read: QTE). Might be that the game is completeable without them, but large parts (sidequests) are blocked off from the beginning, killing the athmosphere.			"

It has too many porting issues that glitch the game, causing you to restart the game and most likely losing the last hour of gameplay you had.  Because there is no independent save mechanism.  There is only auto saving at certain points in the main story.  I played for an hour exploring the street and solving a larger side story, and then got stuck in the clues menu and lost everything.  Poorly executed game.  I cant even finish it because it's so poorly executed.			"

												I would definately reccomend the game due to it's very interesting story, however the gameplay does lack in some respectives. You'll find yourself back tracking alot, sometimes running from one end of the map to the other which gets frustrating as you don't move very fast. The demons are incredibly annoying, after a while each time it's 3 demons in each zone. Consistently without failure, they are not hard to defeat they just become annoying and feel like they're just getting in the way. However apart from these few set backs, the story thus far (I'm yet to have finished the game) is very interesting, the murders are gruesome, so serial killer fans will enjoy this game. Some nice side murder cases to free the other ghosts that linger.Probably give the game a 6/10 it's such a shame with the whole demon thing. They add virtually nothing interesting to the game.			"

I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game because it can be beaten in under 9 hours.  If you want to have it last longer, I suggest finding all the side items.			"

												This isn't a game. It's more like a barely interactive movie. The gameplay is nearly non-existent, besides the 3000 quicktime and other single-button-press events. You get cool powers like ""Reveal"" and ""Remove"" but are never given the opportunity to use them for anything other than the aforementioned single press events. I was waiting for the puzzle where you have to combine your powers in some clever way. But unfortunately, that never happens. There is not a single puzzle in the entire game where you actually have to use your brain.The only positive is that the story is actually pretty good. I was engaged enough that I really did want to find out who the killer was. And the history parts of it were pretty entertaining yet educational.It's unfortunate that the rest of the ""game"" is so poor and lacking any sort of polish whatsoever. For example, when you walk near an NPC, they have one voice. Then you possess them and read their mind, they have a totally different voice. Very jarring. Not to mention the incredible amount of voiceover repetition amongst all NPCs. Another issue is trying to target objects and enemies is often a frustrating mess. Walking up to an enemy, seeing the prompt to ""attack"", and then having it suddenly disappear causing you to die is maddening beyond belief. It's made worse only by the fact that it happens so often. The targetting is really, really off in this game. These are small issues, but I bring them up as 100% undeniable proof the game is filled with small details like this that really show a lack of polish, and probably indicate the greater motivation (or lack thereof) to make this game truly shine. As with many things, the devil is in in the details, pun intended.Do yourself a favor and watch a YouTube video of this game being played in action so you see how the gameplay really is. And for Pete's sake, absolutely do not buy this at full price. Wait for a Steam Sale. I got it for $5.50 via GMG coupon, so the disappointment isn't too harsh for the price I paid. It's unfortunate because the story was actually enjoyable. The story deserves to be told by a greater game.You want a much better mystery game? Try The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. The UI, voice acting, ambience, and even graphics, are light years ahead of this game. Buy it on sale too though, since that one is very short.			"

												This game is pretty short, but it's fun if you have a day to spare. I got it on sale for about 4$. It's definately not worth the 30$ it's selling for, but for $4, it's probably worth a playthrough. So if you can get it on sale for fairly cheap, I recommend it.			"

The gameplay is a bit stiff it's true, when you play as a cat the gameplay is even worse but solving cases as a ghost, finding colectibles to watch a interesting cutscenes and catch the main villain a serial killer was great and I enjoyed it. The story it's the strongest. You can only be killed by demons which i really liked them, you are defenseless against them and you have to use some strategy to pass through them or kill them from behind instead. The game lack difficulty too and forgives if you fail to choose any wrong clue but in the end it was a fresh game to me.Score: 6/10.			"

												The reason for not reccomending this game is because it tries to be something its not. The game is heavily based off of finding clues, reading minds, and peacing together unsolved puzzles. What makes the game not what it should be is the combat system, it shouldnt be there. The only enemy you face the whole game is Demons. How to kill a demon is incredibley simple and very tedious, you walk up behind it and hold RT (if using an xbox controller) and then a quick time event pops up where you have to move the directional stick in a combination with a button. The demons only appear at certain points during the game and i always dreaded fighting them. They arent very scary but rely heavily on jump scares so you will accasionally get caught off gaurd and get spooked. The combat in this game feels like a very ""last minute thing"" that the Devs were forced to implement. They are essentially cheap game lengtheners that take you away from the story, forcing you to spend 10 minutes on some idiotic sneak/quicktime minigame. The game would have been SO much better without the tedious demon encounters. Other than that, the game is very enjoyable and the story is above average and makes you feel sympathy toward certain characters. Playing this game kinda felt like watching an episode of scooby doo because once you think youve found out what is going on, it turns out to be completely different.			"

The story is Awesome, It look's Good too, Game control's are easy, The sounds are pretty good and music just as good. I could not stop playing once I started the game I just had to finsh playing it. The partership between Ronan and Joy was very Sweet cause they needed each other to do thing's the other couldn't do. Now down to business Murdered: Soul Suspect is a 10 out of 10 and I hope to see more game's like this from Square Enix, I do recommend this game and I hope it will get a sequel.			"

												Very interesting and somewhat new kind of game in which you play as a murdered detective.Pros- Very good graphics- Good gameplay though simplistic- Very interesting background- Easy and quick access menus- No bugs at all!Cons- How is it that CA didn't pay any effort to enable keys remapping? Without any external tool you won't be able to do it in game and will be stuck playing either with wasd as keys for up, down, etc... or play with your gamepad. In this game, curiously, my gamepad doesn't work at all... Really nasty. But once this has been fixed, it's no longer a problem :)- A game a bit too easy even if sometimes finding objects/proofs can be toughConclusionThis game starts very slowly but keeps getting better and better with time. It's finally a very very nice game with a unique end and a very absorbing and thrilling background. It's not challenging at all but the storyline is really great! Note that you desperately need an external third party software to remap the keys - and especially if you use an azerty keyboard.A very interesting game in any case. Go for it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												The graphics are very well done, the story is actually pretty compelling and is what kept me going thru to the end. The ""combat"" nearly made me drop the game and walk away. Thankfully it isn't always necessary, (if you can manage to ""stealth"" around the demons) but doing this makes 100% completion impossible and infuriating. I suggest you only get this game if it's severely on sale, in a bundle, or you like extremely twitchy split-second simplistic ""combat"" that borders on quicktime events resulting in undeath-and-death situations, failing which results in restarting from the last checkpoint. For best results, just go watch youtube playthroughs.			"

One of the best story I've ever experienced.I actually doubted to buy this game or not. Eventually, I did and I just finished the game. Main story takes 5-6hrs to complete so it's too short but there're like 4-5 side cases so it can last 7-8hrs to completely finish the game. When it's first half you can guess your killer. So you might say: ""Okay it's so obvious, I know who's my killer just end already."" but game's ending is proves you so wrong. And believe me, ending is worth it.Good old point action and newly running simulator.Unfortunely this game hasn't got any insteresting gameplay. You just walk and collect (not it's not Pokemon Go). I wish at least we can have a ""ghostly gun"" to kill demons. But being an exorcist is kinda fun. Also those demons scaring the s**t out of you. Even I had to disable their AI to speed up the game (sorry I cheated death, again).If you want to have fun DO NOT disable them. But if you're so sick of them like me: Go to your steamapps/common/Murdered Soul Suspect\FateGame\Config folder. Open DefaultAIPerceptionData.ini with notepad. Search for StimTypes=(TypeName=Player,BaseTypeName=Ghost,Result_Awareness=High) and change High to Unaware. Demons won't see you now but you have to kill them ofc. Good and bad things:+Very good voice acting.+Humor between Ronan and Joy.+Salem's creepy athmosphere.+Wall hacking (yes this is a thing).+Story.+Real investigating to solve puzzles/cases.-Gameplay bores you over time.-30fps cap in game, you can unlock it but cinematics are still capped.-Too many cinematics. Every question you ask is a friggin' cinematic. Why not in-game? Seriously.-A minimap could be useful. I lost in that damn mansion. "

												This game had a great idea, with shoddy implementation.Seriously, the whole ghost detective thing had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the gameplay completely fell flat. The piecing together of clues to solve the crime was laughably simplistic. For example, you'd often need to posses someone to prompt them to think about something. When posed with the question along the lines of ""What clue can you use to make them think about the murder?"", one of the answers is literally ""the murder"". And the whole adding in of the demons thing to give it some aspect of stealth combat was irksome; I know they felt they needed to add something in to make it more challenging (since the mystery portion certainly wasn't doing it), but that aspect could have been done away with completely and nothing would have been lost. Less ghost splinter cell and more ghost Sherlock Holmes would have been great. It wasn't all bad; the plot was interesting, the graphics were good. But the stupid stuff the game made you do to reveal the plot was not worthwhile in the least.			"

												So far Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy was my favourite adventure game,Murdered comes very very close.It is definitly the best adventure game of the last 10 years or so.In the game we play as Ronan former criminal who became a detective and died,yes died.We solve the case of our own murder,now say what you want i havent play something like that yet!Its great,original,very climitical,the atmosphere is a mix of modern times with old sql noir,which works perfectly and the action takes place in the city of Salem,how cool is that?Its a cinematic game,like imo every adventure game should be so i love it.On the visual side Murdered is fantastic,gret graphics,pretty good map design,animations are fine theres really nothing wrong with visuals.On the gameplay like I said as its a cinematic game,on times you gonna feel like playing a movie,similiar to Fahrenheit,again for me this is great.So what we have here is a great,climatic,adventure game,that is original in pretty much every sens,some people say its short,idk imagine a movie 7-9h long ;)I dont want to give you any spoilers,Im just gonna say that story got me engaged,interested and entertained from the begining to the end.8/...sorry this game allowed me to posses a cat :3 9/10			"

												Update: I've now finished this game. And though alot of the stuff seemed overly repetitive and maybe tedious, I will say the ending of the game and story conclusion seemed well worth the hassle through in some occasions. Game only takes about 7 or so hrs to play through, but I stick to my previous statement and wouldn't pay over $30 for it.I find this as further proof that reviews(within the media) in general should never be a key factor in purchasing a game. I feel this is much higher than a 63 by Metacritic.The game is very well conceived for the most part. The stories are engaging, the graphics and sound seem to be very well thought-out as well. I would say some things are a bit repetitive, but this should be expected in any game really. I feel the game is a well displayed innovation of a cop drama. I picked this up on the summer sale for $33 and would say it's definitely worth the $30 range. Though I very rarely purchase a game a full price, I do feel $50 is a bit much for any game.TLDR: Engaging and enjoyable. Something new for a story that's interesting from the moment it starts. Has it's repetitive parts like any game, but definitely worth it on a sale.			"

												I was sadly disappointed by this game. From the other reviews I saw I thought the play through would be a lot harder and would take me much longer. The game itself took me about 8 hours to play through and this was including the side quests and collectibles. I felt like the game started off good and had potential, but then the game developers just shrugged, said ""good enough!"", and threw it on the market.There is almost no replay value and the crime solving aspect of the game, which is what I was really looking forward to, is way too easy. Theres only two enemies to you in the game, both of which are very easy to dupe. One you just avoid stepping on, and the other can be executed by a simple click of a designated key board key.Wish I wouldn't have spent 30 dollars on this game.			"

												I start with the bad stuff, because i liked the game pretty much:so, um, I didn't really liked that there was like 3 female and 3 male faces for NPCs and like 10 lines of speach. I dont recommand to pay much attention to random npcs walking around town.So, i absolutely recommand this game if:- you like spooky storyes- you like stories- you like collecting things (a LOT)- you'd like to play as a cat!so the thing is, that you might want to speak english or one language this game has been translated to (else why would you bother buying a storytelling game) because without being able to understand the whole thing it is not really interesting i guess.and oh, the lot of collectable stuff! I loved them, especially the ghost stories <3If you run through the main quest in a hurry it wont take long to finish the game so i recommand to pay attention to the collectables, you won't regret it. And this way the game just didnt end.Its a 5/7 and its a good idea to buy this game. :D			"

												I really love adventure games and Point & Click genre. Especially detective ones like: ""Still Life"" ""Cognition"" ""Art of Murder""... To the buisness. I was informed about faults of Murdered: Soul Suspect. Heard that it is repetive and quite boring game.But lets start with good points. I really need to give them applause it starts incredibly. Putting us with knowledge about innovative ghost mechanics: getting into person body, passing through some obstacles, reconstructing memories. It really looks amazing on the paper and screens. Plot is intriguing. Music and mood is great aswell as small fights which are made in QTE. Movie scenes are great.That would be it now lets come to the worst parts... these soo called innovative mechanics don't add up excitment. You know in most Detective games lets give example here from ""Testament of Sherlock Holmes"". Both games are with semi open city. In Sherlock Holmes you walk around asking people doing additional quests uncovering side story and city with PLEASURE. Meanwhile in Murdered: SS. All what you really do with semi open city is finding tons of hidden memories / notes which will discover you after getting'em all! A flashback movie sequence (AFTER COLLECTING ALL 15-30 THINGS FROM SQUARE). And to collect them you need to know your skills as ghost. You will not feel rewarded at all doing these things but other then that there is not much more if you dont go with plot. You will find frustrating limitations of your Detective with no positive surprise element (You dont do this? You wont get more side-stories!)... Going on yeah mechanics are simply basic soo soon we will find ourselfs doing over and over same things. No riddles, no thinking, just grab this and that mix memories voila!  this is Murdered: Soul.Soo yeah I know some pretty good games. Which wont try innovative elements but they do old ones godly... and it is satisfiyng. Murdered: Soul Suspect IS NOT A BAD GAME. I simply expected more after seeing how much could've been done here. No riddles in adventure games is painful.			"

This was a great adventure game, where you collect evidence and piece it together. Though the gameplay was simple, I really enjoyed the story and the characters. There were some cool gameplay mechanics, all of which took advantage of being a ghost. Possesing people and cats, walking through walls, etc.  It was well worth the time invested playing and I hope the developer makes more games like this.			"

It has too many porting issues that glitch the game, causing you to restart the game and most likely losing the last hour of gameplay you had.  Because there is no independent save mechanism.  There is only auto saving at certain points in the main story.  I played for an hour exploring the street and solving a larger side story, and then got stuck in the clues menu and lost everything.  Poorly executed game.  I cant even finish it because it's so poorly executed.			"

												The PC keyboard layout is unusable and non-configurable. I gave up after half an hour. As it stands, this is unplayable without a controller, which is a pity because it looked promising otherwise.Update:Ordered a Logitech F710 and tried again ... and the controls are even more confusing, convoluted and finicky than when using a keyboard. The pure adventure part is fine (with both input methods) but between the two of us we couldn't manage a single ""action sequence"" (read: QTE). Might be that the game is completeable without them, but large parts (sidequests) are blocked off from the beginning, killing the athmosphere.			"

One of the best story I've ever experienced.I actually doubted to buy this game or not. Eventually, I did and I just finished the game. Main story takes 5-6hrs to complete so it's too short but there're like 4-5 side cases so it can last 7-8hrs to completely finish the game. When it's first half you can guess your killer. So you might say: ""Okay it's so obvious, I know who's my killer just end already."" but game's ending is proves you so wrong. And believe me, ending is worth it.Good old point action and newly running simulator.Unfortunely this game hasn't got any insteresting gameplay. You just walk and collect (not it's not Pokemon Go). I wish at least we can have a ""ghostly gun"" to kill demons. But being an exorcist is kinda fun. Also those demons scaring the s**t out of you. Even I had to disable their AI to speed up the game (sorry I cheated death, again).If you want to have fun DO NOT disable them. But if you're so sick of them like me: Go to your steamapps/common/Murdered Soul Suspect\FateGame\Config folder. Open DefaultAIPerceptionData.ini with notepad. Search for StimTypes=(TypeName=Player,BaseTypeName=Ghost,Result_Awareness=High) and change High to Unaware. Demons won't see you now but you have to kill them ofc. Good and bad things:+Very good voice acting.+Humor between Ronan and Joy.+Salem's creepy athmosphere.+Wall hacking (yes this is a thing).+Story.+Real investigating to solve puzzles/cases.-Gameplay bores you over time.-30fps cap in game, you can unlock it but cinematics are still capped.-Too many cinematics. Every question you ask is a friggin' cinematic. Why not in-game? Seriously.-A minimap could be useful. I lost in that damn mansion. "

												Very interesting and somewhat new kind of game in which you play as a murdered detective.Pros- Very good graphics- Good gameplay though simplistic- Very interesting background- Easy and quick access menus- No bugs at all!Cons- How is it that CA didn't pay any effort to enable keys remapping? Without any external tool you won't be able to do it in game and will be stuck playing either with wasd as keys for up, down, etc... or play with your gamepad. In this game, curiously, my gamepad doesn't work at all... Really nasty. But once this has been fixed, it's no longer a problem :)- A game a bit too easy even if sometimes finding objects/proofs can be toughConclusionThis game starts very slowly but keeps getting better and better with time. It's finally a very very nice game with a unique end and a very absorbing and thrilling background. It's not challenging at all but the storyline is really great! Note that you desperately need an external third party software to remap the keys - and especially if you use an azerty keyboard.A very interesting game in any case. Go for it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												After completing this game with about 85% of the achievements, I can say that I must agree with the mediocre opinions of other reviewers like Zero Punctuation. It really seems like a lot of potential got wasted here. The demons can be annoying, the clues and collectibles a pain to find, and the puzzles strangely insulting to the player's intelligence. The gameplay almost seems like an afterthought to the story. And in my opinion that is where this game, well if not shines at least sparkles slightly.Unlike the gameplay that sold me for dumb, the story was just smart enough that I didn't quite see everything coming. If you play the game as an interractive TV episode of some supernatural detective story it is actually quite enjoyable. And if you do have the patience to find all the collectibles for each section you are rewarded with some nice ""Tales from the Crypt"" type ghost stories. They are just voiceovers to a fixed image, but they are generally well acted and gripping.So if you like a bit of a ghost story and some detective adventures AND you find it on sale for under $10 give it a go!

												I really thought I'd enjoy this game but I mainly didn't.The story's not compelling, the character's are pretty cliché and bland, and I even find the main character a bit ridiculous at times with his ghost cigarette always on. There's a twist at the end I saw coming since the beginning but there's a very final one I have to admit I didn't but nothing to get really excited about either.The main problem are the clunky mechanics. Holy ghost is it bad. You end up runing in circles ALL THE TIME because you missed a clue. But not because you didn't see it but because the game is poorly executed ! You see what seems to be a clue, get near it but no interraction possible. So you think it's not a clue and keep looking elsewhere. But it actually is a clue, only you need to be at the exact spot with the camera facing the exact side the developpers decided in order to get a command prompt. It happens literrally all the time and it's very annoying.And I'd rathyer not talk about the demons phases which are the most frustrating and annoying things I've seen in a video game for a long time, it really got on my nerves having to start over and over again what, in my opinion, shouldn't even be in a game like that.Also, the city streets are of no interest whatsoever. It's just empty corridors that get you from a mission to another with nothing interesting to do and filled with tons of useless collectibles. There's so many of them, I stopped reading entries after a while, it's way too much. It reminded me of the first Assassin's Creed in that way.Graphics are okay and voice acting is pretty good though.It's not a bad game per say, but it's not a good one either in my humble opinion. I didn't have a good time playing it and although it's only a 6 hours long story, I really was longing for it to end after less than 2 hours.I had just finished Life Is Strange before playing Murdered: Soul Suspect, so maybe after playing such a masterpiece I was feeling particularly picky and this game didn't stand a chance before I even started. Anyway, whatever the reasons behind my feelings, I trully can't recommand that game except on a massive sale or part of a bundle, but 30€ is way too expensive for what it has to offer.			"

												In Murdered: Soul Suspect you play the role of a deceased cop whose spirit is trapped in our world and unable to pass on tot he afterlife due to the mysterious circumstances surrounding his brutal murder. It combines crime scene investigations with ghostly manipulation, set tpo the backdrop of a modern day Salem.First and foremost, Ronan (the main character) has easily become one of my favorite protagonists in recent history; here you have a kid raised by the streets who knew nothing but a life of crime until one day he grows up and is offered the chance to turn it all around and make something of himself - thus he ends up joining the force and becoming a detective, though his past still haunts him and his newfound reputation. He's got a tattoo from every major event in his life - the good and the bad - and he totes a massive glock both gifted by and named after his mother. What's not to like?The story is pretty straightforward - get killed by bad guy, hunt down and stop bad guy, pass on - but it's all brought together quite nicely. A strong voice cast and shiny graphics go a long way, too; Salem is looking just awesome!Gameplay, as stated earlier, combines crime scene investigations with ghostly manipulation. That last bit probably needs some elaboration though. Basically, you're a ghost. Most buildings will be off limits, though they tie this into the story - being you're in Salem (home to ancient witch hunts), many of the houses have been consecrated long ago. However, open doors or windows are free game. You can also pass through interior walls and doors (so long as they don't lead to the outside world) and a variety of other solid objects. You can also possess people to read their minds or even influence them in certain ways, or manipulate certain objects to attract attention (TVs, radios, even vaccuum cleaners).All in all, this title is living up to just about ervery expectation I had for it and then some.

												Im truley clueless at the meta score. Its a very good detective gameYeh the ai demons are totally annoying, combat is pathetic, but this isnt a action/fighter. Its a story driven puzzle game.Yeh the puzzles are basic and unchallenging. Frame rate drops are very constant, and my fps is high so its basically a dev failing to optimize. But its at least 7.5Its a good game nothing groundbraking but definetly not poor.			"

												If you are interested in adventure games focused on the story, it is a decent game. The investigation bits aren't developed compared to other games like sherlock holmes, it simply adds to the story. It is not a very long game, even if you are into collecting all the pieces to unlock other non-playable short stories, which is kinda boring IMHO. My biggest problem with this title is the unnecessary addition of quicktime events during gameplay. Quicktime is alright if they are few and far between, but in this game it is added in several mechanics, from fighting demons to escaping from demon pits. They should've done away with all of that if they didn't bother adding a different mechanism of fighting and evading danger.The graphics are alright and the dialogue is okay - if your graphics card isn't at least a medium-end one I'd say skip it mostly because you might run into a few issues with fps, which will probably take away from the game as you have to walk all around places and kill demons to get to the objectives.I can recommend this game only if you enjoy story focused games and even in this case, if its on a sale. I wouldn't recommend people paying over $15 on this one.			"

												Another glitchy xbox port. From what i understand, this was Square's attempt to appeal to a western audience. The plot is that you are a detective who must solve his own murder, which, as a game, had so much promise... but the coding was top heavy. My system struggled to run it even in safe mode, the story was surprisingly predictable, and the controls were unruly to say the least. I would have been more into it maybe if fighting demons weren't WAY harder to combat than they initially let on earlier in the game. The demons can ♥♥♥♥ right off. The investigations don't really involve any real problem solving on your part: just treat it like a 6 hour movie. :/ Save yourself the trouble and watch an LP. You might miss the side missions (of which there are a gazillion of them), but it's really not worth the trouble of playing it yourself. It was such a good idea that fell flat on its face.			"

												Take the basic premise of the Patrick Swayze movie ""Ghost"", ditch the pottery wheel scene, add some gameplay elements from Heavy Rain and L.A. Noire, and wrap the whole thing around the historic Salem witch trials. The result is Murdered: Soul Suspect.As a game, it's really easy, but the gameplay is varied and competent enough to avoid being a chore. Intriguing mystery plot, likable characters and haunting atmosphere are the main reason to play this title, even though there's no replay value whatsoever - consider getting it at bargain price. I should also mention that this is a rare case where collectible hunts are actually worth your time. Those ghost tales are cool as sh!t.			"

												Good game, very good story. It did as most mysteries should and kept making you believe you knew the killer when you didn't. Good ending, good atmosphere. For whatever reason it took me forever to get used to seeing the prompting question when you had to select clues. Also the extra tasks of collecting stage-specific items, by the end, I could, despite my best efforts, only find all but one. They apparently found really, really good hiding places. Same with clues. All but one.  Two problems: the mouse rate is way down when selecting clues on the screen. And there's no way to scroll faster or bypass the credits at the end, which are currently running while minimized at the bottom of my screen. 8/10.			"

												A very disappointing game. I expected a relaxing adventure game with nice graphics, a nice story, some easy puzzles and some exploration. Unfortunately only the graphics held up to my expectations. The story wasn't very original up to the point where I quit, but at least it was interesting enough to follow it. So it could have been a decent game - if it weren't for the abysmal gameplay. The whole game is basically one of those crappy hidden object games. You walk around with your ghost character and search for clues (objects or people you can interact with) so you can walk up to them and press a button. Doh. Once you've found enough clues you can combine the most important ones  (which again means mindlessly pressing buttons, don't get your hopes up) to 'solve' the scene and move on with the story.Oh, and apart from that sometimes you have to fight demons. Sounds exciting? It is not. You just have to walk up to them from behind and press a button combination. Just another very dull gameplay mechanic.Murdered: Soul Suspect would have been a better game if it was one of those Walking Simulators like 'Dear Esther'. And that says something. The gameplay is simply too boring and annoying to enjoy the (not even outstanding) story of the game. Not recommended.			"

												I really like the story in this game! It draws you in pretty nicely and I really want to find out more, but trying to beat the demons prevents me from spending too much time on this in one setting. You have to sneak from behind, hit R and then a random direction button  (W,A,S,D) and a random left or right click at the same time (you have to match the direction button and click that appear on screen).. ugh!. If it wasn't for that I would be spending many more hours on this. As it is now, I play for a little, get frustrated, and then come back to it later. Eventually I get past the demons by beating them, but I don't consider this part of the game fun.Although I'm not sure of the real reason for Airtight Games going out of business, I would like to think it's because they threw this stupid difficult platforming into their puzzle games that adds nothing but frustration to players like me who are in it mostly for the puzzles. (these folks are also the culprits behind Quantum Cunundrum). The recommendation is a yes for the story and progression of the game but a no for the gameplay. If you like platforming games and are pretty coordinated, this part of the game won't be an issue for you; however, you might then be bored with the rest of the gameplay which is just simple puzzle/exploration.

												-If you really like crime and ghosts get it on a sale-Best feature up front: you can control cats. With that out of the way: this is a detective adventure where you play as a ghost, nothing as fleshed out as Gabriel Knight, think Fahrenheit meets CSI, simplified.Graphics are not that much to look at, music the same. Voice acting and characters are good.I'm half-in so there might still be a nice surprise story-wise but it is: get clues to next location, go there, repeat.There are several logical flaws like every log shelter counting as a consecrated building you can't pass but I tolerate that.Worse are the useless collectable item hunts to add artificial length and distract from the story where you should hunt a terrible serial killer. Strange design choices like the game world's small hub being filled with collectibles every metre and questing ghosts. They'd better made several small locations accesible by quick travel like most adventures handle it.Game features no real jump scares and only moderate horror. Has quick-time-events for ""fighting"".The detective part of the game isn't actually that much brainy also and involves some guessing.Only get this if you like crime and ghost adventures very much and it's on sale. The simple clue clicking and the drive to find out about the killer sees you through.Barely recommended.Edit: finished, ending was ok, some entertainment but can be skipped with nothing missed.			"

The gameplay is a bit like as if someone took a point and click adventure and turned it into a TPS without the weapons - or the shooting for that matter and realized  afterwards that there must be a degree of difficulty too so they added these dementors to the game. These demons are the biggest letdowns in this game BTW... Anyway, graphics are OK, characters (the inhabitants of Salem) are repetitive, the story is OK (excpet that I don't get it: why on earth do you need to collect objects completely out of scope and proportion to be awarded with something? eg. boiler or whatever), side ""missions"" are so-so (I am being positive here), controls OK (except for the demon ""fight"" and usual camera mayhem) - and the game is way way short (7 hours or so on normal difficulty). Of course since it is ""open world""-ish you can wander about for long but I do not see the point in doing so.I would recommend it more than not but be warned: this game will not appeal to all.			"

												My girlfriend decided to give this game another go since we both tried it out on PS4 when it first came out in 2014, we were unimpressed and returned for a full refund here at EB Games.Roll forward to Dec 2015, it was on a 90% discount from Steam so I picked it up here for $2.99 USD.Roll forward another year to January 2017, and she decided to play this. The gameplay and story was good in her eyes, although she did complain alot about the Demons mainly because as she says, ""they were scary"".She said that the ending was rather ""underwhelming"" - the last mission was way too easy compared to the rest of the game and she expected a final challenge.All in all the game was very easy for her. She has nunchuck skills.She gives this a 7/10. She also says wait for a sale on this game to pick it up and you will enjoy it.Thank you much love.			"

												PROS:- Nice to see a big-budget game break out of the AAA industry’s increasingly rigid mould.- Above-average script elevates a straightforward story.- Exploring to find weird little characters and creepy ghost stories is weirdly enjoyable.CONS:- Utterly terrible stealth sections that clash completely with the rest of the game.- Puzzles often appear interesting only to phrase themselves strangely, resulting in answers that don’t seem to make a lot of sense.SUMMARY:A mild experiment that’s neither particularly great nor notably bad. Definitely not worth considering for anything near full price, but a pleasant enough diversion if you fancy something laid back. Still, it’s a bit sad that the most interesting thing about this game is that it’s anything other than a brown shooter. Like complimenting someone for only breaking one of your legs rather than both.			"

Noir however the detective bits where you question people is well done the graphics are great even on lowest settings and it can run on allmost everything because i use a laptop and can still get 30 fps. like others have said get it on sale it is good but not good enough to spend £25 on.but it is worth every penny if you get it on sale. It is tence when you see the first type of enemy. the stealth is okay but you are a ghost i dont think you need to crouch. Overall i give this game an 8/10 untill i complete it 3 hours ive played so far and i have not got bored.Edit:I still like it but since ive got a new pc i cant play it as is only 64 bit what is horrible as it costs aproximately £70 for windows 7 64 bit as i have a 32 bit system what plays allmost all my games so if they make it so people can can play it on 32 bit systems i will b e a happy bambi			"

												Sorry I can't continue playing this.Story is possibly good, but I don't feel intrigued enough to go through the game.The main reason I can't recommend this game are the controls.Nobody cared enough to implement mouse/keyboard remapping option, so you have to stick with the key bindings chosen by the developer, which are personally for me are very uncomfortable.It's like they designed by somebody who never used mouse /keyboard in their life.There is absolutely no reason to play this with gamepad, this is not hack&slash game.Apart from this:Game space feels very confined (any time you are trying to walk away from current mission scene, which is 10x10 feet, you are immediately returned to that scene, etc).Graphics are so so (if you max it up and use 1080p screen, there is nothing great about them, textures are bland and washed out)Combat simplistic and boring, similar to playing hide and seek.This game was obviously made for consoles.I regret I made this purchase, even though I didn't pay the full price.I missed the times when I owned PS3, when I could sell unwanted game on ebay or trade it in for pennies, at least I didn't have them in my library and remember all the pain they caused me.

Assuming I'm closer to the end of the game now than I was before, it is now basically move 3 steps, stealth, 3 steps, stealth. It's just repeating. I officially do not care now. Bell Killer can have all the the murders he wants, I ain't soul suspectin' nobody.			"

												Sorry I can't continue playing this.Story is possibly good, but I don't feel intrigued enough to go through the game.The main reason I can't recommend this game are the controls.Nobody cared enough to implement mouse/keyboard remapping option, so you have to stick with the key bindings chosen by the developer, which are personally for me are very uncomfortable.It's like they designed by somebody who never used mouse /keyboard in their life.There is absolutely no reason to play this with gamepad, this is not hack&slash game.Apart from this:Game space feels very confined (any time you are trying to walk away from current mission scene, which is 10x10 feet, you are immediately returned to that scene, etc).Graphics are so so (if you max it up and use 1080p screen, there is nothing great about them, textures are bland and washed out)Combat simplistic and boring, similar to playing hide and seek.This game was obviously made for consoles.I regret I made this purchase, even though I didn't pay the full price.I missed the times when I owned PS3, when I could sell unwanted game on ebay or trade it in for pennies, at least I didn't have them in my library and remember all the pain they caused me.

												I will write in english although my language is spanish. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game with a interesting concept. You are a ghost that have numerous skills, for example to cross walls between others, and you have that find to your killer. You live in Salem, Massachussets, in allusion to Lovecraftian's books, and you are a deliquent that joined you in the police how detective.The fault is in the poor and boring plot that can be very dense sometimes. Besides, the gameplay seems innovator at first moments but after this return something tricky. As well the linear plot, little freedom of movements even if you can cross things...Its not horrible but neither is very good... Reccomendable only for genre fans.Regards :)			"

												honestly i like its interesting but not new well being a ghost is new but the detective style has been done before with greats like L.A. Noir however the detective bits where you question people is well done the graphics are great even on lowest settings and it can run on allmost everything because i use a laptop and can still get 30 fps. like others have said get it on sale it is good but not good enough to spend £25 on.but it is worth every penny if you get it on sale. It is tence when you see the first type of enemy. the stealth is okay but you are a ghost i dont think you need to crouch. Overall i give this game an 8/10 untill i complete it 3 hours ive played so far and i have not got bored.Edit:I still like it but since ive got a new pc i cant play it as is only 64 bit what is horrible as it costs aproximately £70 for windows 7 64 bit as i have a 32 bit system what plays allmost all my games so if they make it so people can can play it on 32 bit systems i will b e a happy bambi			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game that has a lot of interesting ideas that don't quite come together. While the story is interesting and the setting and locations are good there are several issues that can make the game feel like a chore. While I understand why many people weren't amazed with this game I've personally enjoyed it because of it's spooky tone, mystery and interesting gameplay elements. Bottom line is that you will enjoy the game if you're willing to overlook some of the issues listed below and prefer tone and setting to gameplay and story. In any case I would only suggest suggest buying this game unless it is on sale for $20 or less.Pros:Interesting main story as well as side storiesSpooky setting and atmosphereRelatable protagonistCreepy soundtrackCons: Some Gameplay elements feel tedious such as executing demons Lack of interesting charactersVery little challengeFinding clues can be difficult at times			"

What I disliked was the stealth, hiding around the corner for minutes for a good opportunity to exorcise the demons. But overall it's a solid game.			"

												The game throws you inside a spirit... I must say the beginning of the game is really good. It kinda feels like playing a character in a movie. While there are some interesting game mechanics and well, playing a ghost is different from other games, the game felt too much scripted for me. Which means that the player is a little too oriented for me. It's pretty much a game about collecting items laying on the floor or around... and putting the puzzle together with the help of the game itself. You have to solve ""a"" crime, an investigation while following a trail, a way... maybe THE way. And that's what I can't play such a type of game for too long. However I liked the graphics, the environnment, the mood it gets you into. And the story seems interesting (as far as I've gotten). The problem is that everything I like is not related to playing a videogame, but rather to a movie... although I must say, getting control of that cat and moving around with it was cool ! I would recommend it as an interfactive adventure... as a movie, but not as a videogame - I didn't like it enough.			"

												I had a lot of fun with Murdered: Soul Suspect. The story is really engaging; the ghostly and other supernatural powers (walking through walls, reconstructing crime scenes through ghostly shards left behind, getting visions of the past from touching people's hands, etc) are really thrilling, and I especially liked all of the crime/mystery sequences. The game is criminally short unfortunately, and slow paced - it's more about storytelling than it is about actual gameplay,  although there is a light stealth mechanic, and there's what felt like a somewhat rushed ending, so if that isn't your thing, this may be a game to avoid. But the atmosphere is incredible and the storytelling is engaging, and I'm really glad I took a chance on this in a sale.			"

												I am going to recommend it... if you are a fan of thrillers and killers. It's an interesting premise and the mechanics are different that you'd expect. It does get repetitive quickly and the pace is dragged down by the puzzle and stealth aspects. The story and atmosphere are pretty good, the acting is ok, and  the rest (sound, NPCs, length) are all a solid meh. It's nothing special, but if the tagline has you looking down here, play it.			"

												Grab the closest fedora, to save m'lady from ultimate danger as a knight so white your transparent being a ghost and all.  Murdered Soul Suspect plays like a hidden object game with an open world utilizing hubs like Deus Ex.  Ironically many of the cops cant solve this case because their too busy playing Deus Ex which is on their screens at the Police Station.  This game is very very short which is a plus for completionists hunting them achevos since its a pretty easy run to get 100%.  The story is just about the right length without being drawn out.  Investigating crime scenes means hunting down clues, at first the puzzles make no sense when asked to select a word since their not explained, but after doing a couple every player will feel like a PI.  Fun game to play late at night so only play it when the lights are off and best played during shocktober to go with the whole Salem Witch trials thing.  Game goes all 2spooky right from the start with a tale of someone in a water thing and people drinking it or something just like that real life story of Elisa Lam.  Get ready to get spooked! No major bugs in the game, besides sometimes the character stops walking for some reason, just reload the last checkpoint.  All found items are saved after finding them so reloading means you lose none of the items which is awesome.  The game has NO in game map, only preorders got that which sucks for everyone else.  Outside of that its really not needed, the game does an excellent job of telling every clue found by name.  Just use google on any missing ones to mop up, be sure to find the following before entering the ""Judgement house"".35/39 Info About My Killer34/38 Julia's Thoughts5/6 Profiler's Memories22/25 Salem's History8/9 Witch Trials HistoryMystery Fans:  Rating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99Non-Mystery Fans:  Rating:  4/10  Value:  $4.99			"

												THE GOODMurdered: Soul Suspect has a fantastic atmosphere and environment design and it is all supported by a good story and each collectible (of which there are 242 in the game) also comes with a flavour text. It creates an really immersive experience. You also get to do some detective work, both in the main plot and for a couple of NPC ghosts in Salem, but...THE SO-SO...Murdered's core gameplay is more akin to a visual novel, but in 3D. You look at stuff, you collect information and you solve ""puzzles"" by putting piece A and piece B together. It's nothing spactacular and probably not for everyone. Also while the game does have 242 collectibles, there is no way to tell if you missed one or have collected everything in an area. People that like to explore may like that, people that just want to collect everything may not.THE UGLYThe Stealth gameplay where you have to have to evade demons feels incredibly tacked on and unpolished. You go up behind them and kill them with a QTE. If you mess up or get spotted you have to jump between hiding places with a button press until they calm down, at which point you can try again. There is no grace period for getting spotted so you might as well reload from checkpoint because it's faster than waiting for the demons to go back to lurking. SUMMARYIf the sudo-Stealth segments don't turn you off and you don't expect some action-oriented gameplay, Murdered Soul Suspect is a great experience. It's a little frustrating because had they spent just a little more time on the gameplay, this game would get a blind recommendation, but as it stands this game is still RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF SUPERNATURAL MYSTERY STORIES AND PLAYERS WHO WANT TO GET IMMERSED IN A WORLD			"

This was a game which was totally dependent on its story line, and they made sure to keep it short because if they had lengthened the storyline people would have got bored because of the limited gameplay, andto be honest the last scene actually was surprising the only one thing that i guessed wrong, i would have elaborated but can't give any spoilers either. I was really happy that i could run this game with my shity graphic card.I would recomment it but it's actually totally dependent on it storyline and gameplay is really limited and puzzles are not that hard, buy it when there's sale.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is about a wannabe detective/previous gangster, who was over his head as usual. The game is almost a point & click game at times. You are pretty much just looking at evidence, reading some person's mind, then solving a case with the most straightforward answer, which confuses you at times because the answer does nothing to help the case, & it just trips you up.Pros: + Good Graphics+ Music is good, is repetitive when examining evidence+ Good Voice acting+ Your a ghost+ You can possess a cat+ Can see women naked, jk XDCons:- When you're solving cases, almost all the answers are straight forward, making it pointless to collect evidence- Controls are a bit messy, it seems like this game was mainly developed for console- Gameplay gets repetitive after the 3rd case, which is look at this evidence, read mind, now conclude caseConclusion:- If you someone who played L.A. Noire, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, those Sherlock games. Then I recommend you not waste your money or time with this game, because the story isn't much & the gameplay gets very repetitive, but if you still want to buy it. I would wait until this game is %80-%90, because there are better detective games out there right now that are cheaper or of the same price of Murdered: Soul Suspect. "

The demons are the only enemy in the game, all look the same, and can't be hurt unless  you sneak up on them and press a button combination.

												I can't really recommend this game nor tell anyone not to play it. This is a particular game suited for those with a taste for ghost stories. In fact, I really wouldn't call it a ""video game"", but if it has to be labeled as such, just know that this game is a collection adventure to unlock ghost stories, while discovering parts of the main ghost story itself. The game's basic idea: Walk around as a ghost, explore, collect ""ghost memories (collectables)"", and solve simple psychological puzzles from time to time.Pro's: It's not bad for what it is.It's stories aren't distasteful, as far as ghost horror stories go, but don't expect a dark twist at the end or something incredibly cool (like 6th sense, The Others, or a double twist like Shutter Island). There is a twist (as there should be, in any good ghost story) but it's the most generic twist ever, so much so, I don't feel guilty for spoiling it. Still, when all is said, I can't really gripe too hard at the story, because it's a basic ghost/suspense story that's delivered quite well through interactive play. Con's:Really, there isn't a whole lot of things wrong with this, as far as the game itself is concerned. Although, it did have some issues with a 360 controller and my Roccat Tyon mouse (I had to disconnect the mouse to play). But, in all honesty, in a market that has been tapped completely dry, this game could have been so much worse. Also, I had to attach a -dx9 launch option for this game, seeing as my intel HD 3000 didn't recognize the forced dx11.Final Thought: It's fun, but I can't recommend it to just anyone. It's nothing new in the genre and unless you are really digging the ghost stuff, in which you would have already gotten this, I can't recommend it. However, if you ARE into ghosts and goblins, then I will say you won't waste your money with this game, as there is A TON of bad ghost horror stuff out there that, luckily for me, this did not turn out to be.

												Collectibles - the game.This is a third-person adventure game whose gameplay consists of running around, looking for hotspots and collecting... things. Clues, pictures, boilers, rum... No, really. Look up the game's walkthrough. It consists of checklist upon checklist of collectibles you must collect in order to move forward.There's probably a good supernatural story hidden somewhere in there, but I couldn't be bothered to play it longer than 2 hours because of the boring gameplay. I don't recommend this game.			"

												A decent enough story but not much of a game.  Move around hitting e when it tells you to is about all there is to this and getting the e to pop up can be pretty problematic as you often have to be in exactly the right spot.  The game even lacks the most basic ability to change your keyboard layout, although if you play with a controller you won't really have a problem.  Fairly short as well unless you try to find all the hidden collectables.			"

												A boring Telltale type of game for those that enjoy watching a story instead of playing a video game. The idea is interesting enough.

I don't play games for their 3rd rate stories, I play for the gameplay.Not to mention that this is just a plain terrible port. 30 FPS cap randomly applies at times, mouse senstitivity has three options. Low, Medium, High. Wow, thanks guys, amazing job. The whole options menu is plain lacking, and the game eats up more performance than it should.I also don't appreciate lazy game design. Some guy was haunting a kid after he died, and got  eaten by a demon  and disappeared. When I came back and reloaded the save, I found him in the exact same spot, except that I couldn't talk to him. The little girl's scripted ""MOMMY"" sequence replayed again. Why does reloading a save cause everything to reset improperly? This game is not worth your time or money.			"

												Rented this game on console and it was alright, probably around a 6/10 for me. A friend gifted me the PC version when it was on sale, so most of my experience is with the console version and not the pc version.Some great ideas and some nice graphics but this could have been soooo much better. If you want a style of game like this I would say go play all of the Tex Murphy detective games or even LA NOIRE.The story is a mess, the characters are pretty meh and it is just not all that fun of a game. Far from terrible but I can't help but think this could have been so much more with another year or some different design decisions. The atmosphere is also pretty well done.If it is $5 or $10 on sale it is worth a go, but as I said above, I would go hit up Tex Murphy series, Police Quest series or even LA NOIRE instead.			"

												I don't get why places like IGN and other respected game sites gave such poor reviews of this game.  I find it quite appealing and quite fun.  This is not an action packed, fast paced game.  On the contrary it's a slow paced, thoughtful mystery and  ghost story with above average production values.  While this is a supernatural themed game it is by no means gory, nor does it rely on jumpscares (this game isn't really scary at all) but it does have some violent, creepy, and to some, disturbing content.While nothing about this game will blow your mind there is very little that dissapoints.  The story is somewhat predictable, and as a mystery you'll generally figure something out before you character does so it's not a brain challenger.  There is no combat in this game, and only minimal action which is easily overcome and there are no traditional puzzles. Puzzles amount mostly to selecting relevant information from a list of choices about a specific question.If I have any gripes about this game it's that sometimes the controls can wonk out on you where you'll be posessing a body and your controller stops functioning altogether.  There was one instance where one insignificat ghost was talking but I heard no sound.  And some of teh minor characters could have had more background lore on them.  And lastly one of the gameplay aspect, helping other ghosts, was used too little.  Started off good but fades away a lot as teh game progresses.  Also no manual saves, only checkpoint saves and that can be a problem in a couple of areas, but nothing major.  Also, the game is short.  11 hours in and I am almost finished with it.All in all if you like creepy settings, ghost stories, mysteries,  and gathering collectible lore this game has it surrounded by a good setting .  If you're looking for something challenging look elsewhere a sther eis not much in teh way of combat and puzzles.  This is a slow paced, story focused, adventure game, not a supernatural shooter.I highly recommended for the mystery/ghost story lover.			"

You just run around and fetch clues for the story to progress.  Then there are these awful demons in the game and the combat is a buggy mess.  It never works right leaving you either finding them easy to deal with or raging at how the controls just refuse to respond to your commands.

												The ghost of a good gameThe PC version of MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT is on a hiding to nothing right from the start, when you first encounter the abysmally clumsy UI. No effort whatsoever has been made to make the PC experience a smooth one and this frustrates and annoys throughout the game. And then there are the graphics to consider, which are below par when compared to other games from 2014, and the absence of any physics, which is also a disappointment. The gameplay itself is thoroughly unremarkable, the city of Salem is a dull and lifeless place, and the combat (a horrible QT-based system that requires the mashing of random keys and mouse buttons) is laughably poor. Basically you spend most of your time in MSS pixel hunting with the occasional button-spamming session thrown in. So what’s good about it? Well, the premise behind the game is an interesting one and the story involving enough (just) to keep me playing through to the end. The voice acting is good throughout, and you get to play as a cat, which is cool. Sadly, however, the opportunity to make a good game out of these positive aspects has been missed. 2.25/5			"

												        I could not recomend this game to anyone expecting engageing gameplay or meaningful motivation to seak out the many hidden clues litttered through this game. After spending a breif yet adequate amount of time with this game i had found myself stuck twice hunting for the very last clue in one of the games closed ""investigate"" areas usaly holding about twelve clues scattered around containing only three releven ones and yet deming it necisary to hinder your progress untill such a time you find all of them then opening a blande menus houseing all the clues and instructing you  to chose the correct three gradeing you on which of three chances you guess correct and utterly discarding of all the other clues they had just forced you to find.          So I didnt like the story so what it has several side storys for your to hunt down like collecting 10 scattered water heaters, and 16 1970s era jurry cans with a cardbord sign taped to them labled ""need gas"" or somthing similar to that. hell I even had to walk circles around a drunk driving incident collecting trinkets only to discover i just had to wander to a gas sation around the corrnor and reinact a breif memory of who was driving the car that killed every one else within.       I would liken it to collecting the feathers in Assassins Creed 2 only instead of being thanked by an old lady for catching them all you get a dim blue menu containing a half-cliche half-based-in-fact story of a murder with its boring white text and mediocre plot that was given away by the name of the side quest.  And this trend did not seem to be destined to reced as the game progressed if anything it slowly grew more mundane and trivial as i progressed forward.       That being said I admit i was only willing to devote three hours to this game with the only true interaction with the game's enviroment came from a breif few moments in possesion of a cat to platform your way to the top of a building and do you know what wonderful prized awaited me....remember those jurry cans i was speaking about erlier, their was one of some rediculuse number suposedly littering the game. It is always a posiblility that the game does a complete 180 at the last moment but i dont hold high hopes. So no i canot recomend this game to anyone exspecting anything but trivial collectable insperations to make a game. This doesnt mean the storys within where not enjoyable but they mostly seemed more likly to belong in the local tabloids rather than a ""detective"" game.			"

												Would have been better as a movie than a game.The puzzles are weak and easy.The specter ""fighting"" is shoehorned in, not fun at all and just annoying.The entire game is basically just a collecting simulatorThat being said, I doubt it'd even make a good movie.The only thing this entire game has going for it is the pretty unique concept of being a ghost trying to solve a mystery. That's where it ends			"

												Honestly, this game was a massive disappointment. I remember being super pumped to play this when it first came out, but despite having such an interesting concept, the story just fell to pieces in the end. I won't spoil it for you if you want to try it yourself, but they definitely tried for a whole ""mind blow"" ending and failed horribly. Just... truly atrocious. Very predictable and, frankly, bizarre. I was left very unsatisfied. I won't even go into the gameplay in depth, just know... boring. Bland. I just became annoyed at enemies and didn't really find them challenging so much as I found them an irritant. Their screaming ended up just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off more than anything else. The best part was being the cat to be entirely honest. I joked about how the game would have been vastly improved if you'd just played like that the entire time. I sincerely do not recommend, but feel free to form your own opinion. (I'd play it at a discount or borrow a friend's copy).			"

			This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/233290 A non-biased quick look @ 'Murdered: Soul Suspect' - Wow, this game just blew me away, it's so refreshing to have a unique game...		

Wow, this game just blew me away, it's so refreshing to have a unique game style and direction. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a supernatural detective thriller which challenges players to solve possibly the hardest case of all… their own murder. When Ronan O’Connor, a detective with a chequered past, gets caught up in a violent burglary, his life is brought to an untimely end by a brutal and relentless killer. Shocked to find himself in the afterlife, his only escape from the limbo world of ‘Dusk’ is to uncover the truth behind his killer, track him down and bring him to justice using his detective instinct and new-found supernatural abilities. As Ronan, you have the freedom to explore the modern-day town of Salem: its New England-style wooden houses, narrow streets, gothic churches and mental asylum for clues. Battle demonic spirits to save your soul and uncover the shocking revelations about who is responsible for your death. - Highly Recommended!			"

 DON'T BUY THIS GAME I fortunately bought it on sale so it wasn't that expensive, but I haven't gotten to play it AT ALL. I've tried launching it a bunch of times but it doesn't work, it crashes before it's even started. I don't know if it's just a bug on my computer but all other games work perfectly so I'd doubt it. I'm very sorry but I definitely can't recommend a game that isn't even possible to play. "

												Do you like ghosts? Do you like the supernatural and paranormal? Do you like hats and detectives and investigations? Do you like short games ideal for the busy people and that you can 100% in a sane amount of time?If the answers to most of the above are ""Yes"", then this game is for you!The game runs perfectly fine, even on medium configurations thanks to the Unreal Engine of Wonders that Runs on Almost Everything. Story-wise it could've been slightly better (the game appears to take place in the span of a long night and, given its length, I think they intended to make it so) but hopefully there wasn't much pretentiousness. Just a good old compendium of ghosts stories and lore about Salem.There is no shooting in this game so look elsewhere if you were planning on murdering from the afterlife.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very intriguing noir-style adventure-game and experience. You experience + play the game as Ronan - who is a cop that gets killed by this serial killer only known as The Bell Killer that he's chasing; becomes a ghost; and is trying to find out who killed him + why. Not only that, but Ronan is also trying to find out why the Killer has been also killing people. The game is set in Salem, Massachusetts - which is widely known historically for the Salem Witch Trials; and is an excellent setting for this game's story. Throughout the game, Ronan is on this mission of finding the killer - and embarks on this excellent story that any fan of noir, thrillers, and murder-mysteries should experience just for that alone.Ronan is a ghost. With that, Ronan comes by some interesting abilities. Ronan can jump into their bodies and possess them. Ronan can influence other NPC's to do things, once he has possessed them. Ronan can even possess cats and even more around in their body. Ronan can read their minds. Ronan later on can even teleport to hard to reach areas or out of danger, similar to the Blink ability in Dishonored for Corvo + Daud. In one of the most legit uses of letting your character clip through walls, doors, and even other human beings. You can manipulate objects like a poltergeist - such as TV's (so they go static) and printers (and knock the paper out) to distract enemies. All of this is at first very odd and strange - but this is also makes this game interesting, unique, very cool, and very different; especially once you get used to it.Unfortunately, there are stealth sequences in the game. Not that this game needed any, since they feel so half-baked and are, for the most part, not fun. A great concept is in place: since ghosts and their residue linger, you can teleport to these spots to hide. You have to avoid demons, who when nearby have a lethal scream that can damage you and even possibility kill you. If you can get behind the enemy, you can attack them and one-shot kill them - which feels like a Quick-Time Event that tells you what button + movement on the gamepad (yes, I played this with an X360 gamepad - by the way; and it played fine with that). In theory, this all sounds pretty cool - but, it really isn't. It's not executed that well. Unfortunately, these elements feel half-baked and you can die very easily. Not only that, but like many games with auto-saves, don't be surprised if the game reloads at place that's a bit away from you'd have liked the save to have been at; and/or have to do a certain section over and over many times that really shouldn't need to be done again b/c the save was so poorly placed (i.e. before a cut-scene, at a long-winded walk before you reach a location where the saved should've been).Sometimes, you'll be escorting a character safely from one spot to another - and your objective is to move + manipulate objects like a poltergeist, just to distract them so the NPC can move from one location to another. These elements are very cool and really play into the ghost theme that the game is going on in this game. These certainly were much better than the stealth elements than were in the game.When investigating crime-scenes or locations, whether on the main quest or the very few story-based side-quests - you often have to find a handful or so of clues, more or less, in the game-world or specific game area. Sometimes, you then have to also answer a few questions (that you're asking yourself - or well, the game is asking, as you're piecing the story and events together); and come by the right answer to push the plot + stort forward. When investigating: you are scored from 1-3 badges. Don't make mistakes, you get 3 badges. Make another mistake, 2 badge-score. Make more than that, 1-star score - no matter what. There's no real punishment for failing - there's no reload screen for failing; and/or you aren't really aren't scored with a total score on how well or poorly you did. So, there's no real consequences for failing - you can pick the wrong answer, get a 1 score, and not even worry about your score. You could guess, if you can't figure out the answer - narrowing it down via trial and error, if you feel so inclined.There are plenty of collect-a-thons for side quests. From finding info about your character, to seeing old memories, and other things - the game is loaded w/ collectibles. Many of these, they actually do reveal more about the Salem setting, Salem's history, the game-world, the killer, and the characters in the story. So, if you want to get the most out of this game's story, setting, atmosphere, and characters - you'll likely want to find a good deal of these. Finding this stuff certainly actually does enhance the already interesting, fantastic & excellent story.Performance on this game with most things on higher settings on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB VRAM GeForce GTX 560 Ti; 16 GB RAM) at 1080p was a bit over the place, frequently jumping between 35-60 frames. Locking VSync On to half-refresh rate via the NVidia Panel certainly solved this problem, keeping the game regularly not budging at all from 30 frames per second. While the graphics in this game do look good, they certainly are not the best technical quality that is out there.After the 10 hours or so I spent with this game, according to Steam - the mystery was over. I came to the game's conclusion - thrilled with the plot, story, game-world, setting, and characters. But, I was certainly not thrilled and often frustrated with the game's half-baked stealth elements. While I do wish the game had more story-based side quests + that the game's (so-called) ""puzzles"" were a bit harder, I still came away really enjoying a good deal of the actual experience itself. If only the gameplay elements - namely, the stealth elements - were improved quite a bit (or removed entirely), we'd certainly be talking about the best adventure game of 2014. Fans of murder-mysteries, the supernatural, and noir - if you can tolerate the not-so-great stealth elements, this game most definitely should be experienced alone for its setting, story + character elements.Final Grade = B-			"

												Pretty average game. The core mechanic consists of searching around for objects, something similar to most collecting sidequests in modern games, which becomes boring very fast. Occasionally, you'll have to connect some of the clues you find, though these are mostly very obvious. There are also sporadic stealth-combat sections, but like the rest of the game, these offer no challenge at all.The presentation is also average. While the games looks very nice, the character design is uninspired and most character models are used over and over. The music is sparse, and while usually fitting the mood, it gets boring due to repetition. The story is uninteresting, has a lot of cliches and is mostly forgettable, though there are a couple of twists.This is not a bad game by any means and I can appreciate the hard work put into this. While I dislike writing bad reviews, with so many better options out there, it's hard to recommend this one.			"

Positives:+ Interesting Story and main character+ Graphic Style is impressive+ Voice Acting is generally well done+ Lots of items / snippets of information to collect to flesh out the backgroundNegatives:- Combat is extremely basic and probably could have just been left out- Controls are a bit annoying.  You have to stand at exactly the right distance and angle to interact with many objects, and if you need to do this in a hurry or can't find something, this can get frustrating- Very limited side quests- More ""invisible walls"" than needed in a game where one of the draws is being able to walk through things- Story is fairly short (I finished in 7.5 hours and took my time wandering around, it can probably be finished in 6 hours or less if you rushed through the main story)Comments:A game with an enjoyable story and character, but extremely limited combat and somewhat frustrating controls.  It's too short for me to recommend at full price ($29.99), but worth a playthrough if you can pick it up on sale.Overall Rating: 7/10 "

												I really tried to like this game, its a fun little game with too many flaws to recommend it to anyone.The story starts strong and interesting but falls flat midway and the ending is horrible.Characters are dull and one dimensional something that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is how our protagonist is always running around with a smoke in his hand like WTF ?Voices are ok music is ok and what little gameplay is also ok...Can't say I hated the time I spend with the game but you have to be a special breed and like these types of game for what they are.Me I liked my 13 hour playthrough but I really dont recommend it.4/10			"

												It's decent, but it's not worth the full price. Since it's kinda short, and the controls feels clunky. Not to mention the annoying autosave function (meaning you can't save manually). Good story with a nice twist at the end, the demons in the game though feels thrown in to give you a failure state. They get annoying fast. Could've used more voice actors, same people voices almost every male/female npc.Worth it? Meh... it's ok. Get it if you love ghosts, otherwise can't recommend it.			"

												E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was once called the worst game of our time. It was so bad, it was credited with bringing down the very industry that helped create it.Murdered: Soul Suspect is every bit as terrible, and if Square Enix had decided to release it in proportionately similar numbers, the videogame industry would surely once again have been brought to its knees.That may seem harsh, but you're looking at a game that lets you possess cats without ever making it fun, or interesting. Let that sink in, for I still don't know how it is even possible.Sadly, today there's no way for us to tear it from its digital unlife within the Steam network, and consign it to it's rightful place at the bottom of a deep hole, in a landfill somewhere around Almagordo, New Mexico. Instead, it will simply continue this undignified existence as a warning to developers and gamers alike, of just how bad a game can turn out.I cannot fathom the depths of malice and perversion that must have possessed Square Enix, in order for them to bring this game to market. The fact that it is still being sold, is nothing short of a declaration of contempt for you as a gamer, and a consumer.Do not buy it. Do not accept it as a gift. I beg you. Forget this game, and then forget you ever read this. Please, just go on - Blissfully free from the notion that it ever existed.			"

												Frame rate capped at 30 and for something that doesn't look that great is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. For a square Enix game I'm very disappointed, the story is somewhat original but the gameplay is glitchy and handles terribly. The main activity of the game is to point out evidence of a crime scene and use ""detective skills"" (read as trial and error) to determine what happened. There seems to be no fail if you choose everything wrong despite having three attempts.It's not a bad game but it's not worth $60, had it have been cheaper then I'd recommend it however if you want this then I suggest waiting until the summer sales and a price drop.

												If you are a fan of alan wake or L.A Noire, then don't play this. I felt they could have done so much more with this game, there is no sense of urgency when you have to take out demons. The ""investigation"" sections are repetative and offer no real challenge and there are no consequences for ""guessing"" conclusions to the investigations. As for the story, it's not bad but I never felt like it drew me in, and the plot twists were quite predictable. Graphically this game is quite pretty and gives off a spooky vibe. I feel they could have done more with the battle system, since there really isn't one, as well as done more with the open world provided, there is no real incentive to go and explore the world apart from the option collectibles which offer nothing more than bits of lore about the history of the town and events. I felt this game COULD have been the next Alan Wake but the developers fell horribly short. I felt no sense of achievement in finishing this game in a little more than 6 hours.4/10 - wouldn't recommend.			"

Rating: 7.5/10    |     Murdered: Soul Suspect To apriciate this game you have to play it for yourself. Atmosphere in this game is creepy and at the same time mysterious. While the main story is great I also enjoed additional storys unlocked after finding collectibles. Possesing people is a bit limited and so is exploring Salem, but its worth checking to know more about Salems past and his residents. Graphics are fantastic and looks similar to next gen titles like Infamous Second Son.Overall if you like games like Alan Wake, Heavy Rain or Infamous Second Son, you have to try Murdered: Soul Suspect.PROS: + Great main story + Awesome main character+ Voice acting+ Beautiful graphics+ Investigating crime scenes+ Cat possesion sequences+ Mystery and creepy atmoshere+ Creepy unlockable storys(collectibles)+ Easter eggsCONS:- short (main story took me about 8 hours)- QTE when fighting demons- no chapter selection after ending- sometimes stutters on cutscenes			"

												Plot 5/10:The game relies on one of the most overused tropes in regards to Salem's history for it's primary plot. At least in high schools in Mississippi, The Crucible is required reading. Any experience with it and you'll have guessed the killer's name by the time you first meet. The only thing that will come as a shock is who the person targets and manipulates.Gameplay: 4/10It was playable, but the audio would skip occasionally in cutscene, the game stuttered regularly, and the ""stealth or not"" portions were absurdly easy. You'll be forgetting to hold down a button for getting rid of demons more than you'll actually be bothered by them. Also, the walking through walls, possessing people, and such loses its flair pretty quickly. Especially considering half of the NPCs share the exact same 2 lines of inner monologue when you possess them even though they're 15 feet apart, and that's not exaggeration. Plus, you'll spend the majority of the extremely short story trying to look for the clues that require you to aim directly at them before the prompt appears. Extremely frustrating at times.Overall, your best bet is to not waste your money till this game goes on sale.			"

												This game is poorly executed and I would not recommend to buy it for more than a few bucks. If you're really into lame storytelling and unintriguing gameplay, you should give it a go. Otherwise you should maybe try other great Adventure games out there. :-/			"

												Do not buy if you are left-handed and play left-handed, or if you have missing fingers on your left hand, or if  you are disabled on the left side.The half-baked people in charge of Key Re-mapping were in the toilet with a gay-magazine when they were supposed to be finalising a different release.Vermin.Might be ok on a console otherwise. might not.

												Be aware that this game might be quite buggy. It would crash at cutscenes and be a bit stuttery but I googled the problem and found fixes that worked so I could enjoy this game. Not a brilliant PC port.The game itself was fun with a good story. I liked the way the protagonist and the other characters were acted and voiced, i.e they weren't annoying. It has some fun side quests and interesting law. I know want to visit Salem in RL even more.So prepare for some bugs but you should manage to enjoy the game eventually. ;)			"

												I am the type of gamer that looks to sit back and relax on a unique story and this game won't disappoint. The graphics aren't really that great and the world could use a better design but the story and the idea of being a ghost detective as you explore the mystery of your killer it's hard to pass. I rate this game to be better than good but I don't think $50 is a fair price. I recommend to wait for a price drop.			"

												I was interested in this game from the moment of its announcement, and now having played it, I definitely do not regret the purchase. It has a very interesting twist right at the beginning and overall it reminds me of a blend of a number of games, including Blade Runner and Max Payne, however odd that might sound. I most certainly haven't seen all of it yet, but the effects, possibilities and abilities you have as a spirit are well implemented. Your main character being a spirit is certainly believable. The amount of interaction is just right and the story so far as interesting as it is sad.The only major problem and complaint I have with this game is the inability to remap key bindings for any of the controls. Considering the game is Unreal engine based, that is neither understandable, nor really acceptable. However, having found a way around this problem (see my guide at the end of this review), ""Murder: Soul Suspect™"" is as playable as it is fun. If you enjoy a spooky, dark and well told detective story, then this is definitely for you!Please check out my guide that can help with using different key bindings:

			Murder: Sould Suspect™ will not allow you to remap your key bindings and game controls, and for people like me, who for various reasons don't like the default controls, this should help to resolve the issue.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an interesting witch tale set in modern times.The game itself is a very linear experience. It is semi-open world, otherwise I'd call it a movie-on-rails. Salem, the town the game is based in and which is the main hub, can be explored at will and travel from there to the various other destinations as they become available. Everyplace can be returned to later as you see fit. Unfortunately there is no map and that can be a little frustrating when intentionally exploring rather than progressing the story forward. There is a digital collectibles map, I'm aware of, but because this game came with my video card, I did not receive access to that map.This game is easy. The only enemies, Demons, are token representatives of resistance which only serve to draw out the amount of time you spend in a few areas rather than actually representing a challenge to be overcome. They are simply annoying obstacles. The game would have been better without them, in my opinion, as they just slowed down the story, which was frustrating at times. Investigations are the main action the player goes through to progress the story forward at each juncture. They are similar to those in LA Noire, although they are far simpler to investigate. You will search the scene for clues and then pick the most important clues. Several times clues seemed much too obvious and I overthought them, choosing wrong, believing something much more subtle was going on. But don’t worry; your rating on investigation outcomes is meaningless. The most obvious answers are, unfortunately, the correct answers. This game is not subtle in the least. So don’t come looking for a challenge in either enemies or story puzzle elements.There is a great deal of collectible items. If the game narrative is one half of the game, the collectibles are the other half- they make up a significant proportion of the story, in the form of supplemental background information and well written ghost story videos. These are not difficult to locate, most can be found without any effort at all. Good news for those who are practically OCD about collectibles or achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s, as there are plenty of achievements for collecting. In summary, it’s a good story to experience one but is not really worth replaying. If you like easy, single player games with modern day fantasy stories, this game may be for you. I definitely recommend buying this game if it is on sale, you really can’t go wrong. It is bug free and complete out of the box, no need to worry about patches or the possibility of DLC. This game is pretty much a console port, so it worked with, and felt designed for, my Xbox 360 controller. "

												This is a highly underrated game, I don't know why the critics gave it such a low score. I had a great time playing it and I think it had a good story. But I do understand that this game isn't for everyone. It is a laid back game with a slow pace since you spend most of your time searching for clues. There isn't much in the way of action which could be a turn off for some, but if you loved the old point and click style exploration games from the 80s and 90s then you will probably enjoy this game too.

												A fun distraction, it's a game that feels like it almost makes it.The detective parts spoonfeed you. Fighting the demons is rather dull, it's a QTE-to-win.If you're playing this, you're playing this for the story only, the gameplay is poor and just isn't that entertaining.Saying that I finished it, so the plot is entertaining.The collectables aren't too challenging to find besides the chalk hidden in the walls one, yet trying to mouse over the sweet spot to reveal them is oftentimes a chore.Play it for the story, don't expect much from the gameplay.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect unfortunately fails to achieve the goals it set out to do, delivering a mediocre story behind trivial puzzle mechanics whilst hiding its best aspects in a tedious treasure quest. I won’t deny that I had my hand in this as when I heard about the concept I immediately started drawing comparisons to Heavy Rain in my head and there are few games, in my mind, that come close. Still even taking that into consideration Murdered: Soul Suspect feels like a decidedly average game, failing to evoke the kind of emotional investment required by a game of this nature.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/06/20/murdered-soul-suspect-its-never-easy-moving-on/ "

												TIme to find out you're not as invincible as you once thought. TL;DR - I give it 7/10. If you love being the detective and you love ghost stories, then definitely get this game. However, there are enough ""cons"" that make me suggest you wait until it's on sale. Longer review below. Despite it's short ""running time"", (took me 11 hours to complete), I feel in love with Soul Suspect. This game is not about combat or shooting things. It's about detective work, it's about figuring out how to sovle your murder and stop a serial killer even though you can't touch things in the physical world. On the whole, Soul Suspect feels like an experiment, an enjoyable one, but still an experiment. People complain about the ""lack of combat"", but in my opinion they should've cut out the whole system, it became repetitive and just downright annoying. The devs should've focused more on the story, which is what's at the heart of this game.Althought your character, Ronan, seems like your typical white dude, he has a refreshing personality, and he actually changes over the course of the game. Same goes for your ""sidekick"", Joy. The ending feels rushed, and more interactions with the characters you've met along the way or one more investigation could've tied the whole thing together. Even letting the character roam the town of Salem some more afterwards would've been a great opportunity for the devs to include some bonus missions. Overall, it's enjoyable, it's pretty creepy, and you just have to approach it like it's an interactive detective movie, not a ""shoot em up"".			"

												The idea of this game is fantastic, and the story is interesting enough to make you think about it when you stop playing.Overall, the atmosphere helps the immerision, so it had everything to be one of those games you never forget.But...There are 3 things that were VERY annoying to me:1. ""Combat"": The demons that appear once in a while and can actually kill you, forcing you to restart from the last checkpoint were simply unecessary. It is not a challenge, hiding and waitng for the right time to kill them is just an annoyance. They're also not scary at all. They just kill the tension when they appear as you are exploring somewhere, finding clues, wondering what the hell is going on, or just admiring the nice graphics. They kill the atmosphere. If at least the encounters were better developed, with real stealth strategy, it could be cool. But no, it just makes you wonder if continuing playing is worth the trouble.2. Collections: It is nice to search for hidden items, that help you picture the background story of the characters, and understand the history of the city (which is very cool, made me think about visiting it someday). But there are just too many, some of them really hard to find (specially when the cursor has to be at a very specific position to collect it), and each one adds almost nothing to the story. The fragments are just too small, and that makes you lose interest in finding them after a while. Some of them are directly connected to the story, and can hint you at what is really going on (it is very easy to figure out the whole mystery if you pay attention), but after some time you just say ""nevermind, let's continue with the story"", and forget about them.3. ""The most relevant Clue"": This made me stop playing the game after the first minutes of gameplay. (But of course, after a while I gave it another shot and finished it). There are times during an investigation that you have to select the most relevant clue you found at that place to continue, or link an older clue to new developments. The concept is very nice, but it doesn't work. You can't think logically to find out which is the correct one. You have to wonder what the writers had in mind when they created that part. Sometimes it just doesn't make sense (and apparently you have infinite tries, so what's the point, anyway?) I'll just give an example: At the beggining, there is a part where you have to select which information in a cop's notes is the most important one. I selected the one that to me was obviously the most intriguing detail, and any cop in the world would immediately investigate that. But no, the ""correct"" answer was somthing obvious, with nothing really interesting about it. After some minutes, guess what happens? Yes, Ronan (the main character) decides to investigate that thing that the game wanted you to think was not relevant at all.Anyway, even with these flaws, I loved the game, and definitely recommend it to everyone who likes mysteries, and investigative games in general. It is worth it.			"

												My copy of the game is broken.  I am stuck in the police War Room and nothing I do will trigger the additional officer to come in so that I can finish the investigation.  If the game were better I might have the patience to go back and start over, but after investing several hours into it only to get stuck at this point, I'm done until they patch this game.  I can't recommend a game that has game-breaking glitches like this.  Stay far away.			"

												Awsome game!It's something new and original, something you won't see often these days.I played for about 16 hours to complete it with all it's side quests and most of the collectibles, that reveal some nice story elements.Didn't find all of them yet, though.While the graphics are fantastic, the textures and animations of all non story relevant characters are pretty low.Their movement is kind of stiffm their textures low res and on that many of them even share the same textures.Since Salem, the town where everything will tak eplace in, is pretty small, you will have the feeling to run across the same five npcs the whole time.That said, it might even hurt the game concept if it was bigger.Everywhere in the open explorable town, are notes and similar collectibles hidden. Despite Salem's small proportions, those collectibles can be pretty tough to find, since you won't come across them if you aren't searching for them.Among notes and ghosts and humans  with trivial conversations, you happen to meet some ghosts with their own problems.If you find one, a side quest opens up and you can help them to get rid of their problems and move on.The system to help them is the same as in the main story line.The Main story line uses a puzzle system which repeats itself with every quest, but does never get old at the same time.Since you are a former detective, you will investigate each place, lokking for hints and combine them to find where to go next.Those hints are aquired and combined by many different actions to assure varied gameplay.The story itself is very atmospheric and intense with a good soundtrack alongside.The story characters have all an own personality which is intentionally used to drive the players sympathies.All of them are important in their own way and no one of them is forgotten quickly.Technically is some room for improvement.There are some minor bugs, graphically and not affecting but common.I came along one game breaking bug which forced me to reload an old checkpoint. Saving is done automatically and fair placed, though.Hitting some walls will let Ronan twitch around for a second while some other walls, intended to vanish at will, can't be targeted to do so. Luckily, there is always another way around.In the end I would give this game a 7 out of 10, strongly recommending it to experience something new.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect takes a fascinating part of American history and pairs it with a supernatural detective story.  The environment and plot is very creative and unique and kept me interested until the end.  The game is fairly short and doesn't overstay its welcome, yet still provides a lot of character and plot development as well as a few twists.  That being said, there are two minor downfalls to this game.  The first is the overuse of collectibles.  While the collectibles are easy enough to find and doesn't require too much 'post game time' to sit down and sniff them out, there are still a ton of them.  Over 170 in fact.  Each collectible gives some sort of backstory to the world or relevent major characters, but the sheer number of them will have you running to pick them up first before doing the actual story missions.  I feel this can really take the player out of the setting and mood Murdered: Soul Suspect tried to create, with its old, colonial, haunted theme.  If you are the type of player to skip right over collectibles and not be bothered, then this isn't a problem for you.  But if you are OCD, have to get them all, hear every backstory, learn every secret, then this will probably get on your nerves a bit.The other issue to this game is that some of the puzzles are unclear as to how you should go about solving them.  While this has only happened to me about maybe 15% of the puzzles in the game, it is still frustrating to look up the answer and say to yourself 'How does that make sense?'.  The game does give hints if you get the puzzle wrong, but sometimes the hints aren't that clear.  With some trial and error, you should be ok though.Overall, I enjoyed this game.  I picked it up when it was $4 and would have gladly paid $20 for it.  The setting and plot were really unique and I liked all of the ghost mechanics that were added into the game.  It is definitely a game to play when you are looking to get a good story with some amusing puzzles.  I rate this game a 9/10.			"

												A unique perspective on a Mystery Story! This kept me up playing all night, I couldn't force myself to stop.While the Mystery wasn't all that hard to solve (Figuring out before the story does is the Best part of any good mystery) it was entertaining to go through the discovery interactively like this and keeping the setting smaller gives it a leg up over other Investigative games like LA Noire (which became tedious really quick)Would have prefered a longer story line but I'll replay at least a couple of times all the same "

												First of all you must know that you are not buying this game for the action, but rather the originality and the story. You want fight hordes of enemies, and you won't be facing tons of types of enemies. Actualy if I didnt miss anything there is nothing more than demons, wich give it like one kind of foe.The graphics for this game are quite amazing, it's on the same edge as L.A Noir, wich is a beauty visualy. There is much more than graphics borrowed from L.A Noir style, but since we don't have many games of that type with this level of quality.The game isn't long, around 8 hours, without getting every collectibles, wich bring me to the biggest downside of this game, except for the originality , the graphics and story , there is nothing toward replay value, maybe if they bring futur DLC witch I doubt.I dont agree with the meta critics, but i bet the replay value hit a lot!For sure anybody who ain't got lots of cash to spend everywhere, I do recommended that you wait for a proce drop! Would say at least 50 %.			"

												Aside from the game being annoyingly laggy at times (not always) and the occasional inconvenient bug here and there, I played through the story line to the end and I absolutely LOVED it.  There's that moment of realization when you're like ""OH MY GOD IT WAS *nope not gunna spoil it ;)*"".The game play isn't the best and you can't do a whole lot other than follow the main story line.  And the missions are all kinda the same, What happened here, fight these demons, what happened over here, possess the cat to move to next area, what happened here. BUT I still loved the game.  I guess its just one of those games where if you try to describe it, it doesnt sound all that good, but once you play it, you'll love it. Play it.			"

												This game is quite unusual in comparison to the others, and that's the main point of its success. The options are unusual: you can possess, influence on smbd, read the mind and execute the demons. You walk through the game as a ghost, and the main objective is to solve your murder. Despite of this, you are also able to solve the other victim's murders while revealing the hidden items. After you found all the clues on a particular problem, the game proceeds with the next video part that tells you smth. more about your own. AND THAT'S ALL. Nothing more. It becomes boring, especially for those who do not like repetitive cycles. There is nothing scary in the game, it just makes you bored. My advice is: buy this game only if you like what I described above or if you are reach enough to spent around $60 to explore HQ video and the graphics and to satisfy your curiosity.			"

												While I enjoyed the game enough to actually finish it, the overall experience felt very unpolished.What I Liked:-Lovable Characters: I liked all the characters. The voice acting was really great, and I cared about Ronan and Joy; a lot of fun and interesting interactions between the two of them.-A completionist's dream: All sorts of stuff to collect, and fun little stories to unlock if you're into that sort of thing.-Interesting Storyline: The story was surprisingly original, outside of a few painfully predictable points. Original or not, it was interesting and kept my playing.What I Hated:-Sloppy Game Mechanics: Game mechanics were a mess. Especially the dialogue options. You enter a cutscene for each dialogue choice, and the break is very obvious. Once the cutscene ends, there's another obvious break, and you get to choose another dialogue option. It was strange and killed the immersion.-Investigations: Basically a hidden objects game. Walk around, find anything and everything it actually lets you examine until it says you've found all the clues. Then guess which one is relative to the current case. Easy and oh-so boring.-Felt Unfinished: A lot of the powers were pretty useless save for one or two very rare, very unique moments where the game practically screams at you: USE THIS POWER! Teleportation could've been really cool, but there's only a few spots it actually comes in handy, and even then it's super clunky and annoying. A lot of useless hiding spots you'll never use, no matter what, never ever. They're just there for the aesthetics, I guess? Just looked messy to me. And while the start of the game seems to promise a lot of interesting side investigations -- helping to put spirits to rest -- there are very few to actually be found as the game progresses, at least, that I could find.-Enemies: Demons. . .could've been scary, but instead they're just annoying. They walk (float?) a predetermined route. You do the exact same thing to kill them (quick time event). There's no real combat in the game, or even a sense of urgency. You just hide, quick-time kill an enemy when he turns his back on you, repeat.-Cats: O. . .M. . .G Fun at first, but then, seriously, WHY is the SAME black cat everywhere in Salem? You know what, I think that friggin cat might be the killer! Shows up in the most convenient places, always there when I need it. . .what's it playing at? Or maybe it's different cats, all brothers and sisters. . .with absolutely no way to tell them apart. . .? Maybe? And seriously, what is the point of pressing ""Q"" to ""Meow""?I enjoyed the game, it was fun in its own ways. Mostly it was a story that was nice to experience. But MURDERED: Soul Suspect is NOT a $50 game. Maybe $20. So no, can't recommend it.			"

												A pretty good whodunit detective game. Most investigations can be beat by brute force, but that nets you overall less points. The games best selling point is it's creepy atmosphere and the offer of playing as a ghost and playing as a ghost is quite frankly a lot of fun. I dare you to not veer around trashcans and aim for doorways in the first few hours when you could infact just pass through the wall or something instead.You use abilities such as possession, mind reading, memory tracing and teleportation to accomplish your goals.The games weak parts is it's lenght, it's on the short side. And the enemies scattered around, quite frankly i feel that the game would have been better without enemies at all and just more detectiving. Every enemy encounter goes like this: You are startled by a loud scream, you hide nearby, wait for them to turn their back and then kill them with a QTE. It's just a hassle, not scary, not fun and they are in the way. Thankfully there aren't many enemies at all in the game.All in all i really recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect if you want to think a bit for yourself, fantasize about the beyond, are a bit of a history buff, are into creepy atmospheres or ghosts, just looking for a mystery or all of the above. A very pleasant surprise.			"

												First, the bads;1.  I'm not sure if it ported to PC or not, but it really not well optimize for PC, felt kinda sluggy when playing it but not game breaker, still bearable.2. Collectible, too much of it.  Instead of providing side cases, this game use collectible to lengthy the game.3. It is really simple game, point and click adventure, with some ghost busting action.Now, the goods;1. Good story telling if not great, on the main story.  Side story, hit and miss, mostly hit.2. Right length for this kind of game, if you looking to collect all collectible, it will not take to much time, if you just want to just go with main story, it will not be too short either.  It just nice.3. That ""some ghost busting action"" pretty fun.4. You can possess a cat.  A freaking CAT!In all, for do you recommend this game, I can concludeYes - If you don't mind how the gameplay or mechanic is, and you more interested in story.No - If you don't care about the story, just want to have fun with the gameplay.

												One of the best games I've played in recent memory. Brilliant murder-mystery detective game. The demons in the game are honestly the most terrifying I've come across in a long time, making for some qenuinely tense moments.The sound design stands out by far as the best aspect. Graphics are great, but the sound design blew me away.  I would highly recommend this game (though maybe not for full asking price. If you get the chance to purchase it for under €20, go for it!)The only qualm I have is that you can't return to the town to discover any incomplete artifacts that you missed after you've finished the game. Still, highly recommended.			"

												Let me save you the time, and let you know that while this will be a review, it is going to read as more of a rant than anything else. Understand going in that I am not going to recommend any one play this game, at all. The reasons will be detailed below, but I am writing this as a way of venting my frustrations with the game, and treating the main purpose of this as a ""buyers beware"" because let me tell you, I am not going to let the store page lie to you. I will get to that in a second. That being said, Murdered Soul Suspect is the most dissapointing game of the year for me. Hands down. When it comes to expectations (what little I had asked from it in the first place) Not only did they fail miserably, they somehow managed to fail at even the BASIC expectations.  So what were my expectations? I just wanted a good mystery game. Interact with the environment/clues, piece stuff together. Learn about the mystery and basically just immerse myself as a detective. It didn't have to be a compelling narrative or anything, but for the story, I at LEAST wanted a likable main character.  I didn't EXPECT an L.A. Noire esque mystery game, and I would have even allowed a Deadly Premonition esque kind of mystery game. But this......WHAT IS THIS?Where do I even begin with this game. I hope if you are foolish enough to read my tirade you will at least have the respect for yourself to have a snack. Buckle in boys and girls, here comes the salt.  I want to address the store page bullet points real quick. To get this out of the way now. It's a good starting point as any. I won't address them all, just the ones I object to, and you, the future buyer, deserve to know the truth of. -""A twisting storyline supported by a great cast of characters constantly raises questions over the secrets that Salem hides.""  This is cute. What great cast of characters? No. I am not being facetious, I mean what great cast of characters? Where are they? There are characters, sure, and I would have loved to learn more about them, but 75% of the cast occassionally drops in for that ol ""THEY COULD BE THE KILLER"" scooby doo schtick.  No in reality the game really only focuses on Ronan (main character) and Joy, his spirit medium. Every other character isn't any more developed than the last beyond fulfilling the cliche role they were intended to fulfill. There is no ""constantly raising questions over the secrets that Salem hides."" It's no secret. No, I want you as the reader, right now, to mentally say the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word Salem. If you said ""oh the Salem witch trials right?"" then you my friend, are one smart turkey. Tadah. Oh, and there is only one main twist. I don't know where this twisting storyline business comes from. That implies it's constantly twisting.-"" Move freely from one haunting location to the next and even if you have completed your investigation, return to previous scenes to follow new leads."" Sounds compelling right? By move freely they mean you are essentially in a little invisible walled off box, and boy let me tell you there are a TON of invisible walls. Yes, you can return to previous scenes, but ""to follow new leads?"" What on EARTH are you TALKING ABOUT? The only time you return to a previous scene is if you forgot some disposable optional collectible you wanted to collect for 100% completion that doesn't do jack for you unless you are trying to get all the achievements. None of this ""new lead"" bullcrap. You don't change the outcome of anything. You are merely just taking a guided tour through this game.-""Seek-out hundreds of collectibles, side-quests and cases from Salem’s citizens past to learn facts about the town and its people, improve your detective ranking and help you piece together the truth about the killer."" If there was ever a burning point I wanted to address, it's this one. This one, singular sentence on their page. It's complete false advertising. First off, while there are a COUPLE hundred (not hundreds) of collectibles, there are NOT hundreds of sidequests and cases from Salem's citizens. There are FOUR cases (not a typo) where you help out deceased citizens, and  EIGHT collectible sidequests that reveal a story of a previous murder not really tied to the main quest murders. The other collectibles that involve the main quest killer? They don't help you piece together ANYTHING about the killer other than he likes killing  and little blurbs from tabloids. How does that HELP anything? and honestly, with how poorly fleshed out and planned the characters were, you can more or less figure out who the killer is within the first 2-3 hours of gameplay.  The twist was nice, but again, you kind of expect it. The really sucky part about all this is they should have done more with the sidequests involving helping the citizens come to term with their death. But no, you get 4 quests, and the other spirits you run into, you get a two choice branch that changes nothing and it just falls flat. Or hey! hey! better yet! more of those collectible stories involving the side murders but you know, without the cheap copout collectible requirements! MAKE THOSE ACTUAL MISSIONS.  It would have been a farcry better than what we actually received.-""Survive powerful demonic spirits who devour souls in a belief that they can regain their own. Strategically use supernatural abilities to evade and outwit them before they tear away your soul forever."" HAHAHHAHA, ""strategically?""  STRATEGICALLY?! Are you kidding me?! What STRATEGY? Wh-what, you mean, exploiting the terrible AI of the 3 enemies at any given moment by hiding in plain sight, waiting for them to lose aggro, then mashing a QTE prompt? Or, or, using the various distraction options available (j/king you can only distract them with one thing, a crow) and then rinsing and repeat? Get out of here with that nonsense. Stop dressing up this lazy nonsense to sound fancy. Shame on you.Now that is out of the way, let's talk ""gameplay."" Well, you can basically consider this game a semi-rails game. Or, more or less, a guided tour game. You aren't actually playing the game. I mean, yes,you are controlling Ronan, and he is responding to your controls, but literally 60% of the gameplay is you collecting stuff. It's like a giant collectible scavenger hunt. When you aren't collecting things that have no rhyme or reason or impact to the game, the other 40% of the game is you ""solving"" crime scenes. But, YOU aren't solving SQUAT. The GAME has that covered. Look, there is no penalty for guessing wrong or deducing something wrong. All the clues are in the same room. There is no interacting with clues. Hell, the game will sometimes literally zoom in on the primary clue in a cutscene before you even start, rendering all your clue collecting pointless. AND, when you DO have all the clues collected, guess what reader? The game is like, ""soooo what do you think happened"" and you piece together 1-3 of the clues to ""solve the scene."" BUT AGAIN, there is no penalty for failing. It's as braindead as you can possibly get. My favorite moment occurs when the killer is looking at a picture, and the game asks me ""Well, what do you think he is doing?"" and 6+ words flood the screen and you gotta figure out what he is doing. He is clearly startled and up to no good, and literally half the options are the exact opposite of the mood being displayed. What is this, Dora the Explorer? Agh... this game, I haven't even scratched much of the surface, there is so much I want to talk about. So much...so much rage. But I have already spent too much time talking about the game. Look, I don't like it. I think it's highway robbery they would seriously ask for $50 of YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY for this crap. TL;DR: I  hate this game.  "

												This game cuts a lot of corners, and in a bad way. I will start off by saying that you shouldn't expect anything innovative in terms of gameplay and story because there is literally nothing to this game. Have you played Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls? Remember how there was some gameplay in that? Take that,  but remove more of the gameplay and make it a noclip simulator 2014 edition because all you'll  be doing is walking around and looking at things. Slight spoilers ahead.The detective bits? Bland, and obvious as the story is. Sure you won't figure out who the killer is but you will pick up what the deal is with the Killer and still have the protagonist and everyone else bumping their heads into the walls being clueless. Anyone could of picked up the patterns since it was so obvious but near the end of the game that you'll be eager for it to end. Unless you're easy to please. Oh there's a twist to the plot but it doesn't make any gatdam difference to the plot nor does it change anything at all for the later part.Now let's get to gameplay, aka wonder around a building trying to navigate and occassionally posessing people just to influence. There's no point in posessing other people that aren't vital to the ""INVESTIGATE ZONE"" since they all have two lines in mind read and that's it. Reused model heads on different bodies and that's it, find a creeper ghost in some kid's closet only to find five more of him with multiple jobs. Investigate zones are what I like to call areas that you'll be trying to search every nook and cranny to find enough clues to conclude the level, and that itself is also really annoying. Most of the clues are hard to see, and I understand how it is but if I have to look hard through one big room just to realize I need to examine some bloody cat prints for no reason that aren't even remotely related to the case then what's the point? This game is more hollow than how I felt when I beat it.As for the supposed combat? Horrible. There's nothing to it, and it's the most bland thing you'll ever experience. The demons that you face are always set on a path, they won't hunt you down unless they see you nor explore any rooms other than the patrol paths that they'll never stray from. Killing them is also a chore. Press direction + button = instant victory. That's all to it. They're just there to hinder you and nothing else. They'll arrive in the area you just left and have to backtrack to because they can. You can't get by them either so you have to fight them. You can hide and wait patiently. It just feels like they threw them in there just ""because."" They don't have any real point to them other than to add more than just walking around and ""examine"" things.There are side quests though, and that's just more INVESTIGATE ZONES for you to burn time away in to make the game last longer. Will you get anything for it? No. There are collectables, will you get anything for it? No. Only thing you will get is achievements, and  that's it. There are no rewards, there's no good feeling having to help ghosts and frustrate yourself in INVESTIGATE ZONES that are so damn open or have clues so hidden that you can't complete it. A good example is one quest where you have to find out if a guy killed his friends or not, and the objective is ""Who saw the driver?"" No one in that area, not even the Taxi cab driver who was probably called the other night. There's no point in any of these side quests, nor the collectibles to find out ""Salems history"" or backstory.If I want to read about Salem's obvious history that I learned in history class, I'll use gatdam google3/10Don't buy it unless it's on sale for like ten bucks.

												In my opinion, expect the unexpected. This game is wonderful and it makes you fall in love with the character and feel bad, mad, and sad at the same time. You will learn all about Salem's history on how people during the old times are a bunch of hipocrites.So yeah, it's up to you if you guys wanna play this game or not. All I can say it is worth it.

												Time Spent as Detective: 1 HoursTime Spent as Cat: 10 Hours10/10 would cat again.Ok, time to be serious. I would recommend this game to anyone who yet to play La Noire and have extra cash to spend on game. Otherwise you would find this game rather disappointing despite all it's idea and concept being brilliant and yet failed to be execute in beautiful manners.Plus, certain features in this game could tend to be repetitive and annoying which I certainly won't mention due to possibility of spoiler but you can check it out at forum if you want to knew about it. This game are certainly not worth to be purchase in full price and undoubtedly not fit for hardcore fans of mystery game due to the simplicity of it.7/10 for me.			"

												TIme to find out you're not as invincible as you once thought. TL;DR - I give it 7/10. If you love being the detective and you love ghost stories, then definitely get this game. However, there are enough ""cons"" that make me suggest you wait until it's on sale. Longer review below. Despite it's short ""running time"", (took me 11 hours to complete), I feel in love with Soul Suspect. This game is not about combat or shooting things. It's about detective work, it's about figuring out how to sovle your murder and stop a serial killer even though you can't touch things in the physical world. On the whole, Soul Suspect feels like an experiment, an enjoyable one, but still an experiment. People complain about the ""lack of combat"", but in my opinion they should've cut out the whole system, it became repetitive and just downright annoying. The devs should've focused more on the story, which is what's at the heart of this game.Althought your character, Ronan, seems like your typical white dude, he has a refreshing personality, and he actually changes over the course of the game. Same goes for your ""sidekick"", Joy. The ending feels rushed, and more interactions with the characters you've met along the way or one more investigation could've tied the whole thing together. Even letting the character roam the town of Salem some more afterwards would've been a great opportunity for the devs to include some bonus missions. Overall, it's enjoyable, it's pretty creepy, and you just have to approach it like it's an interactive detective movie, not a ""shoot em up"".			"

If the game were better I might have the patience to go back and start over, but after investing several hours into it only to get stuck at this point, I'm done until they patch this game.

												The idea of this game is fantastic, and the story is interesting enough to make you think about it when you stop playing.Overall, the atmosphere helps the immerision, so it had everything to be one of those games you never forget.But...There are 3 things that were VERY annoying to me:1. ""Combat"": The demons that appear once in a while and can actually kill you, forcing you to restart from the last checkpoint were simply unecessary. It is not a challenge, hiding and waitng for the right time to kill them is just an annoyance. They're also not scary at all. They just kill the tension when they appear as you are exploring somewhere, finding clues, wondering what the hell is going on, or just admiring the nice graphics. They kill the atmosphere. If at least the encounters were better developed, with real stealth strategy, it could be cool. But no, it just makes you wonder if continuing playing is worth the trouble.2. Collections: It is nice to search for hidden items, that help you picture the background story of the characters, and understand the history of the city (which is very cool, made me think about visiting it someday). But there are just too many, some of them really hard to find (specially when the cursor has to be at a very specific position to collect it), and each one adds almost nothing to the story. The fragments are just too small, and that makes you lose interest in finding them after a while. Some of them are directly connected to the story, and can hint you at what is really going on (it is very easy to figure out the whole mystery if you pay attention), but after some time you just say ""nevermind, let's continue with the story"", and forget about them.3. ""The most relevant Clue"": This made me stop playing the game after the first minutes of gameplay. (But of course, after a while I gave it another shot and finished it). There are times during an investigation that you have to select the most relevant clue you found at that place to continue, or link an older clue to new developments. The concept is very nice, but it doesn't work. You can't think logically to find out which is the correct one. You have to wonder what the writers had in mind when they created that part. Sometimes it just doesn't make sense (and apparently you have infinite tries, so what's the point, anyway?) I'll just give an example: At the beggining, there is a part where you have to select which information in a cop's notes is the most important one. I selected the one that to me was obviously the most intriguing detail, and any cop in the world would immediately investigate that. But no, the ""correct"" answer was somthing obvious, with nothing really interesting about it. After some minutes, guess what happens? Yes, Ronan (the main character) decides to investigate that thing that the game wanted you to think was not relevant at all.Anyway, even with these flaws, I loved the game, and definitely recommend it to everyone who likes mysteries, and investigative games in general. It is worth it.			"

												A bit of a missed opportunity in many ways, but there's still a game in here that's worth your time. Murdered wrestles with a great concept but its reliance on gaming tropes that just don't fit with its vision betray a fear of straying too far from standard fare.The writing is good, the visual style is great at times and the concept is solid. Give it a tentative recommendation, it's a bit of a rough diamond.			"

												Pros: Has a L.A. Noir vide to it minus the gunplay/combat. There is a nice stealth element invovling demons that gradually gets harder. The story does pull you in and keeps you wanting to see what is next. It was a lot of fun to learn things as the main character did, no cutscenes involving the the serial killer and what they are doing at the moment. Cons: Is a really short game, around 7-8 hours with maybe an extra hour or two you can squeeze out trying to get all the collectables. The ending was nice, but left me wanting a bit more from it. In short I do recommend this game. Don't listen to the professional reviewers who give anything that is't Call of Duty a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rating.			"

												This game was really awesome. Very Story driven. By no means is this a fast pased action game. I did run into glitches where i literally had to watch the cutscene to not end up dieing.. again lol. Also some of the clues are confusing to conclude the investigation. I don't know if it's how they word it or whatever. But I just didn't understand what the case was trying to ask me at times to figure out the order of them all. You'd have like 8 choices with 2 of them being the right choice. I'd fail at some of em. But other's were challengin but I got em all right. That's about my only complaint. Other then that. Game is a great play.			"

												Lovechild of LA Noire and a horror suspense story of your choice.  Worth the money, all 12 hours of it - you don't get to run half an hour in one direction and then half an hour back to complete the quest (repeatedly) to bloat the gaming times. The game is insanely condensed into an amazing story you want to learn, combined with puzzles you will actually want to solve, combined with learning skills you will actually use, combined with enemies you will actually want to eliminate (or avoid, if that's your fancy).  Supernatural detective noire horror story - what can be better? Oh yeah, and the handsome tattooed chain-smoking detective in a fedora and shoulder holster, pity he is - well - dead. The replayability of the game is pretty low, once you know whodunnit, there is only getting back to get the collectibles you haven't found the first itme. Or watch the cutscenes and go all 'aha! how didn't i notice that before?!'. Or just trail behind the handsome tattooed chain-smoking detective in a fedora and shoulder holster (unfortunately dead) and admire the view :]No glitches, no crashes, no real need for the manual save system, though the lack of it might irritate some players. Overall extremely smooth gameplay with plot that is solid all over. I'd buy it on full price, it's that good.			"

												This game feels like it HAD to meet a deadline. Everything about it is clunky and unfinished. Despite being a ghost, the protagonist has a terrible habit of getting caught on every piece of geometry ever. There's also very little to no player agency throughout the entire game, making it feel like one giant cutscene, all things considered. The game looks dated, the writing is poor, and the characters are flat and unlikeable. The plot is *okay*, but the ending is abrupt and predictable. This is likely worth your time for around $5, but otherwise I'd advice against it.			"

												This game is incredibly interesting in how you have to use check every possible clue to find the right answer and there may be quite a few of them. There is also a grading system, depending how good you are at solving each of the cases. The side missions are not the hardest but they do give some interesting story. Also, collecting all the collectibles in one area reveals a story about the area. I only managed one but that was because I wanted to get on with the story as soon as I could.This game is HIGHLY recommended if you enjoy puzzle solving and some very simple fighting. Well, simple if know what you're doing.			"

												While I enjoyed the game enough to actually finish it, the overall experience felt very unpolished.What I Liked:-Lovable Characters: I liked all the characters. The voice acting was really great, and I cared about Ronan and Joy; a lot of fun and interesting interactions between the two of them.-A completionist's dream: All sorts of stuff to collect, and fun little stories to unlock if you're into that sort of thing.-Interesting Storyline: The story was surprisingly original, outside of a few painfully predictable points. Original or not, it was interesting and kept my playing.What I Hated:-Sloppy Game Mechanics: Game mechanics were a mess. Especially the dialogue options. You enter a cutscene for each dialogue choice, and the break is very obvious. Once the cutscene ends, there's another obvious break, and you get to choose another dialogue option. It was strange and killed the immersion.-Investigations: Basically a hidden objects game. Walk around, find anything and everything it actually lets you examine until it says you've found all the clues. Then guess which one is relative to the current case. Easy and oh-so boring.-Felt Unfinished: A lot of the powers were pretty useless save for one or two very rare, very unique moments where the game practically screams at you: USE THIS POWER! Teleportation could've been really cool, but there's only a few spots it actually comes in handy, and even then it's super clunky and annoying. A lot of useless hiding spots you'll never use, no matter what, never ever. They're just there for the aesthetics, I guess? Just looked messy to me. And while the start of the game seems to promise a lot of interesting side investigations -- helping to put spirits to rest -- there are very few to actually be found as the game progresses, at least, that I could find.-Enemies: Demons. . .could've been scary, but instead they're just annoying. They walk (float?) a predetermined route. You do the exact same thing to kill them (quick time event). There's no real combat in the game, or even a sense of urgency. You just hide, quick-time kill an enemy when he turns his back on you, repeat.-Cats: O. . .M. . .G Fun at first, but then, seriously, WHY is the SAME black cat everywhere in Salem? You know what, I think that friggin cat might be the killer! Shows up in the most convenient places, always there when I need it. . .what's it playing at? Or maybe it's different cats, all brothers and sisters. . .with absolutely no way to tell them apart. . .? Maybe? And seriously, what is the point of pressing ""Q"" to ""Meow""?I enjoyed the game, it was fun in its own ways. Mostly it was a story that was nice to experience. But MURDERED: Soul Suspect is NOT a $50 game. Maybe $20. So no, can't recommend it.			"

												This game is quite unusual in comparison to the others, and that's the main point of its success. The options are unusual: you can possess, influence on smbd, read the mind and execute the demons. You walk through the game as a ghost, and the main objective is to solve your murder. Despite of this, you are also able to solve the other victim's murders while revealing the hidden items. After you found all the clues on a particular problem, the game proceeds with the next video part that tells you smth. more about your own. AND THAT'S ALL. Nothing more. It becomes boring, especially for those who do not like repetitive cycles. There is nothing scary in the game, it just makes you bored. My advice is: buy this game only if you like what I described above or if you are reach enough to spent around $60 to explore HQ video and the graphics and to satisfy your curiosity.			"

												Understand beforehand that Murdered: Soul Suspect is a cinematic puzzle adventure game with all the trappings you expect from such. I felt it was reminiscent of Dreamfall and Indigo Prophecy. Its also not REALLY a detective game you just mouse around and collect clues then piece them together to complete the ""puzzle"" to further your investigation. Like an advenure game really. Overall I enjoyed it, the game is visually stunning, the sound and voice acting is top notch. What really blew me away was how detailed and expressive the characters faces were. The only problem is this is $50 for a puzzle adventure game! Since this is a Square title though you can expect the price to drop drastically and if it cost half as much and you like the genre I would say pick this game up for sure.			"

												Brilliant game that is highly under-rated. Its good graphics along with an amazing story is a combination that is becoming harder to find in modern games, with most companies focusing on graphics it is refreshing to know that developer Airtight Games and publisher Square Enix have found a way to create balance between the two.

												The beginning of the game is very well done, but for me it quickly fell flat.  I was raised on Lucasarts point n' click adventures, so I am always on the lookout for adventure games with puzzle elements or a strong story driven narrative.  Unfortunately, despite some cool mechanics and a story I WOULD like to see play out, the game feels like a series of annoying ""where the hell is that last clue!?"" scenes.  The system for solving crimes is also just a ""guess again until you get it right"" kind of deal.  Essentially, just push button to win.  So close, yet so far.			"

												So I literally just this second finished the game, well im lying it was 10 minutes  ago but ill get to that in a sec, Murdered soul suspect is a good game but to me it has no replay value (but I was expecting that going in) you play it from start to finish complete the story and your done as if you read a book or watched a film, you can go back and replay it trying to find all the little collectables to wring out a bit more story but you’re not going to get much more.So the game took me about 8 hours (this is what steam has me clocked at) it may take you a bit less or a bit more if you’re like me and spend ages running round the place trying to find that one collectable you somehow missed.Also on the note of time the ending credits are unskippable and last for about 10 minutes and there is nothing after them it dumps you back on the title screen.So bugbears about the game (well other that the ending credits) it stinks of a console port (not as bad as some mind you) it’s a bit clunky there were several times where items that should have been intractable weren’t (like in the end scene I failed because I was one step to close to have the press E to interact pop-up show up) the FOV is a bit tight, then there is the chose by Square Enix to have combat in the game personally I don’t think it fit well but this is a personal choice thing but after a bit of searching on the web I found there is a way to turn off the daemons/turn invisible to them and in my mind that made the game a lot more fun but to each his own.And lastly they cheating on the ending, they kind of ended it but did it in a way were they can bring him back for a sequel which im kind of ok with as I liked the game and ideas behind it even if the puzzles with a bit too easy (I 3 badged almost every puzzle in the game) but I would have liked it better if they have closed this story off and had a sequel with a new propagandised as the story sets up the idea that ghost are made when you die and feel there is still stuff you need to do.So yes I recommend it but don’t expect too much from it.

												A pretty good whodunit detective game. Most investigations can be beat by brute force, but that nets you overall less points. The games best selling point is it's creepy atmosphere and the offer of playing as a ghost and playing as a ghost is quite frankly a lot of fun. I dare you to not veer around trashcans and aim for doorways in the first few hours when you could infact just pass through the wall or something instead.You use abilities such as possession, mind reading, memory tracing and teleportation to accomplish your goals.The games weak parts is it's lenght, it's on the short side. And the enemies scattered around, quite frankly i feel that the game would have been better without enemies at all and just more detectiving. Every enemy encounter goes like this: You are startled by a loud scream, you hide nearby, wait for them to turn their back and then kill them with a QTE. It's just a hassle, not scary, not fun and they are in the way. Thankfully there aren't many enemies at all in the game.All in all i really recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect if you want to think a bit for yourself, fantasize about the beyond, are a bit of a history buff, are into creepy atmospheres or ghosts, just looking for a mystery or all of the above. A very pleasant surprise.			"

												A very great game if you like detective stories, supernatural themes, and a wicked twist. Really good gameplay for people who like story driven games, though not much in the action department. If you like to explore everything, you might beat the game in 10 hours and uncover the many mini-stories within the game. I.E. The other ghostly murder cases that aren't tied to your story but happened in the area. If not, you'll probably soak about 7 to 8 hours (not including speed runs). I enjoyed it, and I would say...it's worth about 30-40 bones. Full price, eh, not so much. If they added some downloadable content, maybe telling of other cases and stories, it might be worth a full priced game of 50-60. Don't think on this having co-op or multiplayer, this is for the lone players.			"

												Back hand clapping...I had to give up playing this today after the 30th time of trying to execute the same demon and forgetting that (unlike any other game) you have to hold the button down. For me this game is an endless cycle of: sneak up behind demon, press execute button, run away because ""I"" let them go (i.e. forgot to hold the button)...No option...Why for the love of god did they not include an auto hold on execute option in controls?! This awful command system is a game ruiner and all the hard work put into this game amounts to nothing because of it. It's very sad because I was enjoying the game. I have no problem sneaking up behind the demons but then in the heat of the moment I forget that it has a weirdly unique and bizarrely abnormal control system that has never been used in any other game. 3rd Party software needed?The only way I could play this was if I used a program like xpadder to make the button toggle or hold for a time, but having to use 3rd party software to overcome a badly thought out and poorly implemented control system is ridiculous (for a 3rd person game, not a flight sim).No patch?If they make a patch I for this I might play it but since having an unplayable game taking up lots of space on my hdd is a stupid idea,  I will be uninstalling it and wont know if there is a patch because I am not going to bother checking (in much the same way they didn't bother putting an alternative to their useless command system).

												I loved this game from start to finish.  It can be a bit easy at times, but if you go hunting and find all the side stories (I almost got all of them), there is a lot of stories to enjoy.  What I enjoyed the most was that the story had me guessing the entire way.			"

												The whole game took me 10 hours about.  I have clollectibles left but I won't go back and get them.  Just keep in mind this is a ""mystery"" game so replay is minimal.  I would recomend this game as a fun change from normal but remember the total time when deciding on what you will spend!			"

												This is actually a pretty awesome game. The idea that was behind it is a breath of fresh air. The graphics and awesome, music is atmospheric, and it's over all just creepy enough to keep you on your toes. The only problem and the only reason I don't recommend this is game is due the its length. It's way to short. Even with taking the time to get up and go to the bathroom or to grab a smoke my total play time on it was only 8 hours. This is with me doing 90% of the side stuff. I lucky got this game free. Had I paid for it I would have been very upset with its current $50 price tag.			"

												A fantastic game that is more about puzzles and story than action elements. Fantastic characters, a solid story, and a couple surprises along the way make for a game that I would want to see a series of - even if it uses different characters every time, or different locales. For example, one set in New Orleans would be fantastic, considering its roots in the arcane.Nothing is ever perfect, though: there is the occasional graphical glitch that can make it hard to figure out what you've got to do next, and it really felt too short. This could have kept going without feeling like it was being padded - the end came up pretty fast, but at least it warns you so you can go back and collectible hunt. (And that's worth it, especially for the ghost stories.)If you want to get involved in a story, enjoy some solid voice acting, and have a little dash of creepy - you'll love this game.			"

												As a 6 hour experience for about 5 bucks, Murdered tells an ok story. As a game though it falls down in almost all departments. Boring and repetitive stealth sections make up the only actual gameplay part of the experience. The rest of it is simply walking around rooms to find clues and push the story forward, in an almost visual novel sort of experience. While a fan of these kinds of games myself, such as the Ace Attorney series, I dont think this is what Murdered was trying to do, and instead it fails at being a good action/mystery game or a good visual novel too.In conclusion I can't really recommend the title, as it does nothing particularly interesting with its unique premise, sadly turning a very intriguing concept into a run of the mill point and click adventure style murder mystery without a satisfying story to hold it up.

The puzzles are simplistic, the combat is laughable and never evolves and the only real challenge comes from a painstakingly drawn out scavenger hunt. The story is okay.

												Good game, just a little clunky at times with the controls and mechanics. I recommend playing this with a controller, it seems to make it a little less clunky. Over all I'd give it a 7.5/10 as the story is a little cliched but still quite enjoyable. I did have to quit a couple times due to the clunky mechanics that didn't mesh well with certain parts where you were required to be sauve and quick (without putting a spoiler in, those that have played the asylum portion will likely know what I'm refering to).

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a supernatural crime thriller about Ronan, a man with a criminal history who became a detective then found himself a victim of the bell killer when following a lead in the case. The game has a sense of uniqueness that has to be appreciated in just its premise. The character is full of quirks and remarks throughout the game as well as some of the other characters. This is all delivered rather nicely in it voice acting which is very solidly done. The controls are very simple and straightforward nothing to complicate things which lends itself well to the games puzzle-esque ways. Combat doest really exist out side of exorcising demons which is mostly optional bit is always pulled of by one of the movement (WASD) keys and right or left mouse button click so it feels a bit gimicky and like its trying to be pattern like but feels out of place in some way, at least for me. The plot and story are the absolute best  part in this game by far and with quite a few twists and turns that leave you scratching your head at who is behind it all then promptly smacking your ideas of the suspect. The only thing I feel they could have done better is making me feel more emotionally invested in some of the character which would have lent itself well in other aspects of the game in terms of impact. There are side things that can be done BUT due to auto save ONLY with no manual save control of your own if you want to colllect and/or solve all side things do so before reaching the end of the game otherwise that has to be done in a new game. Despite being a rather small and short game Murdered: Soul Suspect still deserves a try and it has its handful of problems but any I've run into felt very minor to the point it felt like might be me being picky so I say give this a go as it deserves a little more attention and love.

												I would only recommend this shoddy excuse for a game during a sale. The game treats you like you are the world's biggest idiot the whole game. Look around a crime scene pick out the most important detail. If you get it wrong the first time it doesn't matter because there isn't an apparent penalty for being wrong other than a red flash and something along the lines of ''No. I need to find something that would actually help me figure this out. I'm a moron for thinking this could help."" It literally feels like an indy game with the gameplay of a flash game but with the graphics of a good game... speaking of graphics... hope you dont have a♥♥♥♥♥♥computer like me, or else you are going to wait 2 minutes for every cinematic to load on the lowest quality setting... Do you know how many cinematics this game had? Alot. Literally the only two reasons I kept playing it to the end was because I spent 30 bucks on it like an idiot and because I kind of wanted to watch the story. It sucks that this writing staff made such a great story, but the people who decided on game mechanics were like... this game is going to be played by 5 year olds right? I mean Jesus Christ! It never gets any harder than the begining. And just when something different happens: I won't spoil what it is, you realize that its just a crappy last minute add in to the... movie... im just gonna call it a playable movie... thats what it is. So I guess if you like movies, murder mysteries, have a good computer, and don't mind being treated with the intellegence of a newborn lemur then this game is for you. Otherwise... please buy it on a sale and don't make the same mistake i did.			"

												Worth a play if you can get it on sale. Soul Suspect is a detective adventure game. Calling it a horror game does a dis-service to actual horror games so I'll just say it has a dark atmosphere. The story is kinda mediocre, somewhat predictabe and relatively short (I finished it in 8 hours, while doing a pretty good amount of exploring). The controls are kinda sticky at times.  Some interacions should be based on proximity instead of the current system of it being based on where the camera is centered. There is very little character progression in regards to powers and the powers are a tad lame. 'Battles' in this game consist of sneaking up on enemies to trigger a QTE to defeat them. If you are spotted by them or fail the QTE, you're forced to run and hide until the enemy gives up at which point you can try again. There is only one enemy type in the entire game, save for the 'final boss.' The crime scene system (not sure what it's officially called) is interesting but will often penalize you for not being able to answer their vaguely asked question in the exact way they want you to. Not sure if this is a localization thing or someting else. Some of the clues are absurd to be called 'clues'  and I wa somestimes annoyed that I had to click on it to make the observation into a 'clue.' Also, as mentioned about the controls, because the camera has to be centered on the item for prompts to show up, I would often miss clues because a prompt didn't pop up -- this would just add unnecessary time as I'd be searching for that last clue and then realize that I hadn't properly centered the camera on the item for the prompt to come up.I got this during a recent sale for under $10 and I think that's a fair price for the game. It wasn't spectacular but was interesting enough to keep me occupied. Frankly, games like this should not be released at full console retail price when the quality of the product doesn't warrant so.			"

												Remember The Darkness? This game plays a little bit like that, with the 'other world on top of this world' vibe... Except that Ronan is a WAY more likable and funny guy than Jackie, who - if Im going to be generous - had the personality of a piece of sopping wet cardboard. (Yes I've read the comics. I stand by my statement.)Gameplay can get a little clunky, but you arent asked to do action sequences more than a few times, so mostly it's just atmosphere. Said atmosphere can, at times, get a little repetative, but it did manage to maintain a pacing of steadily getting creepier and creepier. The tense string instruments make you want to turn around and slap the musicians for scaring you like a little girl. Play at night with the lights off for maximum effect, obviously.Power through the story if you get tired of the levels; they dont take long. The story itself had a few 'whodunit' twists and a few others you can see a mile out, but still. It's not terrible, and history nerds get a nice stroll through Salem that doesnt overwhelm people who dont give a rat's behind about what happened in 1800-and-who-cares.Conclusion: A nice timekiller that wont take up more than a day of dedicated play or a few days of off and on. WARNING: The menu in here IS glitchy as all heck, so stay out of it as often as you can.			"

												Really did like the indepth history into the witch trials and with the integration of it in to the story. The idea that you are trying to solve your own murder as a ghost and the properties that being a ghost give the game play is really different to me.I enjoy the fact for most of the terrain you can walk through because you are a ghost adds a new way of thinking. I give this a 4/5 because of some issues with the game gliching where it does not know what take I was on. Only noticeable on the pause screen. (could be an isolated incident). Also, I feel that some of the game play was a bit stiff at time (might be a personal thing though)			"

The graphics aren’t amazing, even accounting for the fact the game is just over a year old.

												This game is more like ""L.A. Noire"" than anything else, and I really enjoyed it. Then again, I enjoy games with decent stories more than a lot of people seem to do, and the story for ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" had enough twists and kept my intrigue enough to see it the whole way through without too many regrets. There was potential for it to be a ""horror"" game (which I hate), but fortunately any scares were more in the environment and feeling of the game than through outright scares.  Some people seem to put more value on time spent, so for those kind of people this game at $30 (as I write this) might not be of value. But if you enjoyed ""L.A. Noire"", this game is at least worth getting on a Steam sale.There are enough other reviews (should this one ever be read by anyone) that I'm going to spare yet another description of the story and get to what I think are the pluses and minuses of the game.Pluses:+ Non-linear with respect to being able to visit previous locations+ Intriguing story placed in Salem, MA and linked to the historic witch trials+ Dark, brooding atmosphere without necessarily crossing the line into ""horror""+ Good acting and voice work+ No jump scares (for the most part)+ Roughly 8-10 hour play time doesn't require too much commitment+ No achievement mandating that all of the mysteries are solved PEFECTLY (unlike ""L.A. Noire"")+ Side quests while not required provided some well-written ghost stories+ Some interesting plot twistsMinuses:- Demons felt like they were added for pointless stealth/action gameplay- Too many collectibles for a game of this size- No way to track how many collectibles still remain in a particular location- End sequence stops somewhat abruptlyIf you can put up with the pointless demons, which don't show up very often anyway, and you can deal with not having to find *every* collectible, you'll probably find this game worthwhile, although the $30 price tag (as of writing) might be a bit too much for some people, based on the returns. This is definitely worth picking up on a Steam sale, though.			"

												Firstly, the game has a decent story, cool intro and an interesting protagonist. It's like playing through a murder mystery with occasional collection quests and a nicely evolving understanding of your character. That said, the mystery could have been better fleshed out. The culprit was simply not on my radar until nearly the end, which made for a surprising, but unfulfilling twist ending.The game clearly suffers by being ported from console to PC. The controls are unintuitive and sometimes downright boggling for PC+Mouse, but I'm sure for a console controller they would make sense.The ""combat"" is utterly unnecessary and serves only to delay parts of the game for no benefit to the story or character development. There was also an unusual amount of walking back and forth for no real reason. It's not an Open World, you can only go from one scene to another, so why make the player walk through the same parts of town X times?The Clue-finding and Conclusion-Drawing mechanics were very railroaded and often left me wondering just how slow the protagonist must be, to take so long to figure it out. Being told you had found 6 of 8 clues in an area led to boring scavenger hunts, rather than trying to form conclusions based on what you'd already found, which could have lead to more interesting gameplay.It's tough to write a ""no"" review, but my internal rating of 5/10 just doesn't justify recommending this game.

												I guess this is that game: No matter how many negative reviews or hatespeech it received on forums, magazines and websites, I was rather captivated by it. And I still cannot quite put my finger on why... many reasons I think.  Even though I absolutely dispise pixel hunting (hi Arkham City!) I found myself drawn into the world of the protagonist through brilliant voice (and mocap) acting, solid graphics and a demanding story line with a twist at the end that blew my mind. While it is certainly true that the NPC's are the most boring to ever feature in a AAA title, the main characters feel suprisingly human in this stunning demonstration of how much oomph is still left in the Unreal Engine. Even on fairly modest PC setup, the game should look good. I know I clicked 'Yes' in the section that asks if this game should be recommended, but I can at least admit it will not be everyone's cup of tea. You NEVER actually touch a gun in this game, but to me that is part of the charm. It is definitely clear that the developers made an effort to do something different, even if they failed somewhat obviously to do so. If you are looking to take a brake from flinging tons of lead at enemies and you are willing to overlook a few glaring oversights of a development studio that obviously feared missing their release date, buy it. Or put it on your wishlist for that day you feel you need to take a break from mainstream gaming.			"

												Murdered:Soul Suspect is a supernatural thriller kinda like Ghost Whisperer,Medium or Deadbeat.The game focuses on the story and the plot twist adds to a great ending.The characters are well done and you can discover their stories through notes.Also,the voice acting was good.You can possess a cat and even ""meow""  which ,let's be honest, is everybody's dream.The background characters are interesting(from psycho butcher to jealous girlfriend) and you can even help some of the ghosts as a side mission.The dialogue was funny most of the time and straight to the point.Unfortunately,the controls seemed to be made especially for console so it didn't quite adjust to PC keyboard.Another con was the length of the game.I was expecting more gameplay.After you finish the game you can't go back and explore.Speaking of exploration,it was limited by walking from point A to B.You can only roam between those points and it felt like Salem was not really a city but a place with a few locations.In conclusion, meow out of 10.

												Interesting story.  It is like reading a book.  A bit short as I finished it in one afternoon.  No surprise clues at the end, you can figure out the mystery as the story progresses (which is a good thing).  I had guessed a few of the plot aspects before they happened, but I don't find that a negative.  It happens.The game concentrated on the story (which I liked) rather than combat with some story thrown in.  This may not appeal to some.The game is short.There were bad parts.  It was clear that the end was thrown together.  Not that the story didn't complete.  That was fine, but there were four major broken game development commandments.  Two appear right at the end.1.  You cannot save the game.  Ever.  It is a port to PC from a console.  There are automatic progress points.  The good thing is they do seem to happen often.2.  Flash sequences.  Some people like them, I don't.3.  Repeated cutscene (happens at end) when you fail (which will happen).  You can skip it after it starts, but forcing one to even go into it is bad.4.  Sudden timed sequence.  There is exactly one (two parts of one timed sequence) and none of the rest of the game has one.  It is short (the timed sequence), too. I'd recommend the game if you like to play a short story.  This is not a combat centered game.  It is a mystery and in that aspect it was fun to figure out the mystery.  Get it on sale.  Not worth a normal 50-60 dollar price tag.I'd like to see more products like this rather than the overdone shooters and what not, so I realise my suggestion to get it on sale isn't going to encourage more such development.I'm going to give it a yes but read the caveats in this article.

												Amazing story driven game that focuses around the dark past of Salem, Mass. The gameplay mechanics are just a vehicle to take you from one story point to another like breadcrumbs. If anyone loves horror movies, detective games, or history; this game has a great combination of all 3. The length of play is under 15 hours so it may not be worth $60 to some. But definitely worth a $15-30 purchase.			"

												This was a very interesting game. Very unique in the investigation types of games that I've played before. The story was fresh and original, and I couldn't have asked for more. The game had only 2 downsides to it.... One. It was a pretty short game. I finished it in a few hours (not 100% completion, but story) and Two. There was no difficutly selection. It might have been a little more interesting if it was a bit more challenging. All in all, it was a fantastic game and left me wanting more.			"

												It's sad that this game got such bad reviews, but I can kindof see why. It didn't lie about what it would give you but it didn't give much other than the main story as well. There are collectables and sidequests, but the collectables are mostly all in front of your main path and the sidequests are short and few. The ghost mechanics are cool, the story is interesting, I liked the characters, and the ending was satisfying and made sense. The release price was definitly too high, that much is certain, but if you get it 75% off it would most likely be worth it.			"

												The graphics are good as is the voice acting. The collecting of items is quite fun and the unlockable storied you get to listen are really neat and could come from a classy horror anthology. The main story however is full of plot holes, things that just cannot be explained in such ways and the end feels lame and randomly thrown together. At no point I cared for the main character or the girl he had to protect and at no point they really felt deep. Summary: Good looks, neat idea, horrible execution and writing. Not recommended.			"

												A good game, but too simple. Finding clues is interesting, but almost everything important is glowing, so it is very easy to find. As a detective game it is much worse than LA Noire, as adventure it is ok. Atmosphere is good, you can get used to console=like controls very fast, so you can enjoy the game very easily. Story is very good and interesting, but short. I finished the game in 7 hours and I spent a lot of time looking for collectibles. I don't recommend this game for full price, reasonable deal is under 5 €.			"

												The only real downside for this game is the price they're asking for it. I got it in a humble bundle and was more than happy with it. But I would never pay or recommend anyone pay 30$ for it. That being said, I see a lot of flak for this game and I don't think it deserves to be hated. This game was very atmospheric and dark and the story was compelling. Although there is very little action, there is much to watch and enjoy and interact with. If you go into this game expecting al sorts of action and horror, you will be disappointed. If you expect a rich story and a compelling mystery, then this game is very satisfying. I recommend to any fans of mystery and atmospheric games.			"

												Relatively lame game. I played until the end just because it was easy, and you could chip away at it, 30 min here, 20 here type of thing. The reality is this is merely a story based game that you go through the motions to advance the story. Story is decent, but nothing to write home about. Characters are hard to feel anything for. Ronan is ""mr. cool"" and joy is a brat. The ending was a surprise only because you couldn't have possibly guessed it or figured it out until 5 minutes before, and final showdown is not terribly impressive. I expected more from the final few minutes. I would only recommend if a) you like adventure type games and b) you get it on a deep steam sale. I paid 7.49 and still feel like that was about right for what it was. Anything more forget it.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game that errs on the side of an interactive story. It’s short and fairly easy, but entertaining while it lasts. It’s definitely not worth full price, since it’s only really going to get you maybe 10 hours of gameplay tops if you take time to find all of the collectables without a guide, but if it's on sale, I say it's worth the buy. I suggest you put it on the big screen, grab a blanket, a snack, maybe your cat, and your controller and enjoy the small side ghost stories and the overall story from the comfort of your couch. If that sounds like your kind of night, then get it and enjoy!			"

												Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game. I thought it was fun and the story was compelling enough to make me want to finish it. Speaking of the story, however, this main character is easily the dumbest person I have ever encountered in my life, let alone the fact that he's a detective. Ronan didn't die because he was hunting down a murderer, he died because the writers couldn't come up with a good enough excuse for supposedly-respectable police officers to allow this kind of stupidity to act freely in their police department. So they killed him off so that no cops would have to actually deal with how utterly moronic he is. I figured out the story about two and a half hours into the game, and i played a good 5 or 6 hours total to beat it. All along the way, Ronan kept going ""Huh, I wonder what this means"" when the meaning is so blatantly obvious that a 7-year-old could figure it out, given that this 7-year-old had the utmost basic knowledge on the historical significance of Salem. There was genuinely only one part of this story that surprised me, and even then, it wasn't that impactful because of how upset I was at Ronan for his 6  straight hours of nonstop idiocracy. What really emphasized his stupidity, and I personally find this thoroughly ironic, was when he finally ended up talking with Baxter. Ronan spent the entirety of the game talking about how stupid Baxter is, and when it came down to them actually working together, Ronan had gotten to literally the EXACT same place as Baxter in their search for the killer. Also, overall, Ronan's facial expressions were a huge disconnect. You could tell it was supposed to be a dramatic moment, and Ronan still looked like the infant that I think he really is. Except if that infant were 5'10"", had a stubble, and wore a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fedora. Mechanics-wise, it was lacking, but not in such a way that made it hard. Just somewhat tedious. At one point where Ronan should be hauling♥♥♥♥♥across all of Salem, he's instead jogging briskly, taking detours because of how confusing the map is. The teleport mechanic comes in handy, I guess, but honestly it would be so much better if it were just a set distance that you could sorta spam to move faster, instead of having to hold left click, wait for it to charge, and let go, only to travel a repeatedly disappointing distance. Trying to get from the musem to the church was honestly one of the worst sequences for this. I wanted to care about trying to get to the church as fast as I possibly could, but all Ronan could care about was the brunch he was gonna go have with his dead wife after this was all over, resulting in me wanting to start running down my street so that one of us could feel like they were attempting to go quickly towards anything.tl;drstory was predictable, Ronan is a moron, and the controls are meh. 14/10 would Julia again.

												TL:DR - 12hr run time if you hunt for collectables. Average plot, decent but not groundbreaking and ultimately predictable. Decent mechanics and character abilities. Reasonably well written characters. All of this is hindered and spoiled by the frustrating need to kill demons when the kill sequence is buggy as hell and only serves to slow the game down and annoy you. Still worth playing, but be prepared to be thoroughly annoyed for about a quarter of the game.Overall it's got a decent plot, decent set design, interesting game mechanics. The Investigation side of things is pretty typical, doesn't stretch very far from the conventions of the genre but does involve a few quirks to give it it's own identity (e.g. you can uncover clues and information through possessing people and manipulating them into giving up information).The plot is, for the most part, pretty predictable. For example, *minor spoiler, no specific details*,  the story centres on the witch trails of salem, which becomes pretty obvious about halfway through when a flashback to one of the murders is shown. After that, it's pretty clear that the overarching motive is to do with killing witches. This wouldn't be nearly as obvious to the player if the game was set somewhere OTHER THAN SALEM, which is famous for KILLING WITCHES. As soon as strange symbols and similar things get mentioned, the connection is almost instinctive .The only real twists and turns occur right at the end and even then don't do much to flip the story on it's head, they just make the overall story a little more original. Around halfway through the story, a lot of people will figure out the second half of the plot pretty quickly and then will just have to play through the game and wait for confirmation of what is sadly quite obvious.All that aside, the biggest detractor from the game is the BLOODY DEMONS. A few sections of the game require you to get your stealth hat on and exorcise demons from behind by distracting them, triggering a quicktime event, and hoping that the stars and planets are correctly aligned when you press the buttons, because the system is buggy as hell. For starters, this style of gameplay is totally unecessary and poorly implemented. There's absolutely no flow to it and it just seems like something the developers put in to make the game last a little longer and make it more exciting/different (which it does the exact opposite of). For a dectective game, it really kills the immersion and slows the pace right down. It's incredibly frustrating when all you want to do is get on with the investigation.Basically, if you're drawn to this game and like detective games, go ahead and play it. It's pretty fun and pretty clever at times. Just don't expect to be blown away by the story, although it has some pretty good moments. And definately expect to get extremely fed up with BLOODY DEMONS.			"

												Definately a breath of fresh air amongst the thousands of First and Third Person Shooters out there.The mystery is woven a little thick in places but it's definately enjoyable to unravel it piece by piece.The characters, what little there is of them, are competently written and voice acted and the music does it's best to amplify the creepy mood of it all.The game does suffer however from forced  ""stealth"" elements that do nothing but pad out the game's relatively short running time (FOUR HOURS).And at the end Murdered Soul Suspect is a point'n'click mystery game, without any pointing, without any clicking and a mystery that effectively solves itself - But that doesn't mean it's bad.

												I was expecting either a run of the mill horror game or a glorified walking simulator. I couldn't have been more wrong. 1) Horror: I decided to play this right after Outlast because I was in that type of mood. Soul Suspect still managed to get my heart rate up and creep me out in a few spots. 2) Walking SImulator: I think the only one I ever played was Gone Home. It was a great story, it was kind of creepy but it was so human at the same time. Sure there are ghosts and demons and witches, but the story is about people. You really get to learn about the people by just walking around and clicking on things.3) Police Procedural: The only other ones that come to mind are the CSI games and LA Noir, none of which I've played. Althought the ""puzzles"" if you want to call them that were simple, they at least made it feel like I was involved in hashing out the next step.My only gripe is that some of the collectables were in places I'd have never looked had I not eventually given up and looked them up. I'm not a fan of these things though and they are totally optional so it doesn't really efffect the game unless you want it to.I've been playing video games since the early 80s and I've been using steam since the Orange Box was bundled with video cards. Two things I hardly ever do are complete a game 100% and write a review. I've now done both for this game.			"

												This game is short and not very challenging. 99% of the investigation puzzles I got right on the first try. The ""combat"" is slow and not particularly rewarding, and you only fight one enemy type throughout the entire game. A keen mind will recognize the primary villain immediately, but there are some creative twists that get thrown into the mix and spice up the story a bit. As a game, it's subpar, a step above a narrative journey. Not even the backstories were particularly interesting. However what I really liked about the game was its take on the spirit world, spirit powers, and the way spirits interact with the mortal world. It is a very unique theme and approach, and would have made a very exciting game if they had tried a little harder.			"

His life story is fantastic. And the story left me on the edge of my seat. The graphics were awesome, particularly the supernatural elements. The way past and present structures were mashed together was just beyong cool. The ending when all the pieces of this odd, disjointed plot come together left me face down on my bed for about an hour.Now all that being said...this game  could be REALLY annoying. The main challenge I had was figuring out how to sneak past enemies, and even that was rarely more than thirty seconds of looking around. There is little true ""detective work"", and a lot of ""stare at the ground until you see a clue"". And unfortunately, that's basicallt all the game consists of. Going to a new crime scene and staring at the floor until you get a cut scene. At least the floor was very pretty most of the time?			"

												in Murdered: Soul Suspect, you play as a detective who gets killed in the town of Salem, which is known for its witchcraft trials. The detective gets turned into a ghost and you play as the ghost which is fun and it means that you can walk through walls and read peoples minds but the downside is that people only have 1 line thoughts and you can't walk through every wall, which is actually annoying. the town of salem is well imagined and the characters are likeable. my issue with this game is that it wants to keep you involved by making you collect things and listen to ghost stories, but it's not scary and in the end you feel that there isn't enough to do. the puzzles are easy and the game crashes a lot.

												*Spoilers discussed in review*I can't decide if the story of this game did or did not make up for things I disliked. I enjoyed the side stories and as someone who likes searching every nook and cranny of a world I enjoyed hunting for the extra pieces of evidence and items to find the stories. Sometimes it was frustrating having to be standing right next to something for it to have the option to interact with it but most of the time it was solid.....except once where my game glitched and I had to reload before it would let me interact with anything again. I was also a little annoyed that we couldn't revisit investigations. Again being someone who likes to be thorough, when I noticed I'd accidentally missed a clue out of an investigation you can imagine who annoying that stain on the record was when I realised I couldn't revisit it to find the clue I'd missed. Could not have some ""Recall Investigation"" feature been added? My main gripe about the game was the combat system against the enemies. Using a mouse and keyboard, I really disliked how they used the wasd keys and a left or right button click to dispence of enemies. If I was in a panic, I would have to wait around for ages to go through the malarky of it again hoping I don't miss-click or press the wrong key again. I didn't feel like it was a very rewarding system in that respect and just frustrated me more than anything. The enemies were just an annoyance rather than a ""Alright! Lets deal with these evil demons!"" Little disappointed with the ending. I feel like you found out only half of the story...the twist of who the killer was, I thought, was very interesting but they didn't go into it enough at the last minute. I felt through the whole game we didn't have a clue who the killer was and at the end they just went ""Hey lets have this person"". I don't even think I understand why the killer did it. I understand she was murdered for accusing witchcraft...but why had she accused them in the first place? What was her reason for that? The bell didn't really have much significance either. I just feel a bit underwhelmed. I also never appreciate a game which doesn't allow you to skip the credits!Overall, I am glad I played the game (even though it probably doesn't sound like it!) but it was a little....meh. I don't think I'll be playing it again in a hurry to find things I missed.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect shows a lot of promise, but falls painfully short of fulfilling it. In its gameplay close more to point and click adventure that to modern action games, relying mainly on case solving by finding needed items in the enviroment and finding out the proper links between them. Beside that its mostly going from A to B and collecting collectibles on the way. So in overall, even if it is not something revolutionary or even really great, it is still fun at some points and the atmosphere is really good.

												Great concept, good story, good graphics. Short campaign - I completed it in less than 6 hours, but I got the game for free when I purchased my graphics card, so I can't complain. Great atmosphere and an addicting main story which makes you want to see the outcome. Worth a play through if you can buy it for a decent price and have a few hours to spare.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very interesting game. It's described as a horror-action game, but most of it is stealth and detective. Getting achievements is really easy, but the game is also very short. You can finish it in 6 hours (I finished it on PS3). But you have to make sure you get all the collectables, this can give you a lot of easy achievements. I rate this game an 8 / 10.			"

												Don't pay full price for this, or you'll be disapointed. £10 or less is a fair price. I got this through the SQUARE ENIX Christmas bundle, so I'm quite happy with it.Very CPU intensive, maxes out an O/C'ed FX9 series CPU loading the scenes.Issues with the game freezing during cut-scenes. The only way I could play was by loading in safe mode, which made the graphics jumpy.Story line is quite engrossing, and the game play is easy, the demons can be a bit of a b**ch if you get a few together.	 Simple point and click options for the detective sections.MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL YOUR PICK-UPS BEFORE ENTERING THE LAST SCENE (Museum 2) because there is no return from there.Overall, a worthwhile addition to your library, but not at full price.7.8/10			"

												Great mystery horror game, you'll never be scared out of your wits but the music definitely sets a mood and I jumped a few times at screams here and there. Its a pretty good cop ghost story but to be honest the side stories you dig up in each area are a lot scarier and the investigations are a lot more fun than the ghost aspect. Recommend buying on sale just because of how short the game is (beat it in a day) but other than that its a solid syfy detective mystery with a unique story.			"

												I just played it from start to finish in one sitting.  The first time I tried it (when it first came out), I didn't really get into it.  After 10-15 minutes, long enough to get out of the first ""scene,"" the game had me hooked.  I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but this game made playing as a ghost feel extremely unique and interesting, all the way through the end.  I worried, in the middle, that the plot was being too easy to figure out.  Revelations in the latter part of the game, however, just got more and more exciting - I had no idea what was coming.  The story was well written, enjoyable, immersive, and refreshingly different.I highly recommend this game.  I wish I hadn't waited so long to give it a full effort.  I now see why so many articles were written about it when it first came out, and I'm sad it isn't as well known as it deserves to be.  It isn't just another gimmick in a game.  It is deep and powerful, and I am so glad I played it.			"

												I loved this game. That is, *after* I disabled the awareness of the demons in the .ini file. I have to admit, had I been stuck with the demons, I would have returned the game. I like true adventure games - no dying and being attacked. I like stress-free escapism, thanks.I also had an issue with a bug in the interface whilst playing with my mouse and keyboard (PC). The interface, accessed by the tab key, kept locking up when viewing the investigation 'notes' and deductions. I had to switch to a game controller, which fixed the problem. After I discovered those fixes, I was able to play the game without any problems. I was intrigued by the mystery of who the killer was, the novelty of playing as a ghost trying to finish old business, and finally, having fun finding all the little items in the game. I played this over and over, just to re-experience the characters and the story. The story tends to be linear, action folks won't find anything remotely interesting, and old adventure gamers like me won't like the demons, but, in the end, the game was extremely enjoyable.			"

												The game's weaknesses are mostly forgivable due to the strength of the story and worldbuilding and collectibles. I didn't run into any technical problems, and looking back at the reviews, I think they're a lot harsher than the game deserved. It's worth noting that Steam reviews are very positive, sitting a 82% rather than the critic average of 59%. I found the game engaging and interesting, and I thoroughly enjoyed messing with video game conventions of character interaction with walls.Full review: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/07/murdered-soul-suspect.html "

												I'm going to not recommend this game, primarily because it is just too short and has too many small issues with it; however, I do still think this is worth a play through.In Murdered: Soul Suspect, you play Ronin; a not-so-cleverly named man who is dead and searching for his killer. Through the game, you will help some random ghosts in what is I think some of the most interesting gameplay, and run around in crime scenes solving hide-and-seek puzzle games. The major flaw in this game comes with the very short play time and annoying time wasting monster encounters.Throughout the game you will have encounters with ""daemons"" who are your typical Metal Gear style pathed guards; they can only be killed from behind with a simple QTE and are more of a nusanse than actually being a challenge. By the end of the game, I went into the config and made it so they just didn't see me so I wouldn't have to fight them. It's not that fighting daemons is hard, it's just annoying and by the end of the game if you don't know where the escape rooms are you can just die if you screw up.The final encounter is lame and very confusing, I had to look up the solution. Again, like the daemons, this wasn't because it was hard, it was because the prompt wasn't clear on what I should do.The story has some decent writing in small parts. The noir monologue at the entrance to each game section is a neat touch. The two main characters are interesting, and there seems to be a decent about of background lore on Ronin (the PC). The collectables are interesting as they expand on the murder case and also include background about Salem (the town in which the game takes place). I have no idea if any of the lore is true, but it is nice they put it in. The hidden collectables are unique as they are just ghost/horror stories that have no connection to the main plot - its nice.Over all I think the game is worth a play through if you can pick it up for under $10. There is enough there to keep you entertained for an evening and if you like ghost stories than you should have a good time.			"

												This game has a great story with a pretty interesting concept. I really enjoyed it and it took me right to the end of the game to figure it all out. But.If you are in any way a completionist (like me) it will sap hours of your time to find everything, though nothing is particularily challenging to get, it adds up. Additionaly the menu to acess all the backstory unlocked from said collectibles is very difficult to use on PC.Also the ''stealth'' parts, could have been better. I'm not sure what their role was other than to make the game slightly longer and it felt a lot like padding.Having said all this, i can't emphasise enough how much i enjoyed the story and if the game had been more like an interactive novel i would not have complained one bit :) TL;DRGreat story, more than enough to make up for the unnecessary stealth aspect and excessive collectibles.

												Overall a good game. I feel the story was concrete and actually pretty enjoyable, and the gameplay kinda blends a mix of detective activity and stealth. The ghost stories that you can unlock through the game by discovering their respective artifacts are also pretty good for adding some more flavour to the history of Salem, although it can be sometimes frustrating looking through every nook and cranny to find a hiding artifact. But hey, if you enjoy that sort of stuff, there's loads of it in this game. One slightly disappointing factor of the game is that there isn't really an option you can use to manually save the game; it works by checkpoints. So if you end your game in between checkpoints, you'll be forced to start again from the last autosave. However, the game seems to preserve anything you unlock or discover, regardless of the inconvenient autosaves.			"

												For some reason I thought this game was going to be pretty lame, and I was delighted to be proven wrong. This is basically Law and Order: Spectral Victims Unit. You are a ghost cop trying to solve not only your own murder, but several others as well as preventing further murders from taking place. A large portion of the game is just finding clues mixed in with the occasional stealth-kill arena when demons start showing up. Overall, I think if you're a fan of slower paced detective stories you'll find this game to be worth your time.			"

												Remember when Mirror's Edge came out and everyone got all excited that THIS was a new and exciting concept that, despite the clunky execution, really deserved to be remade? And then at E3 they announced it would be? Yeah... Well, don't ever say history never repeats.If you drag yourself, embittered and complaining, to the end of this game, and watch the credits roll-by (unskippable credits, too -- WHO still does that?!), it's informative, I think, about what's wrong with this game. The first name listed is the Story and Creative Director, which is fair enough, followed by aaaaaaaaaall the Square Enix producers, the Marketing directors, then their sales managers, analysts and coordinators, the interactive marketing senior manager, the traffic manager, the senior counsel, VP of HR, HR administrator, the network engineer, desktop support, senior manager officer administration, the senior accountant, the credit manager, and a whooooooole host of other Square Enix people before you finally get to the... Square Enix localisation managers, producers, teams, coordinators, brand design managers, production assistants, and then all of those for each office, the marketing in each country, the community managers, the localisation testers, functionality testers ... etc ...What's my point? There's about 300 names (unskippable, remember) before you get to a single programmer. And therein this game's primary problem.Early on in the game, in your rush to solve the first puzzle, you can seemingly run ahead of the game, find too many clues, and the game will effectively lock and you won't be able to progress. A check online will detail the precise order of clues to find to get past that section, but by that stage, you're pretty much over it. And this is sadly not an isolated incident. This game is riddled with problems: there are walkways you can't walk over the one-inch step on, others you cannot walk down, priests that walk through walls preventing your continuing the mission, cats walking up ramps that seem to freeze in a ""I'm jumping down"" pose, ...Yet, at the core of it, this is a really good game, and if there were more QA people and fewer marketing people involved, it could have been a really great game. In investigating your own murder, you play ethereal detective, run around possessing people to help solve your murder at the hands of a seemingly unstoppable serial killer. You get to hear peoples' thoughts, read their notes, look into their lives, or even influence their thinking.Expanded, some graded difficulty and substantially polished, this could be a real bombshell of new IP. But I am guessing SE didn't have the faith, cash or the willpower to purge the apparent stadium full of executives, producers, directors, managers and marketing people in favour of actual QA folk and programmers.tl;dr? Good idea, poor execution.			"

												*Spoilers discussed in review*I can't decide if the story of this game did or did not make up for things I disliked. I enjoyed the side stories and as someone who likes searching every nook and cranny of a world I enjoyed hunting for the extra pieces of evidence and items to find the stories. Sometimes it was frustrating having to be standing right next to something for it to have the option to interact with it but most of the time it was solid.....except once where my game glitched and I had to reload before it would let me interact with anything again. I was also a little annoyed that we couldn't revisit investigations. Again being someone who likes to be thorough, when I noticed I'd accidentally missed a clue out of an investigation you can imagine who annoying that stain on the record was when I realised I couldn't revisit it to find the clue I'd missed. Could not have some ""Recall Investigation"" feature been added? My main gripe about the game was the combat system against the enemies. Using a mouse and keyboard, I really disliked how they used the wasd keys and a left or right button click to dispence of enemies. If I was in a panic, I would have to wait around for ages to go through the malarky of it again hoping I don't miss-click or press the wrong key again. I didn't feel like it was a very rewarding system in that respect and just frustrated me more than anything. The enemies were just an annoyance rather than a ""Alright! Lets deal with these evil demons!"" Little disappointed with the ending. I feel like you found out only half of the story...the twist of who the killer was, I thought, was very interesting but they didn't go into it enough at the last minute. I felt through the whole game we didn't have a clue who the killer was and at the end they just went ""Hey lets have this person"". I don't even think I understand why the killer did it. I understand she was murdered for accusing witchcraft...but why had she accused them in the first place? What was her reason for that? The bell didn't really have much significance either. I just feel a bit underwhelmed. I also never appreciate a game which doesn't allow you to skip the credits!Overall, I am glad I played the game (even though it probably doesn't sound like it!) but it was a little....meh. I don't think I'll be playing it again in a hurry to find things I missed.			"

												in Murdered: Soul Suspect, you play as a detective who gets killed in the town of Salem, which is known for its witchcraft trials. The detective gets turned into a ghost and you play as the ghost which is fun and it means that you can walk through walls and read peoples minds but the downside is that people only have 1 line thoughts and you can't walk through every wall, which is actually annoying. the town of salem is well imagined and the characters are likeable. my issue with this game is that it wants to keep you involved by making you collect things and listen to ghost stories, but it's not scary and in the end you feel that there isn't enough to do. the puzzles are easy and the game crashes a lot. It doesn't take long to finish and to be honest I'd skip it.			"

												Voice acting is awesome, and the plot is pretty neat and had a few twists I hadn't expected. It really gives you an opportunity to gumshoe your way through the meat of the plot. The game is focused on mystery solving rather than combat, which is refreshing to see (exocising demons doesn't really feel like combat).However, the game is short. Very short. I picked up this title last night and have already finished it. It's a fun title, but considering the lack of length, I'd wait until it goes on sale before spending money on it. I left feeling disappointed by the length, and to be honest, wouldn't have spent the money on it at all if I knew it would have been so short.			"

												The game is about a cop who dies but cannot moves on until figures out who his murderer is. While ghost aspect surely adds a twist to the game, this is basically an adventure game with a lot of walking and listening. There is also some sort of a fighting sequence but it loses it's charm after a while and you start wishing it never existed in the first place. Story, voice acting and characters are quite cool, also the game is arguably bug-free. However, the game is short (I usually hang around a lot in games but even I finished it in 9 hours).Conclusion:FACTS:~ The game has a lot of talking and solving puzzles in it. If you want pew pew bang bang kinda game this isn't for you~ Relatively shortPROS:+ Great voice acting+ Great story+ Great atmosphere and characters+ You can actually use ghost powers (possesion, passing through solid objects etc)+ Nicely placed collectables (so they actually makes sense)+ Not a lot of bugsCONS:- The fights get boring fast and you feel like they're a burden- Investigations are kinda easy			"

												This is one of those games which gets murdered by so called highly educated gaming reviewers but they are stuck in AAA world. Now the game is not perfect, especially with nvidia surround which requires to install flawless widescreen but once that is taking care of, you are on for a very interesting and different game. It is not an action game but a more relax investigation game. You do have to fight some demons but honestly, I could have done without it as it does not bring anything. So, gameplay wise, very basic, a bit cluncky (probably related to the nvidia surround), but all the investigations, the historical aspect of salem, all the legends, this game has a lot to offer if you can appreciate the style. I would highly recommend it and also take the time to do all the investigations, this is where a lot of the gametime is. One thing, the first investigation is a bit slow but please, go past it and you will see why people enjoyed it.			"

												from the opening cinema you know you are in for a treat! You are a god damn ghost! solving your own murder before you can leave purgatory and move on.Story is just phenominal. Side missions are fun and interesting, development is just endless. The demons, the images of the past (ghosts) the controls are superlative, especially if you are an Alan Wake fan, like I am. Graphics are fantastic, sound, voice actors, music. Ive been waiting for something like this so I can stop trolling the bad games like infection, aftermath, dayz, h1z1 time sinks..there is a reward and an end here, and no hackers, no nerds, no kos, no car horders, no bad dev teams who get defensive, dont keep their promises and that think they have followers on twitter because they are cool/interesting people. roflllllWorth every penny and as it goes on you are on the edge of you seat with suspense. Who killed me, and wtf is he! ahhhhI will prepay for a sequel, wondering how I ever missed this title in the first place, kudos!			"

												TL:DR - 12hr run time if you hunt for collectables. Average plot, decent but not groundbreaking and ultimately predictable. Decent mechanics and character abilities. Reasonably well written characters. All of this is hindered and spoiled by the frustrating need to kill demons when the kill sequence is buggy as hell and only serves to slow the game down and annoy you. Still worth playing, but be prepared to be thoroughly annoyed for about a quarter of the game.Overall it's got a decent plot, decent set design, interesting game mechanics. The Investigation side of things is pretty typical, doesn't stretch very far from the conventions of the genre but does involve a few quirks to give it it's own identity (e.g. you can uncover clues and information through possessing people and manipulating them into giving up information).The plot is, for the most part, pretty predictable. For example, *minor spoiler, no specific details*,  the story centres on the witch trails of salem, which becomes pretty obvious about halfway through when a flashback to one of the murders is shown. After that, it's pretty clear that the overarching motive is to do with killing witches. This wouldn't be nearly as obvious to the player if the game was set somewhere OTHER THAN SALEM, which is famous for KILLING WITCHES. As soon as strange symbols and similar things get mentioned, the connection is almost instinctive .The only real twists and turns occur right at the end and even then don't do much to flip the story on it's head, they just make the overall story a little more original. Around halfway through the story, a lot of people will figure out the second half of the plot pretty quickly and then will just have to play through the game and wait for confirmation of what is sadly quite obvious.All that aside, the biggest detractor from the game is the BLOODY DEMONS. A few sections of the game require you to get your stealth hat on and exorcise demons from behind by distracting them, triggering a quicktime event, and hoping that the stars and planets are correctly aligned when you press the buttons, because the system is buggy as hell. For starters, this style of gameplay is totally unecessary and poorly implemented. There's absolutely no flow to it and it just seems like something the developers put in to make the game last a little longer and make it more exciting/different (which it does the exact opposite of). For a dectective game, it really kills the immersion and slows the pace right down. It's incredibly frustrating when all you want to do is get on with the investigation.Basically, if you're drawn to this game and like detective games, go ahead and play it. It's pretty fun and pretty clever at times. Just don't expect to be blown away by the story, although it has some pretty good moments. And definately expect to get extremely fed up with BLOODY DEMONS.			"

												A well done murder / detective game, Murdered: Soul Suspect was an enjoyable game overall and is worth getting (on a sale) if you’re into this genre. The plot is straightforward. You play as Ronan, a criminal turned detective who is shot and killed by a mysterious man. Your quest is to figure out the truth behind your murder and why it happened. Gameplay is mostly good. First off, you play as the ghost of yourself. Therefore, you can walk through most walls and objects which is fun to do. This is carried through the story where characters that are alive cannot see or hear you. You won’t be shooting anyone or have any big action moments. This is story driven first with some puzzles, clue finding scenes and a few small “stealth” parts thrown in. The puzzles incorporate clues you just found or found in the past. You use them to answer questions the game asks you. “What would help Mary remember?” or “What is Joy doing?” for example. The answers are sometimes illogical but you can just guess again.Clue finding scenes are exactly what it sounds like. Find all the clues in a particular area in order to figure out what went on.Stealth sections are the weak point of the game. Luckily, there’s not many of them and it’s not too hard. There are demons that can float around certain areas or inside buildings. To kill them, you need to go up behind them and execute them with a quick time event. However, the controls for this were not predictable and I died several times because the controls wouldn’t respond how I anticipated. The environment, graphics and sound are all very good. There’s definitely a creepy atmosphere that surrounds the entire city. Although, I found that a lot of the characters looked the same and would mistake certain characters for others. I thought the voice acting was fantastic. A definite strong point here.Run the game in 60FPS+Turn off VSYNC in the game options+Enable/force VSYNC in the Nvidia Control Panel Note:Cinematics will still be 30FPS as they are pre-renderedOne of the biggest complaints I have with the game is the lack of a map. It became frustrating to try and navigate around Salem and forget how to get to certain areas you want to re-visit. The game gives you a navigation marker for your current objective, but that’s it. Throughout my playthrough I was never really familiar with the city. For a game with lots of collectibles, it would have been a great addition. I initially tried playing with a keyboard and mouse. It seemed to work fine but when entering the in-game diary, it wouldn’t register me trying to move around. I eventually just used an Xbox 360 controller and everything worked perfect.Pros+60FPS (see note above)+Good story+Great voice acting+Well done animations+Creepy environmentCons+No map+Stealth combat sections+No save feature, only checkpoints+Puzzles are too easy+Steam overlay doesn’t work+Keyboard/mouse controls brokenEven with a few faults, I thought Soul Suspect was a good game and enjoyed playing it. It’s a little short, with maybe 8-10 hours to complete. Even less if you don’t collect the various collectibles. So at the current price of $30, it’s a little steep. Grab this on sale.7/10 Good			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect, is very underated as a game. I put off playing this game for quite some time due to the negative publicity. My loss, because this is well above average in many regards.The negatives are its total lack of replayability and pointless combat system. But forget about all that and don't even bother with the collectibles, the majotity of them are pointless and offer nothing in relation to world or charcter building. The npcs found everywhere are likewise pointless, dont waste your time with them.However the reason I love this game is the story, the main story is gripping and the main characters are likewise compelling. This is not an fps or an rpg, its a very good interactive story. If like me you appreciate a well told story in a great setting and don't mind it being linear with no sidequests and the rest of the fluff then this is a winner. If you spacebar through conversations and skip cutscenes then avoid this like the plague.Love Arch			"

												Pros: Engaging collect-the-clues mystery with good graphics, lots of story, and even a little originality.Cons: WTF is this quicktime event barely-stealth horror thing that keeps interrupting the story? Go away and let me focus on my clue collecting and mystery solving.Also, it's NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to collect all the collectables the first time through because the game only gives you the ""endgame warning"" after locking you out of one of the collectable-filled locations. Since the game is extremely liner, the only replay value is in walking through the same game again for 100% completion.Still, I was engaged and enjoyed myself.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game. I thought it was fun and the story was compelling enough to make me want to finish it. Speaking of the story, however, this main character is easily the dumbest person I have ever encountered in my life, let alone the fact that he's a detective. Ronan didn't die because he was hunting down a murderer, he died because the writers couldn't come up with a good enough excuse for supposedly-respectable police officers to allow this kind of stupidity to act freely in their police department. So they killed him off so that no cops would have to actually deal with how utterly moronic he is. I figured out the story about two and a half hours into the game, and i played a good 5 or 6 hours total to beat it. All along the way, Ronan kept going ""Huh, I wonder what this means"" when the meaning is so blatantly obvious that a 7-year-old could figure it out, given that this 7-year-old had the utmost basic knowledge on the historical significance of Salem. There was genuinely only one part of this story that surprised me, and even then, it wasn't that impactful because of how upset I was at Ronan for his 6  straight hours of nonstop idiocracy. What really emphasized his stupidity, and I personally find this thoroughly ironic, was when he finally ended up talking with Baxter. Ronan spent the entirety of the game talking about how stupid Baxter is, and when it came down to them actually working together, Ronan had gotten to literally the EXACT same place as Baxter in their search for the killer. Also, overall, Ronan's facial expressions were a huge disconnect. You could tell it was supposed to be a dramatic moment, and Ronan still looked like the infant that I think he really is. Except if that infant were 5'10"", had a stubble, and wore a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fedora. Mechanics-wise, it was lacking, but not in such a way that made it hard. Just somewhat tedious. At one point where Ronan should be hauling♥♥♥♥♥across all of Salem, he's instead jogging briskly, taking detours because of how confusing the map is. The teleport mechanic comes in handy, I guess, but honestly it would be so much better if it were just a set distance that you could sorta spam to move faster, instead of having to hold left click, wait for it to charge, and let go, only to travel a repeatedly disappointing distance. Trying to get from the musem to the church was honestly one of the worst sequences for this. I wanted to care about trying to get to the church as fast as I possibly could, but all Ronan could care about was the brunch he was gonna go have with his dead wife after this was all over, resulting in me wanting to start running down my street so that one of us could feel like they were attempting to go quickly towards anything.tl;drstory was predictable, Ronan is a moron, and the controls are meh. 14/10 would Julia again.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is by no means a great game, neither is it a bad game. It is relatively short; the storyline takes about 11 or so hours. The gameplay is fairly simple; travel the overworld to the next objective, sneak/stealth past the baddies, then investigate a crime scene. There are a few puzzles here and there, but nothing that is too complicated. There are a few mechanics introduced throughout the game, but nothing too in-depth, which made the gameplay a bit bland. However, since the game is so short, the lack of new/interesting mechanics didn't really matter since even the basic actions I didn't end up using too many times. Overall, I wasn't blown away, but I didn't not enjoy the storyline. If the following is true: you want a quick game for the weekend, it's on sale, you don't want anything overcomplicated, and you've played through everything else in your library; then this would be a decent game. If you are looking for anything in-depth or with a in-depth storyline, steer clear of this one.			"

												The only reason this game remains interesting is that there aren't that many detective titles around. However, beyond novelty it has little to offer. The investigation mechanics have potential but are way to limited to be engaging. There is little thinking required. It usually comes down to clicking on all clickable things in the area and than choosing the relevant information. It is a straightforward process, as long as you don't overthing things. Your character (and everyone else for that matter) and quite dumb and you will often connect dots way quicker than game wants you to. The final reveal surprises only because of how silly it is.Also the is something of a stealth combat mechanics, probably due to devs or producers not being confident in their product. It sucks but doesn't take too much time.			"

												The only thing holding your attention here will be the story, everything else is basic and an afterthought.While you do play as a detective, the ""investigations"" that you conduct mostly consist of running around a room looking for something that you can interact with until find the ones you need to complete the investigation. Every once in a while you get a few enemies coming your way, dealing with them is easy and they probably could have been left out of the game entirely as it feels like they're there just to pad out the game. You are able to possess people and cats, but there is not much you can do when possessing people, mostly just reading their mind which becomes dull after a couple of tries. While possesing a cat you can also move around the world with it, however the movement is not at all fluid, jarring even, and it's just so that you can move from one point to another which for game reasons you could not do before. Besides the main story you also have some side cases to solve, which can be interesting and I wish there were more of them.In most ways the Murdered: Soul Suspect is generic and average at best. Thankfully though I certainly was interested in the story and it had some nice mysteries to keep you going. So I would only recommend it to people who are confident that they can enjoy a game just by following the story.6 / 10			"

												I would label this as a must buy on sale game. The game itself is a rather interesting take on a detective game, where you are a murdered cop trying to solve his own murder at the hands of a serial killer, so that he can move on to the afterlife and be with his wife. Gameplay mainly consists of investigating crimescenes for clues, and then drawing conclusions based on what you find. There are also ghost abilities, like being able to possess people to read their thoughts, or make electronics turn on. There is also a minor element of combat, as there are demons that will attempt to consume you unless you sneak up on them and destroy them first.The story is engaging, the voice acting is solid, and the movement and game mechanics are well designed and fluid. The ending is solid and satisfying as well. Why only just on sale? It's a relatively quick play through, with no replay value. Once you have made it to the end, the story is complete and there is no reason to revisit it.			"

												There are a few pretty annoying things about this game, and though they don't really weigh on the game experience I would like to name them first:- demons. Only opponents in the game that need to be defeated, completely unnecessary, and take up a good bit of your time if sometimes, like in my case, the combination shown on the screen for execution do not work- no map. Seriously. Why?!- the end ""fight"". Well, go see for yourself.Also, for an obsessive collector like me, this was pretty much heaven and hell at the same time. But oh so good to unlock all the achievements in the end ... Apart from that, I really enjoyed the game's atmosphere which was really dark and convincing, especially in places like the cemetery or the asylum, and there's a lot of backstory and historical information which I personally found very interesting, but even if you're there just for the story, you probably won't be disappointed. Got it at a discount price, not sure if I would really pay 30 bucks for it since it is not very long, but decide for yourself if it is worth it.			"

												interactive film, detective noir gone horror story - I got this on a sale so it was ok. The story is kinda shallow. There are some revelations and plot twists which should have a bigger impact on the protagonist. I had the bad luck to figure the story out once I got a hang of how ghosts work in this game so it was kind of predictable for me.Do not buy this game if you expect something challenging (I put in about 10 hours, got 100% achievements in one playthrough and there is no incentive to play again) or something that makes you think. Do buy it if you just want entertainment and the price is ok for you.			"

												Definately a breath of fresh air amongst the thousands of First and Third Person Shooters out there.The mystery is woven a little thick in places but it's definately enjoyable to unravel it piece by piece.The characters, what little there is of them, are competently written and voice acted and the music does it's best to amplify the creepy mood of it all.The game does suffer however from forced  ""stealth"" elements that do nothing but pad out the game's relatively short running time (FOUR HOURS).And at the end Murdered Soul Suspect is a point'n'click mystery game, without any pointing, without any clicking and a mystery that effectively solves itself - But that doesn't mean it's bad.

												Very interesting game, investigating your own murder was a refreshing idea. However, the demons felt like an unnescesary gameplay mechanic, and there's no option to skip credits, so you'll be sitting there for a good 5-10 minutes.Overall good game, but minor problems with it.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect takes a fascinating part of American history and pairs it with a supernatural detective story.  The environment and plot is very creative and unique and kept me interested until the end.  The game is fairly short and doesn't overstay its welcome, yet still provides a lot of character and plot development as well as a few twists.  That being said, there are two minor downfalls to this game.  The first is the overuse of collectibles.  While the collectibles are easy enough to find and doesn't require too much 'post game time' to sit down and sniff them out, there are still a ton of them.  Over 170 in fact.  Each collectible gives some sort of backstory to the world or relevent major characters, but the sheer number of them will have you running to pick them up first before doing the actual story missions.  I feel this can really take the player out of the setting and mood Murdered: Soul Suspect tried to create, with its old, colonial, haunted theme.  If you are the type of player to skip right over collectibles and not be bothered, then this isn't a problem for you.  But if you are OCD, have to get them all, hear every backstory, learn every secret, then this will probably get on your nerves a bit.The other issue to this game is that some of the puzzles are unclear as to how you should go about solving them.  While this has only happened to me about maybe 15% of the puzzles in the game, it is still frustrating to look up the answer and say to yourself 'How does that make sense?'.  The game does give hints if you get the puzzle wrong, but sometimes the hints aren't that clear.  With some trial and error, you should be ok though.Overall, I enjoyed this game.  I picked it up when it was $4 and would have gladly paid $20 for it.  The setting and plot were really unique and I liked all of the ghost mechanics that were added into the game.  It is definitely a game to play when you are looking to get a good story with some amusing puzzles.  I rate this game a 9/10.			"

All of the pictures in the police department glass case have people with the same face. Including the dog. The dog has the same face as the people. 60/10 Would possess a cat again.			"

												 Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game I hadn't heard anything good about. Even prior to release, all the buzz was fairly negative. I can sort of see why. Soul Suspect is a strange cousin to a few genres. Its engine feels like it should be third person action adventure, but there is little action. The action (when it occurs) relies on limited stealth and is a bit rubbish. It operates mostly like a point and click, but investigative sections are few and far between. The main crux of the game is the deductive reasoning which is frankly utter tripe.Now none of this looks very good for Soul Suspect... You know what let's get this out of the way - the title is dreadful. Soul Suspect is a play on words that doesn't really make sense, except that you are a soul, having been murdered in the opening minutes of the game (spoiler!). But that's it. It would have been acceptable, but the ""Murdered"" title makes it unwieldy. Are we to expect a spate of games in the ""Murdered"" series? I would suggest ""Murdered: Going Ghostal"" about a murdered postman. I digress.On the surface, Soul Suspect is very much on the ropes here, so let's take it back to the beginning, where the game actually makes a very good first impression. Essentially, you play a policeman who is killed by a serial killer while investigating said serial killer and has to solve his own murder before he can move on to heaven. A neat, fun premise that isn't too demanding and immediately has you suspending your disbelief. What I found exceptional was the telling of your character's history in a well done cutscene showing his tattoos and reasons for getting each one. It really adds some layers to your character and I have to say that I liked the guy. There, I said it. He isn't too much of a wisecracking smartarse, he isn't all whiny and angsty about dying, and his voice actor does a cracking job. Great. I'd go as far as to say that all the characters are well written. You eventually befriend a teenage girl and even SHE is well portrayed, with the right amount of attitude to stay interesting without getting annoying.Now, sadly it starts to go downhill. Not quickly or dramatically, mind you - you just start to feel that many elements could have be far better implemented. The meat of the game is made up of investigating crime scenes, very similar to L.A. Noire, but without the depth. It can feel a little bit clumsy walking around the crime scene waiting for the ""investigate"" prompt to come up. It tells you how many clues you need to find, but finding some is needlessly difficult, requiring some odd maneuvering into the exact position. Using the clues themselves is even more frustrating.An example from early in the game is when you have to investigate a young woman who tells you she was murdered by an old couple and needs to know where her body is so she can move on. After investigating the old couple's apartment, you are given the question ""What happened to the young woman's body?"" and you have 6 clues to work with. Intuitively, you might select the ones that give physical evidence or point to what happened to her body, but you'd be wrong. The clues you have to select are actually 1) the girl is dead; 2) this person murdered her; 3) yes, this person definitely murdered her. It doesn't make any sense, because the clues you have to use don't really point to the question asked. This is a recurring problem throughout the game, but swings wildly between obtuse clues and such stark simplicity that you are constantly thrown. For example, later you are asked ""What made that cracking noise?"", a rope, branch or something cracking into a tree. Here it seems like the answer with ""crack"" in it is too obvious, but that is the actual answer!This all leads to a rather odd issue with the game in that there doesn't really seem to be a way to fail the investigations, you can just keep trying combinations of clues until you get it right. You get 3 shields next to a clue if you get it perfectly, dropping down to one as you fail. I don't really know how I feel about this. I like that it keeps the story moving, but it also makes the game feel trivial.What can slow the pace of the game are the fairly boring stealth sections. There are two types - one where you simply have to distract a living person with a possessed electrical appliance in order to let your companion slip past (I never failed any of these sections), and the second is when demons decide to show up. These sections are incredible dull and annoying simultaneously. You need to either slip by the demons' very short, predictable patrol paths or get behind them and kill them with mercifully simple QTE. There is some nonsense about using ghost crows to distract them and hiding in ghost residues if they spot you, but it all seems hastily cobbled together.When you're not taking part in the main parts of the game, you'll be collecting collectibles. Lots and lots of collectibles. There are journals, memories, ghost stories and ghost graffiti to collect and are also the subject of ambivalence. They are very easy to find which is sort of good as they add to the story, but are so easy to find that they seem a bit pointless. The only hard ones to find are the graffiti collectibles, but that's because they're invisible and there's the problem of you being in the right position to tell you that you can interact with them.So all in all, boring, pointless and needlessly obtuse. What a terrible game! Well, no, actually. It all sort of comes together. It gels very well. It initially feels weird moving around the levels and into crime scenes because you might feel like you should be sneaking, but you are completely invisible, so you walk around completely unimpeded. You can walk through walls, possess people to see what they're thinking and (in a great highlight) even possess a cat and run around meowing. The execution of the game might be lacking, but the intention is so clear that I found myself forgiving it most of its flaws.The story is a high point as well, I have to admit that it drew me in very and had me second guessing myself a few times. There are lots of clues around as to what is happening and if (like me) you pick up on them, you will find yourself slightly thrown as you try to piece it all together and re-evaluate your theories. I even found myself pleasantly surprised by the denouement - it wasn't overlong, over complex or a ridiculous boss fight. I was very impressed by the writing and performances in the game, they turned a mediocre game into a good one.I did get the game very cheap, I have to say, so I don't know how forgiving I would have been at £39.99. I paid around £4.50 for it and feel that that is very cheap, but I would have been happy to pay up to £11.99 for it, and that is praise indeed!			"

												a few hrs into this and its quite good 7.5/10 the reason for the score is two things, 1. the npc's walking about dont have much when it comes to commentary and they are all copied and pasted so you see them everywhere one woman was sitting on a bench i possessed her, listened to her story de-possessed her, moved on to a woman who looks exatcly like her walking by the bench and yeah it was her and the EXACT script i got from the bench so theyre cloning the NPC'S without even trying to hide it.2. trying to press E or R on an item close to something else is a little finnicky and frustrating sometimes.so yeah felt a little cheated with the attack of the clones everywhere but all in all i like the investigation aspects as well as the story driving it so i think my score it humble enough to give credit where its due,all in all THUMBS UP!!

												A hugely underrated game in some circles, wherein I fear that some feel it does not stand up to the graphical quality of the PS3/PS4 games we have today. You have a choice: a stunning story, or pure eye candy. This game stands tall on the story aspect, featuring one of the best introductions I have ever seen in a video game. The setting is a powerful one indeed. All characters are relevant, and it is amazing to see a setting unfold and exposition be provided by so many supporting characters.There are the occasional obstacles requiring strategy guides (a solution to a problem would've been to have interactive objects glow orange or something like that) that can impede gameplay, but it isn't really a problem in the long run. Heck, you can possess (play as) a cat. That also makes the game an instant win in my book :D			"

												To be honest this is one of the best 6hrs and a 30mins of playing this game, controls are easy to use, good story line with plenty of wtf/omg's moments. the game not only looks good but it also lives up to its name, basic story, your a cop who has been tracking a murder which you then save a teenage girls life as you die without knowing, after the fall to the ground you then relise that your soul is out of your body as the ""Bell killer"" shows up only to see that you have no control or effect which your forced to see your own death outside your corp, now its up to you and a teenage girl to investigate the crime scenes and leds to find out clues to track down the ""Bell killer"" and help other ghost to reclam their memories as you sneak through countless of demos with the chance of kill or be killed.............9/10    hope this game will get a another one coming out : /         conclustion: if you want to play a game which will get you thinking to solve crimes of a killer dubed as ""Bell Killer"" and stop this madness of an angry spirit as you sneak through countless of demo's to the truth   -must play :3			"

The big problem with the game though was the length of it, but that's without finding all of the secret stories. However you can find about 50% of the secrets just by playing the story.

												This ""game"" is one of the worst I've ever ""played"".  Even if free, it's not worth the time you'd spend.  Certain elements of the game make it clear that the game was rushed to publication, like the ""mysteries"" that you solve for random ghosts, which appear only in the first two areas and give you no reward whatsoever.  The game mechanics are shady and boring, like when you have to put together three clues and they tell you to put them in chronological order even though the clues have nothing to do with time.  Most of the time I could figure out what they wanted but by and large it was guesswork.  The game itself is only 3 or 4 hours of real gameplay with a great deal of padding in the form of hidden collectables, most of which also do not give you any reward except for the ""scary stories"" which feature excruciating voice acting and are a giant waste of time.I wish I had the kind of guts Square Enix has to publish this piece of garbage and demand 50 bucks for it.  Do not buy it, do not play it, and remember this the next time you want a Square Enix game.			"

												When you think of Square-Enix, your mind would probably conjure up thoughts of Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts, maybe for older gamers who remember Squaresoft, you’ll even think of Chrono Trigger or maybe even Parasite Eve. Most of these games are sold as role playing games, and it’s the genre where Square-Enix has really dominated over the past twenty-five years. It came as a bit of a surprise then, when I saw a paranormal detective game being released by the RPG titans in the form of Murdered: Soul Suspect.See more at VG Almanac[vgalmanac.com] "

												You see I recommend it, but only to certain people.I will first of all admit that this game gameplay wise is absolutely dreadful to play. All of it is either you walking around a crime scene trying to find some obscure clue that isn't showing up when pass it or killing demons by mashing WASD or the mouse buttons at once. I found myself struggling to play the game simply for the repetitive and boring gameplay.But what is good is the immersion and story. That is what kept me going through this. If you treat this game as a game and not a story, it kinda falls flat on it's face in every way. But if you look at it for it's story and where it guides, it is pretty damn good. The ending was also great, something you have to experience yourself when connecting the dots. About half way through the game though the story starts to drag but at the end it picks back up in an extremely memorable way.So in terms of the actual game I would recommend purchase if you are into game stories and not gameplay. Something like the Walking Dead but not near as awesome.Performance wise the game is solid on playability most of the time. Most of the games that are helped made by AMD usually have decent ports with minimal problems, two good examples being Sleeping Dogs and Hitman: Absolution. There are problems though. This game in the options tends to not give you details, for instance the in the settings for anti-aliasing the options for FXAA are thing like FXAA(High) and FXAA(Medium), doesn't really give me an idea of what I am working with. The other issue is also with the mouse sensitivity settings, there are 3 options. There is no slider it is literally three options. I had to adjust my mouse DPI to make this game playable. But on high settings for everything at 1080p I would usually experience 120 fps + nicely. Although depending on the lighting my game has dropped to 30 for no reason (namely the church entrance).As a note I am playing with:2nd Gen AMD A10-5700 Accelerated APU (integrated graphics disabled)EVGA GTX 750 1GB DDR3 FTW ACX Cooling8 GB RAM			"

												This game is more like ""L.A. Noire"" than anything else, and I really enjoyed it. Then again, I enjoy games with decent stories more than a lot of people seem to do, and the story for ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" had enough twists and kept my intrigue enough to see it the whole way through without too many regrets. There was potential for it to be a ""horror"" game (which I hate), but fortunately any scares were more in the environment and feeling of the game than through outright scares.  Some people seem to put more value on time spent, so for those kind of people this game at $30 (as I write this) might not be of value. But if you enjoyed ""L.A. Noire"", this game is at least worth getting on a Steam sale.There are enough other reviews (should this one ever be read by anyone) that I'm going to spare yet another description of the story and get to what I think are the pluses and minuses of the game.Pluses:+ Non-linear with respect to being able to visit previous locations+ Intriguing story placed in Salem, MA and linked to the historic witch trials+ Dark, brooding atmosphere without necessarily crossing the line into ""horror""+ Good acting and voice work+ No jump scares (for the most part)+ Roughly 8-10 hour play time doesn't require too much commitment+ No achievement mandating that all of the mysteries are solved PEFECTLY (unlike ""L.A. Noire"")+ Side quests while not required provided some well-written ghost stories+ Some interesting plot twistsMinuses:- Demons felt like they were added for pointless stealth/action gameplay- Too many collectibles for a game of this size- No way to track how many collectibles still remain in a particular location- End sequence stops somewhat abruptlyIf you can put up with the pointless demons, which don't show up very often anyway, and you can deal with not having to find *every* collectible, you'll probably find this game worthwhile, although the $30 price tag (as of writing) might be a bit too much for some people, based on the returns. This is definitely worth picking up on a Steam sale, though.			"

												I guess this is that game: No matter how many negative reviews or hatespeech it received on forums, magazines and websites, I was rather captivated by it. And I still cannot quite put my finger on why... many reasons I think.  Even though I absolutely dispise pixel hunting (hi Arkham City!) I found myself drawn into the world of the protagonist through brilliant voice (and mocap) acting, solid graphics and a demanding story line with a twist at the end that blew my mind. While it is certainly true that the NPC's are the most boring to ever feature in a AAA title, the main characters feel suprisingly human in this stunning demonstration of how much oomph is still left in the Unreal Engine. Even on fairly modest PC setup, the game should look good. I know I clicked 'Yes' in the section that asks if this game should be recommended, but I can at least admit it will not be everyone's cup of tea. You NEVER actually touch a gun in this game, but to me that is part of the charm. It is definitely clear that the developers made an effort to do something different, even if they failed somewhat obviously to do so. If you are looking to take a brake from flinging tons of lead at enemies and you are willing to overlook a few glaring oversights of a development studio that obviously feared missing their release date, buy it. Or put it on your wishlist for that day you feel you need to take a break from mainstream gaming.			"

												I can see how some people might recommend this game.  There is stuff to like about it, it's playable, but as a big studio title I'm going to take the harsher route and not recommend it.  Mostly because it's so underwhelming, gameplay and story wise.The game play is super casual.  Reduntantly casual.  Most of the game focuses around collecting clues, but you don't derive any meaning from them.   Once you've found the right clues you can opt to solve the case and the game will ask you a straight forward question like ""what happened here"", or ""where did the killer go next"" and you click on the clues that blatantly answer the question.  There's no deduction involve, just fill in the blank and then the character will summerize the obvious as though they were hit with some hard earned revelation.There is also the hunt/be hunted aspect of the game.  Every area has one or two sections where demons emerge and you either have to navigate through them, or destroy them without them attacking you.  It was kind of like the developer was trying to include some action in the game, but it was pretty pointless.  They didn't really get any more difficult as the game progressed and they had nothing to do with the story.  It made me wonder if the developers were playing with what kind of genre they wanted the game to be and ended up not developing or cutting out any of the possibilities. Heck, even the opening scene of us trying to get back into our body uses a gimicky game play element that we don't see again for the rest of the game. It obviously wasn't an interesting enough element to use again, why is it still in there?The story is also pretty mediocre.  I guess it's fine, it wasn't painful, it was just blah.  The superficial questions were answered, but there wasn't really any explaination as to why any of it was happening, nor was there any real character development for anyone.  The story did conclude, which is more satisfying than some games, but there wasn't really much reward for exploring so much game territory.  In fact, there were lots of smaller unrelated stories that presented themselves in the first half of the game that were probably more interesting and involving than the main plot.  I think they got tired of programming ghosts in the second half of the game or something because the NPCs that drove these side stories stopped asking for  help, and suddenly all the NPCs that had about 2 lines of original monologue each started sharing about 4 lines between all of them.All in all, I'm sure some people will like this game.  Maybe many will find it on the positive side of mundane, but personally I found it to be an overglorified, padded, hidden object game.  It could really use some editing, and it would be a nice bonus if they actually decided on an aspect of the game to develop into something interesting.			"

												I was expecting either a run of the mill horror game or a glorified walking simulator. I couldn't have been more wrong. 1) Horror: I decided to play this right after Outlast because I was in that type of mood. Soul Suspect still managed to get my heart rate up and creep me out in a few spots. 2) Walking SImulator: I think the only one I ever played was Gone Home. It was a great story, it was kind of creepy but it was so human at the same time. Sure there are ghosts and demons and witches, but the story is about people. You really get to learn about the people by just walking around and clicking on things.3) Police Procedural: The only other ones that come to mind are the CSI games and LA Noir, none of which I've played. Althought the ""puzzles"" if you want to call them that were simple, they at least made it feel like I was involved in hashing out the next step.My only gripe is that some of the collectables were in places I'd have never looked had I not eventually given up and looked them up. I'm not a fan of these things though and they are totally optional so it doesn't really efffect the game unless you want it to.I've been playing video games since the early 80s and I've been using steam since the Orange Box was bundled with video cards. Two things I hardly ever do are complete a game 100% and write a review. I've now done both for this game.			"

												You play the ghost of a detective trying to solve his own murder. The game takes place in Salem, MA, modern day, but there are insights to the city's infamous past hidden all over Salem. As you explore looking for clues as to who murdered you and why, you find many other mysteries throughout the game.This game is very linear aside from finding objects throughout the city and buildings. It took me eight hours to beat the game and that includes the time I spent exploring. It is story driven and has very little action. The only action involves sneaking up on demons and attacking them, which does require some tactic. No shooting or combat, lots of hiding. Not much horror to it either. Nothing jumps out at you and the story itself isn't that creepy. Graphics are fairly decent and controls are smooth. I used a control instead of mouse and key board.I liked the story throughout this game and enjoyed hunting for clues. If you like story rich games and detective noir stories than perhaps this is the game for you. However I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for an action/horror game. Also, I bought this on sale and thought it was a good deal, not sure I'd say the same buying it for $30. It's a good quick game with a decent story. 3/5 stars			"

												This game has a great story with a pretty interesting concept. I really enjoyed it and it took me right to the end of the game to figure it all out. But.If you are in any way a completionist (like me) it will sap hours of your time to find everything, though nothing is particularily challenging to get, it adds up. Additionaly the menu to acess all the backstory unlocked from said collectibles is very difficult to use on PC.Also the ''stealth'' parts, could have been better. I'm not sure what their role was other than to make the game slightly longer and it felt a lot like padding.Having said all this, i can't emphasise enough how much i enjoyed the story and if the game had been more like an interactive novel i would not have complained one bit :) TL;DRGreat story, more than enough to make up for the unnecessary stealth aspect and excessive collectibles.

												Soul Suspect is a good, unique game with an interesting story.First thing I'll say is that if you dont like being confined within a level boundary or anything like that then you probably wont like this game. Yes you play a ghost and can walk through many walls, but you cant walk through all of them, obviously you have to be kept in the game somehow, and I accepted that and enjoyed it.The game is humerous, has some funny dialogue and is a slow paced mystery game as you attempt to solve your murder as well as several other peoples in the game.You can take control of people in the investigation, gain information from them, then use all the clues you found to build a picture of what happened.You will investigate several crime scenes throughout the game, some are to do with the main story, and several are just extra investigations there for fun.There are plenty of collectables in the game to help form a backstory, you dont have to collect them but they are good as they give you a history on the main character and the town you are in. The town being Salem and is heavily centred around the Salem Witch Trials.There are several areas in the game in which you will do your main investivations, when completed you can always revisit them to look for things you didnt find before.There are nice details throughout the game like random ghosts that are just there in the background and vanish as you get close to them, other ghosts that you can help to move on, and even ghostly buildings, such as original structures that no longer exist in the real world but you cannot pass through them as they are real to you.If you want to play something a bit different, with a unique story, humour and lots of collectables for you to find then give Murdered: Soul Suspect a go.I may not play this game again as the fun is in the mystery and trying to work out what has happened, but its still good to play a first time.7/10Oh yeah, ignore the Metacritic score. They don't know what they are talking about.			"

Score: 7/10Similar GamesSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,The Vanishing of Ethan CarterSummaryYou play as a cop with a family history in gang violence. While tracking down the Bell Killer you wind up being killed by him. Now you must master your new ghost powers to solve the mystery of who the Bell Killer is.PositiveThe game has an interesting story and presents it very well. All the different ghost mechanics work quite nicely and really give the game some uniqueness. The atmospheric graphic imagery and sound do a great job at being creepy while staying true to both the spirit world and the living world.NegativeKILL DEMONS!! How about no... I mean combat is done in a pure stealth approach by hiding and taking them down, but overall it ends up feeling like a giant gimmick to make the game double the length. The sheer amount of waiting you have to do is just annoying during these sequences. I don't mind the demon floor traps, but the actual demons looking for you I removed with an ini edit. Here's how to make yourself invisible to them so you can just ignore fighting demons.Go to......\Murdered Soul Suspect\FateGame\Config Open...DefaultAIPerceptionData.ini Change...StimTypes=(TypeName=Player,BaseTypeName=Ghost,Result_Awareness=High)To...StimTypes=(TypeName=Player,BaseTypeName=Ghost,Result_Awareness=Unaware)ConclusionI tried to spoil as little as possible during this review. The great atmosphere and piecing of clues together while doing using your ghostly abilities is pretty fun. It can occasionally feel under developed and shallow so you may find yourself thinking about how amazing this game could have been. I doubt it will get another similar game sequel, but I think another game that used these mechanics and improved on them would be a real treat.ValueI'd suggest not paying more then about $10 for this game. The story is great, but not all that long if you use the ini tweak and ignore combat along with ignoring the collectables.			"

Murdered: Soul Suspect is a good game for those moments when you just feel like chilling. It's a graphical advenure which starts with you being already dead and your goal is to figure out why.Despite the fact that this game provides no challenge whatsoever, I enjoyed playing it because I got hooked by its story.Unfortunately, it's way too overpriced. I mean, I had fun completing the game and so on, but it's certainly not worth its price (fortunately I got it for free).			"

												It's a shame the developers closed down after this got released. I really enjoyed this game. It had a great many problems with the overall design of the game but I enjoyed it for the story. The setting, story, and atmosphere of the game are the biggest parts about it. I didn't mind that the gameplay was easy. It's weakest parts are not being able to find one or two puzzle pieces for side-quests and the ""stealth"" sections where you have to sneak up to demons and do QTEs to destroy them. If you can pick this game up on sale, I'd recommend playing it. If only for the story. Really gritty, film noir style game with a ghostly twist.			"

												If you like indigo prophesy or heavy rain you might like this game.  Otherwise you should stay away.  It's a 3d point and click search-a-thon for all clues in cases.  I assume the more you get the better ending/easier, but many times you go right past a clue without even showing you a trigger to reveal the clue.  Also no way to use a resolution you like without using 3rd party software.  The game would revert my chosen resolution to another of its choosing and would not even go all the way full screen on my monitor or even max out to the resolution of my monitor.  Not my type of game, but if you like the games listed at the top, you may enjoy it.			"

												I'm not really sure why I liked Murdered: Soul Suspect, maybe it was because the investigation parts are just the right amount of challenging without relying on your ability to lip read the faces of the uncanny valley... I'm trying to avoid looking at you L.A Noire... Or perhaps it was the side quests, engaging side quests, where I actually felt like I was doing some good, that I was changing the game world for the better. Whatever it was I did enjoy Murdered: Shoal Suspect. I enjoyed it a lot and (silly name aside) I found myself gripped in a supernatural thriller, which had some level of adventure gameness to it, the controls were solid, the graphics reasonable, and the story (while a little predictable in places) did keep me glued to the screen wanting to find out what happened next, the ability to contribute to that story through the aforementioned side quests, and investigation moments probably helped keep me in during the boring bits.I did find the combat a little clunky, but the moments are so few and far between that it never became more than a minor annoyance, and immersion was spoiled somewhat by the sheer denseness of the player character, watching him piece together the motives of the antagonist was less Sherlock Holmes, and more Scooby-Doo.However maybe you really get off on being smarter than the character... Maybe that is the real reason I like Murdered: Soul Singer. Whatever your motivation for thinking about getting this game, I advise you to.			"

												Just finished this game and I must say it worth its money. My rating: 9,5/10First of all, the Level Design is well layed out with a prety huge map to explore, not to mention that this game is based on exploration. There are many different paths you can take to reach a certain area, the indoor level design is gorgeous, many effects such as lens flares, particles/smoke, cool looking spectral city placed across the map with props all over it and the contrast between colors is tremendous. The more you explore, the more real information about the 1660 time you'll find and secondary cases you need to solve in order to obtain achivements and some creepy stories that are fun to hear or read. Secondly, speaking of textures now, the developers used a really wide range of textures, and the result? The boredom of seeing the same thing over and over again is excluded. Not only did they succeed in creating a sinister environment, but with the accompany of a Various library of sounds , they created a replica of a horror movie inwhich you choose the protagonist's moves. Thirdly, the animations, I must admit, could have been done a lot better. Such automatic, much less cool.Another aspect of the game I want to talk about is the combat system and the enemies. Besides the Killer Bell (the main enemy), are the demons. Yes, it appears that ghosts can be swallowed in by them...who would have thought? To kill one you need to follow this simple step: Go behind it and press the buttons that appears on your screen. Voila you just killed a badass looking demon. There are some demon's spawns on the floor which will make you cast a certain combination of keys the moment you step on it. If you fail, some demonic hands will drag you down (in hell maybe).Encountering a demon will only happen in a specific area full of teleportals. Although I used the Teleportals to travell across the map faster I also used them to hide from demons. They can't sense you in a teleportal.Possesing is a protagonist's ability to read people minds but you can't move with their bodies. Moreover, you can even posses a cat.Nevertheless the story is by far one of my favourites. I bought this game mainly for its level design and for the Dark, sinister and twisted story which caught my attention. You need to take decisions based on what you know so far, based on the recent findings and your logical interpretation.  I won't spoil the story don't worry, you really need to figure it out  yourself. The main character has a easily recognisable visual design and you must admit he's a badass looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the game's poster.All summed up, due to its story, level design including the textures,lighting,particles and lens flares, with a cold heart character I highly recommend this game.

The riddles are not difficult, there are even some stealthy scenarios involving demons etc. but the main focus here is the intense story in a very dark and mysterious little town with a heinous past.The game reminded me of some games of the Telltale-Series, only you can move around more freely and dynamically.If you love intense storytelling and stuff involving police work and serial killers, thats the one!

												I love the concept of this game (a ghost cop trying to solve his own murder by a serial killer), but unfortunately the game is clumsy and shallow. In the end, I couldn't wait for this one to be over.Pros:+ Good concept+ Good graphicsCons:- Clumsy controls- Shallow, one-dimensional characters and unrealistic dialogue- The game's attempt at stealth/combat seems like an afterthought. It is annoying, distracting, and doesn't add anything to the game.- The game's attempt at puzzles that require you to use deductive reasoning are not well done. The main character is so slow at putting things together, it's hard to understand what he considers interesting.- The game appears to be a sloppily done console port. Counter-intuitive key mapping, puzzles that appear to use controller vibration, etc.- Text is very hard to read (bad font choice)- Getting around from location to location is tedious.

												Ein detektiv Spiel, dessen Gameplay mechaniken so sehr auf das simpelste runtergebrochen ist, dass auch Blinder es fertig bringen könnte, das Spiel mit einer Hand durchzuspielen und mit anderen in seiner Hose zu landen. Wer also still-Life erwartet, wird vom Spiel enttäuscht sein.Das worin es gut ist, ist die Geschichte, die das Spiel erzählt. Eine spannende Detektiv, Geister Geschichte, die dazu noch Salam und Inqusitionen  in den Topf schmeißt. Und wenn es nicht genug sein sollte, so kann man viele Collectables sammeln, um spannende Horror Kurzgeschichte freizuschalten. Alle passend zu dem Gebiet, in dem sie freigeschaltet wurden.Und auch wenn das Gameplay rudimentär sein mag, so finde ich es immer noch befridigend, wenn man die Beweise zusammen gekramt hat, und es mit der Geschichte weitergeht.Fazit: Eine Schande, dass dieses Spiel als schlecht angesehen wird. Denn ich nehme viel lieber ein ""schlechtes"" Spiel im Spiele vom Murdered: Soul Suspect, mit seiner einzigartigen Geschichte, den spannenden Kurzgeschichten und einem Gameplay, dass nicht aus schießen, springen, schießen, repeat besteht, bevor ich es überhaupt wage, einen Blick auf den Rest der Square Enix, Sega. Capcom, Sony und co. Spiele-Bibliothek zu werfen, und euch zeige, wie schlechte Spiele wirklich aussehen.

												Worth a play if you can get it on sale. Soul Suspect is a detective adventure game. Calling it a horror game does a dis-service to actual horror games so I'll just say it has a dark atmosphere. The story is kinda mediocre, somewhat predictabe and relatively short (I finished it in 8 hours, while doing a pretty good amount of exploring). The controls are kinda sticky at times.  Some interacions should be based on proximity instead of the current system of it being based on where the camera is centered. There is very little character progression in regards to powers and the powers are a tad lame. 'Battles' in this game consist of sneaking up on enemies to trigger a QTE to defeat them. If you are spotted by them or fail the QTE, you're forced to run and hide until the enemy gives up at which point you can try again. There is only one enemy type in the entire game, save for the 'final boss.' The crime scene system (not sure what it's officially called) is interesting but will often penalize you for not being able to answer their vaguely asked question in the exact way they want you to. Not sure if this is a localization thing or someting else. Some of the clues are absurd to be called 'clues'  and I wa somestimes annoyed that I had to click on it to make the observation into a 'clue.' Also, as mentioned about the controls, because the camera has to be centered on the item for prompts to show up, I would often miss clues because a prompt didn't pop up -- this would just add unnecessary time as I'd be searching for that last clue and then realize that I hadn't properly centered the camera on the item for the prompt to come up.I got this during a recent sale for under $10 and I think that's a fair price for the game. It wasn't spectacular but was interesting enough to keep me occupied. Frankly, games like this should not be released at full console retail price when the quality of the product doesn't warrant so.			"

												Soul Suspect is a good, unique game with an interesting story.First thing I'll say is that if you dont like being confined within a level boundary or anything like that then you probably wont like this game. Yes you play a ghost and can walk through many walls, but you cant walk through all of them, obviously you have to be kept in the game somehow, and I accepted that and enjoyed it.The game is humerous, has some funny dialogue and is a slow paced mystery game as you attempt to solve your murder as well as several other peoples in the game.You can take control of people in the investigation, gain information from them, then use all the clues you found to build a picture of what happened.You will investigate several crime scenes throughout the game, some are to do with the main story, and several are just extra investigations there for fun.There are plenty of collectables in the game to help form a backstory, you dont have to collect them but they are good as they give you a history on the main character and the town you are in. The town being Salem and is heavily centred around the Salem Witch Trials.There are several areas in the game in which you will do your main investivations, when completed you can always revisit them to look for things you didnt find before.There are nice details throughout the game like random ghosts that are just there in the background and vanish as you get close to them, other ghosts that you can help to move on, and even ghostly buildings, such as original structures that no longer exist in the real world but you cannot pass through them as they are real to you.If you want to play something a bit different, with a unique story, humour and lots of collectables for you to find then give Murdered: Soul Suspect a go.I may not play this game again as the fun is in the mystery and trying to work out what has happened, but its still good to play a first time.7/10Oh yeah, ignore the Metacritic score. They don't know what they are talking about.			"

												Remember The Darkness? This game plays a little bit like that, with the 'other world on top of this world' vibe... Except that Ronan is a WAY more likable and funny guy than Jackie, who - if Im going to be generous - had the personality of a piece of sopping wet cardboard. (Yes I've read the comics. I stand by my statement.)Gameplay can get a little clunky, but you arent asked to do action sequences more than a few times, so mostly it's just atmosphere. Said atmosphere can, at times, get a little repetative, but it did manage to maintain a pacing of steadily getting creepier and creepier. The tense string instruments make you want to turn around and slap the musicians for scaring you like a little girl. Play at night with the lights off for maximum effect, obviously.Power through the story if you get tired of the levels; they dont take long. The story itself had a few 'whodunit' twists and a few others you can see a mile out, but still. It's not terrible, and history nerds get a nice stroll through Salem that doesnt overwhelm people who dont give a rat's behind about what happened in 1800-and-who-cares.Conclusion: A nice timekiller that wont take up more than a day of dedicated play or a few days of off and on. WARNING: The menu in here IS glitchy as all heck, so stay out of it as often as you can.			"

												It's a wonderful exploration and collection type game with a spooky (but not scarey) vibe to it, with detailed environments and lots of goodies to hunt down.There's only two issues that make it only worth buying when it's on sale and not at full price.The first is that it's fairly short.The second is the performance problems.  The frame rate is all over the place, so it feels like it's always stuttering.   This is one game where it might have been better if they limited the frame rate and tuned the game to that frame rate.   Only the demon hunts require any sort of timing and hand eye co-ordination, but you don't need 60 frames per second for that.There is a final thing that comes up and it depends a lot on what kind of gamer you are.   The game's mini-games aren't very challenging, and the solutions don't always make sense.  On the upside, aside from score keeping, the game doesn't really punish you for a wrong move.   If you screw up a demon hunt, you just respawn -- the demons you already took out don't respawn.   When you make a wrong choice in your investigation, you just lose a badge point (these aren't even important except for score keeping).   Even with no badge points left, you can keep picking until you get it right and continue the game.   There's very little frustration to this game.Worth buying, but don't pay more than $20 for it.

												This game had potential of becoming a good detective game but it felt squandered.Ultimately the game could've of been more fleshed out while the mechanics work well they ended being used to simply. Where instead it should've been asking the user harder questions depending on the investigation instead of asking simple question such as what happened here. It also felt short and unfinished with a lot of ghosts starting to explain there problems which could allow them to move on but then telling the user not bother. I also think there should've been more then one murder case to look through then just your own and the bell serial killer murders.The story was kind of predictable to the point you can guess the red hearing as soon as he/she shows up. The ending had a twist you don't see cause the character basically showing only twice and in one scene didn't even interact with the player. The two leads had really poor chemistry that they both just came off as whinging most the time during there dialogue.The combat and stealth was poorly executed and unnecessary to the point where it shouldn't off existed in the first place making this game a pure detective game. Guiding joy around ultimately ended up being find the thing to poltergeist to allow joy to move on to the next point.Overall this game had potential of being a good detective game but was squandered with unnecessary combat, simply investigations, short game and uninteresting characters.

												The type of game that makes me wish for a recommendation of ""Only on sale""One of the few games out there that lets you play as a ghost doing actual ghost like things, the game is marred by several issues that really prevent it from working enough for me to give it a pass at normal prices.It's a puzzle game first and foremost that felt it had to add in some action in the form of stealth segments where you must avoid getting caught by demons, which usually boils down to accidentally getting spotted and having to waste time teleporting around safe spots waiting for them to resume patrolling so you can try again at doing a QTE to get them out of an area so you can go back to exploring.And then there's the puzzles, that boil down to trying to find every object in a given area and putting 2 or 3 of them together to solve a small mystery, sometimes operating off of logic and other times suffering from the Phoenix Wright problem where you're ahead of the game's characters but are forced to answer extremely handholding questions in order to advance (such as ""there was a murder"" as one of an early mystery's ""most relevant"" clues when you are asked to investigate a murder).However, that's not what really hurts this game. Instead, it's the simple lack of content. There isn't enough dialogue recorded for a game that features a mind-reading mechanic. There are very few side quests and after you complete them all the hub world you are forced to travel through seems very boring. Collectables are decent but don't seem to ever really be enough considering the amount of ground you cover between them. The main plot ends way too early for something that came out above $20. And those demons mentioned above? They are thrown in purely to prevent you from breezing through levels in 10 minutes.As you'll probably get through most of the content you care about in the first run, the game really lacks a lot of replay value, so your first run through is going to be about as long as you spend with the game. I went through with the ""I'm going to try to collect as much as I can, but more than an hour without any result and I'm moving on"" mentality, and I clocked about 8 hours (which includes a bit of idling time spent away from the computer).It's kind of sad, because the game isn't devoid of value, just not enough to justify purchasing it normally.Its writing, especially concerning some of the ghost stories you come across, is engaging, even if it's not the best you'll ever experience. Meanwhile, it completely nails the ""I'm playing as a ghost detective"" thing it was going for, even going so far as to have the first thing you do be trying to get back into your still barely alive body by trying to slip into it. If you liked Ghost Trick or Geist and wanted more games like that, this scratches that itch nicely.This game is worth playing for those who have a weakness for a somewhat noir detective game or one where you play as a ghost, but because you'll probably only need to play it once, get it on sale.

												Well what can i say about this game hmm.Well first off it wasent very good. the reason for this is that it just does not involve the player enough, there are basicly no choices in this game. the story isent half bad but with it being so simple it just dosent draw the player in. i got bored after the first hour or so of the game due to this reason,The only reason i went through it was because i had bought it and figured i might as well finish it. so it wouldent feel like a totall waste of cash.Basicly you go from point to point, find the clues in each location (wich is extremly easy to find) and you get a abit of the story then you move to next location rinse and repeat, and thats it. There are a collectables you can pick to get a few side stories thats not linked to the main story, They are basicly there to help add the darker feel to the game.on the Plus side+ Good voice acting+ Decent Graphics+ Good atmosphereOn the Minus Side- No Choices that effects gameplay at all- To strightforward- Main Story is to short.- Boring Main Character ( too cliché)- Side stories also very shortAll in all it was a dissapointing game.  feelt like i was playing a bad version of The Walking Dead - The Wolf Among Us - Now if you like this type of game i would recommend picking up a copy ofThe Walking Dead Season 1-2 and Wolf Among Us. Same stuff but with actuall choices that effects the story and really really good story.			"

												Throughout my playthrough of Murdered: Soul Suspect, I could never truly figure out if this was just a game that took the modern game developer's philosophy of all-inclusiveness to an extreme or if they honestly just think gamers are all dumb as posts. That's the biggest problem with this game. I'm generally a fan of story-based games and can appreciate when they make games decently easy to complete so that you can follow the story at a good pace. Even for me, Murdered: Soul Suspect was so ridiculously easy that I just couldn't bring myself to care.You follow the story of Ronan, a cop working on a serial killer case in the city of Salem. As the game starts, Ronan meets his grisly end but comes back as a ghost. He quickly finds out that in order to move on to the afterlife with his beloved, he must solve the case of the Bell Killer and thus, his own murder. It's not an uninteresting premise but curiousity quickly becomes tedium as you work to make Ronan catch up with what you probably figured out just from reading those three sentences. Supernatural occurances in Salem equals witchcraft. In fact, reaching this level of obviousness and not overthinking things is probably the most difficult part of the game.While the game occasionally gives you action sequences involving sneaking around demons a la Metal Gear Solid, the primary bulk of the gameplay is exploring and using detective work to piece together the mystery of the Bell Killer. The kinds of puzzles you have to solve are similar to this: a body lies in front of you with a gunshot through the head. What weapon killed him: a gun, a knife or a rope? See what I mean about overthinking things? This isn't a trick question and the game is full of stupidity like this. One frequent puzzle that is honestly in the game is where you have to influence people to think about a certain topic so you can read their thoughts. You have to pick from a variety of subjects to get them to think about the Bell Killer. To do this, you pick the thought that is directly talking about the Bell Killer. There is no extra thought to this and the puzzle repeats FREQUENTLY throughout the game.The other gameplay elements aren't much better. The stealth sequences are absurdly easy and simply require you to move behind the demons who follow the exact same path without variation in rooms where there are, at most, four of them. There is also a collect-a-thon throughout the game where you pick up elements of backstory about a variety of topics like Ronan's life, Salem's history and other topics. There are over 200 of these collectables scattered throughout the relatively small game world and while it's fun to find these at first, it quickly becomes boring like the rest of the game due to very little reward for collecting them all.Due to the ease of completing the game and the stupidity of pretty much every character, the storyline is hardly fulfilling either. Some may enjoy making their way to the conclusion but you will likely guess what's going on after only a few hours of play time. Still, despite the bad gameplay, the controls felt great to me, using a 360 gamepad, and the camera worked surprisingly well, considering how much time is spent walking through walls. The sound is also decent with voiceovers ranging from passable to pretty decent. If you are looking for a mindless game to play through in a day or two, Murdered: Soul Suspect may be what you're looking for but if you're looking for something with even the slightest hint of meat to it, pass on this one. It will only disappoint.			"

												I would like to write a good review for this game. But i've tried now for half a year trying to find a solution to all the errors this game keeps giving on startups.First day I got the game, it wouldnt launch. It simply exited out and pretended like nothing.Tried finding fixes online and on forums, no help there. I then gave up on the game, and just gave it time.Then now a couple days ago, I wanted to give it a shot again. Nope, different error this time. Cannot connect to steam client error 2. Mkey.Nothing helpful on the web, or on the forums for this either.For all the issues this game has, it will receive a negative review from me.			"

												Every developer that thinks it's a great idea to have unskippable scenes lasting several minutes need to lose their job.  I especially shouldn't have to watch a long cinematic that I don't care at all about, and contained nothing vital,  before I'm allowed to actually play the game I'm trying to play.  I bought the game so I could play it, not watch a movie with a paper thin plot and horrible acting.Other than that, it's an alright game as along as you accept that no matter what choices you make you will always end up in the same place.  Most of the time the game is trying to distract you from how ridiculously linear it is.			"

												A story-rich experience, with a high dramatic intensity. Those are all the words needed to describe this game, and all that you might want from it. Being an average-budget, not AAA-wannabe game, I wasn't expecting too much, and I got exactly that. You can see from the setting, the story and the mechanics that this game' size isn't so big, neither it pretends to be. But you can also understand from the very beginning that the developers did the best with everything they had, even on the technical side (yes, even if it is locked at 30 FPS and may look like a console-to-pc porting, when maxed it looks very good). The soundtrack is good, the ambient sounds are good, even the lighting is pretty damn good and they all do their part in creating a creepy enough atmosphere in which the player has to wisely move. Buy this game for a few bucks and spend some good late afternoons with it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												This game surprised me. I picked it up while it was on sale but didn't play it for a long time, skeptical of the concept and unwilling to believe the ""very positive"" reviews, especially considering the game has poorer reviews outside of Steam. It was a bit short for $30, though that's relatively reasonable considering how much traditional games cost these days.The game surprised me, anyway. I found it pretty darn spooky, and the mechanics were all unique enough that it didn't just feel like typical action game. Expect it to be campy, don't expect it to be terribly long, and you should have a lot of fun (and maybe wet yourself once or twice).			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of the games I missed out on when it was released, in fact, I hadn't even heard about it until I got it in a bundle pack on sale.  Turns out, I loved this game.It takes place in a pretty nice noir setting.  The graphics are alright, but nothing amazing and certainly not groundbreaking for 2014.  The game suffers from a few issues, one of which being the copy-pasted NPC models and voice-acting, and another being the choices you make have virtually no effect on the outcome of the story.  The game features little to no replay value, due to its linearity as well.That said, the story of the game was very well done, and the events that take place are really well thought out and the gameplay mechanics are very well done, so the game is still worth it, I think.  The main character, Ronan, isn't exactly a very complex character, but his inner demons and his relationship with his wife Joy, really give him some depth.  There is pretty great character development in this story, and the whole thing has a very distinct movie-like feel to it.    The evidence finding and general detective mechanics are pretty fun and the atmosphere they managed to create with the ghosts and seeing Salems past through the eyes of Ronan makes for some really cool effects and storytelling.One of the highlights of the game is the phenomenal voice acting and character lip-syncing to the voices, which often goes pretty underrated.  However a downside of the title is that there is a 30 FPS lock on the game, but I honestly wasn't able to notice, very similar to the way L.A. Noire has a 30 FPS lock as well.I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys paranormal/ghost stories as well as noir/detective games with dark-ish atmospheres.  It is certainly worth the time.			"

												A well done murder / detective game, Murdered: Soul Suspect was an enjoyable game overall and is worth getting (on a sale) if you’re into this genre. The plot is straightforward. You play as Ronan, a criminal turned detective who is shot and killed by a mysterious man. Your quest is to figure out the truth behind your murder and why it happened. Gameplay is mostly good. First off, you play as the ghost of yourself. Therefore, you can walk through most walls and objects which is fun to do. This is carried through the story where characters that are alive cannot see or hear you. You won’t be shooting anyone or have any big action moments. This is story driven first with some puzzles, clue finding scenes and a few small “stealth” parts thrown in. The puzzles incorporate clues you just found or found in the past. You use them to answer questions the game asks you. “What would help Mary remember?” or “What is Joy doing?” for example. The answers are sometimes illogical but you can just guess again.Clue finding scenes are exactly what it sounds like. Find all the clues in a particular area in order to figure out what went on.Stealth sections are the weak point of the game. Luckily, there’s not many of them and it’s not too hard. There are demons that can float around certain areas or inside buildings. To kill them, you need to go up behind them and execute them with a quick time event. However, the controls for this were not predictable and I died several times because the controls wouldn’t respond how I anticipated. The environment, graphics and sound are all very good. There’s definitely a creepy atmosphere that surrounds the entire city. Although, I found that a lot of the characters looked the same and would mistake certain characters for others. I thought the voice acting was fantastic. A definite strong point here.Run the game in 60FPS+Turn off VSYNC in the game options+Enable/force VSYNC in the Nvidia Control Panel Note:Cinematics will still be 30FPS as they are pre-renderedOne of the biggest complaints I have with the game is the lack of a map. It became frustrating to try and navigate around Salem and forget how to get to certain areas you want to re-visit. The game gives you a navigation marker for your current objective, but that’s it. Throughout my playthrough I was never really familiar with the city. For a game with lots of collectibles, it would have been a great addition. I initially tried playing with a keyboard and mouse. It seemed to work fine but when entering the in-game diary, it wouldn’t register me trying to move around. I eventually just used an Xbox 360 controller and everything worked perfect.Pros+60FPS (see note above)+Good story+Great voice acting+Well done animations+Creepy environmentCons+No map+Stealth combat sections+No save feature, only checkpoints+Puzzles are too easy+Steam overlay doesn’t work+Keyboard/mouse controls brokenEven with a few faults, I thought Soul Suspect was a good game and enjoyed playing it. It’s a little short, with maybe 8-10 hours to complete. Even less if you don’t collect the various collectibles. So at the current price of $30, it’s a little steep. Grab this on sale.7/10 Good			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect, is very underated as a game. I put off playing this game for quite some time due to the negative publicity. My loss, because this is well above average in many regards.The negatives are its total lack of replayability and pointless combat system. But forget about all that and don't even bother with the collectibles, the majotity of them are pointless and offer nothing in relation to world or charcter building. The npcs found everywhere are likewise pointless, dont waste your time with them.However the reason I love this game is the story, the main story is gripping and the main characters are likewise compelling. This is not an fps or an rpg, its a very good interactive story. If like me you appreciate a well told story in a great setting and don't mind it being linear with no sidequests and the rest of the fluff then this is a winner. If you spacebar through conversations and skip cutscenes then avoid this like the plague.Love Arch			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect takes a fascinating part of American history and pairs it with a supernatural detective story.  The environment and plot is very creative and unique and kept me interested until the end.  The game is fairly short and doesn't overstay its welcome, yet still provides a lot of character and plot development as well as a few twists.  That being said, there are two minor downfalls to this game.  The first is the overuse of collectibles.  While the collectibles are easy enough to find and doesn't require too much 'post game time' to sit down and sniff them out, there are still a ton of them.  Over 170 in fact.  Each collectible gives some sort of backstory to the world or relevent major characters, but the sheer number of them will have you running to pick them up first before doing the actual story missions.  I feel this can really take the player out of the setting and mood Murdered: Soul Suspect tried to create, with its old, colonial, haunted theme.  If you are the type of player to skip right over collectibles and not be bothered, then this isn't a problem for you.  But if you are OCD, have to get them all, hear every backstory, learn every secret, then this will probably get on your nerves a bit.The other issue to this game is that some of the puzzles are unclear as to how you should go about solving them.  While this has only happened to me about maybe 15% of the puzzles in the game, it is still frustrating to look up the answer and say to yourself 'How does that make sense?'.  The game does give hints if you get the puzzle wrong, but sometimes the hints aren't that clear.  With some trial and error, you should be ok though.Overall, I enjoyed this game.  I picked it up when it was $4 and would have gladly paid $20 for it.  The setting and plot were really unique and I liked all of the ghost mechanics that were added into the game.  It is definitely a game to play when you are looking to get a good story with some amusing puzzles.  I rate this game a 9/10.			"

												The only reason this game remains interesting is that there aren't that many detective titles around. However, beyond novelty it has little to offer. The investigation mechanics have potential but are way to limited to be engaging. There is little thinking required. It usually comes down to clicking on all clickable things in the area and than choosing the relevant information. It is a straightforward process, as long as you don't overthing things. Your character (and everyone else for that matter) and quite dumb and you will often connect dots way quicker than game wants you to. The final reveal surprises only because of how silly it is.Also the is something of a stealth combat mechanics, probably due to devs or producers not being confident in their product. It sucks but doesn't take too much time.			"

												The game is about a cop who dies but cannot moves on until figures out who his murderer is. While ghost aspect surely adds a twist to the game, this is basically an adventure game with a lot of walking and listening. There is also some sort of a fighting sequence but it loses it's charm after a while and you start wishing it never existed in the first place. Story, voice acting and characters are quite cool, also the game is arguably bug-free. However, the game is short (I usually hang around a lot in games but even I finished it in 9 hours).Conclusion:FACTS:~ The game has a lot of talking and solving puzzles in it. If you want pew pew bang bang kinda game this isn't for you~ Relatively shortPROS:+ Great voice acting+ Great story+ Great atmosphere and characters+ You can actually use ghost powers (possesion, passing through solid objects etc)+ Nicely placed collectables (so they actually makes sense)+ Not a lot of bugsCONS:- The fights get boring fast and you feel like they're a burden- Investigations are kinda easy			"

												This is one of those games which gets murdered by so called highly educated gaming reviewers but they are stuck in AAA world. Now the game is not perfect, especially with nvidia surround which requires to install flawless widescreen but once that is taking care of, you are on for a very interesting and different game. It is not an action game but a more relax investigation game. You do have to fight some demons but honestly, I could have done without it as it does not bring anything. So, gameplay wise, very basic, a bit cluncky (probably related to the nvidia surround), but all the investigations, the historical aspect of salem, all the legends, this game has a lot to offer if you can appreciate the style. I would highly recommend it and also take the time to do all the investigations, this is where a lot of the gametime is. One thing, the first investigation is a bit slow but please, go past it and you will see why people enjoyed it.			"

												A brilliant tale of modern murder with a foothold in the Salem witch trials. As someone who loves typical ""Who did it!?"" type games, I found it great that it didn't hold your hand all the way through. The voice acting was top quality and believable, the humanization of the characters through actions and interactions were very smooth. My only qualm with the game is that when Ronan has to make his way hastily somewhere you'd expect for him to jog/run/sprint out of the cutscene, instead he just takes a leisurely swagger while puffing on his cigarette. It doesn't give you that sense of urgency that the storyline is trying to portray. I'm glad I didn't buy it at full price (50% off) because it was quite a short story/game, but for the $15 I did pay it was worth it.			"

												To be honest this is one of the best 6hrs and a 30mins of playing this game, controls are easy to use, good story line with plenty of wtf/omg's moments. the game not only looks good but it also lives up to its name, basic story, your a cop who has been tracking a murder which you then save a teenage girls life as you die without knowing, after the fall to the ground you then relise that your soul is out of your body as the ""Bell killer"" shows up only to see that you have no control or effect which your forced to see your own death outside your corp, now its up to you and a teenage girl to investigate the crime scenes and leds to find out clues to track down the ""Bell killer"" and help other ghost to reclam their memories as you sneak through countless of demos with the chance of kill or be killed.............9/10    hope this game will get a another one coming out : /         conclustion: if you want to play a game which will get you thinking to solve crimes of a killer dubed as ""Bell Killer"" and stop this madness of an angry spirit as you sneak through countless of demo's to the truth   -must play :3			"

												A really good RPG game that does not include microtransactions *woot*Story was great nothing more to say about that. Possibly the closest you can get to a 3D mystery clue solving game Graphics: Good.Combat ""demons"" was bit dull but its not suppose to be a FPS/3PS game so it was alright :) .Collectibles/Achievements was bit painful after i had to restart the whole game but i did get them,I rate this Game 6.5/10BUG NOTE! achievement system on steam does not register that you re-started the game so it keeps counting on the last number/save  "

												Very good cinematic and story. I enjoyed this game a lot. It was very immersive.But, as a minus, if you played it once you don't feel the need to replay it. The entire mistery is gone and it's not fun anymore.I recommend this game if you catch it at an offer under 10 EUR. It's worth playing it once.			"

												The game is a big hit or miss to some people. The storyline was really good, it always kept me on my feet and wanting me to finish it! The big problem with the game though was the length of it, but that's without finding all of the secret stories. However you can find about 50% of the secrets just by playing the story. I would only reccommend this game to certain people that I know that are fans of this game genre.			"

The story line is great keeps you going back for more it is a fun game and you have to make sure to search for everything. Could of been a little bit of a longer game but all in all for $7.95 i got a great deal it is worth the money it is a 4.5 out of 5 stars game to me,So if you dont have it get it you wont be dissapointed.

												And another game with a great Idea, and questionable realization. The Story is great, the Atmosphere aswell, even the controls are good. But then, after a few minutes of gameplay you  meet ur first enemy. And you just realize that someone isn't getting enough money from square enix. Seriously, 1 totally unnecessary type of Enemy. A Demon, which basically does nothing but sitting around at an area, waiting to get killed by some random cop ghost. Seriously, if you don't want enemys to be challenging, interesting or able to influence the gameplay in any sort. Just don't implement them. They are not doing the game any favor.And Of course the game feels like a playable movie (I guess it should feel like it). So don't expect innovative Level Design.			"

												a few hrs into this and its quite good 7.5/10 the reason for the score is two things, 1. the npc's walking about dont have much when it comes to commentary and they are all copied and pasted so you see them everywhere one woman was sitting on a bench i possessed her, listened to her story de-possessed her, moved on to a woman who looks exatcly like her walking by the bench and yeah it was her and the EXACT script i got from the bench so theyre cloning the NPC'S without even trying to hide it.2. trying to press E or R on an item close to something else is a little finnicky and frustrating sometimes.so yeah felt a little cheated with the attack of the clones everywhere but all in all i like the investigation aspects as well as the story driving it so i think my score it humble enough to give credit where its due,all in all THUMBS UP!!

												I would label this as a must buy on sale game. The game itself is a rather interesting take on a detective game, where you are a murdered cop trying to solve his own murder at the hands of a serial killer, so that he can move on to the afterlife and be with his wife. Gameplay mainly consists of investigating crimescenes for clues, and then drawing conclusions based on what you find. There are also ghost abilities, like being able to possess people to read their thoughts, or make electronics turn on. There is also a minor element of combat, as there are demons that will attempt to consume you unless you sneak up on them and destroy them first.The story is engaging, the voice acting is solid, and the movement and game mechanics are well designed and fluid. The ending is solid and satisfying as well. Why only just on sale? It's a relatively quick play through, with no replay value. Once you have made it to the end, the story is complete and there is no reason to revisit it.			"

												I got this pretty cheap and I still couldn't really get myself to complete it. The incentive to persue the main objective just wasn't there, on top of that the game is repetitive, clunky and lacks entertaining gameplay. It's a psuedo-detective game, though it holds your hand and never lets you ""fail"", which essentially means if you get an answer wrong you just try again, and again, and again until you are correct. I got a bit excited when the enemies were introduced to the game, the so-called ""demons"", but they are very easy to kill and the excitement quickly turned into annoyance, as the game would often toss a ""kill the demons"" sections at you, which aren't scary or hard, but just annoying (like filler to extend the game if you will).I stopped playing the game after the ""asylum"" part because it got boring. I'm just glad I didn't buy this at full price.			"

												The tag of ""horror"" is wrong, I'd describe it as atmospheric. A real fun detective game where you find out who killed you and why.+graphics are real pretty+voice acting isn't terrible+story is really the focus and it's a great story imo+not a difficult game, just gotta find clues at the crime scenes to figure out what happened at each location+collectables! The collectables tell more about your character and about Salem and other things, which is really cool.-demons are really ♥♥♥♥ing tedious. fighting them is -somewhat- fun at first but it gets old. (I guess) they could scare some people too but I don't think they're that scary.-mind reading could have been better.			"

												I was a bit skeptical about this game after the reviews I saw but after 5 hours of playing it is a solid game. There is barely any action, it's more of a L.A Noire without the gun fights or similar to a sherlock holmes game. The story really sucked me in though, the basic premise is a mysterious killer has murdered you and now you have to find a way to solve the case. I love detective games like this where you have to find clues and piece together the story.The gameplay is good, theres nothing to really say, its fairly basic. The game does have some puzzle solving but its mostly about the story and solving this case. There are other smaller cases in the game that you can solve along the way optionally.I have run into a few bugs here and there where I've had to reload my last checkpoint because something didn't load in properly or the game was stuck. It has only happened twice in my 5 hours of play so they are few and far inbetween.Bottom line, if your a fan of mystery and puzzle solving, you'll love this game. Do not expect an action, think sherlock holmes.  But there is a very good story that will suck you in.			"

												Albeit a rather short game (I completed it in a mere six-seven hours) I enjoyed this game. Is it flawless? By no means. The enemies are very easy to defeat once you get the hang of avoiding detection, and the final boss is a bit of a let-down. In spite of this, the idea of a detective solving his own murder while trying to deduce the identity of the Bell Killer is very interesting. I enjoyed doing the detective work and finding the connection between the various clues, and interacting with Bell Killer victims as well as other ghosts I encountered during the gameplay. Discovering clues to other unrelated murders was also very enjoyable and added a bit to my gametime just for searching for these clues. The connection to the Salem Witch Trials (a mark in history I always found fascinating) was also right up my alley.All in all, I give this game a slightly-above-average score of 7/10, and recommend it for gamers who don't mind an interesting, although short, game.

												Following in the footsteps of Quantic Dream, the developer of Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain, and Beyond Two Souls, Airtight Games have developed a AAA Adventure title - a genre that usually doesn't mix with the sheeple of the current generation. Unlike high octane experiences with tons of explosions and buildings collapsing, adventure games have one goal: to tell a story.And boy, does Murdered: Soul Suspect tell a story. You play as Ronan, a wise-cracking police detective hot on the tail of Salem, Massachusetts' latest serial murderer: the Bell Killer. Just as you're about to apprehend the suspect on the top floor of a dilapidated apartment building the tables are turned and Ronan and his ""I'm a toolbag"" fedora fly out of the window, falling to the ground and becoming the newest victim of both fashion and the Bell Killer. But instead of carting off to the afterlife, Ronan's soul remains tethered to this world by his unresolved business with the Bell Killer. Now, Ronan must use his new ghostly abilities to solve his own murder.The game immediately starts by holding your hand. Telling you exactly which buttons to press and which linear corridor to travel down. Fortunately, it doesn't stay that way for long. The game quickly opens up into an open world exploration game, and you can hunt down clues all across Salem pertaining to your own death, the other victims of the Bell Killer, the Killer himself, and your family members you left behind. As a detective, you must piece together the clues at your own scene of murder and any future murder scenes to discover who the Bell Killer truly is. Sadly, the clues are very easy to discover. Glowing with a supernatural light from across the street, it's never particularly challenging to figure out exactly what happened, and the Phoenix Wright style of click on X-clue to solve Y-mystery is overused, cliche, and simple-minded. You're never actually punished for getting it wrong, nor does the game continue on assuming you're right until you find yourself alone with the wrong person like in Kara no Shoujo. The game just lets you click randomly until the mystery is solved. While I understand that this is one of the only AAA detective titles and Square-Enix took a massive risk in publishing a game that would be almost universally hated by the current braindead population, it still feels a bit too casual for my tastes.It turns out much of Salem's deceased population are also tied to this world, and they make up much of the side-quests. Discover what ties them to this world so they can move on. But not everyone can be saved. You can speak with every ghost, and possess every living human and read their thoughts - a novel idea in theory - but the dense population of both living and dead combined with the watered down sayings makes the world feel bland, as you randomly go through all the recycled phrases in hopes of some refreshing monologue in their head.Thankfully, the open world is anything but bland. The rustic yet modernized city alone is fantastic to walk through, but as a ghost you can see ghostly imprints of past structures. The burning remains of buildings long since erased from the timeline, wrecked cars and ghostly pileups, horse carts overturned, ghostly trains doomed to repeat their final travels, civil war era field hospitals and mass graves from immigrants with the bubonic plague, even puritan era torture devices used in the witch hunts that Salem is so popular for. The developers did their research before making this world, and it feels fantastic and believable.The open world aspect plays out a lot like a Metroid or Castlevania game, or most recently the Batman Arkham games. A wide variety of open world yet enclosed cells linked together. Unlock new ghostly powers and travel back to old places to uncover new clues and sidequests. Walk through walls, teleport across gaps, or possess people and animals to reach inaccessable areas. There are even obligatory stealth sections, where souls, trapped on this plane of existence, never moving on due to their unfinished business, have transformed into soul eating husks of their former selves, and you must sneak past them with the aid of your casual gamer wallhacks allowing you to see the enemy through walls so you can plan your stealth route. Once again, it never dips into ""difficult"" territory, and the closest thing you get to action is a couple of quick time events. I suppose they implemented this mechanic to try to entice some CODers into trying a new genre, but it ends up feeling tacked on. There are few stealth instances in the game, thankfully, but it's so poorly implemented it ends up hindering the experience.Now to talk about the elephant in the room. As anyone should expect from innovative ideas and a new intellectual property, especially in such a niche genre, this game was almost universally panned by critics. I don't often take the time to formally recommend games, unless I feel like injustice was served and the game isn't getting the recognization it deserves. While this game is as casual and simple as a detective game could possibly be, it's got other things going for it. The ending is fanastic, and the shocking revelation that every detective story needs comes unexpected and fast. It's worth playing to the end to see how nicely all the themes get wrapped up. And like I said, the game world is awe-inspiring both in scope and in detail. There may not be shooting mechanics, and the title isn't proceeded by 10: Modern Warfare Reloaded, so naturally the braindead pus spewing mass that is IGN won't like it, and neither will the Michael Bay fanboys that so devotedly follow it because they can't have an intelligent thought of their own volition. But this game provides a lot of ingenuity and new, refreshing ideas, proving that regardless of execution, Airtight games has what it takes to reach new heights in the future. Square Enix sees it. And I see it. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												This is an interesting murder mystery adventure game.  While it has some ""action"" components, it's closer to being a point and click adventure game.  Playing as the ghost of a detective, you have to search through various areas of town for clues about your killer.  I liked the depth of the story and it had enough twists to keep you on your toes.With that being said, I do have a couple of gripes about the game.  Firstly, the enemies.  The ""demons"" (which I would have personally called wraiths given how they're designed, but whatever) feel like they were tacked into the game as an afterthought by some exec in a suit that decided the game needed some action to make it fun.  This in fact does not equal fun.  I literally groaned and rolled my eyes every time I heard the sound of them being zoned into an area.  They're not hard to kill or anything, you just use some stealth type gameplay to sneak up behind them and do what amounts to a 1 step quicktime event to kill them off.  Even when you fail, they still won't necessarily kill you since you can run and hide until they go back on their short patrol route.  I never died from them at any point.  Once you kill all of them off in that particular area, they never respawn (thankfully).  I found their presence interrupted the flow of the game and was just a major annoyance.  I feel like the game would have flowed a whole lot better if they'd removed them completely and just left it as a straight mystery game.My second problem, the clue system.  This one is a bit bigger since it's the main focus of the game.  Searching for clues works sketchy at times.  If you get too close to one of the clues or have it not quite lined up on your view, you won't get prompted to press they button to get it.  This happened a whole lot more than I would have liked.  Given how the majority of the clues don't glow or give any indication that it's what you need to be looking at, it can lead to a lot of frustrated wandinger back and forth in the same area trying to figure out what you missed.  Also, once you have your clues gathered, you often have to patch 2-3 of those clues together into an ""answer"" for the current question you're trying to answer.  While the majority of them make sense, there were a few I ended up spamming through all of the clues to try to get the correct combination.Play time for me was around 8 hours total.  This included me collecting 90-95% of all collectibles, reading every clue that I got, watching the ghost stories for the 100% collections I had, and listening to nearly all of the spoken text each random person has to say when you possess them.  If I'd wanted to reach 100% collectibles without a walkthrough, I could have probably added on a few more hours for wandering back and forth for an eternity trying to find the ones I missed.Overall, this is a decent adventure game that's worth a look.To sum the rest of this up:+ Stylish looks+ Good voice acting and sounds+ Solid story that makes you want to keep playing- Clue system is iffy at times- Combat/enemies are annoying and probably shouldn't have been put in at all			"

												I got the game on sale and I think it was okay, but the full price is ridiculous. I like the game but it's not worth the full price and you should go through more reviews or gameplays even if it's on some 50 % off.I'd say most of the game is okay. And that's exactly the word. It's not great but it's not bad either. The general feeling when you finish the game will probably be something like... yeah, I had fun but it could (and should) have been much more fun.The story is fine but not breathtaking. It uses a lot of clichés but what really makes it dull is that there are too few characters. It's a detective story and you have like two possible suspects, not much mystery there. The detective part is... ehm. You collect clues and then you are supposed to draw some conclusion. Unfortunatelly, all you need to do is to click on the most obvious stuff you can and it's usualy the right answer. Sometimes, you even ""discover"" something you (as a player) must have thought before you started investigating because it's so flippin obvious.The stealth and fights with demons are really easy once you get a hang of it. Not much to say about it, the stealth parts could have been great but they ended up just dull. The demons are really creepy though, they look a bit as if they were dancing... but they wanna eat you... creepy.There are many collectibles. Some of them add to the story, which is great. Each area of the game has a ghost story which plays only if you find all related collectibles. These are great. Unfortunatelly, many collectibles just give you an achievement and that's is annoying. I also ended up with one or two collectibles missing in some catogories which brings me to...The saving system. It works fine, there are autosaves and even if you die, you dont lose much progress. But there is no way to make a hard save and once you reach a certain point in the game, you cannot enter most areas. So if you dont have all collectibles by the endgame, you will not get them unless you play again. And even then you'd have to go through almost the whole game because areas of the game open as you progress in the story. The few puzzles you encounter are really easy. You have some great mechanics (possessing people and cats, messing with electronics to make people move and get you through areas you cannot cross) but the creators really didnt use all the potential. I know puzzles weren't the point of the game but they could have add a lot of fun to the gameplay.I generally enjoyed the game, it's has a lot of genuine creepiness in it and it's mostly fun. But it gets repetitive even of it's a rather short game (I think I have like 12 hours with almost all collectibles, I think people do it faster) and you will be left with the feeling you expected more from it.

												This is a rather enjoyable game. You are a ghost investigating your own death by wandering round looking at clues, possessing people and connecting clues together. The investigations are quite easy and the story is excellent, it progresses nicely usually allowing you to work out the next twist just before the characters do so you feel clever. Additionally there are side missions and extra collectibles that unlock bonus ghost stories that are also rather good. There is however one problem, for some reason they have crowbarred in some combat for no obvious reason. Periodically some daemons turn up which you have to sneak up behind and kill with a quick time event. They are just an annoyance before you can get on with the fun searching around parts of the game.			"

												This game was cool. It opens with your own murder with your life flashing before your eyes. Your main goal; find your murderer and bring him to justice, as a spooky ghost! About 6 hours of detective suspense gameplay. A few items, when collected, give bonus stories of other murder mysteries. Very story driven and I like it that way. Get it on discount though, as it may have some problems some people won't like.			"

												Pretty good game! It's great for players who like to collect and explore, find♥♥♥♥♥♥ and really liked playing games in the early 2000's. I wouldn't be happy if I paid full price for this, since though it's entertaining, it's not the most well-made or creative game, but I guess that's why the good lord invented the Steam sale.			"

												I'm afraid I can't quite recomend this game, at least not untill it costs more than 20 pounds. Whilst graphics and sounds are good the gameplay is short and not entirely engaging. It's an interesting however linear story fit for a film not a video game. It takes around 5 hours to finish it and unless you really want to colect everything there is to find in it there is simply no replayability. All in all it enjoyable, but only once and not for the current price I'm afraid.			"

												The plot is kinda ok but the gameplay is boring and repeative and there is no real challenge to anything. The investigations require obvious answers or the answers are not even realated to the question. The game lags and has a lot of bugs. Dont pay for this game. Just watch a walkthrough on youtube to get the plot and save yourseof 50 bucks. Playing it would make on difference then just wathing a walkthrough.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game. BUT - My boyfriend and I bought it to play when it was 25% off. I would recommend waiting until it comes up as a daily deal for that or less. I DO however, love the ""who dun it?"" aspect of it, and they definitely captured that well. All in all, they build up throughout the entire game until you feel certain you know ""who dun it"" but there's a nice little twist to the game in the end. If you're smart, you'll pretty much pick up on exactly what's going on about the first hour or two while you're playing, but it still keeps you interested. It took me 14-ish hours to finish because I went slowly and looked for all the collectibles - of which there are a TON (and I still missed some!) The neat thing is that each area you find yourself in has its own collectibles and once you get them all it tells a story for that area. There are a few miniature side cases that let you aid other spirits in moving on. These are interesting too. This was definitely a game worth playing, and has some replayability to it due to all the collectibles and maybe if you want to finish it with 100%, but otherwise it's more of a 'play through thoroughly once and enjoy' type of game. The only aspect that I found tedious was the 'demons' you had to fight. As I've seen a few other reviews state, the demons became more of a nuisance than anything. They were put in most likely as to have SOME form of combat, (as there isn't any otherwise) so I understand the point, but they get tiring after a while. That definitely didn't stop me from playing however. I give the game a 80/100 due to the demons and the fact that it's not really replayable. Definitely scary at some points and definitely atmospheric. I LOVE horror stories so it was right on the money. I definitely enjoyed the historical aspects of the game too. Great background.			"

												Wanted this game since I saw it on Steam but got a bit cautious when I saw that many people were giving it bad reviews.Now that it's on sale I bought it and finished the game. My Opinion: Definitely worth buying. At least on sale.Also you might want to consider useing a Gamepad / XBOX 360 Controller for playing.So Murdered[..] is a Story Driven game, making gameply rather linear. There are some side quests but nothing that yould keep you from your main quest for too long. Everything has a voice over and the lips of the animated characters are (to some degree) synced with that is said.In terms of being a ghost detective you have a rather minimalistic set of ghost powers like walking through walls (some inner building walls), posessing people in order to read their very repeteative and simple minds and sometimes triggering some memories.The thing that strikes one the most is that if you are inside someone and you try triggering a response you don't get a voice-acted ""Why the **** am I thinking that?"" respone but simply a text message saying ""not the right clue"" - which is rather boring. The ""Combat System"" is basically describeable with ""keep-out-of-sight"" and ""hope-the-system-triggers-the-backStab-and-I-can-banish-that-demon"" - not that there would be a lot of that but still, it gets annoying because you have to ""backstab"" those demons and if you have played any other game with such a feature (eg. Vampire TMB) you might know that triggering a backstab on a moving target has its difficulties.The main part of the game is the detective part, which means searching for clues and puzzing them together. The thing here is also that if you try to puzzle clues together that are of minor or no importance you get just a message stating that that clue was not the right one. And you may eliminate all your not right clues untill only those not not right remain.Still it was fun to play (for the most part) and I really liked the story.			"

												As soon as I saw this game on Steam I knew I wanted it. I waited and waited for it too come on sale. Luckily it did! and I would have paid full price for it if I knew how good it was!IN the first 20 mins i was s***ting bricks due to the Demons. The atmosphere and the music make it for an exciting scare. Doing the side missions aswell make the game good and not just a linear experience. The click to solve method is great. It makes you think what clues you need to match, sometimes they are too obivous to be the answer. Ive only played for about 7-8 hours or so but I can play this game for ages. The story line is gripping from the go and has not disappointed me thus far. Yes the game does have some bugs/bad moments about the game but it does not effect how the game is played. If you are wondering if you should buy this game then all I can say is that it is up too you! I was not disappointed but that does not mean you wont be. 5* for me!			"

												Lots of ambition, poor implementation.  What initially drew me in was the premise of the game:  A murder mystery ghost story who-done-it.  Instead, you find yourself trapped in a luke warm, predictable storyline with little flair.  The investigation system, the setting and the like?  They are good ideas poorly implemented.  There's only ever one soulution for each investigation, you know exactly how many clues they are, and it's very easy to figure out what happened in each situation before you conclude each investigation.  Solving a case means finding all the clues and then selecting the ""correct"" ones to move on.  The only difficulty in each investigation comes from trying to figure out which clues the developers wished you to reference in each investigation (the objectives aren't always clear).  After a few investigations, you pick up how the devs intended things to go, and it's basically a no-brainer from there.There's much more that I could go on about:  enemy encounters that can't decide if they are confrontational or stealth based, the very limited ""open"" world, and more.  Instead, let's take a look at what might have been.  The most depressing fact about the game is that you can easily see how this could have been a much better, very different game if they simply refined the experience.  Imagine:  a realized world with multiple fully fleshed out characters and places to explore.  Imagine:  being able to guess incorrectly on an investigation and wasting precious time following a false lead while there's a killer on the loose.  Imagine:  characters changing (killed, alienated and the like) based on your decisions.  Imagine:  multiple endings based on the decisions you've made.  Imagine:  meaningful sidequests that, while optional, might also give you access to different powers, resources and people.All of that just serves to make the whole experience more depressing.  If I could think this up not even halfway through the game, how could have the developers missed an opportunity like this?  Lack of budget/time/inspriation/testing?  Such a wasted opportunity!			"

												I was pretty excited about this game when I saw trailers and gameplay about it, but when it was released I didn't have the money to buy it and the reviews I saw for it was saying that it wasn't the most compelling game released. But I recently got it when it was on sale and I have to say I really enjoyed it. This game is different and I think thats what I really liked about it, I mean how often in a game can you go ahead and walk through walls and possess cats? The town of salem is a perfect place to set a supernatural story like this one, its so awesome going through the town to find out about the town's infamous past. If you really wanted to you could spend your time going around and collecting the enormous amount of collectibles which include information about the town and charcters. As for the detective part of the game its ok, it isn't the hardest as the game is pretty lenient, if you guess the wrong answer it gives you two other tries at getting the right answer. Other than the detective work you will also find yourself hiding and taking out demons with stealth which breaks up the gameplay a bit. The story and the investigation of your death is actually damn interesting as it has you guessing who could be your potential murderer. If you were considering getting this game I would recommend it, although I would suggest that you don't expect a action packed game, this game requires less violence and your brain. I personally wouldn't buy this game at full price though, its a bit on the shorter side as it took me 7 hours to complete, I still have collectibles to get but I know some people choose not to collect them. But if you're interested by ghosts, witches and solving murders then this is your game...			"

												This is a different take on the action adventure genre. Its more about the clues and the story than its about the action. Sure there is some, but not much. So if you're craving a an action!-adventure you wont find it in here. What you will find is plenty of exploring, reading and watching rendered cutscenes. The environment is pretty immersive and the gameplay mechanics are very fitting of this game. Everything is explained in-universe, so you're never lost in this who-dun-it storyline. Sound and graphics are top-notch.Highly recommended for Adventure with a Story lovers.			"

Here's a small amount of information about the game.-This game has plenty of story content.-You play in third-person.-There combat, however, you have only one type of foe to defeat (It is mainly Quick-time-events which you press two buttons at once.)-The game is considered short; depending on your playstyle, the length may vary.-If you've read the ""About This Game"" section, you will know that you are a detective. There are more than one case which you can solve, and they are similar to a puzzle where you must find objects or clues leading to the truths of the cases. (This is the puzzle element.)That is all the information I will provide, so that I won't give any spoilers on a game which is based around story elements.			"

												This ""game"" is one of the worst I've ever ""played"".  Even if free, it's not worth the time you'd spend.  Certain elements of the game make it clear that the game was rushed to publication, like the ""mysteries"" that you solve for random ghosts, which appear only in the first two areas and give you no reward whatsoever.  The game mechanics are shady and boring, like when you have to put together three clues and they tell you to put them in chronological order even though the clues have nothing to do with time.  Most of the time I could figure out what they wanted but by and large it was guesswork.  The game itself is only 3 or 4 hours of real gameplay with a great deal of padding in the form of hidden collectables, most of which also do not give you any reward except for the ""scary stories"" which feature excruciating voice acting and are a giant waste of time.I wish I had the kind of guts Square Enix has to publish this piece of garbage and demand 50 bucks for it.  Do not buy it, do not play it, and remember this the next time you want a Square Enix game.			"

												This is a dificult review. The basic idea is great. The graphics are ok. The mainstory is good. All up for a recommendation of this game. But there are some bits that are downright wrong or just killing your fun.The plus sides:The main story is really good. No masterpiece but good and with some twits here and there.You can posses and run around with a cat which is greatThe world in a mixture of ghosty past and present is nicely done and great to explore.The downsides:Some side missions are what feels like ""Ideas that been tossed aside and then used anyway...""The rather short main story is massively expanded by collectiong hidden objects. more than half the time you will belooking for hidden collectibles.Some puzzles are... I am not sure if they are meant as a joke? You want to pick up a key that you been looking for. Then you see a fork a knife and a key and hear the sound of a fallen key and have to click the object that makes that sound... what??!?Then there are those Deamons who are silly hard and just feel like yet another obstacle to expand the time you need to get through this game.All in all this is a great idea put into a very short game and then filled with nonsense stuff to expand it.

												If you go into this game expecting a sweeping epic or a play time creeping towards triple figures then you're going to have a bad time.What this game does have is a short but engaging story (I finished it in 6 hours), a world with plenty of nooks, crannies and collectables to keep the treasure hunters among you happy and characters that managed to make me either care about them or dislike them as the developer intended.As far as replay value goes, I doubt I'll be loading it up for another playthrough right away but I can see this becoming the sort of game that I'll fire up several months down the line when I don't fancy playing any of the shiney new games I've splashed out on at the time. I picked this up on a 50% flash sale, and that price feels about right for what I got.

												Interesting story.  It is like reading a book.  A bit short as I finished it in one afternoon.  No surprise clues at the end, you can figure out the mystery as the story progresses (which is a good thing).  I had guessed a few of the plot aspects before they happened, but I don't find that a negative.  It happens.The game concentrated on the story (which I liked) rather than combat with some story thrown in.  This may not appeal to some.The game is short.There were bad parts.  It was clear that the end was thrown together.  Not that the story didn't complete.  That was fine, but there were four major broken game development commandments.  Two appear right at the end.1.  You cannot save the game.  Ever.  It is a port to PC from a console.  There are automatic progress points.  The good thing is they do seem to happen often.2.  Flash sequences.  Some people like them, I don't.3.  Repeated cutscene (happens at end) when you fail (which will happen).  You can skip it after it starts, but forcing one to even go into it is bad.4.  Sudden timed sequence.  There is exactly one (two parts of one timed sequence) and none of the rest of the game has one.  It is short (the timed sequence), too. I'd recommend the game if you like to play a short story.  This is not a combat centered game.  It is a mystery and in that aspect it was fun to figure out the mystery.  Get it on sale.  Not worth a normal 50-60 dollar price tag.I'd like to see more products like this rather than the overdone shooters and what not, so I realise my suggestion to get it on sale isn't going to encourage more such development.I'm going to give it a yes but read the caveats in this article.

You don't shoot anything and the only time you feel like you are in danger is when you have to face demons that you can destroy by walking up behind them and perform a takedown action.The story revolves around a cop, name Ronan, who dies on duty chasing a serial killer and he can't ascend to the next plane of existence until his business on the mortal realm is resolved, so you have to hunt down the serial killer by solving crime scenes to determine what to do next.Overall I enjoyed the game and story, although once you finish you probably won't touch the game again unless you are trying to obtain 100% of the trophies. My recommendation is to buy the game when it is cheap, maybe around the $20 range or less.			"

'Kid' - Ronan, Murdered: Soul suspect

I like this game, it's not my typical game, but still I like it. It's a combination of a good point-and-click game and say 'The Walking Dead'. Most of the time you need to find the right place and choose the right dialouge, but then there are times you need to take action towards people and demons-FAST. You could always sneak past them aswell (but what's the fun in that;) )

There are alot of side-missions you can do (Achivements, achivements, achivements!), but they are not needed.

At times the music and surroundings makes the game way creepy and scary. The graphics are Amazing and they've really nailed the voices. 

Is it difficult? Not really..you learn the controls pretty quick. I reccomend this, give it a try and let me know what you think and ask me if you have any questions.

Oh, and by the way... 'meow' (if you've played the game you now what I'm meowing about ;) )  "

												The first thing to note is that the poor reviews out there are overly negative. The game has an excellent story line and is fun to play. If you like adventure games with an element of horror or mystery, this is a game for you. Negatives:Main character personality is flat and lifeless Investigations are not difficult, focused on collectingMovies are low res at 30fpsSometimes sounds do not play when picking up and itemLimited enemy encounters and no varietyVery limited replayabilityGame effects like the demon pools cause graphics stuttering even on high end machinesNo in game map (unforgiveable in this game) and many downloadable versions dont include access to the online mapCannot access world to pickup clues after the game ends (can't access museum upon entering judgement house)Postives: Excellent graphics and environmental detailExcellent sound effectsExcellent storyGraphics: 8/10 (due to glitches)Sound: 8/10 (due to glitches)Story: 8/10 (main character is dull)Gameplay: 4/10 (due to low difficulty, lack of enemies, collection bases crime solving)Overall:7/10			"

												MURDERED: Soul Suspect takes place in the historical city of Salem, Massachusetts, where you play the role of murdered police detective Ronan O’Conner. As you can imagine, the plot is rich in Salem Witch Trials lore. I don’t want to spoil anything for anyone, but growing up I was obsessed with all things Salem (and even got the opportunity to visit once a few years ago during Halloween – quite the experience), so that particular plot point was extremely exciting for me.Read my full review here: http://www.pcgamergirl.com/murdered-soul-suspect-2/ "

												When you think of Square-Enix, your mind would probably conjure up thoughts of Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts, maybe for older gamers who remember Squaresoft, you’ll even think of Chrono Trigger or maybe even Parasite Eve. Most of these games are sold as role playing games, and it’s the genre where Square-Enix has really dominated over the past twenty-five years. It came as a bit of a surprise then, when I saw a paranormal detective game being released by the RPG titans in the form of Murdered: Soul Suspect.See more at VG Almanac[vgalmanac.com] "

Murdered: Soul Suspect is a good game for those moments when you just feel like chilling. It's a graphical advenure which starts with you being already dead and your goal is to figure out why.Despite the fact that this game provides no challenge whatsoever, I enjoyed playing it because I got hooked by its story.Unfortunately, it's way too overpriced. I mean, I had fun completing the game and so on, but it's certainly not worth its price (fortunately I got it for free).			"

												An entertaining game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a decent noir-ish plot, because that is mostly all this game consists of. It is essentially a 3d visual novel with some limited stealthy portions. The story is your basic whodunit with a supernatural twist that surprised me, at least a little bit, in the end.If you were to rush threw the game, you'd likely be able to finish it in about 5-7 hours and it took me ~9 hours to 100% it. I'm not sure if I would recommend it at full price ($30.00 at the time of this review), but I bought it at $15.00 and do not regret the purchase.			"

												I was lucky and picked this game up at my local EB Games store for $9, well worth steams advertised price.Pros: One of a kind game, haven't really played a game like it before.          Plenty of collectables and side quests/Stories.         Open world.         Spot on atmosphere and music/sound effects.         Good story.         Runs well/Smooth Gameplay.         Good Graphics.         Controller/Keyboard + Mouse both work well.Cons: No Replay Value.          Runs at 30 Fps with V-Sync enabled, (Isnt a problem for me though as i get no screen tearing when running with V-Sync disabled and i get about 200 Fps running smoothly).I Recommend this game to anybody who is into detective, supernatural and horror themed titles.

												Absolutely loved the game. I hate horror but saw the trailer and had to play. Got the xbox version for the holidays and found the controls a bit difficult so I bought the PC version and could not put it down. Was excited but kind of disappointed when it was over.Really wish there was a way to play it over and get either a different end or extra content, or better yet I wish there was a sequel following Joy, a different ghost, or a prequel following Ronan when he was alive.Pros:-Great story with a twist and great score, really put me on edge and I don't like horror so A+ for making me like that-Loved the quality and range of the voice acting-Third person with fully mobile camera so it doesn't set off my vertigo-Well animated emotion-Enjoyable cutscenes (took me 12 hours to finish it, loved every minute and I was sad when it ended)-Really freaky demons that you can either play as is or modify the config file to play around (I couldn't handle the demons so that's what I did. They still freaked me out and I had to execute them but they weren't as huge of a hurdle with the modification)Cons:-No map (my xbox360 version had a code for a map included but it had expired so no map)-Very little if any replay value because the story is linear and additional material doesn't affect the story (aka no extra cutscenes). Once the game is over it runs through the credits and boots you out to the menu. If you try to continue from the menu once the game is done then it sends you back to the final checkpoint where you can't leave to explore the town for missing items-It felt so short, I was a bit taken aback when I realized that I was at the final scene-It didn't affect me but I found it funny that some of the character modeling overlapped (like his badge or hand would enter his thigh during some cutscenes)9.5/10 for me on this game			"

												A fairly short noir thriller where you play a ghost trying to solve his murder. The mystery is fairly predictable with a slight twist revealed at the end.+Controls are good, they're pretty basic but they work.+Subplots galore! (Subplots are revealed through collectables, most are easy to find but there's a couple tricky ones here or there)-Length: I completed the game in six hours. That's including dicking around, getting lost, looking for collectables, solving extra mysteries, and going afk for a while.Overall, I'd recommend getting this game if, and only if, it can be had cheap.

It reminded me a lot of like Batman: Arkham Asylum but without any melee fighting (for the record I hated batman for that so I was okay with this change), and with more things to track down (which, I'm okay with, I like stat progression and holy moly so many achievements, but it was rather bewildering at first because it just slams you with tons of new things all at once).If you ever played those Scooby Doo platformers on consoles between 2000-2005 then you'll probably like this enough that it's worth $15, like one of those used games you buy at Gamespot/EB-Games and you enjoy it for a time.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an interactive movie, with only mildly interesting story and generally mediocre gameplay. The supposedly interesting mechanics, like walking through walls or possessing people are either confusing, or only useful in specified places. The combat (or stealth with QTE takedowns to be precise) turns stale after only the second encounter. The meat of the game, the investigations, are also lackluster. They limit player interaction to mostly looking at stuff Kim Jong-un style, give no failure state and so become devoid of any meaning or satisfaction.And then there's the truckload of collectibles - checking every corner and wall for them quickly becomes rather irritating than satisfactory and draws attention away from the storyline. For me, as a stupid completionist they doubled the gametime of around 4 to 5 hours while also making it almost insufferable.Overall, I can't think of a person to recommend it to. Maybe if you would just ignore the collectibles? Even then, worth a couple bucks, tops.			"

Not too much fighting, which is great if you like to creep, discover and evade (like I do). But the game engine is a little clunky, meaning that you have to be exactly right on top of an object to activate it. It's also a little slow, with lots of cut scenes and evidence examination. If you can get past this, then it's a a fun way to pass a few hours, especially if bought cheap on a Humble Bundle deal like me. I probably wouldn't pay full price for it.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect review.Comrades, this is not a game, certainly not a detective one. The puzzles are not really puzzles and there are no options of getting it wrong. The game is quite short, only has few side quests, and three types of enemies (demons, train and controls).The thing is that as a detective game Murdered: Soul Suspect fails, it fades away into the shadows if compared to Sherlock Holmes and L.A. Noire.The game play is very basic, pretty much point and click on clues and then select the most relevant one. As such on a gameplay and mental levels the game is not challenging or stimulating at all.The story is simple and the plot can be guessed, but it is not a cliché one.I can't recommend this as a game, however I will recommend this as an interactive story if available to purchase below $7Overall score 5/10For more reviews joinhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

												A dark ghost-detective adventure story about ghost detective searching for truth about his murder so he can leave this kind of limbo.Game is good, this game doesn't fit all, so i understand a lot negative reviews in games related media.Pros:- slowly evolving dark detective story- nice unusual gaming mechanisms (as ghost you can possess people, you can attract them via ""poltergeist"" ability, you can walk through walls)- classic adventure mechanism - find clues yourself (which often means to watch everywhere and see if it is possible clue or not) and think about them (at every investigation you have to pick one to three from collected best fiting clues which are leading on)- dark atmospheric locations of Salem city- nice soundtrack- skippable EVERY cutscene and video (there is a lot flashbacks or memories videos etc.)- not bad rendered characters- you can even possess a cat! :)- daemons - in late gameplay i hated them (only real enemy during gameplay), but they can be scary, which is good, at the end i loved locations with daemons- almost no bugs or glitches (encountered only one during whole gameplay, some kind of stucked movement, character started walk to the left forever, but leave and enter location helped /i played it on keyboard and mouse so it was no stucked controller or so)Cons:- i can imagine much wider possibilities with such nice game mechanics, it looks like someone tied dev's hands- there are a few side investigations, but i could imagine a bit larger world with this setting and with some kind of open-world possibilitiesNice story, if you're into adventures, detectives, ghosts and mystery, go for it (8€ was worth it). It easily could be ""detective simulator"" packed into ghost-story. Lot of people complaining about every investigation has ""same gameplay"" - you go find clues and pick the right ones to solve investigation (or to get another additional clue) - well, as detective main character i find it natural you are visiting crime scenes douing your own investigation.

												For what it is worth, this game is not bad. In fact, it has a decient story to it.It is clearly unpolished in many ways, from the fact that Ronan always enters an area the same way, even if the story should indicate a sense of urgency to the fact that many of the ghosts you come across are merely 2D, and fade to prevent you from being able to tell easily. At one point you are wandering through a quarantined area and you can talk to a ghost of someone who had caught TB. For the time of the event you should expect her to be dressed in early 1900s style clothing, but she is wearing something clearly modern.i really want to like this game, but it is unsatisfying.Pros would be that the game does have a decient story, the main characters are developed enough to be believable, even if at times they do act very out of character in attempt to push the story forward.Cons, the gameplay gets seriously repetative. Every area is exactly the same things. Collect this, investigate this, guide this person, find a way around this, rinse, wash, repeat. Areas involving the demons are simply annoying. The puzzles are overly simplistic and many of the clues are difficult to find. Do not be surprised if you find yourself looking over the same room half a dozen times because they made things exceptionally obscure.For what it has, i am glad the game is short. Anything more than 7.5 hours and it would have become far to repetative and annoying to bother with. That and this game has little replay value.Why am i still recommending this game? Because if you can get it on sale for something under 10 dollars, i think the story alone is worth it. Anything more, and it would be best to pass this up for something a bit better.i feel bad for anyone who payed even 25$ for this game.			"

												Murdered Soul Suspect has quickly jumped to my list of most underrated games of 2014.  A solid mystery yarn with great atmosphere and a gripping story, it's a sure bet for any gamers looking for more story-driven fare.Like similar titles (Beyond Two Souls, LA Noire, The Walking Dead), MSS operates on the philosophy that story trumps action.  The gameplay consists almost entirely of investigating scenes to piece together the central mystery, with some stealth elements wedged in for good measure.Everything is fairly well-done gameplay-wise, though the investigations can become a little repetitive later on into the game.The story is the focus here, though.  The plot (which I won't spoil here), is like Patrick Swayze's ""GHOST"" had a baby with LA Noire.  Overall, enough to keep you going through the game.Not that it needs to keep you going for long.  I finished the game in just over 5 hours.  I don't, however, feel cheated.  If purchased at sale price, it's a great game that's worth your time and money.  I'm going to be revisiting it eventually because replaying would be so quick.So if you're looking that's light on action and heavy on story, check this one out!  I really enjoyed it.			"

												less a videogame, and more an interactive movie on rails. frequently your only input will be to choose the order in which you ask someone a set of predetermined questions as you investigate a series of murders. combat with demons - the only enemies in the game, outside of cutscenes - feel more like a worthless speedbump than an entertaining mechanic. however, if you can force yourself through the tedious, mediocre gameplay, you'll find a fantastic whodunit that will keep you guessing right up until the end.  the overall concept, voice acting and art direction are absolutely superb, but unfortunately, poor execution, clunky controls, and repetitive, thoughtless ""scene investigations"" will probably bore and frustrate most players into quitting before they get all the way through what is otherwise a great story. it's worth a buy on the merits of the story alone, but expect some tough slogging through the mud to get all the way to the end. buy it on sale, ignore the terrible gameplay and stick it out to the end to watch a neat psychological thriller / whodunit crossover, and then uninstall it forever.

												Tthis is one of the best games I have ever played in my life, apart from the walking dead, but thats a very hard game to compete with, and to be honest I think this is better if I think about it! It is totally worth every penny, this game makes the most of its plot twists. I totally recommend it and love it! Murdered: Soul Suspect!			"

												Entertaining. I liked the investigations and the setting, however the town map felt a bit cramped and the story a little short. The ghost abilities are fun, but I would have loved to be able to scare bystanders on the street.If you like a supernatural yarn, then you could get some mileage out of this.			"

												Murdered Soul Suspect is a 3rd Person Ghost Walking Simulator. You are a cop, who has been murdered in the intro and must now try to solve your own murder (and several others). As you can barely interact with real worlds objects, you mainly walk around and look at things. From time to time you have to answer questions about the things you looked at, these questions are normally either embarrassing easy or the answers do not make much sense.There are some nice ""ghost mechanics"" included, mainly walking through walls, but they do not carry the game for its full (or half or quarter) length.So, what else can carry a game with stale gameplay?Visuals? They are nice, but no unique sales point.Music? There are mostly mysterious sound effect.That leaves us with: Story. And the build-up is great. Your dead cop character has a checkered past and is full of hurt, you have your run of the mill serial killer to follow, your teenage side kick complains a lot etc. The first third of the story is good, then not a lot happens, then a few foreseeable plot twists and it ends with ... a deus ex machina. In a nutshell:+ really good concept, no open end- gameplay is mainly walking around looking for stuff- story starts out good, then becomes less so and leaves you unsatisfied			"

 Too Long Won't Read Verdict Bargain Bin - Buy this game at a discount price. The story is solid, but not mindblowing. I enjoyed the ride and the atmosphere was great. The gameplay mechanics are nothing to write home about and the ""action"" sequences are annoying obsticles. The game runs for about 5-6 hours which can be extended by hunting all the little collectibles and enjoying the snippets of content that brings. Overall it was an enjoyable experience. The 'Tails I played this game from start to finish in two separate nights. The game immediately pulled me into it's atmosphere of supernatural mystery and maintained it's low hanging horror throughout. I'm glad it did not try to be a horror game; it was smartly realized to keep that element very passive which just supported the backbone of the game's overall flavor. This particluar ""flavor"" is set in Salem, Massachusetts and plays heavily off of the historical witch trials. You get to experience this through the character known as Ronan who dies in the first sequence of the game.  Ghost Detective...ooOOoOOOOOOooo . In order to avoid spoilers I won't say anymore about the story than that.Gameplay-wise this game relies on an investigation mode where you have to search specific areas for clues to piece together a shard of the story. Sometimes finding all the clues in a given area is really easy, othertimes they aren't all so obvious, but that's okay, beacuase you don't need to necessarily find all the clues to complete the investigation. Good design. There is a strange component to this core mechanic in the form of what seems to resemble a score system. It was never made really clear, but basically, whenever you have to put the final pieces of an investigation together a menu is brought up in which you usually have to choose three clues that explain that particular scene. At the bottom of this menu are three police badge shaped icons and whenever you make a mistake in choosing clues one of them goes away. However in my experience the badges will never drop below one and create no pressing incentive to just randomly click on all the clues until you get the right answer. Bad execution.The final main mechanic you will run into are these ""stealth-action"" sequences. You will occasionally run into areas that have demons blocking your progression. You must sneak behind them and perform a short series of QTEs to destroy them. I played this game with mouse and keyboard, and my expereince with these QTEs was frustrating to say the least. You start by holding R, then have to follow up with a combination press of W, A, S, or D + left or right mouse button. It is a little akward and to be frank they are QTEs which I already despise. I did run into some areas where these demons could be ignored and you can progress by just being sneaky, but not many. And when the demons see you, you have to go run into hiding spaces and then teleport between them when they search the hiding spaces. This entire mechanic is a bit akward and I don't feel it added to the game in a positive way. Bad design.The game doesn't have a whole lot more to offer mechanically, but it should be expected seeing as this is a very narritive focused game. So as I said above, I reccomend this game only at a discount.EDIT: Oh I forgot to mention. The final sequence to the game is irritating. You have a limited amount of time to figure out what to do and if you fail it takes you back two whole cinematics. Luckily cinematics can be skipped, but it was frustrating.			"

												I like the game story. It makes you curious and keeps you wanting to finish chapter after chapter. I totally agree with others that this game has potential but the story is too short tho the ending is quite surprise. Nice music. Boring combat. Excellent  game ideas. Hope that they will extend the idea n make it more fun in the future, more powerful main char, more puzzles, more tricks, etc... Recommend it on sale.			"

												I finally finished this game today and I'm finding it incredibly difficult to decide how to score/review it, since my thoughts about it are so mixed. I chose to give it a positive overall score because I don't feel it's a *bad* game per se, and it certainly does have an audience. I did enjoy the game, even while at the same time I had so many issues with it.Since I first heard about this game, I couldn't wait for it to come out. The premise sounded fantastic. Salem is very close to my heart IRL, and I'm inclined to adore any game that explores occult/supernatural themes in a unique way. And this game certainly did that. However, it just doesn't have the polish that it deserved, and I feel as though it doesn't give itself license to be what it is. In stark contrast to this is another game that came out this year with very similar themes and gameplay, which I found to be executed far more effectively. That game is the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and it was made by a much smaller studio no less! Of course, these games did not invent detective games, however they explore mechanics that I haven't seen much of before. While I won't spend this whole review comparing the two games, I will say this: if you enjoyed the detective mechanic and occult themes here, do yourself a favor and look up the Vanishing of Ethan Carter as well.With that said, I did enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect. Wandering around the streets of Salem as a ghost, deciphering clues and uncovering hidden remnants of the past is a fun and unique experience. The game looks great and plays smoothly, and the difficulty level is appropriate for the casual player, nothing quite too challenging. I also enjoyed the story, which wove together some pieces of Salem's darker past with modern times, as well as stories from in between. Exploring a Salem full of ghostly objects and remnants was an interesting idea, even if many of those objects were clearly just placed at random to place limits on the world. I didn't really feel like this is what an ""in-between death realm"" would look like - random boats and carts all over the place, the occasional demon grabbing for you and other dead people standing around that disappear when you get close. These effects start to feel more like decoration than a living world, which is a shame. This is Salem after all, there was such potential here. Some of the locations outside of the town proper were much more interesting, such as the cemetery. While you can roam around Salem (mostly) freely, at the end of the day, it's a very small place with a finite number of activities. And while walking through walls and objects never gets old, using your other ghostly abilities such as ""possessing"" living people does. 90% of the time, all you can do is read their thoughts, and most people have only 1 or 2 thoughts, neither of them interesting. After doing this a few times with different people, you'll hear the same thoughts over and over, and this feature will lose all of its appeal. Only very rarely do people's thoughts contribute to gameplay or add any interest to the story, mostly it's just a bore. A few times, the possession mechanic was used to inhabit and move through other characters, including a cat, which was very interesting. I would have loved more of this, it would have provided a bit more variety in gameplay and made the ability feel a bit more tangible. I'm also left wondering why the devs developed the ability to inhabit and move through a secondary character, but this was only used for a combined total of 30 seconds throughout the game. Much more potential for stealth here. Instead, all we can do is ""poltergeist"" objects like fax and soda machines while the other character runs around, and it's almost impossible to mess up.Which brings me to the other stealth mechanic, the demons. I did not like the demons at all. Very tedious and unnecessary piece of gameplay. This is what I meant when I said the game should embrace what it is, a detective game. Instead, it tried to add some action into the mix, with a half-hearted attempt at stealth mechanics. I love a good stealth game, in fact it's one of my favorite genres, but this was painful. The demons just wander around set courses, and you have to either slip by them or attack them with what is essentially a quick-time event. The only thing that makes this remotely challenging is that you have to press (if playing with keyboard and mouse) a random WASD key and either left or right mouse button at the same time. It just ends up feeling like a cheap attempt at adding challenge to a very boring mechanic. Essentially, the only weapon you have in this game is how fast you can press those keys. The demons don't change throughout the course of the game, and you don't develop any new abilities for dealing with them. They merely serve as padding to prevent you from getting from one area to the next too quickly. The ""action"" culminates in a very disappointing ""boss battle"" which strangely attempted to weaponize the game's detective mechanics. It all just felt very strange and unnecessary. Again, in contrast, VEC allowed itself to be a detective/exploration game without injecting unnecessary action, and as a result achieved a much more cohesive experience overall. Perhaps if M:SS had developed the stealth/action parts a bit more, it could have integrated that gameplay more effectively. But as it is, I felt the game would have been better off without it.M:SS does have a few other redemptive qualities that I want to mention. There are stories in the game that you uncover by finding objects and letters, and these, along with the main storyline, are what kept me playing. It is definitely fun, at least for me, to explore the various scenes and settings in the game and uncover the secrets of what happened here. Perhaps that is what this game does best - it allows you to unravel the story through experience rather than just telling you what happened. Many of the locations are great and kept me wanting to explore every last nook and cranny to make sure I didn't miss anything. Not all of the stories are interesting though. Most of the notes you'll find are sad journal entries written by the main character's wife. Both her and the main character himself are beyond boring and cliché. All of her journal entries are about how Ronan is such a bad boy, but she's irresistibly drawn to him nonetheless. She's afraid of him, but she loves him. If you've read one, you've read them all. It became disappointing to pick up a note and see her sad face on it. Ronan, however, is even worse. I just found him incredibly uninteresting and unlikeable. Keep on ghost-chain-smoking your ghost-cigarettes, Ronan. Most of the other characters and stories in the game were much more interesting, so at least there's that.Another gripe - where are all the witches? We're in Salem, and there are basically zero witches. Huge missed opportunity there. To this day, Salem has a thriving Witchcraft community, and it's an essential thread in the tapestry of the town for obvious reasons. While the story references the witches of old, I was left wanting more than that from this part of Salem. And further, for a ghost story full of demons set in a town famed for Witchcraft, there is no horror to this game at all. The only thing scary in this game is whether you'll continue to fail at QTEs and have to do them over and over again.Alright, I feel this review is just devolving into me listing off complaints about what I wanted this game to be, which isn't quite fair. There is much more I could say about why this is overall a decent game, but I would say that if this game piques your interest, if you want to try something different and aren't scared off by the mixed scores, then I'd say go for it. Get it when it's on sale and go in with low expectations, and you'll probably enjoy it. 6/10			"

												I would definitely recommend this game. BUT - My boyfriend and I bought it to play when it was 25% off. I would recommend waiting until it comes up as a daily deal for that or less. I DO however, love the ""who dun it?"" aspect of it, and they definitely captured that well. All in all, they build up throughout the entire game until you feel certain you know ""who dun it"" but there's a nice little twist to the game in the end. If you're smart, you'll pretty much pick up on exactly what's going on about the first hour or two while you're playing, but it still keeps you interested. It took me 14-ish hours to finish because I went slowly and looked for all the collectibles - of which there are a TON (and I still missed some!) The neat thing is that each area you find yourself in has its own collectibles and once you get them all it tells a story for that area. There are a few miniature side cases that let you aid other spirits in moving on. These are interesting too. This was definitely a game worth playing, and has some replayability to it due to all the collectibles and maybe if you want to finish it with 100%, but otherwise it's more of a 'play through thoroughly once and enjoy' type of game. The only aspect that I found tedious was the 'demons' you had to fight. As I've seen a few other reviews state, the demons became more of a nuisance than anything. They were put in most likely as to have SOME form of combat, (as there isn't any otherwise) so I understand the point, but they get tiring after a while. That definitely didn't stop me from playing however. I give the game a 80/100 due to the demons and the fact that it's not really replayable. Definitely scary at some points and definitely atmospheric. I LOVE horror stories so it was right on the money. I definitely enjoyed the historical aspects of the game too. Great background.			"

												Its an interesting idea for a game. The story was cool and obviously ties in with the Salem witch trials.I enjoyed having the side missions where you had to investigate exactly how people died that were ghosts and didnt recall their deaths.Minor critisms are that the main character is pretty bland, the 'combat' in the game was way too easy and almost pointless and also there could have been more side missions. The game takes about 6-7 hours complete and definitely isnt worth more than £10 in my humble opinion			"

												As soon as I saw this game on Steam I knew I wanted it. I waited and waited for it too come on sale. Luckily it did! and I would have paid full price for it if I knew how good it was!IN the first 20 mins i was s***ting bricks due to the Demons. The atmosphere and the music make it for an exciting scare. Doing the side missions aswell make the game good and not just a linear experience. The click to solve method is great. It makes you think what clues you need to match, sometimes they are too obivous to be the answer. Ive only played for about 7-8 hours or so but I can play this game for ages. The story line is gripping from the go and has not disappointed me thus far. Yes the game does have some bugs/bad moments about the game but it does not effect how the game is played. If you are wondering if you should buy this game then all I can say is that it is up too you! I was not disappointed but that does not mean you wont be. 5* for me!			"

Throughout the game, you come across mysterious scenarios where you have to solve a person's death. You do this by walking around and finding clues. In theory. But in practive you just end up mashing the X button (I play with a controller) until something happens. It's tedious, and boring.I've only played a few hours of it but I'm over it already.

												If you like indigo prophesy or heavy rain you might like this game.  Otherwise you should stay away.  It's a 3d point and click search-a-thon for all clues in cases.  I assume the more you get the better ending/easier, but many times you go right past a clue without even showing you a trigger to reveal the clue.  Also no way to use a resolution you like without using 3rd party software.  The game would revert my chosen resolution to another of its choosing and would not even go all the way full screen on my monitor or even max out to the resolution of my monitor.  Not my type of game, but if you like the games listed at the top, you may enjoy it.			"

												Tried to play this game and it seemed good but cant get past the first chapter because it crashes every time. Contacted customer support but just got the run around. Literally ALL my other games wor and i have about 60 total besides this one so im not sure what the issue is. I will change this review when the game is fixed. I know it happens to a lot of others too so the developers need to get it together. NOW NEW REVIEW BELOW... Got the game to work past the first chapter, not sure why , maybe it updated...good job to developers...great game, interesting storyline so yes, well worth the money i spent on it THANKS GUYS AND GALS!

												I'm not really sure why I liked Murdered: Soul Suspect, maybe it was because the investigation parts are just the right amount of challenging without relying on your ability to lip read the faces of the uncanny valley... I'm trying to avoid looking at you L.A Noire... Or perhaps it was the side quests, engaging side quests, where I actually felt like I was doing some good, that I was changing the game world for the better. Whatever it was I did enjoy Murdered: Shoal Suspect. I enjoyed it a lot and (silly name aside) I found myself gripped in a supernatural thriller, which had some level of adventure gameness to it, the controls were solid, the graphics reasonable, and the story (while a little predictable in places) did keep me glued to the screen wanting to find out what happened next, the ability to contribute to that story through the aforementioned side quests, and investigation moments probably helped keep me in during the boring bits.I did find the combat a little clunky, but the moments are so few and far between that it never became more than a minor annoyance, and immersion was spoiled somewhat by the sheer denseness of the player character, watching him piece together the motives of the antagonist was less Sherlock Holmes, and more Scooby-Doo.However maybe you really get off on being smarter than the character... Maybe that is the real reason I like Murdered: Soul Singer. Whatever your motivation for thinking about getting this game, I advise you to.			"

												I got this game from buying a new video card, and had heard good things about it before that. When I finally got to play it, the first thing that struck me was how much it felt like a console game. The world is very limited, and it feels like one is railroaded from crime scene to crime scene.Gameplay is limited to finding clues at each crime scene and then selecting the most relevant to ""solve"" the scene, with some side cases sprinkled in for flavour in between. Occasionally demons arrive and must be dealt with (or evaded), but this is very tedious and not fun (or challenging) at all.Adding insult to injury is the fact, that Interaction with the environment is extremely limited, and dialogue choices are non-existant. The game also isn't entirely free of bugs, which sometimes make it necessary to load an older saved game.What saves Soul Suspect from being a complete disappointment is the setting, in which the protagonist perceives both the mortal and the spirit realm. This does grow old after a while though, and there is absolutely nothing that could possibly add a level of suspension (while there is the occasional strained-strings-with-something-unspeakable-about-to-pop-out-of-nowhere-background music rest assured, nothing will actually happen).If I hadn't gotten this game for free I would most certainly feel that any amount of money spent would have been a complete waste. As far as crime games go they mostly revolve about finding and combining clues, and it is also the core mechanic of Soul Suspect. The execution, however, is so uninspiring (and sometimes insultingly simple), that I simply could not recommend this to anyone.			"

												A refreshing mystery game, light on action with some straight-forward navigational puzzles, and a solid narrative as far  as video games are concerned. There's some above average voice acting present here, with atmospheric and sometimes spooky visuals. The content and subject matter of Murdered: Soul Suspect is what makes it a breath of fresh air in a sea of violent action games.  How do people cope with their own deaths? You'll learn a lot about that subject if you take the time to talk to other ghosts in the game's world. Some are flat-out in denial, others have embraced it. Some are recently deceased, others are ancient ghosts, still troubled by their tragic (or not) fates. You'll encounter spirits that offer  side quests requiring you to help them figure out the circumstances  of how or why they died.  It's rather interesting if you're into that kind of thing.To nit pick, the game goes on for about an hour longer than it should, revisiting areas previously visited and therefore becoming a bit tedious, but the obligatory mystery genre twist at the end makes it worth it. There's no combat to speak of -- sometimes you have to dispatch ""demons"" which requires a bit of  stealth combined with quick time events -- that's the extent of Murdered: Soul Suspect's ""action"". These  scenarios are few and far between, but only serve to slow down your investigative process, and caused me to roll my eyes, particularly at the end of the game, when I just wanted to move forward with solving what I wanted to solve to complete the game. Murdured: Soul Suspect is not a perfect game but if you crave a break from shooting things in the face, instead gathering clues, solving mysteries and exercising the more analytical side of your brain, Murdered: Soul Suspect is for you.

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. At first, I thought this would be a failure and not peak my interests whatsoever. After getting it through the recent humble bundle and trying it out I was hooked, once started, I did not play another game until I was finished up. Even went as far as attempting to get all of the collectibles for some extra story. It really is a one and done kind of game though, which I enjoy but may not be for you. If this looks like a weird game or something you wouldn't like, i'd rethink that and give it a shot. I had the same mindset and immediately after starting it that all changed.			"

												In short: Grab it if it's $15-20 or less, it's a unique steal for that price.Just finished this, really enjoyed it even though it was rough and clunky around the edges.The reviews paint it as a train-wreck of a game, but that's because they were comparing it to highly-polished 'AAA' fare out there. If you stack it up against something like Assassin's or The Last Of Us in terms of graphics, animation and mechanics, it doesn't look great, but at it's heart is some nice storytelling and a few fresh ideas.The 'combat' is basic and thankfully there's not much of it. Shouldn't take up more than 5% max of your game time.I had the most fun exploring the town and the locations, learning the history of the place and the stories of the various characters.Big shout outs to the moody, effective, original sound design (even if the mixing means that the cut-scenes are louder than the in-game sound).Biggest shout out of all to the writing and excellent voice acting & performances. Really puts a lot of modern games to shame, and artfully avoids the usual 'Japanese game' melodrama (I'm looking at you, Yakuza). Very understated for the video game, and very effecting. Quite touching at times.The biggest minus? You spend most of the game collecting clues, but once you finish the game you can't keep searching for the rest. Although it might make sense plot-wise... they should at least let you leave the last locations after restoring you final game save, to go 'clean up' before the final sequence. A very poor decision that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth at the end of a nice experience, especially for story fans who want to investigate and get all the clues. Granted, they warn you before you enter the last location that you won't be able to return, but this restriction shouldn't be there in the first place. Massive missed opportunity and we'll never get a patch to fix it, which is a massive shame. :(Anyway, regardless, the journey is great and stays a memorable experience despire this oversight. If this was a $15-$20 'indie' release, it would have been a solid 8/10 in the reviews, but came out as a full priced 'AAA' game and suffered because of it. Enjoy it for what it is - an unusually understated and restrained murder mystery with a lot of interesting fresh ideas and some great acting. Highly recommended, when it's on special... :)			"

												Great adventure game. The game is too short to be worth it's full price. 7-8 hours of gameplay, 75% achievements without looking too much, for the collective items you find in the games these days. The game is pretty straight forward and doesn't let you hang in difficult places. You only have the auto saves to get back to, but tbh they're more than enough.Playing as a ghost it's quite different from other adventuregames and there is a eerie feel to it. You might even call it a thriller adventure.That was a saturday that wasn't wasted. I do enjoy getting surprised by a good adventure game, last time I had a good adventure game was Cognition: an Erica Reed thriller "

												After seeing the trailer i was really eager to try the game as i am big fan of adventure games. After playing at friend for a few hours Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, i was expecting something at least as good. But i was overall disappointed. What i liked about this game:- the story is really interesting  and the concept is newWhat i didn't like:- the clue system: although it has some interesting concepts (like possessing people), it get repetitive really fast. You just need to collect all the clues in each chapter- the stealth/sneak - the addition of demons is just annoying and useless, you just need to sneak behind them and do  quick-time sequence - the menu clearly shows that is a console port- the town could put emphasis on exploration, but seems dead (literally and figuratively) the NPC are always in the same place- the save system- i don't think checkpoints have a place in an adventure gameOverall: 65/100 I recommend playing this only if you don't have anything else to play. If you want a good detective-adventure game, try  Sherlock or L.A. Noire			"

(Honestly one of them was so easy it just felt like those last second ""oh we need to add just a few more things to finish this game)-Achivments story or collectables (no kidding there is a S**T ton of collectables!-Quick time events (maybe me but they are a pain in the butt to exucute and i mean that for real!)-Ending gives you a small window to ""finish the game"" (not gonna lie I died so many times because I just could not get to the event and press it when it came up)Verdict-This is one of those rent it, play it for 2 days, you can finish this under 8 hours if you rush story without dying (good luck on that) other wise its just one of ""those"" games, you know the one you talk about to friends and say ""yeah I played it, good story but recommend renting it"" as you cough taking a drink.I'm not booing this game (get it booing?) its more or less a play through once and the second time is just to collect.Hope this helps decide to buy this game or not.

												The first con I want to point out right away. It is a game that can be finished in just around 7-10 hours give or take. BUT, the storyline is fantastic! It includes amazing graphics, on spot voice acting and a set of very likeable characters. It is just the right mix of bad♥♥♥♥♥and charm to make you melt into the storyline. It is about finding the clues, so you have a detective puzzle style but has a bitter twist, as you are a ghost trying to solve your own murder. The only other cons I have are that if you are playing without a controller, the keyboard controls are kind of hard to use, especially when killing enemies. The enemies are also tough to kill, but that just might have been because I was using the weird keyboard controls. I did find myself stuck for a frustrating amount of time trying to kill enemies in certain areas just to procede. Overall, this game was an incredible gameplay and I recommend playing if you are looking for an interactive detective puzzle game with an in depth and exciting storyline.			"

												It is an ok game with a good gimik. Shame more wasn't done with the ideas that the game had. If you complete the game you can't pick an area to go back to to see any collectables you might have missed. Reccomend save before final bit!			"

												I have absolutely nothing but praise for this game. I just want to start this review by saying that.I'm not a massive horror video game fan. Hell, I can't even get through the first level of F.E.A.R. So when I first saw Murdered: Soul Suspect pop up as a pre-order at my local games store, I was fairly hesitant. Upon release, I was still hesitant, and decided against it. Then it popped up in the Steam Summer Sale, so I figured for half the price, why not? If I don't like it, no harm done. Luckily for me, I loved it.The atmosphere of the game is fantastic, the characters extremely well fleshed out (or spirited, I guess), and the story is amazing. You play as Ronan O'Connor, a detective with the Salem Police Department. The opening cinematic sees Ronan fall from a fourth floor window to the street below. After desperately trying to align his spirit with his body, the person who threw Ronan from the window, known only as the Bell Killer, appears. Using Ronan's own gun, the killer fires 7 round into him, and ends his life for good.Only, he doesn't end Ronan's afterlife, and this is where the fun begins. You play through the game trying to solve the mystery behind not only your own murder, but the murder of several young girls throughout the town. What follows is one of the most brilliant gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure to play. Using an array of otherworldly abilities, and the assistance of a girl who can see and interact with Ronan, you embark on a mission to find the killer, and put your soul to rest.A special mention goes to the collectables throughout the game, especially those required to unlock short horror stories. These just upped the atmosphere of the game, and I felt really immersed in the world of modern day Salem. Whilst the game isn't overly long, it has been thoroughly enjoyable, and I recommend it to anyone who's played L.A. Noire, and seen the movie Ghost (with Patrick Swayze of course). This game, to me, felt like a mashup of those two instances of media, and Square-Enix really pulled it off.So, after all that text, do I recommend this game? Yes. Yes I do. And shame on all those who don't.			"

												MURDERED: Soul Suspect is an atmospheric, story-based game. Tonally, it lies somewhere between LA Noire and the Still Life series. The gameplay is reminiscent of a point-and-click adventure but with the difficulty knob turned way down. If you're looking for a challenge, this isn't the game for you. However, if you're looking for a nice Noir-esque detective story with a supernatural twist, you should enjoy this game. Personally, I enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												The various bugs can be extremely frustrating, and the lack of responsiveness from the menu alone should have been a priority for the dev team, but if you can get beyond that, this game is all the best parts of L.A. Noir, without all the awful driving around or clunky combat. Interesting story that could have been its own movie. I liked it, but can only give it a lukewarm reccomendation.			"

												If you like your games because of the story and mechanics buy it. However, the game is really short. It only took me a total of 12 hours to compleate it and those hours included all the things i did in the day while i had the game paused. Personally i would have waited to buy it untill i could have bought it for like 50% off because of the length of the game alone. Everything else is awsome though.			"

												Back hand clapping...I had to give up playing this today after the 30th time of trying to execute the same demon and forgetting that (unlike any other game) you have to hold the button down. For me this game is an endless cycle of: sneak up behind demon, press execute button, run away because ""I"" let them go (i.e. forgot to hold the button)...No option...Why for the love of god did they not include an auto hold on execute option in controls?! This awful command system is a game ruiner and all the hard work put into this game amounts to nothing because of it. It's very sad because I was enjoying the game. I have no problem sneaking up behind the demons but then in the heat of the moment I forget that it has a weirdly unique and bizarrely abnormal control system that has never been used in any other game. 3rd Party software needed?The only way I could play this was if I used a program like xpadder to make the button toggle or hold for a time, but having to use 3rd party software to overcome a badly thought out and poorly implemented control system is ridiculous (for a 3rd person game, not a flight sim).No patch?If they make a patch I for this I might play it but since having an unplayable game taking up lots of space on my hdd is a stupid idea,  I will be uninstalling it and wont know if there is a patch because I am not going to bother checking (in much the same way they didn't bother putting an alternative to their useless command system).

												So I literally just this second finished the game, well im lying it was 10 minutes  ago but ill get to that in a sec, Murdered soul suspect is a good game but to me it has no replay value (but I was expecting that going in) you play it from start to finish complete the story and your done as if you read a book or watched a film, you can go back and replay it trying to find all the little collectables to wring out a bit more story but you’re not going to get much more.So the game took me about 8 hours (this is what steam has me clocked at) it may take you a bit less or a bit more if you’re like me and spend ages running round the place trying to find that one collectable you somehow missed.Also on the note of time the ending credits are unskippable and last for about 10 minutes and there is nothing after them it dumps you back on the title screen.So bugbears about the game (well other that the ending credits) it stinks of a console port (not as bad as some mind you) it’s a bit clunky there were several times where items that should have been intractable weren’t (like in the end scene I failed because I was one step to close to have the press E to interact pop-up show up) the FOV is a bit tight, then there is the chose by Square Enix to have combat in the game personally I don’t think it fit well but this is a personal choice thing but after a bit of searching on the web I found there is a way to turn off the daemons/turn invisible to them and in my mind that made the game a lot more fun but to each his own.And lastly they cheating on the ending, they kind of ended it but did it in a way were they can bring him back for a sequel which im kind of ok with as I liked the game and ideas behind it even if the puzzles with a bit too easy (I 3 badged almost every puzzle in the game) but I would have liked it better if they have closed this story off and had a sequel with a new propagandised as the story sets up the idea that ghost are made when you die and feel there is still stuff you need to do.So yes I recommend it but don’t expect too much from it.

												I really enjoyed this game. The perspective was new and exciting. There aere a few features that really made the detective aspect of the game itself far more interesting. There are plenty of side quests for you to do, though I myself am not one for them. The side quests have no effect on the progress of the story but do provide interesting information about the town of Salem and the life of Ronan (you). Some of it gets a little repetitive but seeing as the game isn't that long to begin with it doesn't stay that way for long. The ending is great and the characters you encounter are interesting and relatable. Overall it's a nice game and at a nice price if you can get it on sale. Honestly..$30 is a bit much for me but I managed to get my hands on a cheap copy. Good luck to all who play. d~(^.^)~bWARNING!Graphically the game leaves much to be desired and the combat system is really quite simple making the game feel far too easy. I honestly liked making it more interesting on my own by setting some challenges like killing an enemy this way or not using this ability to do so, but really, get it on sale, it's not worth $30...sorry guys.

												recommend the game not for gameplay though the gameplay is rather fun very similar to L.A.

Not worth 30$ though because you'll only get 4-6 hours of gameplay and there is no replay value unless you missed some collectibles and you want to collect those.			"

												This game has a good story and the investiagion portions are fun.  This is not an action game so know that going in.  There is no fighting or shooting outside of cutscenes.  The closest thing to action this game has is a sort of stealthy takedown mechanic that is occasionally used to remove adversaries.  This mechanic isn't handled very well, but for the most part it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the rest of the game.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a long time. The graphics are superb, and the story is outstanding. The amount of realism in this game really makes me want to go and visit Salem. The characters are all unique to their time periods, and their personalities are well expressed through amazing voice acting and movement of the body models by the game makers. I'd give this game a strong 9.5/10, only because it was too short to me. I'll definately be sitting down and playing this game over and over for a long time. I reccomend to anyone who wants a good game with a great plot and plot twists!			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is probably best described as a story driven puzzle game. You don't shoot anything and the only time you feel like you are in danger is when you have to face demons that you can destroy by walking up behind them and perform a takedown action.The story revolves around a cop, name Ronan, who dies on duty chasing a serial killer and he can't ascend to the next plane of existence until his business on the mortal realm is resolved, so you have to hunt down the serial killer by solving crime scenes to determine what to do next.Overall I enjoyed the game and story, although once you finish you probably won't touch the game again unless you are trying to obtain 100% of the trophies. My recommendation is to buy the game when it is cheap, maybe around the $20 range or less.			"

												Let me just start by saying that I got this game for free with my video card, so I'm sure that affects my review, but it still left me with plenty to say about it.Now usually I'm the kind of person to play fast paced action games where a story doesn't exist as much as a huge pile of bodies does. Somehow, this game still got to me. I was kind of reluctent to play it at first, but once I started to play, I didn't really know what to think. The story is so original, I've never seen anything even close to it. Basically you play as a cop, and the game starts off with your death. The goal is to find your murderer while you play as a ghost, find clues, and avoid demons. Despite it being a detective game, it doesn't really have many boring/slow part, it keeps you hooked pretty much the whole time. I haven't beat the story yet, but it seems to be really well developed and around 8 hours of gameplay from what I've heard. I know that sounds like it wouldn't interest the majority of players, but don't instantly turn your head away from it, it's definitely a good dame, and not the type I like to play either. Watch some videos, do some research, even wait for it to go on sale if you're really not sure if you want it, but seriously consider it. "

												This is an adventure game, the kind of adventure game that would fit the point and click genre (if it weren't for the fact that is in 3rd person). Its a good adventure game, with a good story, with some flaws in a couple of puzzles and a weak 'stelath action'  mechanic which is not a big deal since it is used 4 times throughout the game. I'd say 40€ is a bit too much because of the short lenght. But it is fun, interesting concept, moody and captivating			"

												Overall, the game is amazing. The gameplay is unique and interesting. Not a lot of action throughout the story but definitely fun. Its basically like you are playing a main charector in a movie, there is no free will in the game meaning everything is scripted in one way. Since theres is not any choices to be made in the game it makes it hard to stop playing the story because of how hooked you are to the story. I would not pay full prive for this game since there is no replay value, for $15 it was a great buy!			"
