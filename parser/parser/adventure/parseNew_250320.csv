												One of the best story games in Steam. It was so good my friends sat around the computer watching me play it. It was like watching a really good movie except you are playing it. The story is so well done that you cannot help but to be engrossed in it. The visuals are amazing if you like a comic books which I do!! Some games have that cheesy voice acting but this game was top notch. It had just the right amount of everything for everybody. Script, score ... the whole shabang!  INCREDIBLE!! You will be missing out on one fine game if you have not played it.Wicked!!			"

												Update for the full game:After finally following Bigby and Snow White trough all five episodes, i can happily confirm, that Telltale did once again a wonderful job in catching the atmosphere and even more importantly the characters of the comic. You get sucked into the world of Fables, where well known Fable figures have to live in the human world, after escaping their home dimension, and you try as Sherriff Bigby Wolf (aka Big Bad Wolf) to not only solve a series of strange murders but also battle against your inner demons.For fans of the comic it offers a very interesting pre-story to where the series begins and you meet and get to know some characters, which were only shortly in the comics.The graphics style fits the shrill world of Fables and the voice acting is once again nearly without flaw.Gameplay wise it is like the walking dead, more of an interactive movie than a true adventure, but it is done very well. Last but not least the music also fits perfectly.. from the well done intro with Bigby wandering through town up to the whole game, the ""Film Noir"" atmosphere is present everywhere.As in any good of these detecive/Noir stories, it get´s rather dark and the borders between good and evil are easily shifted.

												A mature story that takes place in a noir setting, The Wolf Among Us is a gritty take on various fairytale characters that have somehow escaped into our world and secretly living among us.  You assume the role of Bigby Wolf ""The big bad wolf"".  The first episode of the story has you involved in solving a murder mystery that has the appearance of leading to something much bigger.The game follows the Telltale forumula used with their Walking Dead games.  A narrative-driven story where your decisions have some impact on the outcome of certain story elements.  One significant and welcome change that was added to The Wolf Among Us is that not only do the choices you make impact the outcome, but also WHEN you make some of the choices.  This means that you can be presented with a decision of what order to do things and the order you choose will change how the story flows.  This new feature will add some amount of replayability to the game because of the significant changes in narrative that result from the order of certain decisions.The artwork follows a comic book style similar to Telltale's The Walking Dead games and the music is very well done and sets the tone for the game.  I also liked the feature where you unlock various ""Book of Fables"" entries as you play the game.  These entries will allow you to read more about the lore of the various characters and their backgrounds as they pertain to this story.I really enjoyed playing the first episode of this game and looking forward to what the future episodes will bring!

""You are not as bad as everyone says you are..."" You Are The Big Bad Wolf... At first, I want to say thanks to the developers for creating this amazing game. Telltale Games is a new branch of episodic games with point-and-click system. And, it looks awesome. You, guys, have created a great tale with an exciting plot and vivid characters. I like it. The Wolf Among Us is a video game based on Fables comic book series, created by writer Bill Willingham. Our protagonist is Bigby, a.k.a. The Big Bad Wolf, sheriff of FableTown. He's extremely cunning and resourceful, in addition to being an excellent detective. Telltale Games have created an ideal sheriff moderately strict, but fair. Bigby is a true protector and savior of the city. I admire him. Advantages: + Incredible storyline + Interesting and charming characters + Cinematic gameplay + Strong and memorable protagonist + Beautiful places of the city + Constructive dialogues + Amazing music Disadvantages: - Not found Conclusion: The Wolf Among Us is a fantastic, morally ambiguous detective tale, that exceeds expectations, providing an intriguing and thought-provoking adventure. 10/10. Recommend to all.  "

												Truly an amazing game from start to finish, the entire game is FINALLY released, The story is based on a comic and the game itself is the prequel to a nice graphic novel that you can check out. This game is a graphic novel game with interactive qtes and choices with consequences.Bigsby Wolf who protects the the people of fabletown, protects the border between  fables and mundane, fables are people who are from your fairy tales that has come to live thier lives in new york in a hidden society with spells(glamour) to hide thier real forms from mundanes (normal people), those who cannot afford it, lives an an area called the farm. A murder has happaned and it is up to Bigsby the big bald wolf and snow white to find out the answers, which leads to something much deeper and more sophisticated than this. You'll experience and encounter many characters from your favorite fables as you progress if you want to know more you've got to play the game, anymore would spoil this great story.the game is from telltale with implements of ideas from thier previous titles. There will be qte and choices that will affect the fate of those around you and how your story will progress, it will be a detective story and leaves you wanting more,I really enjoyed it and played multiple times to experience the choices differently. From start the finish the game is SOLID+ flawless voice acting+ story is immersive and leaves you at the edge of your seat at all times+ Replayable choices+ Fantastic art+ The way the story protrays the character from those fables is downright imaginative+  well placed  qte interaction during certain points in the game- Its a graphic novel type of game, some people will not like these types of games, if thats you know what you got yourself into!- Some of the episodes felt a bit slow with choices and less action but thats to tell the story, the best episode is definently 3- Remember not every choices will change every outcome some are set outcome so that the story flows			"

Review finished. Scroll down to see individual episode thoughts and a final conclusion.After Telltale’s breakout success with The Walking Dead, my expectations for whatever they chose to do next were understandably extremely high. Yet in the span of only the first episode, The Wolf Among Us has completely met and surpassed them leaving me stunned and impressed, feverishly awaiting the next installment (of which five are planned).Based on the graphic novel series Fables, The Wolf Among Us is set in a world populated by fairy tale creatures, from Snow White to Red Riding Hood and others I won’t spoil for you. Don’t think for a second that this in any way makes for a childish or overtly fantastical narrative; TWAU is a shockingly gritty, mature, and gripping piece of fiction, held together by exceptional writing and voice work. Also, fear not if you haven’t read the source material (as I haven’t); Telltale did an excellent job of establishing the rich world and lore, and you don’t need any prior knowledge to get a lot out of it.No character falls flat, and the performances that bring them to life are simply remarkable. Not least of them is our lead, Bigsby Wolf (you can probably guess his origin), that shows one of the key areas Telltale has improved upon from previous games. The Walking Dead was Telltale’s first real attempt at providing player choice to shape the narrative, but often it didn’t feel that way, largely relegating you to an onlooker “picking the right answer” than an active participant in what was happening. TWAU changes that by letting you be the character you want to be. You can be the benevolent sheriff or a complete jerk, and it never felt as if I was being pushed toward either path, letting the story unfolded organically as I shaped Wolf to the person I wanted him to be, which makes the thought of what could unfold all the more exciting.Telltale has again gone with a stylized, cel-shaded graphics style which comes even closer to a moving comic than TWD, and the result is stunning. With excellent use of shadows and framing, this is a gorgeous homage to classic film noir (which proves a perfect match for the dark, mystery ridden narrative). The controls are largely unchanged from TWD but have been tightened up considerably and the bugs and glitches that plagued previous games all but eradicated, making this the developer’s most technically sound production yet.The Wolf Among Us is something you absolutely need to play. The first episode is an outstanding display of just what Telltale is capable in terms of storytelling, and if future episodes follow suit this could easily be in the running for my game of the year. The only reason I would recommend waiting is because the wait for more is going to prove unbearable. In the end all I can say is they’ve left me hungry...hungry like the wolf.Episode 2 UpdateIt's difficult to say much about EP2 without spoiling both it and the previous episode, so I will simply say it takes the story in even darker and more controversial areas than before. Telltale has further confirmed my original impression from EP1 that they have a bold vision for where they are taking the season, with numerous shocking and unrestrained moments fleshing out the characters and leaving me breathless in anticipation of EP3. I can only hope it doesn't take another four months to get here.Episode 3 UpdateWhere the first two episodes were used to introduce us to the characters, build the world, and set the plot rolling, EP3 acts as something of a midway point both literally and figuratively. There are few if any reveals or twists on the level of prior episodes, but with how invested I am with the characters and story at this point it didn't matter that I wasn't stunned when the credits began. Each moment to moment, no matter how mundane, held my rapt attention as I eagerly ate up every line of dialog and the innumerable subtleties found in character faces and the environments that bring such depth to the narrative. While it's too early to say with certainty, if the level of quality with the final two episodes continues to increase as rapidly as it has thus far, this may very well be my game of 2014.Episode 4 UpdateAt this point I'm so tightly wound up in what is easily Telltale's biggest masterpiece to date, that it's difficult for me to say anything more about TWAU without sounding like the the rabid fanboy I've become. As the season nears its end and all the lose threads begin to come together, the scope of Telltale's ambition and their ever expanding skill at directing that vision into an astounding experience is showing itself like never before. Even if the final episode falls completely flat, it won't change the fact that TWAU is easily one of the most amazing games to be released this year, and something that you shouldn't be ignoring. I'm going to be sad when it's over, but that doesn't diminish my irrepressible excitement to see how it ends.Episode 5 Update And ConclusionWell, it's finally come to this. After months of pushed back release dates, missed timelines, and what seemed like endless waiting, The Wolf Among Us has finally seen it's last episode and cemented itself as not only the most ambitious and fully realized experience Telltale has ever made, but one of the most brilliant games of the year! EP5 incarnates everything that has been built up during past episodes, with a captivating conclusion that provides a fitting end to all that came before, while leaving room for the series to go in any number of directions with future installments.As a whole, The Wolf Among Us is an enthralling breakthrough for Telltale and videogame storytelling as a whole. The pacing is sublime, the plot thrilling and riddled with intrigue, and the characters among the most well written and voiced I have yet to see in a game. It's shockingly brilliant in every regard and I am truly saddened that it has come to an end, for the sole reason that the wait for season 2 will feel like an eternity.Telltale has succeeded without doubt in creating a fairy tale for a modern age, one that pulls no punches and surprises with each passing moment with the lines they are willing to cross to tell the story they want, and the means they have at their disposal to do so. It's dark, violent, ugly, occasionally appalling, but more than anything an absolutely astounding achievement that should not be overlooked.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												The Wolf Among Us to me is the strongest interactive story Telltalehas put out to date. Yes it is better than the Walking Dead, betterthan their new Game of Thrones (which has a lot of potential). I can't call anything Telltale does a game, because tbh there is notmuch gameplay at all. Its mostly an interactive story. It is more about chosing dialouge options and minimal investigation thanabout ACTUAL gameplay. Which is fine, because I enjoy theirability to tell a good story. Do not be fooled though, the game offers the illusion of choice,The game will end up happening the way it is intended to no matter what you chose. The only thing is you have to choose  whether characters live or die, or if people hate you or not. TheChoices in TWAU are quite good, and more than once you aregiven the choice of more than two options of what to investigateor chose. Which I like. The characters are expertly voiced and acted. The music and entire setting has a real Noir flair to it, which I was instantly inlove with. This game has a fantastic story with an intriuging worldfull of mystery and excellent characters. Bigby Wolf the maincharacter you play is one of my favorite protagonists secondonly to Geralt of Rivia. That being said if you enjoy what Telltale does, this is its bestwork in my opinion. Most people will love Walking Dead moresimply because it is the world that interests them more. If youwant an interesting story with the best characters and a noirishplot and setting, pick this sucker up and enjoy.Here is hoping for The Wolf Among Us Season 2 this year.10/10			"

												The Wolf Among Us took me by surprise. Just when I thought Telltale Games couldn't possibly surpass last year's The Walking Dead here comes The Wolf Among Us which is not only beautifully made (like a comic book in motion), but also well told and orchestrated, intriguing and exciting. This first episode has already won me over. I wonder how they're actually going to 1-up it. It seems almost impossible. Bravo Telltale Games, keep 'em coming!Edit: finished the game when Episode 5 was just released and the game did not disappoint.[Rating: 92/100]			"

												The best interactive movie I've ever watched/played. I mean that in the best way possible. I went in with expectations lukewarm; I didn't want to get my hopes up but I already knew and loved the Fables mythology and was assured by friends that this was ""the one"" to try among Telltale's offerings. If you're a Fables fan, this will indeed offer up something new even if you've read the entire series cover to cover.If you're not a Fables fan, this game may just make you one.			"

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)Following the success of The Walking Dead, TellTale continues their tradition of interactive story based games with The Wolf Among Us.  Based off the Fables graphic novels, the Wolf Among us follows Bigby Wolf the newly reformed big bad wolf and appointed sheriff of Fabletown, a community within New York City that houses a plethora of washed up fable characters.  While enforcing the fabletown laws a series of events plunges Bigby into a murder investigation that involves the entire fable community where everyone is a suspect.The interplay between the various characters is handled well with witty banter and humorous responses that take advantage of the history behind every citizen.  Compared to the Walking Dead, the story moves along at a brisk pace with significantly less time spent in conversation hub areas requiring you to exhaust every option of interaction before being allowed to progress forward.  The fantastic story is also strengthened by the clean comic book style of 1986 new york with a solid soundtrack complimenting Bigby's search for the truth.There are occasional fighting sequences similar to Heavy Rain where Quick time events have to be completed lest Bigby take's a pounding that can have an effect on later events.  Decisions you make also feel like they have more impact on the narrative than TellTale's other titles as it does a better job of masking the transparency of keeping you to the critical path of the story.  Having a strong central objective and antagonist also makes each episode feel more cohesive than the Walking Dead.Voice acting is top notch as every snarky remark and desperate confession carries appropriate weight. Facial animations are much stronger than the Walking Dead with less rogue eyebrow movements and a stronger emphasis on subtlety.  The contrast between the idealized “happily ever after” fables and the miserable lives they're now living as supernatural beings with real world problems creates a truly engaging story.  There's something special about seeing characters like Beauty and the Beast having marital problems after a few hundred years and needing help to pay rent to maintain any grasp on the lives they once had.  While fables are generally told as children's stories they tend to be inherently dark and primal, the wolf among us isn't afraid to push further into the grit of old fables as adult themes, language and violence are common place.Dialogue options are pretty satisfactory, there were only a few times I wasn't able to respond in a manner I felt would've been appropriate and piecing together evidence in a crime scene rewards the player by making relevant connections in dialogue afterward.  Each episode is generally around 2 hours in length and worth the price of admission.The Wolf Among Us offers a much stronger interactive experience than the first season of the Walking Dead with a captivating story, engrossing characters and a much needed fix on pacing.  Bigby's investigation has plenty of twists and turns to keep players engaged in the on-goings of Fabletown with an original premise and a morally gray protagonist that allows every interaction regardless of how violent or generous to feel natural.  While it allows you tackle objectives in different ways from time to time, the story remains pretty linear without any true divergences occurring.  The overall outcomes are going to be similar regardless of what path you choose.  Still, changing the details, and Fabletown's perception of Bigby has it's own reward.  Anyone who's looking for a great story with action, humor, compassion, a talking pig and mystery should give the Wolf Among Us a try.Don't feel like reading all of this? Here's a video version:

Superb example of Telltale's storytellingI have to admit: I was late in discovering Telltale's particular style of developing adventure games. My first real experience with any of their recent games was last summer, when I played and enjoyed the first seasdon of their vision on The Walking Dead. For the many gamers who've played either of these titles, the format of The Wolf Among Us will come as no surprise: it's an episodic adventure game based on a comics book-series. But the setting is rather different: in The Walking Dead people, be it good or bad ones, are set agaist the onslaught of a catastrophical zombie-apocalypse, which makes the player sympathize a lot (in my case anyway) with one or more of the people. The Wolf Among Us is based on the Fables comic books, a modern-day twist on several figures out of children's stories or legends who were driven from their homelands and turned to live in New York, helped by some magic called ""glamours"" that makes them appear in a human form.This setting may look like less ""dangerous"" at the first sight, but that's actually far from the truth. What starts out as a mature version of a story using some well-known fable characters (The Bid Bad Wolf aka The Sheriff is the you one play with), rather quickly turns into a grim, gritty adventure where nothing is what it seems and dangers looms large around every corner. Fabletown turns out not to be the safe-heaven everybody hopes for, but a harsh place in the middle of a rather coldish city dominated by the impersonal lights of neon-advertisements. Just like in The Walking Dead, actual gameplay is restricted to watching cutscenes (all of them very compellingly done) and interacting with other fables and objects. There is hardly any inventory to speak of and no puzzles: the main thing to do is to react to what is being said or happens. For this several options are given, and most of the time you have to choose your reaction within a limited timespan. This is so meticiouly done, that some decisions can be taken at leisure, while others need to be done in a split-second (just like in real life, probably).Gameplay-wise, the one real difference compared to other Telltale-games lies in the amount of quick action-scenes. In these, players have to react quickly by pushing an indicated button on the gamepad (which I do recommend highly for this type of games). There are quite of lot of these ""events""', maybe too many to some's likings, but for me they felt perfectly integrated. This is an action-filled world after-all, where violence seems to be omnipresent. As such, this game is definitely not for children: the violence can be very brutal and up-close.As an example of how an original story can be interactively told in a game, The Wolf Among Us succeeds magnificently. I did not feel the same amount of emotional interaction as in The Walking Dead, but the sheer tension and the detective-like feeling more than made up for that. This is another triumph for one of the best game developers currently active.Gameplay: 27/30Graphics: 17/20 (Telltale's engine is very well suited to the film noir-feeling this game has)Sound: 10/10 (the sound-effects and especially the music are top-notch and help so much to give the right atmosphere)Technical/stability: 10/10 (smooth and stable to perfection)Replayability: 5/10 (when paying good attention, there is no need for a second play-through, but that's perfectly normal)Steam integration: 9/10 (no trading cards but in true Telltale-tradition a bunch of achievements that unlock as you progress, making it an easy-to-get 100% game)Personal appreciation: 9/10Overall score: 87/100.Wonderful game!

												No idea where to start with reviewing this game, so many positive things about it and very few negatives.I have been thinking about purchasing this game for a while now, being unsure if I would like it due to the fact that I disliked ""The Walking Dead"" games. Eventually, I made up my mind and purchased this game over the weekend and I do NOT regret purchasing it at all. Not played a GREAT game in years... Any of ""The Walking Dead Game"" fans out there will love this game since it follows the same style and it is made by the same developers I believe.The Story was extremely interesting along with engaging, leaving you wanting more at the end of each episode due to the excellent Cliffhangers. It is a story that makes you think, even when you turn off the game and go on another game you are left thinking about it, because it is one of those games that has such an impacting and interesting story. All of the Characters were unique in their own way, there were those who you liked and there were those who you absolutely hated. Another thing I loved about this game was the amount of choices you got. If you disliked someone you could chose to act like a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them or beat the living crap out of them which is always satisfying. Unlike ""The Walking Dead"" where you aren't really fearing anyone, ""The Wolf Among Us"" has it so pretty much nearly EVERYONE fears you which I loved.As for how the game looks, the game looks very unique and is rather cartoony/sketchy which I enjoyed very much, it gave the game a very unique look to it along with the type of colours that were used within it. The game runs very smoothly as well and I did not have any problems with it on my Computer.As for replay value, I did go back and replay some Episodes in order to get 100% Achievements and I feel like playing through the game again but this time, acting like a jerk or choosing different routes, choosing who to beat up and who to trust etc.The only thing I disliked about this game was that it was pretty short. There are FIVE episodes and all of them are roughly 1 Hour 30 Minutes long so I managed to complete it in roughly 6-7 hours with 100% Achievements. Hopefully if there is a Season 2 then there will be more to come (I do believe a Season 2 is being made).Overall it is just one of those games that you can't get enough of, I DO recommend buying it.

												Telltale just cant go wrong with games !!! You think they already gave the best with The Walking Dead when BAM comes another masterpiece. This is such a fantastic game that not only takes you back to your childhood tales but the way they portrayed the dark sides of them fairy tale characters is beyond belief.All in all a must play game as usual !!

												Edit: Episode 3 is dramatic, climatic and excellent improvment form the seemingly rushed EP2. Episode 3 now seems to focus more on time, where to go first. Playing as Bigby gets more immersive due to the higher amount of more action, choices and of course, as ruined in the art, the wolf form. While only appearing once it really does show the image of Bigby letting go. So much so I went back and replayed that final scene 2 times to reach a consensus on the ending. Though only on its first episode, I think this will turn out to be a great game/episodes/series/whatever. The games has a very intriguing story which comes from a series of comic books, the characters are well written especially Toad. The art style is the same comic book feel as Telltale's other series/things The Walking dead. One thing that is really intresting comes with that there is no moral compas character like Clementime, which leaves all descisions to be almost made without direction. This game will be just as good as TWD and I hope people play this.			"

												(I am not familiar with the Fables comics source material, however no such familiarity is at all required to enjoy the game)The 98% positive user reviews are probably good enough already, but just in case:If you liked The Walking Dead, you'll probably like this.If you like the X-Men character Wolverine, you'll probably like the main character, as they have many similarities.If you like the idea of classic fairy tales being ""reimagined"" in a dark metropolitan setting, you'll probably like this.The art style is great. I don't think the screenshots and trailers fully do it justice. Although the color inversion shadowing looks a very strange at times.If you can't stand (fairly extreme) violence and/or swearing, you might want to pass on it. Though if you tolerated The Walking Dead on this point, you'll be fine.A few other considerations:The choice making in this game seems even less consequential than in The Walking Dead. This doesn't particularly bother me, but if you're expecting a branching story line, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.I think there were more QTEs (Quick Time Events) than in The Walking Dead. This doesn't bother much either. I see it as a way to make the game feel more interactive and keep the user engaged and paying attention. Works well enough for me. I'm not expecting a deep gameplay challenge with a title like this.Basically every main character is flawed somehow. Defiling your memory of beloved story book characters is part of the point here. You might not end up truly liking any of the characters. On the other hand, you might get a validatory kick out of seeing their utopias broken.			"

												New York City in the 1980s was a miserable place, and from the first few moments of The Wolf Among Us you can feel it. Even worse than the sticky heat of the city is the plight of the Fables, famous characters that appear in stories like Snow White or The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, exiled from their Homeland and forced to live among human ""mundies"". Placing storybook characters in a modern city is a neat enough premise, but it's the simple and elegant investigative storytelling that makes the five-part series a joy to explore.It's up to you playing as Bigby Wolf to keep the Fables from being discovered, and to keep them from hurting themselves too much. The former Big Bad Wolf, Sherriff Bigby embodies the noir detective with a dark past and a heart of gold, but his character fortunately never strays too far into hard-boiled cliche. Well, he does drink quite a bit, and smokes cigarettes constantly, true to type but he's got one of the Three Pigs sleeping at his apartment, which isn't. And when the pig calls Bigby out on his lone wolf demeanor, it's extremely apt.The Wolf Among Us is a highly cinematic point-and-click adventure that consists mostly of interactive cutscenes. When you interrogate people, you have a limited time to choose between 3 dialogue options; if you let the time run out, you stay silent and let the other character continue talking. How you go about examining crime scenes and how you treat other characters effects how the story plays out. If you threaten a character, they will remember it and treat you differently next time they see you. Sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure book.Even if you use a controller, your interface is a cursor that moves around the screen and lets you interact with people and objects, examine clues, and fight. Like everything else, the combat is cinematic. Tap a certain button or click an object in time and watch the cutscene, or get your face knocked in. At first glance, the graphics for The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us are almost identical, but this is actually where the two games start to differentiate themselves. Telltale's The Walking Dead seems to have drawn more inspiration from the show than the comic. The slightly softer shading and muted tones make it the more 'realistic' looking of the two; while The Wolf Among Us has much heavier cel shading and highly saturated colors that make it look like a hand-drawn comic. This isn't to say that the graphics are anything short of amazing- they really capture the gritty comic book atmosphere without being overly cartoony- it looks like a living, breathing comic book. Speaking as someone who normally hates motion comics, Telltale has set a new standard for comic book adaptations.If you're not a big reader, you won't need you to run out and read every issue of Fables you can get your hands on before playing Wolf Among Us- they make it as user friendly as possible. For the uninitiated, Telltale has included the Book of Fables- every time you come across a new character or concept, an entry is added in the Book of Fables that fills you in on their backstory in the Fables universe. Wolf Among Us has Bill Willingham's seal of approval on it to be part of the Fable's Universe. So if you're already an avid reader, there you go.For all the Fables fans, there's obviously a lot of familiar territory here. 'Faith' is similar to the very first Fables arc where Bigby Wolf and Snow White solve Rose Red's murder- a great hard-boiled detective story where they piece together clues and interrogate fantastic characters in order to get to the bottom of a grisly mystery. Keep in mind that The Wolf Among Us takes place twenty years before the first Fables story, so all of our key players are a little rough around the edges. Snow White is only Ichabod Crane's assistant, and she isn't sure if she's cut out to be a public servant. Depending on the choices you make as Bigby, you can be gruff-but-well-meaning, or you can smash and intimidate your way through your leads, not caring where the collateral damage leads you.As I always do with multiple choice games, I had to do two run-throughs where I take opposing paths. Each episode takes about 2-3 hours to run through, but once you take your first bite into the story, you're hooked. Episodes of The Wolf Among Us end with a 'to be continued' trailer just like The Walking Dead, and I can already see how both of my save files are playing out differently- it was like I was watching two completely different trailers. Telltale has perfected their episodic formula.There's a lot in The Wolf Among Us for Fables fans to get excited about. And if you're new to the series, it's just as good an introduction as reading the first tradeback. I enjoyed the game so much that I did two run-throughs one after another. Either way, play The Wolf Among Us. You won't regret it.			"

The decisions you are going to make are actually bringing consequences in the further game process they also will effect the relationship to other characters in Fabletown. The atmosphere is pretty thrilling and oppressive probably because of this awesome design choosen by the developers. The gameplay mechanic are not revolutionary but good implemented. To be honest I wouldn't call it a game more a interactive movie and this in a positive way. I definitely recommending this gaming experience!			"

												The best Telltale Games title by far. The Wolf Among Us has a story that rivals that of almost all games ever made. I truly enjoy Telltale, so this game is the epitome of that love. The beautiful thing about this game is it is based on a comic book series almost nobody has heard of, therefore they can make this story with characters we will recognize (fairy-tale characters) and have them become gritty and dark and have an enthralling story you won't want to have end. I would literally jump up and down screaming if they announced a sequel to this game. If you play one game from Telltale, then play this one and you will want to play every game they make. A true masterpiece in story-telling. Masterpiece.			"

												I bought this on sale only because of the praise it received in the trusted media and amongst my colleagues. Since I did not enjoy the previous telltale games too much, it took quite a while until I installed and played season 1. I liked the first episode, made my peace with quick time events and was generally very fond of the visual aestethics and the cinematic sequences. My second session with the game then completely sucked me into this universe and I played through episodes 2-5 in one sitting. The game has the perfect tone, writing, pacing and mix of interaction and story. I am not feeling that my decisions have that much impact on the general story though.Still waiting for something really bad and unpleasant happening because of one of my choices.You should definitely buy this and spend 3h to play the first 2 episodes, it will be money and time very well spent and you will most probably finish season one very soon. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this kind of game and I will consider Telltale's product on release date now "

												The Wolf Among Us is a story focused quick time event / point and click game, and is by far the best game i've played from Telltale until now.  Story / Setting  This is clearly the best thing with that game, it's probably the most original setting I've seen in a game ever. Without spoiling, it's some kind of mix between Harry Potter, fairy tails, and a film noir. I found the story amazing, and I'm glad I bought the game late enough to play all episodes in a row at once ! (I finished the game in barely 3 days).   Gameplay  The gameplay is the exact same as the other Telltale games I had played (TWD S1&2). It just worked a bit better here, since this game is more based on investigation than TWD, and it really fits with the point and click aspect. The combats, dialogues, and investigation are still great, but once again, the choices you have to make don't have a real inpact on the story... whatever you choose, the main story elements will stay the same.  Performance  Runs ok on my 4 yo laptop, even on high settings.   Style / Graphics  Once again, it's the exact same thing as what I was used before with the developer. I love it, it looks like an interactive comic or something.  Really one of the best single player game I've played, and the best narrative one for sure. I just hope Telltale starts focusing more on the player choices / story evolution, and does some more original games like it, and less series / video game adaptations.			"

												First of all, I have to say that this is the one and only game that should win the following Steam Award: ""BEST USE OF A FARM ANIMAL""   Review on: The Wolf Among Us is a Telltale adventure game based on Fables, a series of comic books that create a universe where characters of traditional ""fables"", hence the name, live ""among us"" (hence  the other  name).The universe itself is not as childish as those tales, though, and that's something Telltale wants you to know from the very beginning. Fortunately, it falls not within the adulthood of God of War 2 and 3 but instead, closer to his older brother The Walking Dead.Even if I consider, plot and structurewise, The Walking Dead to be a superior game, with The Wolf Among Us Telltale delivered another great gem which, while similar in many aspects to TWD, still manages to have strengths of his own.The argument itself is Sherlock Holmes-esque, toned down to match the Fables universe, which I think is one of its biggest virtues. I was  amazed  by the way the game introduces and develops a bunch of characters taken out of fairy tales and accomplishes to keep a balance between the divergence and characterization of those characters with respect to their analogues in the traditional fables.Those characters are now living in the slums of New York city, and have been beaten by life itself. They are not shown as they  truly  are to us muggles, as that would lead to conflict. They are people with life and social problems, allowing us to easily empathize with them.Gameplaywise, do not expect any more than a... Well, than a Telltale game. Which mainly consists in dialogue choosing and some quicktime events.I did appreciate that they polished the movearound moments of The Walking Dead (Lee having to cross the farm, quite a few minutes to get from point A to point B), but that's all there is to it. Same mechanics, same graphic engine...BUT, you can surely expect a game that  makes you think . And I'm not talking about the plot. Which is a rather good thing, and I can't but recommend this game to you all. (Various edits to format)  "

Do you like comics? Do you like a good story and gameplay? Do you enjoy great acting?Well good. You chose right, then.I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm not a fan of The Walking Dead. I hate it. Zombies just are not interesting, nor are the characters in it. This is absolutely not TWD, but something that can be enjoyed by a simple lover of the cinema. One of the genius things that Telltale seems to do with these games is create a beautiful, full movie that you can interact with, with generally minimalistic animation. They tend to not even use mocap, as far as I know. But, somehow, they can create fully realized characters on your screen.Playing as Bigby Wolf in this film-noire-esque game was an absolute delight. You could choose to live up to the name ""The Big Bad Wolf,"" or toss it out the window and prove that you're ""not as bad as everyone says you are.""GraphicsThe first thing you'll notice going into this game is the ""cell-shaded"" models and hard-outlined background and textures.  This design choice serves to put you into the genre. The story of ""The Wolf Among Us"" is a prequel to the comic book series ""Fables"" by author Bill Whittingham. Even if - especially if - you've not read Fables, this game is still a wonderful ride. Any lover of the graphic novel medium will be sure to appreciate the art and design direction, and the wonderfully crafted comic-book characters. Bigby Wolf can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sure, and he tends to do so, but he can also be a tender sweetheart, just following what he thinks is right. I'm also not ashamed to admit I chose whatever option would please Snow. What can I say? I'm a hopeless romatic. Anyway, if you're a fan of comics, you're a fan of The Wolf Among Us.Gameplay and ChoicesYou may have heard that this game, and other Telltale Games, use QTEs (Quicktime Events) to put you into the action. While the usage of QTEs can upset most people, because it seems like a needless difficulty meter for a game that doesn't need it; I truly appreciated the use of QTEs in TWAU (The Wolf Among Us). The Quicktime Events were NOT overused, nor were they needlessly difficult. I felt as though they DID put me further into the story - which, by the way, was wonderful. The rest of the gameplay is based on making, generally, one of four choices, each with it's own tone and consequences to your relationships with the characters: Your choices DO matter, though not always in the way you expect. You will often be presented with two or three very clearly important choices, and those have immediate consequences. Sometimes, it may result in the death of another, or the hatred of a friend. Your choices put you further into the role of Bigby Wolf.ActingThe acting in this game is oddly phenomenal. As an actor myself, and simply as a person who observes things, you can tell within the first few minutes that each character has a personality both vocally and visually. They move differently, speak differently, and express differently. Bigby Wolf and Snow White, being the most notable ones, have great voice actors and facial expressions as you progress through the increasingly dramatic twists and turns. I highly recommend you see for youself.StoryThe story of TWAU is set before the story of the Fables comic series. The Adversary, a villain with only a name, has driven the Fables out of the Homeland and in the world of the mundanes, or normal people. They create a town, funded by a murderer, and attempt to make sense of their new lives in the mundane world. Fabletown is set in New York, and takes on a film noir style tone and setting. The law in the town is in disarray - people who need help aren't getting it, and people who get it aren't needing it. With Assistant Deputy Snow White, and Sherrif Bigby Wolf being the only truly active members of the city, not much gets done, and its citizens are growing ever in debt. Fables have to keep up a magic spell, known as a glamour, to remain to be seen as human (those who don't look human already, that is). Those who can't afford a glamour are sent to the farm, where the animal-like Fables see it as a prison, and the humans see it as a vacation home. With the increasing conflict between Fables classes, money issues, and lawmaking, it's not wonder that a single spark can set the entire feigned peace of the town ablaze. Take control of the story, and make it your own, as The Big Bad Wolf.ConclusionOverall, this game was a masterpiece. Sure, it wasn't an original IP, as are most Telltale Games, but it was a worthy expansion to the Fables universe and a wonderful standalone story. I sincerely hope you consider buying and playing this game, and I hope Telltale creates a Season Two. Now, if you excuse me, I'll be purchasing the new Wolf Among Us graphic novels and single-issue comics, as well as reading the entirety of ""Fables"" and ""Fairest!""  10/10. Peace. "

												I had been holding out playing this game until the final chapter was released yesterday. The game style is very much like the Walking Dead series. Five chapters, and your choices help build a unique story.Although the game style is the same as Walking Dead, there are a few differences. There certainly isn't many, if any at all, puzzles in The Wolf Among Us. It all seems to be very dialog based, which isn't a bad thing!I found it a very enjoyable play through, you could sit back with a glass of wine and watch it like a film. The QTE that popup when you least expect them keep you quick on your feet as well.I won't go too much into the story as I wouldn't want to spoil the plot, but it keeps you on edge the whole time, keeps you guessing as to what comes next. Thoroughly enjoyed it.			"

 Overview  The Wolf Among Us is another Telltale adventure game, much akin to those we’re all familiar with. In this installment you play as Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of what has become Fabletown, a dilapidated section of modern day Manhattan where crime runs rampant and morality is often checked at the door. Taking place in and around the 1980s, Fabletown became a makeshift refuge for fairytale folk who were looking to escape the totalitarian grip of The Adversary that controlled their native land known as The Homeland. In The Wolf Among Us you’ll be greeted with many of the same fairytale residents you’ve grown to know over the years, but with a sinister twist. Gone are the days of rescued princesses and noble knights, as Fabletown is nothing that it seems to be; a heaven gone sour, cold and unwelcoming.While it is difficult to go into detail of the plot without giving away spoilers to the story, but as Sheriff Wolf, you’re duty is to protect those of Fabletown and to make sure they blend in with regular citizens with the use of “glamors”, magic potions that transform them into everyday people. When a murder occurs in Fabletown, you’re thrown into a world of slumlords and criminals, where everyone seems to have an ulterior motive and a secret to hide. Similar to previous installments of Telltale’s adventure games, you’ll find yourself making the usual rounds of questioning to advance the plot, but this time in the role of an investigator. You can approach each situation as the role of “good cop or bad cop” or a mixture of the two as you see fit. Often times I found myself picking what I felt best and then really wishing I could go back after seeing the fallout of a bad decision, especially when you’re blind-sided by a poor choice in episode one and it doesn’t come back to haunt you until several hours later.That, overall, is what I loved about The Wolf Among Us; the decisions you make, whether good or bad, leave an everlasting feeling in your playthrough. For example, towards the beginning of the game I made a rash decision to physically harm a character because I thought he was “just being a jerk”, ultimately regretting it hours later when I learned more of that particular character’s backstory; I felt guilty. It’s that depth and emotional connection that made the game hard to let go; I often felt bad for these fictional characters, felt sympathy and remorse, or distain for those that wronged them. The story gripped me from the very beginning and never let go and when it was over, I wished there was more.There’s so much to this game that cannot be said for fear of spoilers, but know that there are so many layers to it. The characters are rich and vibrant, the locations are simple, yet hold so many references and the story is enthralling. It’s a rollercoaster from the beginning to the end and the ending will keep you thinking long after the credits finished rolling. Pros   The story – It grabs you and never lets go. The plot twists will keep you guessing. Voice acting – Simply excellent.  Cons   None.Overall, The Wolf Among Us stands, in my opinion, as one of Telltale’s best adventure games to date. I found it equally engaging and difficult to put down. If you haven’t played it, or have been curious about it, I cannot recommend it enough. The Wolf Among Us isn’t something any fan of the genre should pass up.			"

												Great music and graphics, this is a very impressive story game.  The game-play is similar to The Walking Dead - mostly story with the odd QTE.  There isn’t much to do, really, and the focus is very much on watching the story unfold. Of course you influence the story, but at the moment it's difficult to say by how much. Only the first of five episodes has been released. I’m not sure that releasing a game in small sections is a good idea. Well, it might be for the game producers, but the first section is really short - only a few hours of play, which really is a little disappointing. In future I might consider waiting to buy games like this when all the sections have been released. Recommended? Yes, most certainly! But you might like to wait until more episodes have been released.			"

												I didn't know how great this game was, till I had a friend gift it to me. At first, I didn't know if I would find this to be my kind of story but that instantly dissolved away after I finished the first episode. It feels like I really missed out on a great story this whole time because of the title. Not really a big werewolf fan but learning that this game has other magical/fairytale characters, I was hooked right away. The imagery is beautiful and well done. The music is haunting, relaxing, and captivating. This is definitely a game that no one could ever forget or simply put down.			"

												Not everyone will like The Wolf Among Us. If you appreciate good art, immersive soundtrack, and a story-based game that you have some (but not much) impact, sort of like a graphic novel that comes partially to life, you will enjoy. One bone I have to pick is how easy the game was. There were no puzzles, and it is nearly impossible to die. Again, this is more of a graphic novel that's voice-acted. It's done very well; no doubt a lot of work and dedication was put into this game. Another area of contention is the characters: fortunately the main character was interesting, but quite a few weren't. At times I found myself uninterested, but the really good art and music kept me going through these parts to a rather satisfying climax. I can see how people can be upset with the actual ending, but that does not justify missing out entirely on this experience.			"

												As my second Telltale game i'm really suprised by how well The Wolf Among us is put together. The characters are really interesting and because most of the chartacters represent a fable they have a huge background story. The game kinda has a unclear start, but slowly everything became clear and got more and more interesting. I feel the choices you make in this game matter more than in any other Telltale Game, Especially since people who dont like you anymore may have  usefull information for your investigation. My previous and first Telltale game was Tales from The Borderlands, wich has alot of humor so jumping into The Wolf Among Us was a bit different because of the whole serious and detective vibe.The sound in this game is wonderfull aswell as the great voice-acting and dialogue choices.Despite all the great things this game has to offer a few of the cons i've come accros are things like, a few bad animations and the game having a really slow start. It takes a while before the game sucks you up and gets you interested, but overall i really enjoyed this game. The story is great, The characters are done really well and the whole fable theme made it even better for me. I would recommend this game to anyone who appreciates a great story, with great choices to make and a fantasy detective/dark theme.			"

 The Wolf Among Us  is a wonderfully crafted story about Bigby Wolf and his journey to solve the murders going on in Fabletown. Through his journey he comes across all sorts of interesting characters and familiar fables we've known as children and through his choices can effect the future of each of these characters and how they treat you in the end. Pros: + Excellent storytelling+ Interesting characters+ Wonderful dark setting+ Satisfying length+ Good humor when the game calls for it.+ Amazing protagonist Cons: - Small bug that breaks cutscenes and will bring up the choices and they will all say  ""This choice is blank!""  but is easily fixed by just going to the main menu and rewinding that part of the episode.- There is quite the selections of choices to make and things to discover but most won't really effect the overall outcome of the story. 9.5/10 The Wolf Among Us is an amazing experience and is worth a spot in your library, I could say more but  these lips are sealed.

												I wanted to write a review long time ago but I also wanted to see whether or not Telltale Games could deliver all the way before doing so. The final episode is out now and it's time to review the whole package. You're playing as the Big Bad Wolf. You are the sheriff of Fabletown and you have sworn to protect the city and the Mundane people (normal humans citizens) from the Fables. You have to make sure Fables wear glamour (basically a disguise) to make them look human.You are investigating a series of murders throughout the five episodes and it gets more and more interesting along the way. You meet a lot of famous Fables during the episodes like Bloody Mary, Beauty and Beast and the crooked man. There is many more as well and in the main menu you can read up on some backstory, which is really helpful if you're new into the fables and the characters. Even if you haven't read Bill Willingham's comic book series, called Fables, you will still understand the story. However it's certainly good if you have some knowledge of Fables like Big Bad Wolf before going into this. The story about the Big Bad Wolf, the red riding hood and the three little pigs is a common tale at least here in Sweden.Telltale have changed the quicktime events around from The Walking Dead and added some new features. The Wolf Amoung Us is nothing like the Walking Dead except for the fact that it is a point and click game. It tells a more gritty and dark story then the walking dead and the graphic style is different. It's different in a good way.The Wolf Among Us have a fairly cheap price tag for quite many hours of enjoyment. The voice acting is really good and so is the look and the feel of the game. A very solid game that I would recommend to anyone that's looking for a great story and for fans of point and click games in general.			"

												Alright, Episode Two has gone live and having played through it twice, I'm ready to edit the review. Will definitely continue to update the review until I feel like I finally have enough to have a bigger picture of the whole game.In light of Episode Two's release, I am willing to upgrade my review to a recommendation, but only just barely. The release was delayed for a much greater amount of time than most players had anticipated (about four months), and all of the admittedly minor problems of the previous episode and the more pressing problems of the game's episodic structure as a whole still stand.Episode Two is just about as short as the first episode (around an hour and a half average), and this is furthered by the fact that it lacks many of the features that the first brought to the table. There is no story branching to be found here, no particularly challenging puzzles, and very few QTE-driven action sequences. While this may seem like negative criticism, it really does actually help to drive home the focus on the game's story, which very much starts to heat up here.The episodic structure of the game is still a mark against it, especially considering that now Telltale have not only released development of this game alongside The Walking Dead 2, but have begun work on two completely new games based on the Borderlands and Game of Thrones IPs. It feels like they may have bitten off a bit more than they can chew, and it shows at points in the game. Some scenes for example that you may have seen at the end of the first episode's preview section will turn up in the second, though even though the dialogue will be the same, the location of the scene will be completely different.All in all the game is a very good dialogue-based Adventure game, albeit one with a rather questionable development model. It is worth picking up, but if you can borrow it off your friends or play it off someone else's box, that would probably be the better choice. Logically speaking, it would still be best to wait until the full game is released, but I do feel that there should be enough here to justify a purchase, even if only just so. My issues with the game's release model and its developers do not detract from the fact that this game is defintely worth playing, whether or not it is worth actually buying.			"

												 OK, i just want to mention that the time played is wrong. This total includes at least 3-5hrs. of pausing to make coffee, watch the news ect. The Achievements are all straight forward & story related, except for a few that require very short re-plays of certain parts of the story. Also i'll try to avoid any spoilers to a pretty good storyline.  As for the game itself, it was very good, but not great. 7/10. The playstyle is like The Walking Dead Episodes, with the player following a story & making verbal choices that can effect the plot, & also effect the way characters in the story treat/view you. The action scenes are done with QTE's, & there are also some investigation scenes where you interact with the environment, looking for clues. The story was good, i enjoyed being the Big Bad Wolf & even cared (slightly) about some of the characters by the time the final chapters rolled around. It's a bit mature for 12yr olds & they probably wouldn't understand most of it anyway. To finish, i'd for sure recommend this game. If you want a good story, & a not too frantic game-play style, it's probably just short of being up with the best. A very above average game.			"

												This is the first game by Telltale that I've played, and I was generally pretty impressed. First of all, the setting and characters are really well developed. It takes characters from many popular fairy tales and various fables, and it puts them in a gritty noir setting. Former princes and princesses now have to make ends meet by working crappy jobs and always being behind on their rent, whilst non-human characters are forced to blend in with the crowd by needing to apply an expensive magical potion on themselves regularly, and things of that nature. The main plot revolves around a series of murders that we have to solve whilst taking the role of Bigby Wolf (aka Big Bad Wolf), who has been appointed as the Sheriff of Fabletown, a part of NYC where fairy tale characters live. The plot is gripping, with lots of tense moments, plot twists, as well as choice and consequence.Regarding choices, after I completed the game, I went online to look up how impactful the choices are. Unfortunately most choices don't bear big consequences and for the most part only change a few lines of dialogue or alter the cutscene slightly, but there are a few big decisions peppered around in each of the 5 episodes that comprise this game. So in essence, it's more like an interactive novel with a linear story and only a few differences in the plot based on the choices. Fates of most characters will remain the same regardless of what you choose really.The action scenes usually consist of quick time events where you have to punch, dodge, or perform some sort of quick action. If you really despise QTEs, the game might not be for you, although most QTEs aren't so bad and can be quite forgiving. I missed a few QTE prompts during cutscenes and still managed not to get any game overs.The game has an excellent presentation. Beautiful art style, lovely voice acting, nice music, and well-crafted cutscenes and dialogue. Overall, highly enjoyable. I'd recommend it.			"

												What is there to say about The Wolf Among Us? Should I say it's enchanting? Is it magical? Is it mysterious? To all those questions I would say: yes, it is. But it's so much more than that.Once Upon a TimeThe Wolf Among Us tells the story of Bigby Wolf, once the big bad wolf from fables long lost in history and now the Sheriff of Fabletown, a group of (dis)enfranchised fables from all sorts of folklores and fairy tales (like up to Norse mythology and horror stories). The stories that go across Fabletown are not of the 'happily ever after' form, though. Many fables are either in debt, or crossed the wrong shady figures. The ones that do well are either blind and ignorant for the lower fables' troubles, or have their own separate shady agendas. There Lived a WolfIn this small community hidden in New York by a magical barrier and the use of 'glamours' (magic used to change one's identity into someone else in terms of appearance), Bigby must solve a crime that will soon make his mind churn like never before. You will have to make decisions that leave you unsettled or thinking for a long time. You might make choices you come to regret later. All in Telltale's fashion of their amazing episodic stories of course.Who Ruled The LandFrom slapping people, to doing a bit more than slapping, or choosing to intimidate people by wrecking in general or to make them see reason by being reasonable, everything will have an effect in the end.Will you be a bad wolf and strike fear into the heart of Fabletown? Or will you come to terms with your past and become the protector of Fabletown, being loved by the community? The choice is yours, so make it count.Want to have a general impression in terms of actual gameplay of The Wolf Among Us before you buy it? Or do you want to watch a full playthrough of the game to see different choices, outcomes and reactions to them?Check out a full playlist I did with my partner Wessel on our YouTube channel for Otter & Weasel:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLezRH4vOzOnj-Di3LHjbevoba04A_ea2J "

												If you liked Season One of The Walking Dead from Telltale Games, you should like this too.  I don't think it's quite as good as that, but it's still a fun and engrossing story.  Filled with great characters and memorable set pieces, I definitely give this a thumbs up.But it seems there are a million reviews all stating how great the story is an everything, so I'm going to nitpick a few things that will hopefully prove more informative.I  would call this a choose your own adventure game opposed to a point and click game.  You basically enjoy the story and make decisions along the way.  Each chapter has one or two ""action"" set pieces that consist of QTEs that I'm not even sure if you can fail.  The decisions are important though.  Some are clearly favored to one perspective while others are more ambiguous as to their outcome.  Yet others are just ""eff you, I'm the Big Bad Wolf.""  Some decisions will lock you out of entire areas to investigate.  There is an inventory, yet it's pointless, you never have to combine items or use the right item on the right background object.  There really aren't any puzzles to solve.  So like I said, it's more a book than a game, even though it's a damn fine one at that.I also didn't feel like the story lived up to the conclusion of the first episode.  The rest of the episodes are good, but they never reach that ""holy s--t!!"" moment at the end of the episode one.  The season does end with a rather spectacular action sequence, but then the ensuing conversations and final decision kind of drag on, losing that intensity.But again, just nitpicking.  You should definitely check it out for yourself.			"

PrefaceSo, you fancy playing a game with:a good story?likable characters?possibilities to play the hero your way?the feeling of gambling a bit and solving easy riddles?Then keep reading.StoryI've only finished episode 3 yet (out of 5; lucky for you, I can't spoil the end :)), but I didn't have to go this far to say, the game got me hooked in from the beginning. And no, not because I pretend to be a wolf myself too. And you may say it would be boring to play the detective when we see enough of that on TV. But eventually you want to know everything about the bad guys that hurt you, and you have the company of nice female characters who help you with your investigation and whom you can befriend. Gotta say, the latter kept me liking the game even more. :)The story combines the world of fables with the all the good and bad things of the real world in an interesting way, I'm really I'm impressed, especially after finding out I could be the Big Bad Wolf, and I would meet Snow White, Beauty, Little Mermaid, The Woodsman, and other interesting characters.Character developmentYes, you can influence the game a lot, how you treat others and how they'll treat you, your actions will have an effect over the continuation of the story. Obviously, that system cannot be perfect, otherwise the number of possible outcomes would lead to a combinatorical explosion. But luckily they put in just enough choices and consquences that will keep the game interesting.Because you usually have 4 choices to pick from, the game feels like the quiz show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" but without the aids and I think you'll lose more money than you started with. :) Nevertheless, I like that sometimes I  have to think about what to do next.GraphicsThe worst part of the game to be honest, but it would be very bad to judge a game just by its graphics. After all, in the end what matters is if you enjoyed it or not. And at least, less powerful computers can cope with the game. To describe it in short, the foreground objects and people have detailed graphics, while the backgrounds are mostly dull and boring. This cartoonish appearance is still good enough for my taste, although I can understand some people just won't like it no matter what you say to them.MusicI'm not a guy who puts much effort in paying attention to details, but I think the music of the game is fine. It's not bad, but not super good either. I play the game for the story, and all the music has to do is accompany it by blending in well to the game. And there I saw no error.Game ControlsThe game can be paused by pressing Space anytime, which is a lot of help coz you aren't given much time to decide on your next action. Which is bad because very often I have this problem that I haven't finished hearing the conversation (or reading it for that matter), and I already have to click. And if I don't the game usually picks silence (not responding anything), which is often not what I want. And if you screw up, at least you can restart from the last checkpoint. That doesn't help much though if you are forced to listen over the same conversation in full length. You can't just quickly skip sentences like in ME3. Too bad, but I can live with it. A few times I picked up more information that way, which felt rewarding.SummaryIf you feel like a wolf, and you want to play a casual game, that you can pause any time you want, that you can stop anytime you want (it is preferred to wait for checkpoints though), you just want to be part of a story, relive the fables to some extent, and you just want some adventure with some action in it, without too many and too hard puzzles to solve, then you will enjoy this one. Sure, the artwork could have been better, but the game is cheap enough to counter that disadvantage.I enjoyed the game a lot and I will finish it. I might even replay it to act differently and see what happens.			"

MYSTERD'S VERDICT:VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.INTRO:Telltale once again delivers the goods here with their usual style + format. Their style of interactive adventure games + choice-driven narratives here fuel this entire endeavor. Soaked with nothing but flavor, neon lights, cigarettes, style, seedyiness & some fairy-tale characters + Fabled characters, Telltale once again delivers here; delivering a hard-boiled noir + murder mystery that will captivate fans of their games to the very last jaw-dropping moment.THE TELLTALE EXPERIENCE:Let's face it: if you're not a fan of Telltale's format and/or you might be growing tired of their format, you will probably not like this game or might not be in awe of it. This game likely will not convert you over to their brand + styles of games, if you've grown tired of their format + structure; or you just might not like their format of adventure games. Action sequences here are often in the form of Quick-Time Events (QTE's), in which the player must perform a certain motion on the D-Pad or analog sticks, buttons and/or keys on their gamepad or hit correct keys on the keyboard at the right time and/or in the right sequence to push the story forward. A lot of times, you are forced into Brutal QTE's where you're forced to actually feel, immitate (with the keyboard or controller), & flat-out experience the madness and/or whatever's happening on-screen. When the QTE's are brutal, intense, and often interesting, that is when they're at their best.Also, you are forced to respond to gray decisions in a quick + timely manner, forcing the pressure + tension on the player to do something - no matter how good, bad, or God knows how things are going to play out. This is absolutely another one of those times when this game is at its best. Choices are scattered all over the place and are often as gray as ever, but whether they matter in the final outcome of the game & grand scheme of things - that's another question and/or story entirely. Though, they will at least likely shape certain parts and elements of the actual journey.Puzzles, which were once a staple of adventure games, are once becoming less + less used with each Telltale games - and the one or two that are here, they really aren't difficult at all. Players looking for a challenge here on the puzzles, look elsewhere. Though, not having the pacing ruined by being stuck on a specific puzzle to push the game ahead is a nice thing, for those who want to constantly push the game & story ahead at a decent pace.STORY, PLOT & CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTS OF LABYRINTHS + EXCELLENCE:Telltale's games would likely fall apart if the story, character & plot development with its voice-acting, dialogue, writinng was miscast and/or not executed that well - since their games usually really do also heavily hinge on this stuff and spend loads of time on this. As usual, Telltale does not disappoint in this regard, loading the game w/ lots of interesting plot twists, plot points, story beats, character developments, and so many fairy-tale + fabled characters awesomely woven into this labryirnth of a murder mystery with lots of intrigue + creatively. Actually, this one just might be one of Telltale's best in all of these regards.Players play The Big Bad Wolf AKA Bigsby, as he is the Sheriff of a town in NYC of nothing but Fables, is trying to figure out why a girl gets murdered + then a string of more murders occur. This labyrinth of a plot with lots of different characters (i.e. Snow White, Georgie Porgie, Mirror Mirror, The Woodsman, Beauty And The Beast, etc) is always intriguing + will keep the player immersed & drawn into its world + story. That certainly just tips the iceberg here, as I don't want to go too far into Spoiler Turf here + ruin things for gamers who actually want to experience this fantastic story.GRAPHICS:While the graphics aren't technically spectacular in any ways here, it's the artistry of it all that goes a long way in beign spectacular here. The noir-inspired theme, the use of colors, neon lights, and design of the actual characters are always excellent here, loaded with nothing but style, coolness, and swagger. This game just oozes character at all times, from head-to-toe. Running the game on my rig at a native 2160p / 4K resolution with i7 950 Bloomfield, GTX 970, 16 GB RAM, and Windows 7 64-bit OS was absolutely no challenge for this game to remain at 60 frames per second for the majority of this glorious experience.CONCLUSION:Fans of Telltale's games with their adventure-game + choice-driven format & structure - if you love hard-boiled noirs, murder mysteries, & wanted to see an ensemble of a cast of Fabled character under one roof that the Big Bad Wolf can possibly blow down (or not, depending on your actions + decisions), this is the game for you. With lots of flair & style; an absolutely unforgettable story + plot; great characters; great use of fairy-tale characters + Fabled characters - look no further than this game. For fans of their actual games, this is a very easy game to recommend. To put it simply: this is one of Telltale's best adventure games that utilize + follow their actual format + structure that they're famous & known for.			"

												Masterfully written and masterfully drawn, The Wolf Among Us surprises with an unique personality and original setting, combined with the developer's already well-known dramatic storytelling.I bought this game more than a year ago and shelved it. The premise sounded interesting, but not enough to play immediately. Now that the first (and probably only) season is over, I decided to try it and discovered a very polished experience, more personal and gritty than The Walking Dead, and also more engaging.Art direction is simply astounding. The graphics are superb, quality-wise. Even if you don't like cel shading you have to admit the devs did a very good job, and the comic book-like drawings set the atmosphere delightfully. Sounds and music are also top-notch. The lip-sync is perfect and the voice acting professionally convincing.Gameplay-wise, the experience is immersing and compelling. I did not encounter a single glitch, lag or bug. The controls are simple and work fine, even though I would prefer to use E instead of Q for the action sequence QTEs. Divided by episodes and chapters, it can adapt to long play sessions as well as 15-minute rounds.Where this game really shines is, of course, the story. Drawing inspiration, direction and lore from the original books, there's much more to be seen that can be noticed at first sight. This provides a wholesome world with fleshed-out, mature characters and an interesting background, connecting seamlessly to the parent storyline. Be not mistaken, this drama is not for children. Also, be prepared for a shocking shift in the way you'll forever look at your classic fairytale characters. Many of them are here, and there's no ""happily ever after"". Illegal drugs and magic, prostitution, exploitation, murder and a very important dose of gore and violence populate this game/visual novel/point-and-click RPG-ish adventure. If you're into dark fantasy, rough drama and noir mystery-solving detective stories, this might be right up your alley.Tell Tale Games at it's finest, and another very nice gaming experience. This game was met with universal acclaim and there's a reason for that.Highly Recommended. "

The Wolf Among Us is a decision-based story-driven adventure. With fairytale characters secretly living in the normal world ever since they exiled from the world of fables centuries ago, sheriff Bigby Wolf comes across a murder case which has him investigating a conspiracy against all the inhabitants of Fabletown.Pros: This film-noir detective story has truly excellent writing, as you're constantly faced with a variety of decisions that shape the story arc in a unique way, while your relation with each character you come across evolves. Nothing is black and white, and whatever choice you make from multiple options will have unforeseen consequences, for better or for worst. Character reactions and expressions are deeply realistic, and you'll want to revisit the game multiple times to find different outcomes, constantly finding a new surprise around the next corner as the plot unfolds. Graphically, the cell-shading perfectly captures the impression of a live graphic novel, an art style that couldn't possibly better represent the atmosphere.Cons: The story remains linear, and although you have multiple branching paths, you remain limited to going where the plot will take you next. There is a bit of staggering in some of the animations, as well as occasional awkward silence in between dialogs. Furthermore, every choices are timed, and while that may add to the realism of an action sequence or conversation, you're often left with very little time to consider what your options are and what may come out of these. Some of the options are a bit misleading, as it isn't always clear what the tone of a dialog choice is beyond the words they express (example: Will choosing ""Calm down"" mean you'll whisper it reassuringly or yell it at the person you're interacting with?). Gameplay is limited to quicktime events and clicking on things. There is a well-known bug you're likely to experience at least once, where a scene starts offering repetitive ""This choice is blank"" dialog choices that can only be resolved by re-doing the previous scene hoping it doesn't bug again.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.I got extremely involved with the story, the first episode was enough to get me hooked. Telltale truly has refined the ""decision matter"" storytelling to near perfection, all delivered with excellent voice acting. While I'm cooling off from my first experience, I can't wait to play it again and try things differently. I am already recommending The Wolf Among Us to everyone I personally know, and am doing the same to anyone who will read this.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												After finishing The Wolf Among Us i decided that Telltale Games is definitely the King of point and click adventure games.The Wolf Among Us reveals us the magical world of Fables, a world entirely different  of the one we mundies think we're living in. A world where pigs can smoke, and the wolf hunts the Huntsman. Based on the Fables comic books, the game depicts a series of crimes committed in Fabletown, which you, as sheriff Bigby aka The Big Bad Wolf must solve. The story is just great, intriguing and with a lot of twists, there is no doubt about it, and the fact that you're to choose what and when happens just makes it greater, even if this does not apply for all choices made during the game. The voice acting is marvelous and the artwork is spectacular. The facial expressions are also much more realistic than in TWD or any other Telltale game so far.Even in a positive review, I usually try to cover also the negative sides of a game, but this time Telltale guys gave me no chance for it. There is nothing i didn't like, nothing that didn't feel appropriate, not a single aspect i could complain with. The Wolf Among Us turned out to be exactly what i expected it to be - my GOTY of 2014 for point-and-click adventure games.			"

""The Wolf Among Us"" is a five episode series based on Fables (DC Comics/Vertigo), an award-winning comic book series by Bill Willingham. it is a violent, hard-boiled thriller where the characters and creatures of myth, lore and legend are real, and exist in our world. Your choices matter and will change and define the story you experience. Purchase ""The Wolf Among Us"":═══════════════════════════════════When it comes to quality story gameplay, you can't go wrong with Telltale Games. and ""The Wolf Among Us"" is no surprise to be one of the best story driven games on the market.The game takes place in Fabletown, New York, after all the fairy tales' characters had escaped the woodlands to live a modern life, leaving everything behind. You play as Sheriff Wolf Bigby, who was in the past the Big Bad Wolf from the Little Red Riding Hood story. Throughout the story you'll investigate the story of the Murder of two Prostitues -  Holly the troll and Faith (A.K.A Donkeyskin). Atmosphere The game's atmosphere is amazing. there's always this noir feeling to it and you just want to keep playing for ""just 10 more minutes"".StoryThe game sucks you into it's amazing atmosphere and story. It'll question your moralities and decision making abillities. You will have the option to play as the vicious bad cop, or be kind (each is satisfying on its own). You will get emotional.Whether it's the brilliant voice acting, the absolutely AMAZING writing or the fantastic story, this game is not one you will forget after you're done playing it. Graphics Simple, yet sophisticated. Cartoon-ish, which fits the game perfectly since the game's about fairy tales and stories.Not many graphic options, but it doesn't really matter in this game, where the main focus is on the story telling abillity. Final Score - 10/10This game left an impact on me. the kind of impact that, once you finished the game, you know there isn't any game like that, and you wish you could play it for the first time again. i hope Telltale will give us a  2nd season of this marvelous game. Buy it now!  "

												I've stumbled upon DC Comic's Fables fairly late. It really didn't stop me from enjoying its 150 issues + spin-offs and special episodes. The premise is outstanding, better execution of one of my own ideas I've thought of before I knew Fables exist. It's a story of (mis)adventures of citizens of Fabletown, a small community where all of your favorite fairy tales and urban legends live in disguise and try to survive away from their mystic homelands which were ravaged by mysterious Adversary.If you've ever played any of Telltale CYOA adventures, you know what they're all about. If you're a newcomer, Telltale Games published two type of adventure games and they're certainly more known for their choice-and-consequences games such as The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones - Telltale Series and The Wolf Among Us. These games are delivered in episodes which consists of chapters. Think of it like episodes of TV show with playable scenes. Interaction levels are low, puzzles are non existent, you get to walk around, talk to characters and choose wisely or impusively. There are few fight scenes which are based on single button mashing and/or pressing the right button at the right button. Nothing to concern you, for these are not action games.The Wolf Among Us, as I said, uses the same formula as other Telltale Games. The thing is, source material for this game is so damn good, it automatically makes this game better than most (all?) other TTG adventures. It's gritty, mature, violent. Hands down, this game is masterpiece because writing team wisely used the existing settings and characters and then incorporated the new ones which fit in PERFECTLY.  The story has some really nasty checkpoints and it managed to suprise me a few times. Game acts as a prequel for visual novels, but Telltale Games managed to create a perfect adaptation. Music, sounds, voices and graphic style, everything is nasty enough (in a good way) to keep that Fable's spirit alive and well.Honestly, the only thing that game doesn't do well is making choices matter, but that's already standard problem for Telltale Games - they only change the path, not the outcome of your decisions. Violent, mature and completely Fables (we love you, Colin!), The Wolf Among Us stands proud on the throne of Telltale Games adventures. Do you need to play it? YES on both accounts - it's no-brainer if you're a fan of Telltale Games and a perfect entry into TTG world if you're a newcomer!***Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it? It made you buy the game / abandon the idea of buying this game? Super awesome!

												Like any other recent Telltale game it is wise to not expect much in the gameplay department, however The Wolf Among Us managed to grab me right from the very start with an interesting ending during the very first episode. The colours are bright and the neon who bright the whole city during night is only a mask to hide the truly dark side of Fabletown. The game picked quite a few interesting characters from stories we might have heard when we were younger. As someone who never read any of the comics it was interesting to see the end, however I can't tell how close the game was to the comic books. You can tell that something odd is happening in this town and it does not take you much time to find that there might be more corruption and dirty secrets that you would have imagined. Another point that can help you getting into the game's mood is the soundtrack of The Wolf Among Us. As soon you start each episode you can listen something that really merge the story and the music into one form making a great combination and by having this tune right at the start of each episode really helped me getting in the mood, just like the lights from Fabletown did, as odd it may seem. If any of you like to combine certain games with certain times of a day or seasons than I must say that, while I finished this game with a sunny weather this is a game to be played in the cold winter after a long day with some warm coffee or tea on your side. To me, there are outside conditions that can affect how immerse a game can be and playing a game on Summer is really different than playing on Autumn or Winter. But this is just a side note. I recommend this game to anyone who may enjoy the usual Telltale game or even for a light gamer with low experience in gaming mechanics who is just looking for an interesting story with some plot twists as well. It took me around 9 hours to finish the game without going back to get all the Book of Fable entries in episode 3, 4 and 5 and my best time with the game was during the very first episode and the last one.

												I normally like games that have great character development, great story, and superb atmosphere. The Wolf Among Us absolutely nailed all of these three subjects. It is one of the best games I have ever played.The first major impression I had is the characters. The characters are incredibly unique and funny. When I started learning a lot about them, I felt like I was in a different world living with them. I did not want to leave. It was such a shame this game has an ending. The story is absolutely brilliant and full of insane twists. It reminded me a lot of Twin Peaks, David Lynch movies, and other great murder mystery stories. They build a lot of twists, tension, and develop great atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, the art direction in this game is one of the best I have ever seen in gaming. The choice of colors and shading is unbelievable. This is eye candy for people who like taking screenshots. I do not want to say anything what it is about. You got to try this game out and be surprised. Brilliant game. 9.4 out of 10			"

All you need to know is that if you liked how The Walking Dead was presented you're going to love this and second, you don't want to know of the subject matter of The Wolf Among Us nor read any written account concerning the game lest you spoil even the basic premise.I will add that after my first QTE with this game, I broke out the Logitech Gaming Software application for my G500s mouse and created a profile by binding one of the mouse buttons to a macro that made the QTEs where Telltale has you mash the Q button inconsequential.  +1 for PC Gaming.<macro repeatdelay=""1"" guid=""{F233EE99-7288-446D-9071-04C112CCB3F9}"" hidden=""false"" name=""Q"" repeatmode=""pressed"">        <multikey xmlns=""http://www.logitech.com/Cassandra/2010.1/Macros/MultiKey"">          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""91""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""50""/>          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""91""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""46""/>          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""95""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""41""/>          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""99""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""25""/>          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""100""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""33""/>          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""100""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""20""/>          <key direction=""down"" value=""Q""/>          <delay milliseconds=""99""/>          <key direction=""up"" value=""Q""/>        </multikey>      </macro>			"

												Telltale have really found their groove when it comes to games that rely heavily on intriguing characters and strong storytelling. The Wolf Among Us continues that trend as it opens up the world of Fables, an 'adult' take on Grimm Fairy Tales that were watered down by Disney over the years.It's based on the Graphic Novel series and is set before the series starts, so it doesn't 'spoil' anything if you want to get into the comics long term (which are due to end issue #150 - the end of 2014).It tells the story of Snow White and the Big Bad Wolf as they try to live and blend into the normal (Mundy) world of New York. They do this within their gated community, and glamour spells to make them appear as human as possible. It's an interesting take on what for most will be familiar characters, backstories and interactions with each other and the game does a good job of creating a sense of realism to this strange fantasy world.It's dark, gritty and sleazy.The game is mainly a based around a 'Point and Click' style world, with a few Quick Time Events thrown in. However, don't let that put you off the game as the QTE work well within the context of the game, and can add a real sense of suspension and tension to a situation.The PnC elements work well within the detective/crime solving nature of the game too, as you play as Detective Bigby (Big Bad Wolf) as he tries to solve the issues of Fabletown before they spill out into the real world.There are a few minor issues that are perhaps starting to become Telltake trademarks in their own right regarding save and choice strings becoming corrupt. However these are for the most part rare, and can sometimes strangely be solved by simply restarting the game.In short; I enjoyed this game, even if it is little more than an interactive story. The characters and writing is strong enough to carry that interaction, and the presentation of the game world draws you in and makes you feel like your choices matter in the long term.			"

The game has best visual design and characters amonth others by Telltale. And it works as standalone game - no previous reading required (though it has some back stories in book of fables database).-It has common Telltale QTE syndrom in action scenes, missing some of QTEs don't even affect what will happen on screen.

												Really fantastic game, one of the best from Telltale. There has to be a sequel though, because that ending left me extremely confused. I only have one complaint, and I don't remember if this happened with other Telltale titles or if the goal was just clear in them: I like to explore everything in a room, and sometimes I would click on an object that would trigger the continuation of the story when I hadn't finished exploring the room yet, and then I wouldn't be able to return to that room to continue exploring it. That was really annoying: I had to restart a few chapters to avoid the specific object until I was done exploring.			"

												Oh man, oh man, what to say... well, as an avid fan of the comics I can honestly admit the game was much better. Character interactions and overall writing were superb. Plus, the noir art style definitely fit the theme of the game. The choices you make basically converge all to a predetermined place, but character reactions to your choices fit the bill quite nicely. Gameplay is what you'd expect from a Telltale game, so not many complaints there. All I can say negative about it is the fact sometime there are a few visual glitches that can detract from the overall gaming experience, although if you save and quit those usually disappear. If you want your reply value out of a game, this is definitely one even if you don't want all the achievements. Check it out and I'm sure you won't regret it.			"

												The Wolf Among Us was an interesting story, and is based from the Comics called ""Fables"" who are well known Fairytale Characters living amongst the Real World in New York City.You play as the Big Bad Wolf, the Sheriff of Fabletown with major anger issues, and the thing I loved the most about this Game, is the extent that you can choose to unlease your rage, or you could just play the ""somewhat"" niceguy.The Gameplay focuses on Detective work, trying to get to the bottom of some Murders which happened in quiet Fabletown. It doesn't really offer a challenge to solve the cases, but rather about sitting back and enjoying the ride, choosing Dialogues that suit your style.The Voice acting was well done, and the Animations fit in well. The Characters were well made, and even though I had the Music turned down to 3, it was still loud enough to really enjoy.If a sequel were to pop up oneday, it would be a definite buy for me.Genre- EpisodicGame Elements- Player Choice- Quick Time EventsAverage Playthrough- 8 HoursLiked- Interesting Story- Well known and loved Characters- Great Voice Acting- Good Music- The ability to be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... or notDisliked- Repeatedly pressing a single button in Quick Time Events			"

												The Wolf Among Us (WAU) is another quality interactive adventure game from Telltale based on the Fables comics; taking you through a dark & bloody murder mystery full of action, violence, twists & turns. Characters are based off of fairy tales, but each has its own unique 'humanised' personality complementing their fantasy persona. This adds depth to each character, allows for some creative (and sometimes unexpected) scenes that also has the benefit of adding greater weight to your decisions. The consequences of your decisions remains an important feaure of WAU & you will also find at several points you can only choose one location (out of several) to explore, each giving you a different clue or story arc to experience each time. It was also really interesting to see where the journey would take you, as you try to solve the mystery progressing through the episodes; Well written story!I can certainly say that after playing WAU, you will never look at your childhood fairy tale characters the same again! :)Quality of the animations, voice acting, art direction (including the colour palette choices) & camera work really come together to create a unique experience that immerses you into the gritty & violent world that's been created. I was somewhat hesitant to get this one after Walking Dead S1 (even though WD would have to be my GoTY for 2012), as I wasn't sure if Telltale could pull off another classic, or perhaps more to the point, if really the main reason I liked WD was simply the genre & being a fan of the TV Show. Turns out I was wrong! I could even argue WAU is a better game overall, only really lacking to a degree on the emotional impact that made WD a game I still remember so vividly to this day. The story is more complex than found in WD, littered with clues along the way & subtilties in much of the dialog. This did make it more difficult to follow when having to wait a couple months between episodes, but now with full release it would not be an issue. Although the voice acting is excellent, I did think that some of the dialog was lacking. Some scenes just seemed to boil down to a heated swearing-fest exchange of 'effin this and effin that'! Not that I am offended by such things, but gets a little repetative & some better work could have been done to use such words more for emphasis, than all over the place. Most of the dialog was good, mind you, but parts seemed a little average. Perhaps the comics are also like that, I don't effin know! :)Certainly not a story to share with your kids; it is disturbing at times, often sinister, with some very dislikable (yet utterly memorable) personalities. That includes (at times) the infamous Bigby 'Big Bad Wolf' Wolf, who you play as! Now with a few of these interactive adventures under their belt, Telltale have proven they can replicate the experience & even improve on the core design! Great story telling, great experience & overall another quality production that is hard to fault.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												This is such a great game. I've started it completely blind, I didn't even know what it was about, I thought: ""eh it's going to be some kind of werewolf story"", boy I was wrong. I can't and won't say much about the plot 'cause it would spoil it. It's great with plenty of twists, great characters and a great visual design, go for it :) 9/10			"

												Telltale Games have done it once again! The Wolf Among Us is a very refreshing and invigorating experience. An experience that is not only masterfully told, but felt as well. Throughout each episode, I find myself completly immersed in this enticing and wonderful experience from start to finish, and I can only say one thing.... That I want more, and I rarely say that about games. With each episode that comes to pass, I find myself wondering what will happen in the next episode? What will become of Bigby and Snow, and so many more questions. It is because of Telltale's unique way of weaving out the story of their games that make me love this wonderful gem of the game. The only thing that saddens me is how long the episodes take to be released;however, I understand it because of the wonderful Walking Dead Seasons! Plus the always riveting Q and E segments mixed up with the W, A, D, and S key segments too! In all honesty, I would recommend this game to anyone in a heartbeat with they are looking for an incredible journey that they soon won't forget!			"

												Score: 5/5Pros:Great storyGreat soundtrackAdequate gameplay (for a Telltale Game)Awesome characters (I actually cared about how these characters interacted with Bigby (I ship Snow & Bigby in this btw)Actually canon within the Fables universe (and has aroused my curiosity for the source material, which is great because it's a prequel to the series it's adapted from)I\'ve always been a sucker for Dark FantasyCons:Like most Telltale games, the choices made don't really feel that important, usually there are only mentions about them by (mostly) secondary characters (though since this is my 5th Telltale game played I find that this is rather normal so this does not effect me much).Weird glitches, characters and objects would be in the wrong place but correct themselves after a bit. Really noticeable though when it occurs.I was really torn between giving this series a 4/5 or a 5/5 because of the fact that TTG keeps making story-driven games like this that claim your choices have a big impact on the future story but don't. This, I believe, has been a problem ever since the first season of their Walking Dead series. However, do not make this be the one thing that deters you from giving this game a shot. I enjoyed the hell out of this game despite the flaws its, I guess, advertising. This never deterred me from re-playing TWD Season 1 and, hell, I plan on re-playing WAU since I did take a break from this game to achievement-hunt Rocket League after playing Episode 1 during the Lunar New Year Sale and not coming back to it until very late May (5/31). The level of enjoyment I got from this game and its story, and my desire to continue to dive into the world of Fables is the sole reason I gave it a score of 5 on my scale. My recommendation: BUY IT. This game is definitely worth the money and the time you\'d be putting into at least one playthrough. Though, if you\'re like me, you\'d want to replay it for more of the greatness of Bigby Wolf and his Fabletown \""pals\"".			"

												The Wolf Among Us is the third game using Telltale's new adventure game ""formula"" that worked so well with The Walking Dead. So, is the third time still the charme?You play as Bigby ""Big Bad"" Wolf, the sheriff of a New York district housing fable creatures exiled from their realm. Anyone even vaguely familiar with DCs Vertigo imprint (which publishes the Fables series this game is based upon) will feel at home, right down to the font of the subtitles. The basic theme is essential Vertigo, in that myths clash with gritty realism and vice versa. Although in this case, the normal world doesn't intrude much upon the Fables cosmos.To disguise themselves from the humans, the fable creatures use a glamour spell. The deceptive nature of these glamours fits well with the unfolding detective story; unfortunately, the gameplay does not so much. Even more so than in TWD, it is about multiple-choice dialogues and the occasional QTE-driven action scene.There are absolutely no puzzles or riddles whatsoever to be found in this point & click adventure game about a detective trying to solve a murder mystery. So, if this sentence sounds wrong to you, you may have a problem with fully enjoying this game. For me it took away much of the tension: I didn't care much about missing clues, since there really weren't any to be missed; I didn't care too much about my decisions either, since I felt more like a spectator than the driving force.Yet TWAO is far from being a bad game. It is well written, with a mature and intelligent story, interesting characters, great looking visuals, good voice acting and musical score. It's just missing that certain edge. It's got character and charme, but also lots of glamour.			"

The Wolf Among Us is one of the best telltale games I've played. With it's amazing characters and rich story it will keep you glued to your pc until you finish it. There is not one boring moment in it the more you play it the more you want to play it and see what will happen next. I can't say how much will your choices affect the story since I only finished it once but it does give you the feeling that what you choose to say or do matters. All I can say is that everyone that worked on this game did a great job because I liked every aspect of it and I wish that we get season 2.The Wolf Among Us is a must play. "

												This was my first Telltale game, and first adventure game in quite a while. It seems like many games are episodic these days, so I'm glad that I got this when all 5 chapters were completed. I have to say that I did enjoy it. I really liked the work they did on integrating fairy tale characters (fables) into our world (mundies). The idea of ""glamours"" too was interesting. Gameplay was good, with a nice pace to follow the storyline. I really liked the graphics, even though (or in spite of) they were 2D (reminds me of the good old days). There were some bugs though. Choices I made in one chapter sometimes were screwed up in the next -- the game didn't save properly perhaps. This happened two or three times. Then in the final chapter, the screen had ""blank choices"" which i couldn't select, and the scene kept looping. I had to exit to the main menu 3 times before it finally loaded properly on the 4th. If i exited the game entirely, I'd probably have to go through Chapter 5 from scratch. The game doesn't let you save on the fly, but only autosaves at key points. Despite this, I enjoyed playing the wolf among us, and recommend it! But I'm only rating it 6.5 because of the bugs.6.5/10.0			"

												The Wolf Among Us is an interactive story based on the eponymous comics. In a world where fables walk among us, you play the role of Bigby, the Big Bad Wolf, sheriff of Fabletown. The story begins with you investigating a disturbance involving your arch-nemesis Woody where you end up rescuing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from beating. After which, you try to slay that ♥♥♥♥♥ yourself, but before you can seal the deal you find her head laid at your doorstep. The story twists and turns as you follow your investigation to find out who is♥♥♥♥♥♥blocking you at every turn by murdering each and every lady you hit on. You will need to unravel the mystery before Fabletown unravels. ""He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster... when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you..."" -- Friedrich Nietzsche.The gameplay is the fairly standard affair for a Telltale game, with plenty of dialogue and differing moral options set on a timer along with a few quicktime events and point and click adventure mechanics mixed in. If you enjoy this style of storytelling then you will enjoy this game.			"

												Having read quite a few of the comics back in the day, this adaptation of the Fables series is not only faithful to its spirit, but also manages to be an original work in its own right. As a Telltale game, it is polished, layered, well-structured. It was released the year after The Walking Dead: Season One, and before the latest rabid churning-out of adaptations (Tales from the Borderlands, Game of Thrones, Minecraft, Batman), which, judging from reviews, seem to detract from the studio's former glory and fall into predictable formula recycling. The Wolf Among Us differs from The Walking Dead, however, in that it doesn't give you as many predictable dilemmas (oh-whom-to-save), but dwells in the greyer areas: to-kill-or-not-to-kill, why-should-I-do-this, etc.Bigby Wolf is an intriguing central character in the comics, and the decision to make him the protagonist here was wise and well-considered. The voice acting is decent and sparing. The plot moves beyond the whodunnit and veers off into ethical, philosophical conundra. The main antagonist is a delightful, nuanced villain, but the henchmen are also fascinating, especially Bloody Mary. The decision to bring up these new characters from folk songs and urban legends instead of fairy tales was rather brilliant.In their origins, fairy tales were extremely dark and bizarre, having subsequently been bowdlerised by folklorists such as the Grimm brothers and Charles Perrault. The Fables series does tap into the darker sources of fairy tales, but at heart remains a comedic adventure. The Wolf Among Us, instead, taps deeply into the dark, twisted sources of fairy and folk tales, making it a much grittier, more engrossing and more subversive take on this universe. Now let us have Season Two, Telltale.			"

Amazing dark cartoonish storytelling game!StoryThe Wolf Among Us is a kind of a mix between an interactive story and a videogame. The whole story is somehow difficult to explain, but its set up in a fictional New York where the character from the Brothers Grimm fairy tails have migrated seeking refuge. The main protagonist is Bigby Wolf, who once was the Big Bad Wolf from the fairytails, but now he tries to be the good guy working as a sheriff in this town. Things start to get scarier as some members of the community start to get murdered for unknown reasons and this threat might even reach Bigbys close ones, such as his collegue and love interest Snow White.Game playThe gameplay is divided in three main sections: exploration; where you investigate places looking for clues; dialogues, where you choose from usualy four options to set the pace of the conversation; and quick time events, which take place in most action scenes. Now, I really dont like quick times events, but there is usually only one or two action scenes per chapter, so it didn't spoil my experience. VeredictOverall, I really enjoyed this game, it was really great and deep, made me feel chills over my spine quite a few times, the story is rich but easy to catch and the character Bigby is very well build, with his contraditions of being the Big Bad Wolf turned into a law agent. I strongly recommend this game. Just wish it would be longer...I give it 5.0/5.0 "

												Telltale Games is really hitting their stride right now in the adventure/story game genre, with The Wolf Among Us continuing right where they left off with The Walking Dead season 1. The two games, structurally and mechanically, are basically identical - the gameplay is primarily dialog-driven with a few action scenes thrown in occasionally. The only small difference is that there are absolutely no 'traditional' adventure-game puzzle solving bits to be found here - this is purely an interactive ""choose your own adventure"" story, basically. The game is an adaptation of a graphic novel series about fable characters that live hidden in our world. I didn't know anything about the source material going in and I enjoyed it a lot, so knowing any of the background is clearly not a pre-requisite to playing or enjoying this game. You play as Bigby Wolf (a.k.a. the ""Big Bad Wolf""), the sheriff of Fabletown. The main storyline has you investigating a murder, and without spoiling anything, let's just say you encounter a variety of interesting characters and places along the way. It's a fun ride. The game is split into 5 episodes, all of which have now been released. The first episode does a great job of setting the stage, and although the following episodes vary in intensity and quality, overall everything is pretty good, and the story concludes in a satisfying way.On the technical side, the graphics and voice acting are outstanding. I ran into one bug near the end of the last episode, but reloading from a previous checkpoint fixed the problem. Hopefully this will be patched soon. Other than that, I had no other issues. This is a must-play if you enjoyed The Walking Dead adventure game, even if you don't know anything about the comics. If you didn't play The Walking Dead but have an interest in adventure/story games, you may like this (though I would suggest perhaps trying TWD first, just to be sure). Overall, as a fan of both Telltale games and the genre as a whole, I really enjoyed this, and hope the series continues.			"

Amazing Game and well made by Telltale Games :)!So i completed the game about 12 hours ago, and the only thing i can say is i am astonished, like i said before i did not know what to expect of this game but this game got me real good, just like the walking dead, telltale games once again made a great job. This game is really just the walking dead quality of a game, well made, stories (episodes) are well made either, music is greatly composed, charachters are well written, just everything about this game is WELL MADE!. Without spoiling to much about the ending the only thing i can say about the ending is i am CONFUSED as F*ck, im not quite sure what happend xD, but damn it was a good one, hopefully their planning on releasing a season 2 like they did with the walking dead, because this game really deserves a second season! no doubt about that!97/100 GG Telltale Games GG			"

												This is definitely my kind of game. A true discovery.I don't think I've ever had such level of relaxation as while playing episode 1. It's really more like watching an interactive movie.Many, many great ideas, superb character creation, suprisingly professional voice acting and outstanding writing (for a computer game) makes this one of my favourites. I will definitely play this again soon.As for the choices... well they don't really influence the plot, which may be good. You do not have to constantly worry to push the game forward knowing you will lose nothing if you choose 'wrong'. This way, you can concentrate on choosing who you want to be. The choices you make are about struggling to become more human, to control animal instincts or just being Big Bad Wolf all the time. You write another, your own, story with the options you choose. And it is not artificial. It's something you actually feel. This is my first Telltale game and I am extremely excited to see the rest.			"

												In The Wolf Among Us you play as Bigby Wolf, a sheriff operating in a world inhabited by characters from fariy tales. Although this may at first sound childish (assuming you’re not a fan of the comics on which it is based), the game is actually very dark and violent as it paints these well-known characters in a very different light. Best described as an interactive story, you point and click your way through various scenes as you attempt to unfold the mystery at hand. You will often be forced to choose from various dialogue options, allowing you to paint yourself in whatever light you desire and eliciting different reactions from the NPCs. The storyline is absolutely captivating and really keeps you guessing, its never boring or predictable. Each chapter is fantastic, full of intrigue and mystery, and I had a very difficult time staying patient in between releases. The final episode is extremely satisfying while also leaving you craving more. I absolutely cannot wait for the next season, will be an instant buy for me. This is the game that made me fall in love with Telltale's ability to captivate with their wonderful storytelling, and caused me to go from someone who was very skeptical of this genre of game to being a huge fan.

												Telltale has done it again!  The Wolf Among Us is an absolutely fantastic story-based adventure game in the same vein (mechanically speaking) as The Walking Dead.  Your choices alter the incredibly in-depth story and offer a variety of ways to play the main character, Bigby Wolf, all of which lead to consequences which often have a ripple effect throughout the entire narrative.The game takes place in Manhattan in a secret community composed of the many 'fables' that we've grown up knowing since we were children.  The Three Pigs, Snow White, The Little Mermaid, and other all make appearances throughout the game and you get to see a grittier side to them than we're used to.  All in all, the game was an incredibly well-written and kept my interest from the moment that I turned it on.  I spent a large portion of two consecutive days playing the game and that was only because of the fact that by mustering all of my willpower I was able to quit the game and save it for later.  I highly recommend it!			"

												Telltale Games have managed to produce another cleverly crafted game adaptation from a comic book franchise. Running on from their success with The Walking Dead Season 1, The Wolf Among Us us based upon Vertigo's Fables comic book series wherein Fairy Tale characters live amongst the normal ""mundane"" people of New York City in a small gated community. Like the comic books, The Wolf Among Us, attempts to recreate the historical 'Grimm' aspect of such tales, and intentionally un-Disneyfy them. At the same time as it does this The Wolf Among Us re-establishes the relevancy of Fairy Tales in the modern era much like the comic book series managed to do, creating cautionary tales instead of feel-good stories.Although the game stays true to the ethos of the comic books, it suffers slightly from the theme of detective noir it initially represented itself to be. The game combines elements of point and click exploration with QTE's and dialogue choice. It's a mixture that should lend itself well to an investigative game, but the lack of environment interaction leads to it not really feeling like an investigative piece (It's less CSI and more  Criminal Minds), instead the investigation occurs through half-truths lies, intimidation and coercion that Bigsby employs to garner information from residents of Fabletown. This creates a quandary as very little information is ever given to the player, leaving you feeling fairly lost in the investigative process, and being pointed in directions by other characters, who may or may not be telling the truth. It's a great technique for creating an aura of suspense and mystery but fell a bit flat when episodes are released two months apart which negated the suspense. (In other words I recommend a play-through now when all episodes are available).  It also negated the creation of plot-based assumptions by the player which it could then overturn at a later phase, i.e. no ability to create a plot twist but this proved to be unnecessary anyway as information was still being revealed right up until the end of the game.The game does an excellent job at overturning character stereotypes based on traditional fairy tale roles, instead encouraging us to understand the characters portrayed and not to judge based purely upon existing prejudices. The morality choice is again present as in The Walking Dead and can be a way to encourage aforementioned stereotyping intially only later overturning the player's prejudices through further interactions. It is this ability to challenge existing concepts and ways of interaction that makes this game a ""mature"" game, regardless of adult-themed content. The characters themselves are intelligently re-imagined, causing reflection on our own previous assumptions, and interpretations of the old rhymes and stories, an aspect that has been carried over from the comic books. In fact the reinterpretation of these characters is what gives this game a meta-cognitive feel, as it carries its theme of appearance vs reality.Where The Wolf Among Us does shine above and beyond its sister game is in the QTE's and combat sequences. They are far more immersive, and one feels a great deal more in control of the situations, even when initially surprised by the beginning of the event. It also serves to characterize exactly why Bigsby is a character to be feared, in short the game puts some bite into Bigsby's bark. It's a brilliant game that manages to serve up an intriguing story whilst simultaneously re-inventing player perceptions of classic characters. I highly recommend it!Edited: Spelling, italics and clarity			"

A great melodrama from Telltale Games, currently ranking higher on my personal preference chart than either ""The Walking Dead"" or the new ""Sam & Max."" Like so many fantasy stories do nowadays, ""The Wolf Among Us"" recycles fairy tale characters and throws them all into a modern setting. But unlike some, it manages to do so without being tacky.Being the appointed sheriff of this city within a city is a difficult task made worse by being the only such officer, having little to no support from the government or community, and no authority whatsoever in the ""Mundy"" (everyone else's) world. The role is given to Bigby Wolf (yes, say that out loud), the villainous veteran of several fairy tales, tasked to keep the peace in a community with sparse respect for established laws.As Bigby, you are initially feared more than respected, though not enough of the former to avoid some painful looking quicktime events. Though the character is established as wanting to reinvent himself as reformed from his checkered, violent past, you can choose to play as bad cop instead of good cop. Either way, you'll ""suffer"" the consequences for either choice as the story progresses.The player could be fooled into thinking that this results in a vastly branching storyline. It may, as the episodes progress, but two playthroughs of the first episode have revealed it to so far be more about permutation than branching.Personal progress as of review: Two complete playthroughs of Episode 1 in 5.5 hrs=-=Pros:well-executed, flexible, choice-centric storyconvincing voice actinggood visual designcan ""rewind"" savegamesfunctioning pause buttoncontinues the standard Telltale end-of-episode choice summary that allows you to compare the decisions you've made to that of other players as a whole.Cons:occasionally erratic movement controlsclunky save systemno manual savingambiguous check pointscannot skip cutscenes or most dialog (adding aggravation to replays)cannot rebind keys from menu.Grade: A=-=Episode 1 spoiler: save your money at the beginning			"

												If the Walking Dead showed us anything, it's that Telltale knows how to invest players in a story: create deep and complex characters the player cares about, throw them into one Sophie's Choice after another, and ask the player to make the call. Whether it be through hard thought, reckless impulse, social pressure, or just a glance at the timer ticking down, each decision made is yours alone, no matter how proud or ashamed you make yourself. Gameplay-wise, you're simply putting 1's and 0's into value operators. Reality-wise, you're creating a story and a world.  The Wolf Among Us doesn't buck that trend. Hard choices abound, and, somehow, the people you meet express lives more dark and depressing then we saw from a zombie apocalypse. Trying to raise a child, not having enough to pay the rent, being bullied: the strange and extraordinary residents of Fabletown are suffering from very human problems.  It's not hard to sympathize with most Fables we meet, and we want to see their stories to the end.  That, however, is the game's biggest problem: if you want to find out what happens next, be prepared to pick up some comics. I've never seen a game's story rise so high to fall so low, and that's saying something.  This isn't to suggest some conspiracy theory about this being a twenty five dollar advertisement for the graphic novels. In hindsight, I realize you can't take an epic tale such as a comic series with over a hundred issues, stick someone in control of the series' main character, and expect your choices to reflect on someone so definitively pre-made. While playing as Bigby, you can make some pretty clear-cut demonstrations of his power as effective judge, jury, and executioner, but the game doesn't even try to make citizens react with any sort of concrete stance to your actions. This isn't because Telltale is lazy or incompetent, but simply because their hands are tied. You can't kill off a canon character, you can't even change who they do or don't like. The game's story is flawed at a conceptual level.  It's a real shame that what I'll remember the most is how I feel right now, ten minutes after watching the credits roll, because, while The Wolf Among Us is a mere shadow of what it could've been, I won't totally forget just how captivated I was in the midst of it all. Make no mistake about it, this game is a labor of love. Most of the dialogue is among gaming's best, and I've seen award-winning movies with characters less human than these Fables. While the animation brings you back to Playstation 2 days, the art design is personally my favorite in any game, ever: we've seen cel-shading before, but this truly is a moving, breathing comic book you can play. All of this makes for for an incredible jumping point to a potential Game of the Year.  However, in a game like this, story is everything. In the moment, you'll be interested, you'll be invested, you'll actually care. This is why it can't simply end like it does: the grand reveal, the moment everything is explained incites not shock or cries, but acknowledgements, ""Yes, that does make sense."" All your investment, all your time spent in the Fable's community, is for the moment alone. After the Walking Dead ended, I spent days thinking about my choices, what I could've done differently, what I learned about myself. After The Wolf Among Us ended, I simply felt sad for the characters I'd shared time with. Not because of what happened to them previously, but because I'll never know what happened next. I'll never pick up the comics; not out of hate, but out of disappointment. The Bigby displayed in those books and the Bigby I crafted over hours of commitment are two entirely separate characters. I want to know what happens next almost as much as I want to completely love this game, but when the curtains close and there is literally not a shred of closure to be had, I can't help but feel used. I look forward to Telltale's future projects and still have faith in them, but the brief vertical slice I had of such a vibrant and interesting world, one that held such absurd promise, has eventually left me wanting and sad.  I understand how, to the uninitiated passerby, it may seem like I'm making too big a fuss over an ending that's only the small part of a larger narrative. If you don't understand where I'm coming from, picture this: you're watching a movie at a theater, but the projector breaks down fifteen minutes before the end credits. Now, imagine that you've been watching that movie for thirteen hours, and it starred your favorite actors and was made by your favorite director. And every single copy of that film is now broken at that part. But, hey, you can still read a comic version created by completely separate people, and a comic that may change the protagonist from a murderous vigilante to a gruff but fair detective.  There'll be people who're okay with that, and if you're one of them, great! By all means, enjoy this intro to a larger universe you can spend hours upon hours with. Seriously. However, if you're like me, you'll want the major character and plot arcs to at least somewhat resolve within the medium you started them in, as a reward for your investment. Like me, you'll be disappointed, and I'll point you instead in the direction of The Walking Dead. However, to end on a note of positivity, I can safely say that The Wolf Among Us is my absolute favorite game I wouldn't recommend to a friend.			"

												A masterpiece in interactive storytelling. The Wolf Among Us is a fantastic dark-fantasy noir that is deeply engrossing and exceptionally entertaining. The stylized graphics fit perfectly with the story as well. In my opinion, this episodic series is much better than The Walking Dead Season 1. Two thumbs way up for this title.			"

												8,5/10+ fantastic presentation, sci-fi cyberpunk setting (haven't read the comics, but that's how i see it), great voice acting as with all telltale games, it's worth it only for the opening of each episode (music is fantastic)+ point and click adventure game in 3d person, with some quick time events (actually many of them), that fit to the story and game overall (especially during fights it feels right)+ story is very interesting, writing is top as you would expect, again you feel one with the game's world, couldn't be more immersive, but i guess by now we expect that from telltale- episodic, meaning you might forget what's happening till you play the next one, luckily the story is so strong that you won't- do your dialogue choices really have consequences? except from a moment where you had to choose your path, i don't think anything else would change anything, unless there's a surprise at the end.not as good as the walking dead , still another great game from telltale. they know how to make immersive games with great writing, great atmosphere and voice acting, but after this and the season 2 of the walking dead, maybe they should expand on this kind of gameplay to something more.

Pros: Strong narrative and intriguing story keeps you curious and hooked from start to the end. You freely characterize ""Bigby"" a.k.a. ""Big Bad Wolf"" into a good and caring detective or a savage and cruel wolf. Dark, gloomy atmosphere and true detective-noir tale. Nearly all decisions are significant and have impact on game. Gorgeus art style and music. Familiar characters from classic fables such as The Big Bad Wolf, Woodsman,  Snow White, Bloody Mary, Beauty and Beast. Best and favorite Telltale game for me.  Cons: It lasts only ten hours. The wait for second season. A+  "

The Wolf Among Us			* 8/10After years I've bought it on heavy sale I finally decided to play The Wolf Among Us, and I have to say I didn't really expect to be so caught and finish it in barely a day and a half!Set in the Fables Comic universe this adventure follows Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown (a portion of Manhattan in 1986) investigating a murder, a case that will lead to a bigger and more radical case that will change and reveal Fabletown's undergrounds.Enough with the synopsis because the story is everything in this game. Literally. In fact the gameplay is mostly made of Quick Time Events and Dialogues, and both are very important because everything you do or say will lead to consequences, and this is essentially the core of the game as you will really see sooner or later what your actions or words lead to. The lack of actual gameplay is really overshadowed by what the story tells you as it will literally keep you glued on your chair trying to solve the situation and get some answers. But the game will keep you where you are as it will reveal more and more, even though you're practically not doing much in terms of gameplay. The fact that your decisions influence how the story evolves, potentially gives great replayability to the game as you can take different choices in more new runs just to see how relationships or events change, even though the basic plot remains the same. Not to mention the fact that once you reach the end you can still re-play the game to better understand other situations or dialogues or references.The game has an episodic structure, which seriously helps to shock and impact more the player with story revelations or cliffhangers and I find this kind of structure essential for this purpose as I believe it wouldn't work in a different classic way.So, yes. It's all about the story, but how couldn't I mention the art of the game? Starting with the soundtrack, it's made of thin but effective background music and amazing opening and close credits themes everything with an 80s mood. Visually the game has a great art, starting always from the artistic opening titles in each episode, and the game itself with a Comic look mostly due to the cel shading effect, but also colours, a great characters design and detailed ambiences that gives the game an impressive and coherent visual impact. I really have appreciated the voice acting as well, great voices, performances and accents.+++PROs+++ STORY & STORYTELLING. Yes, this game's core is the story itself which I can't spoil, amazing and surprising, not to mention heavily influenced by all your choices made during your run. Not to mention the way the story is being told, with all characters, dialogues, and situations shown with precise camera settings and so on. Everything supported and enforced by an episodic structure, which helps giving more focus on the story than the gameplay.---CONs--- GAMEPLAY. Gameplay is really simple and basic, there are no actual riddles, and even though you can move and click to make few actions it mostly reduces to Quick Time Events and dialogue choices. I actually didn't mind about it too much as the story is the real core of the game, but I could have used some more action, be it moving and fighting or be it clicking for riddles BUGS. I've read of lots of people having crash or freezes, but none of those ever happened, and I'm playing on a Win 10 x64 laptop, one of the worst compatibility situation. I can't really confirm any of those. What I can do is tell of the HUGE glitch I've witnessed (as many others, you can read about it in the steam discussion, watch out for spoilers) at the very very last chapter of the final Episode (5), where consecutive dialogue boxes keep saying ""This choice is blank!"", and then you pass from a previous ambience to another without being able to do anything with incomplete and floating part of characters models. And this is a very common glitch, which was never fixed, and it's quite ridiculous. Luckily for me loading the checkpoint again was enough to play the correct final chapter without any glitch. "

However I have waited until I had completed all 5 episodes before doing so because I was worried that TellTale might not be able to wrap up the story convincingly. Fortunately, they did a great job. This crime-noir fairytale has one of the best storylines I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. If you like mystery stories and plot twists, get this game. If you liked the Walking Dead games, get this game. If you like point-and-click adventure games, get this game. You won't regret playing The Wolf Among Us.10/10			"

												Yea!-Great characters-Interesting and exciting story- Fitting art styleMeh!-Episdoes seemed to get shorter as they went on-Choices really don't have much meaning overallBleh!-Episdoic content-Did encounter a glitch that messed up the game, that it had to be rebooted to be fixedThe Lowdown:Telltale brings us another point and click adventure set in the world of Fables who reside hidden in our modern world(based on the graphic novel series). You play as Bigby Wolf(Big bad Wolf) who must find a murder amung their kind. With the help of Snow White you soon find out this is deeper then murder.The game follows the typical Telltale style that made Walking Dead such a hit. Putting story first then gameplay, you are quickly drawn into the world. While the game offers you some  tough choices to make, it really only offers minimal changes that all will come out to the same outcome(but another character will ""view"" you differently).  The only real choice is the end game one, that effects how the story will end. You basically move scene to scene with talking to other characters or clicking on objects to investigate them. Every so often you will have a big action sequence that will have a minimal quicktime event taht will consist of pressing a directional button, moving the cursor to a point on screen and clicking, or tapping a keyboard key. All very easy and not frustrating. It is more an interactive movie, then a game to  be honest though.While I waited for the last episode to be released before purchasing, since I hate waiting on cliffhangers, that really would be my only gripe with the game. There was also a glitch that when loading the last scene of the game it caused the game to glitch out and throw me through random parts of the story with just me as a walking head and not being able to walk more then a few feet.The Verdict:A great game, that is highly worth the money. Was one of my top games of 2014 "

												TellTale Games are (almost) always about telling us a story, and The Wolf Among Us doesn't fail at that.The feeling is unique and the story is well-written. As in pretty much all TellTale Games, the choices you make might not affect the global ending, but it does affect the way the story is told to you.Will the story be about the Big Bad Wolf's redemption, or will it be a story of violence in Fabletown? The choice is yours to take. The only ""downside"" is, maybe, the lack of gameplay; TellTale Games make an excellent job at telling us a story, and they are great point-and-click, but I would have loved some true puzzles or riddles.Another great game from TellTales, if you liked The Walking Dead or Tales from the Borderlands then you should love it too.My only recommendation to the developpers: please, try to get out of your comfort zone and add some puzzles to flesh out the games, or, at the very least, more variety to how the game plays.Rating; 8/10.

This and Walking Dead are simply some of the best adventure gaming you can experience. Voice acting is top notch, writing is excellent, the background for each of the characters is just enough to hint at their root material while still allowing them to suprise you.

												I dont want to tell to much (care maybe spoilers). I love the story (even there are many sad parts, hard fights, cruel things, nothing what never was be done before but it has its own style and feels unique with the many fairy tails and the many strings). You dont play much, the investigations are not much, the choice are rarely and change only less, sure there could be more ways, more things to change, more ways to answer questions in details but its fine, its hard enough to choice between 4 choices or even 2 (who you run behind, who you capture and such things). In the whole game are hard decissions to make like in Walking Dead 1 & 2 and you dont want it and dont want the time runs down for chosing 1 of 2 or more dilemma wrong possible ways. Good thats  all only a game, but represent the whole crime injustice world so well. Its hard to find the truth, if it exist, to do the right things and not make a mistake or wrong choice only because the evidence are not there or exist or are manipulated, not let someone free who order kills or kill/imprison someone who doesnt  anything. There are to many that are free that make with her dangers further that already had to be stop and others are for the mistakes of others unfree. Hard harder i dont want be sheriff. So many lovely characters, nice design of places.Only thinks i dont like is the game is for me to short even 8 hours is nothing much, i had fun, it has quality but if someone is good it cant be long enough. Some people are getting most time over. So its damn it hasnt even more to play or get The Wolf Among Us 2 released yet (sure you never can be sure something goes good further). What i miss too is the TRADING CARDS, buts its only a little weakness. I would love if TELLTALE GAMES would get GERMAN subtitles.Thanks the big atmosphere, great people, you think everyone could behind all of that and all are mysterious things doing i give this game because i love fairy tails 97 %. If the game would be 10 hours long, Faith would´nt be dead, german language support and it would has trading cards i would give the game even 98-99 % PERSONALY. Its my own opinion, so choice yourself and look  Lets play, show a trailer, play it at a friend or some hours of family sharing and then decide if you want support the developers or not. I am  happy to support this game with that money i choose what you think it is worth, how many you would want have if its your and other work and buy it or not. Thank you for reading/ your time. Have a happy day :)			"

												This is by far my favorite TellTales game. The characters are flawed yet intelligent. The story a gritty mystery shadowing a slightly more common tale of people just trying to make it given the harsh hand they're dealt. Where the bureaucracy is pretty much no help and often hardly different than the criminals they're trying to find. I enjoyed this far more than the more popular Walking Dead series. There was far less stupidity going on in this game and no one pretends to be innocent. Like many of their recent games you have to deal with the consequences of the choices you make and the story really pushes you to make some tough ones. Not always life and death so the urgency and to choose the lesser of two evils seemed to weigh less on my conscious. The writing was excellent and in the en some characters really do surprise you. As Bigby you're automatically branded as the bad guy and everyone expects the worst from you. So it's really easy to fall in line with what everyone expects you to do or you can choose to rise above it. And surprisingly this game gives you many opportunities to let the Wolf inside out it'll take you longer to rise above it. At the end you don't really feel like a hero but realize that what you do is often a thankless job but you do your best anyway. But trying to be an upstanding role model certainly didn't detract from all the violence and action that happens. Luckily you don't die easy. My only complaint if there was one would be I would have liked it if the game explored a bit more of the interaction between the Mundies and Fables. The only part we're ever exposed to that crossover is when Bigby is at a police station being interrogated but that scene is only a very small part of one chapter. Or if we had some reason to go to the farm. I really hope there's a season 2 of this series. I love the reimagining of Fables it almost makes me want to check out the comic myself. Anyone who's a fan of adventure games or even of the comic in general should play this title. You'd definitely get your money's worth and it'd be time and money well spent.			"

												The first episode is around two hours long, and it's fantastic. Really cool art style, well-written, top-notch voice acting -- looking forward to the rest of the episodes. Well worth the pricetag imho, but waiting until all of the episodes are released isn't a bad idea either.			"

												The Wolf among us is one of my all time favorite games out there. This isn't a game where you shoot terrorists as a sheriff or run around ripping everyone apart as the Big Bad wolf. The world of fables has been created so beautifully that after a long time, I actually felt invested in all the characters and took the time to read each of their history. The Story itself is brilliant and very beautifully executed. The choices here do matter to the game as it changes every character's perspective on you. You can be a good cop or you can be the one who rips out dee's heart. The Wolf Among Us is one of those games you will immensely enjoy. Just don't expect much in terms of actual gameplay and you will be pleasantly surprised.			"

Like wow just wow, definately a must play for those that love a good story and or detective games and murder mysteries. Definately another solid telltale game. :)			"

												This is by far my favorite TellTales game. The characters are flawed yet intelligent. The story a gritty mystery shadowing a slightly more common tale of people just trying to make it given the harsh hand they're dealt. Where the bureaucracy is pretty much no help and often hardly different than the criminals they're trying to find. I enjoyed this far more than the more popular Walking Dead series. There was far less stupidity going on in this game and no one pretends to be innocent. Like many of their recent games you have to deal with the consequences of the choices you make and the story really pushes you to make some tough ones. Not always life and death so the urgency and to choose the lesser of two evils seemed to weigh less on my conscious. The writing was excellent and in the en some characters really do surprise you. As Bigby you're automatically branded as the bad guy and everyone expects the worst from you. So it's really easy to fall in line with what everyone expects you to do or you can choose to rise above it. And surprisingly this game gives you many opportunities to let the Wolf inside out it'll take you longer to rise above it. At the end you don't really feel like a hero but realize that what you do is often a thankless job but you do your best anyway. But trying to be an upstanding role model certainly didn't detract from all the violence and action that happens. Luckily you don't die easy. My only complaint if there was one would be I would have liked it if the game explored a bit more of the interaction between the Mundies and Fables. The only part we're ever exposed to that crossover is when Bigby is at a police station being interrogated but that scene is only a very small part of one chapter. Or if we had some reason to go to the farm. I really hope there's a season 2 of this series. I love the reimagining of Fables it almost makes me want to check out the comic myself.

												The Wolf Among Us was fantastic! I just finished the last episode of Season 1, and I can honestly say I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.I think most of us have played The Walking Dead, another Telltale Game, and it is possibly what drew you to The Wolf Among Us in the first place, so I'm going to compare it a bit to that.I love The Walking Dead. It had a compelling story which was all at once wonderful, exciting and heartbreaking to play. However, the choices you made along the way, led us all to the same ending no matter what. There wasn't much value in giving it a replay. There were decisions, but too often that decision was ""choose between letting so-and-so die, or so-and-so"". And it made me feel like a terrible person the entire game because it felt like it was IMPOSSIBLE to do the right thing, to make everyone happy, or anyone for that matter, and someone was always resenting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you for letting their loved one die.TWAU corrects this completely. As Sheriff Bigby Wolf, there are so many decisions you will be faced with which will alter the outcome of the game 100%. I'm terrified to say anything more for fear of spoiling anything for anyone, but you will notice, when certain choices come up, there would have to be a completely different arc created to honor your choice. You can be Good Guy Wolf. You can be Bad Guy Wolf. You can fall somewhere in between the two extremes. You can do the right thing. But you don't have to. Whatever you want. And if there are future seasons, your choices will have to stand, because well... they are that impactful on the story.The story, which, by the way, is excellent! Season 1 was dark, deep, well woven and action packed. I feel bad mentioning anything more than 5 minutes into the game because I don't want to spoil ANYTHING.Please, do yourself a favor, hit ""Buy"", ""Install Now"" and ""Play"" ASAP. I paid $8.50 during the sale, and I'm concerned I'm going to be arrested for robbery at that price.			"

												I have to start with saying that I had no idea what this game was about when I purchased it.I got it for $12 on a recent Humble Bundle (4/16/2016), and I started playing it.I feel that if you want the best experience with this game, you don't want to know what it's about. Just go into the game blind. This game has so many twists and turns, it's hard to close out of it. The characters are so well built and introduced, you end up having to actually contemplate on what you want to do. This has became one of my favorite games, and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did.I really hope they push out a second season. It has so much potential.			"

												My dog watched me playing this... I am kinda looking at her different now...Telltale games have done it again. A dark, yet beautiful story about the creature you listened to in you bedtime stories. You got many characters, not only from grimms fairy tales, but from a wide span of myths. Every character has different abilities and everyone has their background story. Key to this game is to be a detective, to find out who is your ally and who is not. It can go either way, depending on your decisions.Every once in a while you even get the decision to get physical, which seems to be the only option, but doing nothing is always a viable choice!Too bad you can't do any achivements while in offline mode, had a router breakdown and played this while offline, so I am missing some achievements now, even if I didn't skip any chapters.Will try to find the courage to play again with different choices.Too bad it seems to be really short, 5 chapters about 1,5 hours long, yet steam doesn't seem to track time while offline. Completion time about 8 hours I think...			"

												Again, Telltale, you never fail to amaze me. This game is simply EPIC! Interesting back story, engaging storyline and downright gorgeus artstyle. The gameplay time is not too long and not too short either. Just perfect for a good one or two-sitting playthrough. I've competed my first playthrough in about 6-7 hours, that said after thorough searches and reading everything available before moving on to the next step. Another couple of hours extra are spend to get the Fable entries that I've missed (some are missable, some just requires you to play the chapter again).I'm not gonna explain the story and all that. There's tons of review already explaining all of that. All I'm gonna say is that, please, PLEASE, don't let this gem slipped under your radar. If you're on the fence either to buy it or not, you have my guarantee that this game is worth every cent. Buy it, play it, LOVE IT.Personally, I give The Wolf Among Us a big bad 10/10.* Discretion is our guarantee *			"

												TWAU is definitely my favorite telltale game. I greatly enjoyed getting to know the various fairy tales we've come to know through a twisted lens. Mystery and character depth were aplenty as almost all the fabletown characters were not as clear-cut as they originally seem to be. I liked that a great majority of the cast got somewhat deep backgrounds which helped shape the decisions I made throughout the game. The game also incentivises multiple playthroughs of each episode (in the form of achievements) which is a plus in my book.My only gripe with the game is how it got weird near the end. As fans of other telltale games may be aware of, choices you make determine how characters view you at later points of the story. Well I skipped from good to bad (in general) at random times so the characters became very fickle in how they viewed me near the end. It felt unnatural to have character A go from supporting me to dissing me after just 2 or 3 panels. It was quite weird. Other than that, the game was a stellar experience.- great story- amazing set of characters (+ depth)- QTE weren't as bad as I anticipated- delicious mysteryI'm looking forward to another season or maybe other new telltale games dealing with similar material.

												Really great game. HOWEVER (big, BIG however) Telltales habit of taking a really long time to release really short episodes is extremely frustrating. I will buy their games in this genre in the future but NOT do so until all episodes are relased. This is for two reasons, the waiting sucks and I won't pay full price for 1/8 of a game. Waiting saves frustration AND money.			"

												Do you want to play a game with a janky engine that is showing its age and still has a completely broken save system after several years? Do you want to play a game with kludgy mechanics, involving really dodgy action sequences and lame quick time events? Do you want to play a game that may break several times while you're playing, resulting in all of your game choices saying ""This choice is blank"", requiring you to stop, exit, and restart the game? Do you want to play a game where you have only a bare illusion of player agency and no actual meaningful impact on the story whatsoever? Do you want to play it in 90 minute sports every two or three months as each of five episodes are released over the span of nearly a full year?You very well might. Despite all of these telltale Tell Tale Games traits, The Wolf Among Us manages to compensate for all of these failures (which are repeated in every one of their modern games, so far) just enough with a really entertaining story set in a noir 1980s, where you play Wolverine who is tasked with protecting Fabletown. Great art style, color pallete, and voice acting join the actual story in making it worth playing with what would be intolerable failures in a lessar game.Due to the miserable save system and the difficulty in remembering the 90 minutes you played after two or three months each time, this is a title best enjoyed after all five episodes have been released (as is now the case). That way, you can play the entire thing in a couple of sittings without as much risk to your game save and you can keep up with the story.If you're interested in a compelling story that keeps you interested in reaching the next beat in it, The Wolf Among Us is probably worth the sticker price, for most people. If you're unsure about it, you should definitely consider picking it up during a sale. I'd only suggest avoiding this title if you have played enough of recent Tell Tale Games to know that you really dont' have the patience for the inherent jank of their products. Otherwise, if you still have a little patience for that, it's a fun ride.			"

Simply Amazing!Short Summary of the Story: You are Bigby Wolf, sheriff of Fabletown. Fabletown is a city filled with fables ""disguised"" as humans. A murder was committed and you have to solve it. A lot of other fables try to stop you or help you and you have to get to the bottom of this murder.Opinion: For me this game is just amazing. Its story is very interesting and gets you really curious of what's going to happen next. The graphics are stunning, the story is astounding and the voice acting is well done. I really like the action scenes of this Telltale series because it's frequent and you have to make certain choices, of taking a life of someone or not sometimes. The transformations of fables without glamours was very interesting and all the characters have a very well written past in the story.Short list of Pros and Cons:Pros:- Amazing Story- Great voice acting- Stunning Graphics

												For starters, for the price of a couple of cinema tickets you get a 10-hour-long interactive story. Can't go wrong with that.Now, for the good stuff...- Bigby is one of the most awesome, troubled, badass, deep, complicated, admirable protagonists you could imagine. He's like Wolverine only gives even fewer ♥♥♥♥s. You'll have a man-crush on this guy after playing the first 10 minutes of the very first episode.- The story is just classic hard-boiled fiction. No-holds-barred power trip that's got more plot twists than the entire series of The A-Team. And it's dark, and it's brutal and just generally it's a great piece of storytelling.- The ""choice and consequence"" element may not have as far reaching consequences as you may expect, but it's more about self-discovery. It's about Bigby and his moral stuggles and you, as the player, has the power to choose how he deals with all that♥♥♥♥♥♥that's being thrown at him from left and right. It's a quest for moral victory and as such, it delivers superbly.- Visuals are great. Stylised after the comic book, the game feels like a grotesque, cartoon-ish representation of our own corrupt little world. I wouldn't trade the graphics in this game for any modern, life-like look. It just looks and feels like it's supposed to.- Voice acting is just awesome! You can tell so much about the characters just by listening to how they speak. You'll find yourself imitating Bigby's voice in your head in no time.Now for the bad:- Nothing. Null. Nada. Zero. Zilch. There are no bad things that can be said about this game. Whatsoever.- There's this one glitch at the very end of the game, but it only happens sometimes to not very many people. It's well worth checking out though, because it's one of the most amazing glitches I've ever ""suffered"" from! So I don't consider it a negative.- It's short. Just kidding. No it's not - for not even 20 quid you get 10-15 hours of solid, easily replayable entertainment. It's like one of those movies you keep coming back to year after year.If you haven't played it, you damn well should, even if you're not a fan of choice and consequence, or even adventure games in general, even if all you play is CoD or DotA2, just buy it and play it. It's just so good you can't miss it.			"

												I'm not at all familiar with the Fables comics, but I immediately got into the story. You start to recognize characters and it's really nice how it's all immersed in it's own world. The positives in my opinion:+ There's an excellent plot with some unexpected twists to keep you interested.+ The voice actors are really good and the graphic style looks nice.+ The characters in the game are really well developed.+ There's some nicely made Quick Time Event combat.+ The ending is a real braintwister that will make you think of different possibilities but I don't want to spoil anything.The negative:- The choices are well (even though a couple of them had different outcomes than I thought between the line and the action) but they don't seem to matter to the plot line. It doesn't really change the outcome of the game at all as far as I can tell.			"

												Just finished Ep2.  An absolute delight for fans of Adventure games or Telltale Games... or even more for fans of the Vertigo graphic novels it's based on, such as myself.  Woo Fables!I often hear people trying to compare it to Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" Game series, which I've enjoyed as well, due to its similar gameplay of choice & consequence, and story-based nature.  However.. so far, this game has less puzzles (only one so far in Ep2); is not as action-based, and is *entirely* story-focused.I would recommend it to people who like grim adventure games with a  'violent noire'-detective atmosphere.  This one involves famous characters from various fables and stories from your youth.. who have gone bad! ô_ô The main protagonist that you play is a human depictation of the Big Bad Wolf, who is the sheriff of ""Fabletown"". His/ Your job is to protect the other fable characters from each other by resolving their issues and solving crimes.The story, soundtrack, and voice acting are very well done, which makes it extremely immersive! I also particularly like the graphic novel/comic book art-style that stays true to the books.All in all, I can't wait for more! <3			"

												The Wolf Among Us is based on the 'Fables' comics series by Bill Willingham, although the game acts as a prequel so it is a good   place to start if you've never read or heard of the series before.A colourful noir-ish mystery set in the 80's, the setting has fairytale, urban legend and literary characters ('fables') living secretly amongst the populace of New York city. The fable community keeps itself hidden from the mundies (regular humans) and as Bigby, the Big Bad Wolf, you act as their sheriff. When a fable turns up dead you start to investigate who might be behind it, and discover things aren't as simple as they may appear.The art direction, voice acting and music in this game are fantastic, combining to create a slick and gorgeous package that feels a cut above the presentation of prior Telltale games. Like other recent Telltale games, the focus is less on puzzles and more on story and interaction. The content is engaging, well-written and you'll be pulled into the thick of it and eager to piece the mystery together.Thoroughly recommended.			"

												Each time I see a game with information that it was created by Telltale Games I know it'll be a quality product with mature story, decent characters and well-written scenario. ""The Wolf Among Us"" confirmed my expectations. We have complicated history about problems with Fables living in our human world, based on comic serie called ""Fables"" created by Bill Willingham. We can experience their problems, thoughts and dreams. Everything painted in beautiful visuals emphasing the mood of a scene, whether it's good or bad. We have mature storyline which I won't describe to prevent spoiling it to You. It is worth experiencing by yourself, same as various different characters present in the game.""The Wolf Among Us"" is definitely a must-have, not only for fans of its universe. I played the game without reading a single comic from ""Fables"", yet I could understand whole story and have a lot of fun.			"

												 Very solid detective game. Very rare product of episodic released content. Point & Click polished to perfection.I never read the comic books (visual novels), but TellTale went a long way from their first games with ""The Wolf Among Us"".  This game is a hope for me for detectives as a genre in video games will stand on thier own terms on the scene. There is a big audience for gritty noir-like, or neo-noir narrative.  A strong player agency illusion is succesfully created. Smart gamifying props ""Mr. John noticed that"" after answering his question does a lot. Small elements made this game appropriate for the wide audience. Plainly digressing - this isn't as big and big buget as L.A. Noire. It's confusing from the prologue (no context without reading the source material), some answers are decorative. But the whole picture is far too gorgeous to not want a continuation.Thank you for not leaving this on a cliffhanger like most episodic games/movies do. That big user rating is a token of respect for that attitude TellTale Games.			"

												The game is basically the graphic interactive novel. It's beautifully artworked, the story is well written and the characters are not just black and white. I was very satisfied with the whole experience (as it was my first Telltale game)  and looking forward for more - hopefully sequel of episodes.I thought I would use my classic rating system for games I review but first of all, this not a regular game, second many of pluses and minuses would be same thing as it's complicated. Take a note, storytelling is nice and immersive, you think your decisions impacts and it's flow just right and yet after some time you notice (even with some replays) that it gives only a little diference how it ends or how situations turns up. On other side, it's so nicely holding itself together that it doesn't really matter that much anyway and you will enjoy it as it come. Every chapter has it own moments, cliffhangers or suprises and the end is  so open for the new episodes or second game  and.... damn, I hate you Telltale for ending of first episode  to take audience for a while believe Snow is dead. Don't dare to kill her! :DEven out of sale worth your time and money...9/10			"

												So i finished this game today so i thought i would do a little reveiw for it.So well this is a telltale game and that is actually one of my favorite game makers. Thankfully this game didnt dissapoint me, I really like this game.You cant compare this game to like The Walking Dead but its sure a freaking amaazing game. The story is easy to understand and its getting better and better after each episode. The story is quite simple, there is a murderer going around in this town called ""Fabletown"" and well your mission is to find the murderer. After you have played for some time you will quickly realize that there is ALOT more to the story then you thought, and that will keep you going and going.Also the characters in this game are amazing, some of the characters will get you attached like in The Walking Dead which i really like cus that makes the much more playable and fun!Performance wise this game runs like a clock, really good optimized even for my laptop. Runs almost flawless, also the controls are good too and not complicated (can be played with a controller)I strongly recommend everyone getting this game if you are a fan of the Walking Dead games, this one is just PERFECT. All in all one of the best games i've played in a while and I totally advice everyone to buy it! 9/10			"

												The Wolf Among Us is one of, if not the most impressive Telltale Game yet.  One of the primary reasons is the character that the user plays.  Bigby Wolf, also known as the big bad wolf, came from a time and place where blowing down houses and eating people was his every day life.  Now he lives amongst mundane folk and other fairy tale creatures that are disguise (glamored) as humans; thus, it is important to remember that the player is NOT calling all of the shots.  Its safe to say that the general gaming populous has never eaten another living being, nor blown down the houses of three terrified little pigs.  That being said, the player has some choices that will feel like his or her own, however, the majority of the decisions are based upon the mindset of a half werewolf attempting to adapt to a ""normal"" life.In a game like The Walking Dead, it is much more upsetting when the player is left with an ultimatum that doesn't make sense for an ex civil war teacher, but who's to say what is going through the mind of the Big Bad Wolf?With every new play-through, there seems to be more and more hidden character development.  While the choices and content may seem a tad more limited in TWAU than in TWD, the truth is just the opposite.   In the latter episodes of TWD, the early portion seems  more and more obsolete. TWAU brings up choices that were made early in the season, and is also forced to work within' certain boundaries, for it cannot do anything that will break or set the story off balance for the graphic novels.Now that this game is fully released, I couldn't recommend it more.  I even plan on picking up the graphic novels.

												Similar Games:The Walking Dead, Heavy Rain, and to a lesser degree Police QuestThe Good:The voice actors are top-notch and really help convey the feelings and motives of the game characters.  Voice acting is crucial with a game-type such as this, so it is a good thing they found some serious talent.  Adam Harrington (Bigby) and Chuck Kourouklis (Toad) are the standouts in my opinion.Beautiful bright color palette used throughout the game.  The game “popped” and the artistic focus on the Fable comics really shows.  The environmental variation really accentuated the cell-shading and was an improvement over Telltale’s other title The Walking Dead.This graphical choice also lended itself to the expressive countenance on the game’s memorable cast.  Quick and responsive facial reactions helped draw me in to the story and care even more about these intriguing characters.Lighting was also aided by the use of cell-shading.  Numerous situations in the game were made much more ominous due to the placement of the light sources.  One scene in particular involved a TV’s casting glare that flickered across a brutal crime scene.The musical score was quite memorable and assisted greatly in the “immersion” factor.  I found myself particularly enjoying the unique title theme music and, like the rest of the game’s score, found a strong correlation to it and the emotion and intention of the character on the screen.Being a game about fables, it was quite fun trying to guess all of the storybook jumpers before they “revealed” themselves.  I considered it a bit of a mini-game, as there was a book of fables that updated after you met each new fable character.Some neat easter eggs were present during unsuspecting moments, that always put a smile on my face.  I’d be surprised if anyone caught the Lost reference.The statistics behind what percentage of players chose each branching path in the story was an enjoyable read after my play-through.  Knowing I was the minority or majority in a decision choice, led to some interesting personal retrospective. These key choices also proceeded into branching story-lines that seemed much more drastic than the ones in The Walking Dead.I’m a big fan of episodic gaming, especially when it is done right.  The same things that kept my brain glued to a television series on Netflix thinking, “Oh man!  I have to see what happens next” are present in The Wolf Among Us.The Bad:Contextual controller displays were not always intuitive and often led to an incorrect button press.  Most of the time these inconsistencies were only present during the quick reaction moments of the game, which was unfortunate to the say the least.Check out this example, which displays a left trigger input for the door on the right.While probably not a negative in most folk’s book, but the gore and gritty realism was quite jarring and seemed out of place sometimes.  Profanity seemed frequently unnecessary and often made me wince at the screen.I enjoyed the detective portions of the game and just wished there was more to interact with and deduce.  I would have liked being able to try and piece together more of the crime scene on my own (i.e. combining inventory items with areas of interest or carefully crafting the motive from the evidence present in the scene)This is nit picky (sorry Rod), but the subtitles were sometimes hard to read against certain backgrounds.  I like being able to check the subtitles in a game, if I’m not sure what the word was, but the game made a lot of them difficult to read.Can you play it while the children are awake?:As I mentioned above, this is definitely a mature title.  Frequent use of profanity and numerous visuals of gory violent acts made me sure to keep the children far away while I played.Did I make time to complete it?:I sure did.  It took me a little over 2 hours to complete the first chapter.  Thoroughly enjoying every minute of it too.  The story was just as good, if not better than, The Walking Dead’s and I will be waiting eagerly for the next episode.Recommended Purchase Price:I recommend that folks purchase the season pass for all five episodes, as the first episode seems to be only a taste of what is to come.  I will of course review each subsequent episode and update my recommendation should it be warranted.$24.99or100% of current retail value of $24.99http://www.gamersglance.com "

												Story set into one of the New York neighbourhoods where live all kinds of fairy characters after they were expelled from their Homelands by Exodus. The hero of this game is The Big Bad Wolf also known as Bigby Wolf, who is the scheriff of this town and protects it by keeping nonhuman-looking fables stay under Glamour spell or sending them to The farm outside the city. Bigby has really bad reputation among the fables 'cause of his history back in the Homeland and tries to make it better, or not it's players call, thats what you'd love on Tell Tale Games, the game depends on your decisions which makes gameplay more attractive and interesting. It's like watching TV series where you decide what the main character does or not.8.5 /10 "

												Wow Telltale you're amazing. I have never heard about fables and the comics this game is based on. I thought it's just a quick money grab for telltale after the success of their masterpiece The Walking dead, but i was wrong. This game is as good as WD. Amazing story, great voice acting. All the characters are interesting and have some mystery around them. After finishing each episode you just want to play the next one, same as watching a good TV series. And when it finishes you want more and start waiting for another season.All i want Telltale to improve in the future is graphics. Maybe not the graphics itself but animations should improve. But it's a very small flaw which makes this game worth 9,9 instead of 10.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is definitely a worthy game to play. Just like The Walking Dead, this is a game that relies on the choices the player makes, changing the course of events and altering the end.Characters are taken out of our favorite childrens book and imported into a modern society where the have to live hidden. The game is about solving a series of problems that come up, and restore the peace in their little society. This is not a game for children though, the game is brutal, full of violence and adult content (not sex).It's so far, GOTY 2014 (even though it was released last year, but only finished this year)... but it's gonna be hard to find a better game.

												The Wolf Among Us is another great example of Telltale's Unique Adventure Games. It is based on the universe of Fables, which I have no knowledge of whatsoever. However, I now realise it has a lot of memorable characters from fairy tales and well known books. There are countless references to them throughout the story, and I found them funny. To be honest, it is hard to take the game seriously when you consider where the characters originally came from.The story is, sadly, not as strong as the Walking Dead Games in my opinion. There is a character in the game who is quickly established as an a**hole and he is used in one of the games plot twists. I didn't find this suprising at all, but then again, there are less characters and locations in this game, which I find to be a strong suit of The Wolf Among us. It helps seperate the two. You will talk to the same characters many times, and you will visit locations that will quickly become familiar to you. Also, the ending did not offer much closure on the games many unanswered questions. This setups a second season quite nicely, and I do not see this as a bad thing.The game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard in a video game. Almost all of the lines are memorable, powerful, and superbly written and acted out. Some of the voice actors from the Walking Dead can be heard here too (Dave Fennoy, Lee and Gavin Hammon, Kenny). Dave takes up a polar opposite role by being one of the bad guys, and Kenny plays the Beast. While Dave plays his character superbly and differently to Lee, Gavin's lines are not acted any differently to the Walking Dead. He sounds the same. This is, of course, a personal complaint. The best actor in the game, hands down, is Adam Harrington who plays the Main Character, Bigby Wolf. I have no complaints about him; every line is excellent.The Wolf Among us also goes down the Adventure Game route more with the inclusion of the Book of Fables. Some of the entries are unlocked by exploring certain areas or taking different choices. I like this, as it offers replayability, something unheard of in any previous TellTale game. The game can play out in vastly different ways depending on your choices. They all have a very noticable and serious impact. Finally, this game is more action orientated than the Walking Dead. There are many QTE sections in the game, and they are the best I have ever played. Never before have I been intense pressing Q and moving left and right. No spoilers, but there are some awesome fighting sections in the game that makes you feel every strike made.Overall, The Wolf Among Us shows that Telltale is improving their unique genre of games with every release. It is intense, meaningful, weird, disgusting and brutal and is worth every penny. 9/10.			"

												This game is deeply engaging. Although gameplay is pretty  basic, but its the story that suck you in. Unlike other Telltale games where you decide on choices that are right or wrong, good or bad, this one explores the choices you make through shades of gray. Every decision you make is neither right or wrong, ultimately you have to look at your own moral compass and decide what is best for your character and the story in general. Voice acting is top notch, you immediate get swept away from a myriad of interesting characters that populate the story as you play each episode to the end. You get to explore everyone's strength and weaknesses, decipher what makes everyone tick and try to navigate the world through a series of conversations that are extremely well written. This game is a must have for everyone into a deep, immersive, story driven game.			"

												Surely a masterpiece, in a world losing its soul to soulless AAA games, this is a fresh air you fill your lungs with as much as you can. Every single aspect of the game; be it art, dialogues, voice acting or plot in general will make you glad that you are living this experience. Granted it's not an action game per-se but still like a book; what you see is more than enough to thrill you. 10/10 would get goosebumps again			"

												8/10 - You follow the story of detective Bigby Wolf on the case of a recent murder. Bigby and the gang all come from Fabletown, a world in which the characters are from well known children's fables; the big bag wolf and the like. They live in the real world and disguise themselves as humans (mundies as their known) to keep their identity secret. I'll leave it at that.If you've played Telltale's The Walking Dead, this is almost as high quality so you'll know what kind of ride you're in for. If not, you can expect the likes of drama, action, suspence and intrigue; coupled with constant dialogue options and interspersed throughout the games roughly 10 hours of playtime all combined to make for a thrilling experience.

												The Wolf Among Us, is perhaps the best game out there. With a gripping plot, and characters easy to sympathize with you will not regret spending money on it.The first episode of The Wolf Among Us showed us something new from Telltale. For the first time I've actually felt like I was in the game.. Like I was Bigby. It made me feel like I'm part of the story which no first-person game has ever made me feel. The third episode is the most gripping of them, and you get to see just how dark this game actually is.Definitively going to be ""Game of the Year"" when it is completed.10/10			"

Yet another masterpiece by Telltale.The Gameplay:The gameplay doesn't feature fast-action or shooting of any sort, as it is a point-and-click adventure, with some quicktime events. That's not a drawback at all, as the game has a charm through the gameplay. The gameplay is very similar to 'The Walking Dead', a game you should check out aswell.The Graphics:It's not hyper-realistic graphics, as in some of the newer games, but this game is made to resemble the comic-style, and it does it very well. The art-style is eye-catching, and add a nice touch.The Story: The story is probably the best part of the game, as in most Telltale games. You play as Bigby Wolf, also known as the Big Bad Wolf. You live in Fabletown, a secluded part of a real city. Fabletown is filled with all sorts of shady characters and interactions, and it's your job to sort it out. You will learn to love the characters and make difficult choices for them. The story of these characters are very dark and depressing, and they face some very harsh problems.Sounds: The voice-acting is great, and the sounds only adds to the experience. Not much to say here, you should mainly hear for yourself.If you liked 'The Walking Dead', you should purchase this game.If you have purchased this game and liked it, you should go get 'The Walking Dead'			"

												It's been a while since I write a review... so here goes nothing. The Wolf Among Us was amazing from start to finish, Telltale really shines in their newest game. It's based on the Fables comic book series. You play as Bigby Wolf, or The Big Bad Wolf, who is sheriff of Fabletown. It follows through a string of connected murdles that lead through an unpredictable story that's witty and deceptive. There's so much to love about this game, you can go into it knowing nothing of the comic series, as I did, and still get so much out of it. It's perfect as a prequel and it definitely sparked an interest to check out the comics. The story is strung together throughout all 5 episodes, and Bigby really shows why he's called The Big Bad Wolf, he makes a perfect sheriff and can definitely back up his bark with his bite, which episode 5 showcased completely what he's capable of if pushed to his limits. I thought episode 5 brought the season to a perfect close, but also leaves the door open just enough for a second season. The controls are easy, choosing what to say when prompted, exploring environments is fun and rewarding, and the script is perfect, especially Bigby's lines. It made me laugh, made me cry, made me sad, and I really felt like I connected with the characters and Fabletown. I really feel like this is Telltale's best work and that's saying something, considering how much I love The Walking Dead. There's nothing I can really say is wrong with the game, the choices you make seamlessly weave the story along and I felt like my choices affected the story in a way that felt very personal. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes comic books or fans of Telltale Games, or even if you liked The Walking Dead game....no not Survival Instinct. But definitely give it a try! You won't regret it. It has an amazing story, the graphics are beautiful and really looks like a comic book. The Wolf Among Us deserves so much more mainstream attention than it has received.TL;DR  One of the best story based games I have ever played hands down. They need to make a sequel to this game. Like seriously.			"

												Tagline: So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed...Great game. Warrants a second playthrough. Game engine is exactly like The Walking Dead game, difference is the choices were a lot more technical compared to emotional.Although there are no wrong decisions made as the story is customised to the way you play, the penalty is missing out on important plot detail. Simmilar to say reading a book and you decide to skip paragraphs. But that's where a second playthrough will help fill in the gaps.Selling point for this game is seeing popular fairy tale characters in a gritty poverty stricken environment. Fairy tales like Snow White, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow , The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Rumpelstiltskin, A Christmas Carol, The Wind in the Willows, Bloody Mary, Through the Looking-Glass, Three Little Pigs, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Donkeyskin... etc.This game ain't for kids...

												Easily the best Telltale game yet. Based upon the glorious comic book series ""Fables"" by Vertigo DC, The Wolf Among Us features a brutal and unique story where nothing is what it seems to be.Featuring a lot of options that alter your game, each gameplay is different and unique, which brings a lot of replayability and unique experiences for each player.The art direction is amazing, the music is superb, the voice acting is glorious and the story is easily the best I've seen in years.If you liked previous Telltale titles like The Walking Dead, Tales of Monkey Island, Back to the Future or Sam and Max, you need to play this game. But be prepared because this one is different and in many ways better: so far, this is what I call ""the ultimate Telltale experience"".			"

Posted: October 13, 2013
												Last year Telltale Games proved to everyone that their strategy of making episodic titles based on existing franchises could work with The Walking Dead. It was certainly one of my favorite games of the year.The Wolf Among Us is based on a slightly less well-known comic series called Fables. The premise is that the characters from the fairy tales that we grew up with left their homeland during a mass exodus and are now living among us. Specifically they live in a neighborhood of New York City called Fabletown, and the fables who can't pass as human have to use expensive spells called glamours to blend in. Because of this a lot of them have to live at The Farm, which is a community of fables located upstate away from the prying eyes of us mundies.The player character is Bigby Wolf (formerly the Big Bad Wolf) who now works as Fabletown's sheriff. They make it clear that most of the fables either fear him or simply don't trust him, so I took the angle that he would want to prove that he had changed his ways. Unfortunately circumstances threw me into a few fights anyway.The fights used quicktime events similar to The Walking Dead, but they seemed to go much more smoothly. There are also fewer puzzles; moreover investigating a crime scene is a lot more interesting than finding pills for a guy I thoroughly don't like.The art direction is absolutely gorgeous. I could literally take my screenshots and make a comic book out of them. Being that it is set in the 80s everything has a slightly neon tint to it and all of the major events seem to happen at night. A little cliché, but there you go.As with The Walking Dead the decisions you make during this episode will have consequences later on, mostly in the way you treat people. As much as I tried I think I may have done a few things that I will regret later on. This is a Telltale game after all.Episode 2:This episode played quite differently from the first one. In Episode 1 the player was confronted with several binary choices that were clearly presented as important moments. Episode 2's choices were much more dynamic, taking the form of ""how far are you willing to go to get the information you need?"" situations. I prefer this new approach to player choice because it is less gamey and doesn't take you out of the scene to make your decision. They were pretty tough decisions too, because I was trying really hard to redeem Bigby but at the same time I really needed to solve the case. And some of the other characters ticked me off. Another difference is that there are fewer fights in Episode 2. I suspect that this depends on the choices you make, but the way I played I only had to fight one person.The focus of Episode 2 is gathering information and following leads, but it hardly ever had me looking around a room for clues. The information was usually gathered in conversation with other people, oftentimes in some form of interrogation. In terms of actual story, not much new happened; it was mostly piecing together what had already happened. That said, the very end left us on another cliffhanger, one that will almost assuredly have a large impact on the story moving forward.Episode 3:The plot of The Wolf Among Us seems to be falling into a pattern; the majority of each episode is spent dealing with whatever shocking revelation was the cliffhanger of the previous episode, then they turn around and give us a new cliffhanger. The end of A Crooked Mile wasn't quite as shocking because they hinted at it a couple of times throughout the episode.I have been trying to have Bigby be as good a person as possible, which has been pretty difficult up until now because violence is a pretty natural shortcut. I believe I succeeded this time, mostly due to the fact that Telltale had Snow White present for many of the scenes. She has taken on the role of the moral compass the way Clementine did in The Walking Dead. The difference is that Clementine was a moral compass because Lee wanted to teach her right and wrong, while Snow White is a moral compass because Bigby is romantically interested in her.I can tell that I am doing a good job because there are several characters who used to be quite hostile towards Bigby who are now rather amiable. Now that I think about it there were a few people that I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off more. But they were people I didn't like anyway.A Crooked Mile is the first time I have seen Telltale make a self-referential joke. Conversations in their games will often have messages that say ""So-and-so will remember that"" when you have backed them up or opposed them. One scene involved a character who was on painkillers and decided to have a few drinks. After a while he passed out and the game said ""He won't remember this."" I was laughing so hard I was too late to take a good screenshot.Overall I think this was my favorite episode so far, especially since the end scene suggests that we are much closer to getting to the bottom of the whole thing. If you've been on the fence about The Wolf Among Us, I feel confident in recommending it now.Episode 4:I can tell that Telltale knows what they need to do for their interactive storytelling to work well. Over the course of The Wolf Among Us they have been slowly stripping away everything that doesn't directly add to the story they are trying to tell. The good thing is it gives each episode focus, with very little to distract the player. The bad thing is that they are in danger of stripping away too much in my opinion.In earlier episodes there were some very interesting segments where I had to either piece together evidence or interrogate someone for information. That is mostly gone, along with pretty much any area where I am free to walk around that look at objects or talk to whoever I want to. This also removes some of the opportunities for player choice. For example, during one conversation I didn't want to ask a character where an object I needed was because I didn't want him to know that I didn't have it. During his next speaking turn he told me anyway, which felt like the writers didn't really expect me to choose the option I went with. If I fail to say the right thing to get information, the game should let me fail.Another danger of stripping down the game is making the episodes too short. This is a little more subjective; some people like shorter episodes because they don't have a lot of time to dedicate to gaming, but I've come to expect episodes that are around two hours long.Overall I wouldn't say this was a high point in The Wolf Among Us, and I'm hoping they bring their best for the finale.

												Telltale has done it again they made a badass adventure game set in Bill Willingham's world of Fables (It's a graphic novel series that you can find on http://www.billwillingham.com/ if you want more mature stories) & I'll try my best to explain the game. WARNING IF YOU HATE SPOILERS, PROSTITUTION, SEEING YOUR FAVORITE FAIRYTALE CHARACTERS SUFFER, POLICE BRUTALITY (Mostly Bigby) & ALL SORTS OF OTHER♥♥♥♥♥♥HAPPEN THEN THIS GAME AIN'T FOR YOU!!!!!!So our game begins with the big bad wolf himself protecting most of the childhood fairytale characters we all know & love while trying to keep his cool towards the unbearable NPCs like the corrupt mayor Ichabod Crane for example but the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan when one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Faith a.k.a Donkeyskin Girl (It's a fable you can read off here http://www.kidsgen.com/fables_and_fairytales/donkeyskin.htm on this website) has her head laying on the front entrance of Bigby's apartment. Devastated by this tragedy Bigby prepares for his quest to find the culprit behind this terrible crime with the help of his old friend Snow White (He also has a crush on her & who wouldn't she may be animated but those♥♥♥♥♥♥& warm personality can drive any man mad with lust *howls at the moon*) while Bigby finally gets his violent personality back like any badass should (His past is really sad if you read the Winter Wolf fable & probably one of the main reasons he uses violence to solve his problems) to start wrecking havoc on any liars that cover up for the bad guys.From rampage to rampage (I won't go into detail because Bigby fights a lot of people) Bigby & Snow discover that a long crime war has been around for centuries started by Fabletown's professional mob boss The Crooked Man (If you paid attention in school there was a nursery rhyme called ""There Was A Crooked Man"" which is the same crooked man from the rhyme brought to life by Mr. Willingham) who is obviously the biggest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from using scare tactics on his hired help, getting other fables like Tweedle Dee & Dum to do his dirty work, Stealing from the poor, Corruption in the government (Crane was in charge of that) & lots of other crimes that would get you executed.Shocked by this news Bigby yet acts more of a badass to find proof related to all the crimes to catch the biggest fish in the sea (Violence included). After finding proof, killing the Crooked Man's henchman, capturing the mob boss himself, got the crowd supporting Bigby at the trial & punishing Crooked Man order is restored in FableTown so Bigby can finally relax for now. If Bigby wanted to he would have celebrated & maybe get lucky with Snow but we'll save that for another time we'll just let Bigby Drink & Smoke alone. (I hope you enjoyed my version of the story since I can't explain everything about the game)Pros:1. Badass Main Character2. Good Story3. Mature4. Depressing atmosphere5. Set in a comic book universe6. Believable emotions7. Memorable characters (Also dead ones lol)8. The game acts like a prequel to the comic book series9. Interesting character background stories you can read off the game menuCons:1. Some people may despise the Quick Time Events or how simplified the game is since point & click games have a history of being hard (I'm talking about the ones in the 90s & 80s)Overall if you like what you read then give some money to Telltale so they can make another game set in the Fable Universe & leave some feedback if I missed anything.

												I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead Telltale games, and, being a little morose when I'd completed them, I bought this on a whim whilst it was on sale for a few pounds. And then of course, I never looked at it again for a year or two. During a boring, slightly hungover Sunday, I decided to dig it out and give it a try.  I have absolutely no interest in superheroes, comics or even games set in a grimy, dark urban settings, so it was to my complete surprise that I absolutely loved this game! The game is, in simple terms, about a bunch of fables, myths or otherwise legendary characters who are all living an area of New York as their 'real' selves. Bigby, the anti-hero, is based on the Big Bad Wolf, and he's a sort of sheriff character, trying to rid the streets of crime from the likes of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Crooked Man and Georgie Porgie (who's a right a**e, let me tell you). Sh*t goes down, and Bigby ends up having to solve a murder linked directly to him, alongside Snow White, the assistant to the Mayor.  The gameplay is very much like TWD games, with point and click action, so if you liked those games, you're on to a winner with this one. The story is dramatic and really quite dark, with false paths, red herrings and unexpected developments throughout. It was an unusual story, and this game was one of those that stuck with me for days afterwards. Of course, being a Telltale adventure game, it makes you feel terrible about any choices you make. For any fan of TWD series and story driven adventure games, this is one you can't miss. It is well worth the full price, so wait for the sales and get it for a few pounds. You won't regret it.			"

												The Wolf Among us is a story based detective mystery. It is very similar to the Walking Dead in base mechanics like a heavy reliance on quick time events and plenty of dialogue.  The game takes place in New York, in a certain section in town where fairly tale characters live and appear human due to an expensive magic they have to acquire unless they want to be sent The Farm which is said to be like a prison of sorts. You play as Sheriff Bigby who was a former murder and is now tasked with keeping the  fantasy tale characters know as Fables safe. Bigby has quite a temper so even if you try to play as a saint in this game he will occasionally still be a jerk which adds to his character. This is not a game for kids. The cute talking animals are quite foul mouthed and there is plenty of pretty graphic violence and heavy subjects during your investigations.Gameplay is bare-bones. Fight scenes are just Quick time events as I've mentioned though they are pretty fun to watch since some Fables have super strength and all of them are very resilient to damage which leads to some pretty violent lengthy fights.  When given control of the character you can interact with a few predetermined items and talk with characters. There are never really any puzzles or actual investigating which I found rather disappointing considering the plot revolves around mystery. Most of the leads can be found simply by talking or plain assaulting a suspect. It is very linear and when you are given a choice where to go most of the times you will go to the place you didn't pick afterwards anyways. Your choices to play as a “man” chasing redemption through justice or a psychotic tormentor are pretty cool since sometimes you just really want to maim someone instead of arresting them.The artstyle in this game is superb. The town looks really run down and the neon soaked streets just add so much charm. Cell shading really fits the game perfectly. Everywhere you journey to is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, odd mystical creatures or plane unsavory hostile sorts. You never really meet any one normal and only see regular humans on the background in some scenes, never interacting with them. When Fables show their true forms more often than not they look horrifying but lucky your character Bigby is more than capable to take most of them on. Also there is nudity and pretty detailed gore which fits the gritty tone of the game but once again I must say do not be fooled by the screenshots thinking this is a game for children.The sound track is amazing and definitely one of my favorites of 2014. It is a kind of fusion between moody, techno and mystery which fit the game like a glove. Voice acting is pretty good as well which is a must for such a heavily dialogue driven game. One thing that caught me off guard was the same actor that plays Clementine in the Walking Dead plays a child frog called Toad Jr. Having just played the walking dead it was plain odd seeing a frog talk while Clementine's voice comes out of its mouth. Nothing wrong with that, just something I found funny that I wanted to mention. Sounds effects are pretty satisfying too. Sounds great when you throw or get thrown several feet through the air and break a wall and its to the appeal of the super hero like fight scenes.As to be expected from Telltale the story is the best part of the game. You never really know what to expect since the world is so odd and unique. You start off investigating a murder but as to be expected things quickly become much more complicated. It starts off pretty strong but the villains don't really do anything else bad after the first episode which makes you lose some interest as you simply investigate because it is your character's job and to play the game you bought instead of being actually invested in the mystery and the culprit. Don't get me wrong it's a decent enough tale but quickly loses steam and it takes quite awhile to regain some. It's just too bad that a mystery game ends on a cliffhanger which leaves you completely unsatisfied. Characters themselves are all memorable with very different personalities and oddities. In the end I'd say this is a very enjoyable game for those looking for a good story and an odd world that you will remember long after you beat the game.  I did experience a glitch twice that made me go exit to the main menu due to not being able to pick any choices in dialogue but those all happened right after a quick save and hence was a very minor issue.  Don't be expecting to be using brainpower during this title though. It is heavily on rails and you will discover everything through talking and quick time events. If you are fine with that then I can see no reason not to suggest this game. This a very unique experience that should be tried by anyone that loves story based games.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is the shortest Telltale adventure game series I've played so far but it's turned out to be one of my favourites. Its unique setting with downtrodden fairy tale characters living in an 80s New York (courtesy of Bill Willingham's Fables) seems to be a perfect match for an adventure game - or a visual novel with Quick Time Events (which I believe is a more accurate description of Telltale's adventure games from the past couple of years). Is it better than The Walking Dead? I personally think so, but only because I like solving murder mysteries. Both games are good in their own right but while one explores the human condition against a backdrop of zombie apocalypse, the other provides a grittier, seedier epilogue to fairy tale characters we grew up learning about as kids.

												Telltale Games deliver yet another brilliant game, this time taking from the source material of the comic book series, Fables.Pros+ Brilliant story, I don't think any episode lacked at all.+ Various intresting characters, all based off fairytales. Some you may know, and there are probably a few you don't.+ Book of fables, a collectable in the game. Unique to The Wolf Among Us (As far as I am aware) which provide insight to characters and the story.+ Improved combat, at least better than what I saw in TT'S TWD. Simple yet fun.+ Several plot twists you will not see coming!Cons- Like every Telltale game, your choices do not radically change the game.- Rather short, even for a telltale game. Only took me about six and a half hours to complete.I would highly recommened this game, and I do hope that one day there will be a Season two. About new characters or about the ones we know, I don't mind, as long as it feels like a sequel.			"

												I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead Telltale games, and, being a little morose when I'd completed them, I bought this on a whim whilst it was on sale for a few pounds. And then of course, I never looked at it again for a year or two. During a boring, slightly hungover Sunday, I decided to dig it out and give it a try.  I have absolutely no interest in superheroes, comics or even games set in a grimy, dark urban settings, so it was to my complete surprise that I absolutely loved this game! The game is, in simple terms, about a bunch of fables, myths or otherwise legendary characters who are all living an area of New York as their 'real' selves. Bigby, the anti-hero, is based on the Big Bad Wolf, and he's a sort of sheriff character, trying to rid the streets of crime from the likes of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Crooked Man and Georgie Porgie (who's a right a**e, let me tell you). Sh*t goes down, and Bigby ends up having to solve a murder linked directly to him, alongside Snow White, the assistant to the Mayor.  The gameplay is very much like TWD games, with point and click action, so if you liked those games, you're on to a winner with this one. The story is dramatic and really quite dark, with false paths, red herrings and unexpected developments throughout. It was an unusual story, and this game was one of those that stuck with me for days afterwards. Of course, being a Telltale adventure game, it makes you feel terrible about any choices you make. For any fan of TWD series and story driven adventure games, this is one you can't miss. It is well worth the full price, so wait for the sales and get it for a few pounds. You won't regret it.			"

												The Wolf Among us is a story based detective mystery. It is very similar to the Walking Dead in base mechanics like a heavy reliance on quick time events and plenty of dialogue.  The game takes place in New York, in a certain section in town where fairly tale characters live and appear human due to an expensive magic they have to acquire unless they want to be sent The Farm which is said to be like a prison of sorts. You play as Sheriff Bigby who was a former murder and is now tasked with keeping the  fantasy tale characters know as Fables safe. Bigby has quite a temper so even if you try to play as a saint in this game he will occasionally still be a jerk which adds to his character. This is not a game for kids. The cute talking animals are quite foul mouthed and there is plenty of pretty graphic violence and heavy subjects during your investigations.Gameplay is bare-bones. Fight scenes are just Quick time events as I've mentioned though they are pretty fun to watch since some Fables have super strength and all of them are very resilient to damage which leads to some pretty violent lengthy fights.  When given control of the character you can interact with a few predetermined items and talk with characters. There are never really any puzzles or actual investigating which I found rather disappointing considering the plot revolves around mystery. Most of the leads can be found simply by talking or plain assaulting a suspect. It is very linear and when you are given a choice where to go most of the times you will go to the place you didn't pick afterwards anyways. Your choices to play as a “man” chasing redemption through justice or a psychotic tormentor are pretty cool since sometimes you just really want to maim someone instead of arresting them.The artstyle in this game is superb. The town looks really run down and the neon soaked streets just add so much charm. Cell shading really fits the game perfectly. Everywhere you journey to is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, odd mystical creatures or plane unsavory hostile sorts. You never really meet any one normal and only see regular humans on the background in some scenes, never interacting with them. When Fables show their true forms more often than not they look horrifying but lucky your character Bigby is more than capable to take most of them on. Also there is nudity and pretty detailed gore which fits the gritty tone of the game but once again I must say do not be fooled by the screenshots thinking this is a game for children.The sound track is amazing and definitely one of my favorites of 2014. It is a kind of fusion between moody, techno and mystery which fit the game like a glove. Voice acting is pretty good as well which is a must for such a heavily dialogue driven game. One thing that caught me off guard was the same actor that plays Clementine in the Walking Dead plays a child frog called Toad Jr. Having just played the walking dead it was plain odd seeing a frog talk while Clementine's voice comes out of its mouth.

												First of all, i'm a huge fan of Telltale Games, so basically i'm gonna recommend this :)There isn't much to say about this game actually, it's just like TWD except that you are such a bad a$$ wolf who can make others suffer by ripping their hands or chop their heads off! (and that's fckin amazing if u ask me!!).It has a lot of action, a lot of choices, and a lot of consequences.-So, what do i like about this game?--EVERYTHING!!! starting from the main menu, storyline, gameplay, soundtracks (which is amazing), characters, and the choice to change and be the good guy for ones, as you are basically the bad guy (wolf) who everyone is afraid of!.Enough saying! just buy this game and u won't regret it, it deserves every penny! :)			"

												Surprisingly good  (if short) visual novel/interactive movie.Honestly - I haven't even expected it to be good, my last Telltale game was Sam and Max, and it wasn't even decent in comparsion to original game. But it seems that developers learned their lesson, tightened up their writing, and finally have gotten familiar with their cellshaded engine.I'm not a big fan of comic series which this game is based upon, but authors managed to stay true to original characterisation and even given some supporting characters more depth. Voice acting is also surprised me, while not phenomenal, it was really good.So on a plus side we have:1) graphics - it really looks like a comic, and some scenes are screenshot-worthy;2) voice acting - like I said, not phenomenal, but surprisingly good; 3) plot - it's hard to describe it and avoid spoilers at the same time, but I almost wish that it would have been AU instead of prequel; it stays true to characterization and setting of the original Fables, and simultaniously gives surprising depth to secondary, and, to lesser extent, main characters.The game has a few minuses though:1) length (I realize that it's an episodic game, but an episode should be more ""meaty"", IMO);2) console controls (it really shows that the games were developed with a controller in mind, and not mouse + keyboard; mouse acceleration is awfull, and controls are sometimes awkward);3) the fact that it's a prequel (if they are to stay true to the story, then they just can't kill characters which later will appear in the comics, it somewhat ruins the element of surprise);4) music, especially the main theme (most music in game is forgettable, but ""DUN... TU-DUN. DUN... TU-DUN. tim-dam-dam."" main theme is just grating).****/*****			"

												Even though the horror genre is generally lost on me -- especially zombie fiction -- I'm a huge fan of Telltale's The Walking Dead. The writing, particularly dialogue and characterization, really sets the bar about as high as it can possibly get in video games.I was naturally excited to play The Wolf Among Us, though I decided to wait until the summer sale this year to play it so I could experience it in a binge, like I did when I played The Walking Dead Season One last summer.This series lives up to the high standard set by The Walking Dead, and it appeals even more to me than that series does. The characters are fantastic, the dialogue is expertly written and even quite humorous at times, though the story itself is really quite dark. The characters are all very relatable, and they've got their own issues they're dealing with. At the core of the story is the conflict between who people are and their struggle between their nature and who they ultimately wish to be. It's deep stuff, and the fact that the game is populated with a number of very real personalities makes it hit all the more harder. I particularly liked characters like Woody and Gren; people who come off as your typical villains when first introduced but eventually develop into fully rounded characters with very real flaws, should you allow them to. And, of course, Bigby. Though he ultimately is what you make him, I found that each path you could potentially take is a totally fleshed out, meaningful one. Kudos to the writers, because producing that kind of a narrative can't be an easy thing to design a video game around.The gameplay is pretty sparse, just like it was in The Walking Dead. All quicktime events, with some very stripped-down '90s style point-and-click adventure exploration thrown in as well. I could understand how that may turn some people off, but if you're here for story and characterization (as I am) then it shouldn't bother you much. This game doesn't shy away from what it's strengths are to fit other expectations. It's a story-driven experience, first and foremost, and it's not self conscious about that, which is relieving. I think that trying to shoehorn in some shooting or deeper gameplay would have just distracted from its strengths.The art style is, at its core, the same as The Walking Dead. But the color palette here is spruced up in various shades of warm oranges, neon reds and pinks, and cooler purples. Nothing is really gray or brown. The streets are a cold slate, buildings mimicing the streets, with glowing yellow windows throughout the buildings. Most of the game is set at night, and the artists are obviously shooting for a noir feel, which is helped along by a pretty solid soundtrack. While the basic art style is familiar to Telltale's other efforts, I have to say that it's much improved from the drabness that I felt hurt The Walking Dead. This is a really, really fun game to look at, and though the writing is utterly fantastic, it doesn't have to rely only on that to keep it standing like The Walking Dead did.If you're a fan of Telltale's The Walking Dead, you already know that you should probably buy this. If you're unfamiliar with that title, but you're interested in a strong narrative with a good atmospheric feel, then I can't recommend this game enough. I'm really enjoying it, and I can't wait to play the finale this upcoming Tuesday. But if you're looking for more action, or a more ""gamey"" game, then you'll probably want to look elsewhere.And man, I really can't wait for their adaptation of Game Of Thrones.			"

												Absolutely amazing game, from start to finish. The story is gripping, the art style is eye-catching, and the voice acting is superb. There are a few odd glitches though. Whenever Steam pops up an achievement notification, it's always during a loading screen and it can make the loading process lag. Three times when this happened, it glitched out the game to where it would skip one or more scenes, immediately thrust me into a dialogue choice, and every option would be blank. Thankfully, the autosave feature is well-implemented, so I can just return to the start menu, continue the story, and proceed as normal. One other odd thing is that in many of the action sequences, if you are playing with a 360 controller, if a prompt comes up to press the right trigger (or vice versa) you can hit the left trigger and it still registers as being the correct button. This isn't necessarily a negative, since many of these instances give you barely any time to react, it's just kinda weird.Overall, 12/10 game. Would slap Toad again.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is filled to the brim with choices and some of these are really important. It is something I have not experienced before, not on this scale. The Walking Dead is not even close. what really intensifies the decision making is the protagonist of Bigby Wolf. A crude anti-hero that you can role play a bit with. During my first playthrough, I chose a direct route, I had the opportunity to violence when it became so - and the blood flowed. A private investigator got a taste of my fist, another man's face I introduced into a glass bottle and then I tore an arm off. Because I'm the big bad wolf.As the rhythmic music flows, I wander aimlessly around while dark figures pass me by. My white shirt is rumpled and unkempt, with sleeves rolled-up. My black tie is loose, but I do not care in the slightest. The neon purple lights cast sharp shadows on me and framing my bitter facial expression. Then I fall into the darkness, my eyes shimmering yellow for a moment. I lead the cigarette to my lips and takes a puff: it brightens up my face ... My name is Bigby Wolf and I'm Fable Towns sheriff. It all reminds me of the series Once Upon a Time. We are in a city populated by mythical beings disguised as ordinary people - refugees from the city that obviously is not quite as it was told to me as a small child. Fable Town was a promised new beginning but the oh so familiar bureaucracy is hard on the less fortunate. It is a painful story that already after the first episode feels hopeless. No happy ending in sight, just dark storm clouds.The Wolf Among Us is an interactive story where the gameplay takes a back seat . Even more than in Telltale Games last Games, The Walking Dead. Most time will be spent in the dialogues and quick time events, the fact is that the game is full of them. In such a dialogue driven games, it is essential that both the voice actors and the script is good. With a broad smile, I can say that Telltale Games has outdone themselves many times over. Nothing sounds contrived, it is an exceptional performance.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is a thrilling action adventure based on the award winning Comic book series ""Fables"". In Fables all the figures from your childhood, like Snow White, Red Riding Hood and many many more came two the Mundie (non-magic) world during the 'Exodus' to find a better live. In the Homelands they suffered surpression, death, enprisonment. But can they solve the problems of a everyday human in Fabletown, NY?You follow Bigby Wolf (the big bad wolf), detective and protector of Fabletown, while he uncovers the mysteries behind a murdered prostitude, he also tries to leave behind his past as one of the major villians in the Homelands. But is both achievable?Telltale has yet again created a very unique game with a very immersive and dark story about Power, Poverty and Emotions. Positiv+ Dark and thrilling story+ While being ""rather"" short it does not feel as something is lacking. Quality over quantity ;)+ Talltales unique art style/graphics+ likeable characters + the decisions you make will have an impact on how the story unfolds and how the others will react to your presenceNegativ- missing gameplay like puzzles or riddles like in other adventures- a lot of Quick-Time-Events (QTE's)What to expect from TWAU?:You can expect a thrilling detective/noir story which will get you really excited! But if you are looking for a ""real"" game with ""complex"" game mechanics, puzzles ect. you will be dissappointed. If you played ""The Walking Dead"" and are familiar to Telltales work and liked it, then you will definitly like this game too! Now with all episodes, so no forced breaks, you will find it hard to not play it through at once!In Numbers: 85/100 Points "

												Telltale strikes again with a beautiful adaptation of the comic series Fables, and the result is mesmerizing. If you love fairytales retelling and film noir mood, you'll love this game. You play as Bigby - nickname for the Big Bad Wolf - the sheriff in charge of the community of Fables, and you start right off the hook with a murder to resolve. The characters, the story, the humour, everything is delightful and I can guarantee you'll love seeing your favorite fairytale figures in a modern setting and how they have adapted to fit into the human world. As for the gameplay, it's all about the story: the choices you make shape the events unfolding and the reactions of the people around you, so there's a dozen of possible outcomes and dialogues you can trigger depending on how you react and how you answer. All in all, a very good game, and definitely one of my favorite these days.			"

												This game is fantastic the story had me hooked from the start, and at the end of every episode i wanted to start the next straight away! the choices are great and can only imagine the second play through being just as fun choosing a different path for bigby to playout! The only bad part about the game is the length i didnt realise how much time i was playing the game each episode is around 90mins long give or take but really felt like 10mins as i was sucked into the world of the fables!11/10 would recommend to anybody this game has soo much to offer!

												If you are looking for a puzzle filled adventure game........well you won't get it here. But if you play them for the story and characters, then I can't recommend this enough. Its basically dialogue trees and quick time events just like every Tell Tale game since Walking Dead. If you have no idea what Fables is about, this is a pretty good introduction but wikipedia will help fill in some gaps. I got a crap computer and this game ran it smooth and still looked beautiful. Glitched once with a dialogue tree but restarting the game fixed it.			"

												I went into this game pretty blind, I had my assumptions about the game( I thought it was more of a werewolf thing not The  Big Bad Wolf) I knew the reviews were extremely positive and I knew how the TellTale Games were played as I had played the two seasons Of The Walking Dead and enjoyed them. You play as Bigby Wolf A.K.A The Big Bad Wolf from many fairy tales, the game has many colorful characters all from various fairy tales and myths i.e Snow White, The Woodsman, Big Bad Wolf, Ichabod Crane and many many more. I loved the story because it brough the fairy tales we were all told as a kid but brought them into a deep dark adult world and showed what it would be like if these characters were real.The controls are the same as the other Telltale games so if you've played any of them you should know mostly what to expect though I think this one did the controls better than The Walking Dead series as far as the action sequences go.The story was great and had quiet a few twists and turns early and often I was really surprised I enjoyed this game as much as I did and it definitely blew away any expectations I had before playing it.

UPD: Updated for season's finale. Also added a quick TWAU vs TWD comparison, in case anybody is curious.What a beauty.  Excellent writing, art-direction and voice acting, as expected of Telltale. There's absolutely no reason for me to not recommend this to the fans of Telltale's episodic games, or otherwise anyone else interested in what this is all about. Well, unless you're for some reason not fond of the visual style Telltale's been using, can't stand the copious amounts of cartoony gore, or simply hate fairy tales, except this one definitely lacks a happy ending.Speaking from an artist's perspective, The Wolf Among Us blows The Walking Dead completely out of the water in terms of visual narration (well, we're obviously not talking a brown and muddy zombie apocalypse here), it's a lot more colorful and cinematographic, and the attention to detail in some shots is mindblowing - I could barely prevent myself from hitting F12 every time another pretty picture popped up on my screen.Having previously never read the Fables comics that the game is based on, I cannot speak for the faithfulness of the adaptation, but I can assure you that Telltale's writers took great care that the player/reader never gets lost in the story: you don't have to resort to looking up information in order to familiarize yourself with ANY of the characters, or the setting.It's very difficult to speak about the story without spoiling it one way or another, so let me just draw a quick comparison of this game to The Walking Dead one:- More action. Game is packed to the gills with quick time events. Expect a lot of frantic button mashing, especially when you're not expecting it.- More gore. TWAU is a game practically soaked in blood. You'd think TWD would be more gory due to the whole Zombie Apocalypse business going on, but it makes perfect sense in the end as TWD takes a far more realistic approach. TWAU? Expect fountains of blood gushing out. On top of a pile of torn off limbs. It's okay, it'll all heal back anyway! Now let's do it again!- More talk. Remember that this game is a hardboiled detective drama. I wouldn't say it has puzzle elements per se, but you do get to conduct a few interrogations and listen to some teary-eyed claims, which is a welcome change of pace from ripping people's limbs off and beating them to a bloody pulp with said limbs. Or vice versa.- More choices. Don't get me wrong, the game still does not allow you complete freedom, but the impact of your actions/words feels quite a bit more severe than in TWD. Game continuously forces you to choose between several options, thus adding quite a bit of replayability value. And that's great.All in all, it's quite a thrilling ride, and, considering its ending, I'm fairly sure we're not yet done with this story... Not even one bit.			"

Delve deep into the depths of grit & violence, encounter characters from legends and folklore as you unravel secrets within the mythical enclave known as Fabletown.For every question there is an answer. For every problem there is a solution. For everything else... there is an explanation. ""These lips are sealed."" "

												The Wolf Among Us is a game I never really expected much from, but was completely blown away. I will even admittedly say that I may have even enjoyed this series more than TellTale's famous The Walking Dead series.--Final thoughts at the bottom--GameplayThe game play is reminiscent to TellTales other adventure games. You progress through the story by investigating areas to find useful information or a way of proceding to the next area. Their is no complex puzzles or anything to get you stuck as the game is heavily story related so it tries to keep you progressing. Most of the gameplay is about carefully choosing your response to conversations or story event where you must choose between doing X or doing Y. Quicktime events fill in alot of the action parts and add to the intensity.GraphicsThe cell shaded art style fits perfectly into this world they have created. The characters are well drawn and animated, some feel very recognizable. The facial movements and body movements look good, however some people still seem to walk like they have a stick up their butt(This is an issue I have with all TellTale games). The world they have created sets the perfect setting for how the story takes place. The amount of detail they went into on some of the level design is very well done, even in places you arent around for very long. Its nice to see them still put the detail in to make this feel like a live breathing world.AudioThe sound is done very well in The Wolf Among Us. The background noise and ambience was well done. The music is superb for the style they are going for in this game. The theme song kinda reminds me of Farcry 3: Blood Dragon music. The ingame music was very good at setting the mood for the events happening as well as for the areas you were exploring.The voice over work is phenomenal and is what brings this story to life. The voices chosen for each character fit their rolls perfectly. Not once did I hear any voice that I thought to myself ""that doesn't fit"". The emotions are portrayed very well through their voices and sucks the player into the story. Top notch voice acting all around.StoryThe story is where this game really shines. I must admit I was never really interested in this game, nor did I really here to much about it, other than ""Its good"". So I went in knowing nothing about the plot or anything. Wow was I blown away by what I experienced.It takes place in a place known as ""Fabletown"" which is a small community of fables built on the outskirts of a real world city(I believe its New York). This community is build up of Fables who have left ""The woodlands"" and have moved into city to live in a real society. However when murders start happening, fabletown turns to terror. You, Bigby Wolf, AKA the big bad wolf, being the sheriff must hunt down and get to the bottom of whoever is behind it. One way or Another. This is The Wolf Among Us's biggest feature. The choices. Every choice you make in this game effects the story severely, even more than TellTales other games. In the walking dead when you madea choice it always felt like no matter what you did it would still end up being the same result, however the wolf among us does the opposite. Every choice effects how people in fabletown view you, which in turn effects trust, reliability, story arc changes and much more. You begin to really care about the characters. You begin to take more time with decisions, knowing that what you do could make characters love or hate you and this could effect how useful they are to you down the line. The story progresses very fluently and keeps you wanting to know more. Their are loads of plot twists that will keep your mind bumbling for more answers. Just when you think you got it figured out, *BAM!!* plot twist. my only complaint about the story was that it was rather short, I played through all 5 episodes in less than 8hrs.Final thoughtsAfter going into this game knowing nothing about it other than ""its good"", I must say I was blown away by the world they created, and The story had me hooked and thinking about it even when I wasnt playing. The way this game makes you care for its characters is incredible and the obsolutely phenomenal voice over work brings them to life with a voice. The animation and level design is gorgeously done in TellTale's signature cell shaded art and everything plays very smooth with a smooth looking framerate, which is I know alot of problem had with the first season of the walking dead. If you are looking for a game with a unique world and setting, with an amazing story. Then you will love the Wolf Among Us. If you are on the fence about this game, its definetly worth the buy. For a game I wasnt expecting much out of, I must say I think this may be my favourite game created by TellTale(Yes even better than the walking dead).			"

												Anyone else getting this awkward feeling Telltale Games has a really objectionable stance towards tangible gameplay? They continue with their steady decline away from it in the effort to focus on storytelling instead, as if the two are mutually exclusive somehow in their mind. Having said that, The Wolf Among Us manages to deliver a compelling story, if a bit blase for the fans of the detective genre, which manages to keep you engaged and its structure as a mystery seems to work really well with the now alredy tried-and-true episodic format. Extremely well-realized main character benefits from having relatively diverse dialog options which help define his personality along the way, whether he ends up as a chain-smoking stoic or someone else depending on your choices. Supporting characters succeed at being memorable, with couple of exceptions, and help propel the game further with possible future twists and turns hinted towards by the game's system messages.In the end, this is a game bearing Telltale Games' characteristic hallmarks and flair - you know what to expect length-wise, characterization-wise and you're already crossing your fingers for another season. Make it happen.			"

												Telltale doing once again what they do best, delivering a compelling story with choices that matter and consequences which carry on through the entire game. I enjoyed this different take on the fables as it places them in a very different setting than we are used to. And as a detective story it kept you interested by letting you uncover the plot one piece at a time. But you are doing more than just clicking objects and picking dialogue options. The combat was made interactive, and while sometimes a little bit too fast (could be due to playing with a controller?) it make me feel very much engaged and in charge of what was going to happen.

												This game was so great that I ended up spending close to $200 on comics, and I know I'm going to spend more. It's a well-crafted story (something Telltale has shown they're pretty good at) that does a good job of captivating the player's attention and motivating them to find out just what's going on in Fabletown. As far as gameplay goes, it's pretty much just like Telltale's more recent games, but morally questionable choices dripping with consequences, QTEs, and excellent dialogue are far from bad. All in all, it's fantastic. I played it through a few times to see all the choices/get all the achievements, and it's really cool to see what Telltale did with the Fables universe.			"

Telltale nailed it once again!You play as Bigby Wolf trying to solve what at first looked like a simple murder, and at the same time, trying to supress your brutal instincts (or not). Lots of unexpected events and tense moments, with a great Noire atmosphere.I will probably play it again from the start, this time being a total prick.I really look forward to grabbing the graphic novels this game is based on...

												The Wolf Among Us is a Telltale Adventure game in the vein of The Walking Dead series. It takes place in the world of the Fables comics, where characters from myths and fairytales are alive and living in modern-day New York. Through the course of the game, you make choices through dialog trees and point-and-click adventure gameplay, which can cause (mildly) divergent paths throughout the plotline, making the game's experience your own. The story itself deals with a noir-esque mystery, where you take on the role of Sheriff Big B. Wolf, aiming to solve a murder.The game, taken as a whole, is very well crafted. Voice acting is top-notch, and there's some rather subtle lore and information spread throughout - it was wholly enjoyable and I highly recommend it. The one negative that I would say about the game is that there are a large number of action sequences which use QTE to resolve themselves, so if QTE are not your cup of tea, that may drag down on your opinion of the game. It's difficult to get into much greater detail without delving into the plot itself, which is the whole point with these games, so I'll leave it at that. Highly recommended.			"

The one negative that I would say about the game is that there are a large number of action sequences which use QTE to resolve themselves, so if QTE are not your cup of tea, that may drag down on your opinion of the game. It's difficult to get into much greater detail without delving into the plot itself, which is the whole point with these games, so I'll leave it at that. Highly recommended.			"

You've just imagined this game in your head. Story wise it's quite interesting from playing only the first episode. You're a warewolf investigating a crime that involves Snow White, Beauty & The Beast, Magic Mirror and other fables. That's really all I can say about the story thus far, but from what I've seen I believe this story will be quite interesting,			"

												First off, this game ruined my childhood.That said, I absolutely recommend it. Amazing story, art, music and voice acting. Telltale nailed it once again!You play as Bigby Wolf trying to solve what at first looked like a simple murder, and at the same time, trying to supress your brutal instincts (or not). Lots of unexpected events and tense moments, with a great Noire atmosphere.I will probably play it again from the start, this time being a total prick.I really look forward to grabbing the graphic novels this game is based on...

												Telltale has successfully applied their 'The Walking Dead' formula & mechanics, this time capturing the essence of film noir and (hopefully) the Fables comic (which I haven't read). The Wolf Among Us takes more cues than ever from cinema, with ample establishing shots between acts, vignettes from interesting angles and simulated lens effects. These little details all help create depth and atmosphere and well, I just love that kinda stuff.The writing is fairly decent and the characters are likeable. Since it's a fairytale-inspired comic-inspired noir, it's difficult in fairness to call anything cliché or one-dimensional, though objectively I suppose much of it is. I prefer to call it heavily themed or stylised. Whatever, it works.Most of the interaction is superficial and the game is rather linear, but I didn't mind because the interaction served well to keep me engaged in the story while giving the impression of nonlinearity. However, a much enticing replay will quickly expose this illusion leaving you disappointed. Just play it once and live with your choices. Let it be.LIKES: -Amazing art direction, lighting & palette had me in screenshot frenzy.-Top notch voice acting for a game. Subtle, moody soundtrack adds a heap.-Plentiful badassitude.DISLIKES:-Predictable formula makes all the decisions about how people will judge you, rather than the logical path, or the role playing path. This heavily influenced my choices. However, see next point.-Telltale say the choices matter. This is a lie. They are merely noted upon.-The ending was a huge disappointment after some great mystery and drama along the way. It left me wanting a more compelling climax and plot twist.			"

												This game is astounding in it's presentation, storytelling and overall production. Telltale Games IMO has become the masters of adventure games and interactive storytelling. This is a high tech ""choose your own adventure"" story book. The story itself was gripping. The acting was very good. The cinematic feel to it was very engaging. I haven't taken in an adventure game so good since the Walking Dead series or even Grimm Fandango. Trust me, for the price you will get far more entertainment value than any movie in theaters. Plus no crying babies, overpriced popcorn and you can sip all the Scotch you want.			"

												This is a contender with The Walking Dead: Season 1 for Telltale's best game in my eyes. If one is taking art direction into consideration, this is easily the most beautiful game Telltale has ever released. The stylings are gorgeous, the mood pitch-perfect, and that intro sequence has me wanting a Season 2 for more of them alone.I wasn't the slightest bit familiar with the Fables universe going into this game, and it would be fair to say my expectations were set very low. That said: I was sold on it by the time Bigby lit his cigarette, the reverb of his lighter flick springboarding into a slick, fantastically atmospheric musical intro sequence.I experienced a lot of moments in this game like that. Be it the sound, art, writing, or the voice acting (let me shout out Bigby again here); this is an inspired piece of work from top to bottom. I finished episode 5 tonight and the afterglow is incredible.			"

												Anyone else getting this awkward feeling Telltale Games has a really objectionable stance towards tangible gameplay? They continue with their steady decline away from it in the effort to focus on storytelling instead, as if the two are mutually exclusive somehow in their mind. Having said that, The Wolf Among Us manages to deliver a compelling story, if a bit blase for the fans of the detective genre, which manages to keep you engaged and its structure as a mystery seems to work really well with the now alredy tried-and-true episodic format. Extremely well-realized main character benefits from having relatively diverse dialog options which help define his personality along the way, whether he ends up as a chain-smoking stoic or someone else depending on your choices. Supporting characters succeed at being memorable, with couple of exceptions, and help propel the game further with possible future twists and turns hinted towards by the game's system messages.In the end, this is a game bearing Telltale Games' characteristic hallmarks and flair - you know what to expect length-wise, characterization-wise and you're already crossing your fingers for another season. Make it happen.			"

Telltale are really pumping out amazing quality adult games these days, and after the glory that was The Walking Deads season 1, there just doesn't seem to be any stoping them. The graphic style is even more stylized and gorgeous in this game, and the story is absolutely intriguing. I'm really, really looking forward to continuing this, and if you are looking for a good time, enjoy the noir style this is using, and are a fan of The Walking Dead game, you really need to give this one a try. I was unsure for quite a while if I would actually enjoy it, and I am very, very glad that I picked it up. Telltale, you are simly amazing right now. Keep up the fantastic work!			"

												The Wolf Among Us is a game I never really expected much from, but was completely blown away. I will even admittedly say that I may have even enjoyed this series more than TellTale's famous The Walking Dead series.--Final thoughts at the bottom--GameplayThe game play is reminiscent to TellTales other adventure games. You progress through the story by investigating areas to find useful information or a way of proceding to the next area. Their is no complex puzzles or anything to get you stuck as the game is heavily story related so it tries to keep you progressing. Most of the gameplay is about carefully choosing your response to conversations or story event where you must choose between doing X or doing Y. Quicktime events fill in alot of the action parts and add to the intensity.GraphicsThe cell shaded art style fits perfectly into this world they have created. The characters are well drawn and animated, some feel very recognizable. The facial movements and body movements look good, however some people still seem to walk like they have a stick up their butt(This is an issue I have with all TellTale games). The world they have created sets the perfect setting for how the story takes place. The amount of detail they went into on some of the level design is very well done, even in places you arent around for very long. Its nice to see them still put the detail in to make this feel like a live breathing world.AudioThe sound is done very well in The Wolf Among Us. The background noise and ambience was well done. The music is superb for the style they are going for in this game. The theme song kinda reminds me of Farcry 3: Blood Dragon music. The ingame music was very good at setting the mood for the events happening as well as for the areas you were exploring.The voice over work is phenomenal and is what brings this story to life. The voices chosen for each character fit their rolls perfectly. Not once did I hear any voice that I thought to myself ""that doesn't fit"". The emotions are portrayed very well through their voices and sucks the player into the story. Top notch voice acting all around.StoryThe story is where this game really shines. I must admit I was never really interested in this game, nor did I really here to much about it, other than ""Its good"". So I went in knowing nothing about the plot or anything. Wow was I blown away by what I experienced.It takes place in a place known as ""Fabletown"" which is a small community of fables built on the outskirts of a real world city(I believe its New York). This community is build up of Fables who have left ""The woodlands"" and have moved into city to live in a real society. However when murders start happening, fabletown turns to terror. You, Bigby Wolf, AKA the big bad wolf, being the sheriff must hunt down and get to the bottom of whoever is behind it. One way or Another. This is The Wolf Among Us's biggest feature. The choices. Every choice you make in this game effects the story severely, even more than TellTales other games. In the walking dead when you madea choice it always felt like no matter what you did it would still end up being the same result, however the wolf among us does the opposite. Every choice effects how people in fabletown view you, which in turn effects trust, reliability, story arc changes and much more. You begin to really care about the characters. You begin to take more time with decisions, knowing that what you do could make characters love or hate you and this could effect how useful they are to you down the line. The story progresses very fluently and keeps you wanting to know more. Their are loads of plot twists that will keep your mind bumbling for more answers. Just when you think you got it figured out, *BAM!!* plot twist. my only complaint about the story was that it was rather short, I played through all 5 episodes in less than 8hrs.Final thoughtsAfter going into this game knowing nothing about it other than ""its good"", I must say I was blown away by the world they created, and The story had me hooked and thinking about it even when I wasnt playing. The way this game makes you care for its characters is incredible and the obsolutely phenomenal voice over work brings them to life with a voice. The animation and level design is gorgeously done in TellTale's signature cell shaded art and everything plays very smooth with a smooth looking framerate, which is I know alot of problem had with the first season of the walking dead. If you are looking for a game with a unique world and setting, with an amazing story. Then you will love the Wolf Among Us. If you are on the fence about this game, its definetly worth the buy. For a game I wasnt expecting much out of, I must say I think this may be my favourite game created by TellTale(Yes even better than the walking dead).			"

												I took the whole day to finish this game because I found it so hard to put down. There isn't much confusion as to what pick-up item bribes who like you'd witness in Sam & Max. In fact, I can only remember using a key for one of Ichabod's doors. Maybe the developers, for this particular game, believed those mechanics would ♥♥♥♥ with the pacing. Spoilers from here on out... what a thought-provoking game, especially after I looked up the alternate endings, you'd find it impossible to please everyone in the ""trial"" (I use quotes here because I, along with apparently just 12% of the players, decided to kill the Crooked Man under the impression that only death could free the town from a person who can manipulate any situation). I was looking forward to seeing whether or not the Crooked Man, our final antagonist, had some formiddable fable transformation; but I suppose I'm fine with the Bloody Mary battle. Maybe it serves the narrative more that the Crooked Man is just a human fable, but really more of a statement[en.wikipedia.org] on the nature of keeping someone's interests while holding them in debt (manipulation). This game was unusually cerebral and consulted multiple themes at once. I want the review to be brief, but the trial made for a good microcosm on the role of the government (in other words, a one-size-fits-all will always be met with opposition). It was pretty sad to see Mr. Toad and his son deported to the farm; there was a strong sense of ""everything is ♥♥♥♥ed beyond reason and there's nothing you can do to make it right"" which underlined every one of my decisions. I can already tell I'm going to think on this ending for awhile. Also, it's important to note an issue at the end of episode five which forced me into inescapable prompts of choice bubbles reading ""This choice is blank!"" Resetting the game seemed to fix this. Good product overall. As a consequence of eating my ice cream in one bite, I hope a need to see fable monsters beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of eachother didn't override any appreciation of the story.			"

												Better than Walking Dead Season 2 and better than its own source material. The Wolf Among Us takes the universe of the Fables comics -- where characters from myth, legend and fairytale hide among us in New York City -- and gives it an extra noir spin by setting it in the grimy red-light districts of the city's 1980s.Like Telltale's other recent episodic adventures, it's less about winning the game than about who you are and what the world looks like when your story is done. How far will Sheriff Bigby Wolf go to protect the people of Fabletown when the system fails everyone around him?			"

												After some major trouble in the homelands of the fairytale characters they flee to the normal (mundy) world of New York City. Here they find out that things are hard and hardly end 'happily ever after'. This is the background of a gritty and dark Telltale adventure where your choices make the story and helped with some quick-time events make this an action adventure too.The main character is Bigby Wolf, the big bad wolf from the fairytales who is now the sheriff of 'Fabletown' and has to deal with the growing discontent of the fairytale creatures who find it hard to live as 'normal'  people. No one trusts him and everybody is scared of this beast with his bloody history. And then the unrest really starts when a murder is committed. As the story unfolds you discover that this runs way deeper and will influence the very excistence of Fabletown and its inhabitants.I really enjoyed this story, although I sometimes got frustrated by the quick-time events and the short time-period you are given to make your choices. But the story was so gripping that I finished chapters 3 to 5 in one go.I highly recommend this game to everyone who like story driven games and I guarentee everyone who has read their fair share of fairytales you'll have fun recognising every character and the way they are portrayed in this modern-day fairytale.

												The ""Wolf Among Us"" is a very well made and engaging narrative adventure. Unlike the other works from Telltale Games, this game doesn't take inspiration from a popular movie or game franchise, instead it crafts a very original setting (inspired by a comic) where classic ""fables"" left their lands to move into New York City, where they have to hide their true nature.The game follows ""Bigby"", the Big Bad Wolf from the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" tale.Bigby is the sheriff of ""Fabletown"" and he'll have to collaborate with other fables to uncover the macabre mysteries of fabletown's underworld.The Wolf Among Us is a very intriguing thriller which explores a darker side of the classic tales we heard as kids and dips everything in an insanely well designed neo-noire atmosphere, mixing the classic detective movies from the 1950s with a stylish 1980s appearance and music.Very highly recommended, specially because of it's undeniable originality.

												Visually this series has been absolutely gorgeous from the get-go.  Despite the fact that certain areas are supposed to be decrepit and run-down they are colorful and detailed.  The characters are expressive and unique.  The ""cinematography"" if you can call it that is top-notch.  It's easy to see everything you need to when exploring and it follows the action well in dramatic/fight scenes.The music is relatively subdued and low key but it compliments the game well enough.  The visuals with the 80s synth sound call to mind things like Drive/Hotline Miami which I'm not sure if that was intentional.The controls for the series have mostly been spot on.  I played with a 360 controller and I may have stumbled a bit or two on a QTE but it was nothing crippling.  One issue with the game is that since you are using fixed-camera angles if you are holding say ""up"" and move into a new room, ""up"" may become ""left"" and the game doesn't seem to interpret the change properly.  It's a minor gripe though and not game-breaking.The gameplay isn't much to write home about to be honest.  You're either interacting with everything on screen until you've run out of options, doing a QTE sequence or choosing from multiple conversation options.  I think the real winner here is that rather than burdening the series with obtuse moon-logic puzzles, Telltale elected to keep the game elements light in favor of the story.  That's not to say you don't interact with or shape the story.  Be warned you are looking at about 10 hours of gameplay here.  For some that may be a drawback, but for me it was the draw.  Those 10 hours have no filler or wasted content.The story in TWAU is phenomenal and is the real draw to the game.  Granted it is based on the existing Fables graphic novel series but from what I understand a lot of the plot for the game if not all of it was created from scratch.  The writing and voice acting are top notch here, and Telltale fans will notice some familiar voices from previous games.  Aside from Bigby most of the other characters are multi-faceted and compelling.  People who immediately seem innocuous and friendly may have dark secrets, people who are at first glance are two bit thugs may actually have some humanity in them.  All of your interactions with the Fables both good and bad come back to you, so be careful what you choose.All around, I can't recommend this game enough.  It's clear that Telltale learned a lot from The Walking Dead and their previous games and the are really only getting better at what they do.  Yes the game is short and is largely more focused on narrative than gameplay, but if you're okay with that there's a lot to love here.  Absolutely buy this game.			"

												I strongly recommend this awesome game... but wait for it. Summer 2014.Everything's damn perfect in this adventure game. The mood, the writing, the art direction, the sound, the setting... Telltale at its best, by far.YET... I do not recommend the small episodes scattered around the year. The game's experience should get much much better if you can actually play them all in a row. The first episode finishes on a big bad old cliffhanger... and those really have a meaning when you only have to wait the follow up for about a week or so. Not six month.You should also understand this game is heavily based on QTE. If it's not for you, it's not for you.I can't comment on the story though. Everything is about the story in this game, and it is very easy to spoil it. All I can say is it's top notch.Wait until summer 2014, then buy this game as hard as you can!			"

If you are patient though, then grab this game right now, it is worth every penny. EDIT:I gave it a 10 cause even now after I finish the game I still am waiting for a DLC or a sequel, c'mon. Even thought it might take 2016 for the sequel to come out due to the Tales for Borderlands game they are making and the Game Of Thrones game. Unlike the Walking Dead Season 2 which I saw the ending as a bit of a let-down and even after finishing that TellTale Game, I still want this game to have a sequel.			"

												After some major trouble in the homelands of the fairytale characters they flee to the normal (mundy) world of New York City. Here they find out that things are hard and hardly end 'happily ever after'. This is the background of a gritty and dark Telltale adventure where your choices make the story and helped with some quick-time events make this an action adventure too.The main character is Bigby Wolf, the big bad wolf from the fairytales who is now the sheriff of 'Fabletown' and has to deal with the growing discontent of the fairytale creatures who find it hard to live as 'normal'  people. No one trusts him and everybody is scared of this beast with his bloody history. And then the unrest really starts when a murder is committed. As the story unfolds you discover that this runs way deeper and will influence the very excistence of Fabletown and its inhabitants.I really enjoyed this story, although I sometimes got frustrated by the quick-time events and the short time-period you are given to make your choices. But the story was so gripping that I finished chapters 3 to 5 in one go.I highly recommend this game to everyone who like story driven games and I guarentee everyone who has read their fair share of fairytales you'll have fun recognising every character and the way they are portrayed in this modern-day fairytale.

												The ""Wolf Among Us"" is a very well made and engaging narrative adventure. Unlike the other works from Telltale Games, this game doesn't take inspiration from a popular movie or game franchise, instead it crafts a very original setting (inspired by a comic) where classic ""fables"" left their lands to move into New York City, where they have to hide their true nature.The game follows ""Bigby"", the Big Bad Wolf from the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" tale.Bigby is the sheriff of ""Fabletown"" and he'll have to collaborate with other fables to uncover the macabre mysteries of fabletown's underworld.The Wolf Among Us is a very intriguing thriller which explores a darker side of the classic tales we heard as kids and dips everything in an insanely well designed neo-noire atmosphere, mixing the classic detective movies from the 1950s with a stylish 1980s appearance and music.Very highly recommended, specially because of it's undeniable originality.

												So first off this takes place before the comics if you are a fan of those. It sets up and lets you experience a great bit of story from the eyes of Bigby.The shaders and art style where chosen both to be familiar to the comic fans and the people who knows the kind of work tell tale games who produced it.As for its gameplay like most of the tell tale stuff I and many others would more call them interactive stories. As the only real stuff you do is do quick time events and walk around to look at stuff.All in all the quick time events are well laid out with some great time sensitive ones as well. The story is really what makes this though. Now that it is all out you can easilly look ahead if you want but I say play through it and don't because the story will have you thinking every which way with it's amazing lay out. "

												This is a very slick title, based on same engine as The Walking Dead. Light on puzzles and inventory, linear but will remember dialogue decisions to offer slightly different progression. The graphics are spot on, voice acting is perfect and character models and facial animation is top notch. It is a beautiful and thrilling title to play.What is isn't however is a traditional adventure game. The majority of dialogue prompts are time based, there are also quick time/button bashing sequences which are terrible on a touch pad. Controller or mouse is a must. It's a game that will require full attention and not allow time to decide on what to say, which I like but worth being aware of if a traditional point and click is what you are after.Highly recommended.

												Pretty amazing game, if you like The Walking Dead, then you'll definitely like it.Take the gameplay of TWD, change zombies with Fables. You'll get this game.The game is about a murder mystery, in which two people were killed, but it's not boring, you need to make decisions as you play through the game, if you decision was good or bad - I's completely up to you. Sometimes you have a lot of time to decide, and sometimes you have less than 2 seconds to do it, which makes you need to do quick decisions.The music is amazing too, I was sitting on the main menu for 30 minutes because of the awesome music, it's really, really good.As always, I really recommend getting this game, even if you have no idea what Fables are, you'll understand as you progress through the game.11/10 Would put my arm into place again.

												Some of my first and most vital PC gaming experiences, growing up, involved the classic point-and-click adventure. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for those kind of games. Once again, Telltale games has revitalized the entire genre with The Wolf Among Us.  I purposefully kept a blind ear and eye to every single bit of information/reviews/videos when it came to this game and what it was about, until the moment I could play it for myself. I was more than pleasantly surprised to discover it was based on the comics I have been reading and enjoying for the past few months--The Fables series. And I have to say, it really does the comic book series justice, both in style and character.  But don't worry, even if you've never read the series you can easily delve deeply into the world this game presents. Who doesn't like a good murder mystery? It's even better when you get to take the role of detective (or in this case, Sheriff), sniffing out clues and interrogating suspects, piecing together evidence bit by bit. In this case, you are none other than the Big Bad Wolf, who has been assigned to bring law and order to Fabletown: a magical and rather grisly place tucked away in New York, where many creatures of legend and fairytale characters have been exiled to live. As you can expect, not everybody plays nicely with each other, and pretty soon things end up bloody.  I love how the game really gives you complete control over your character's personality and detective skills, though it could be frustrating at times when you come to realize something major yourself...only to wait and guide your character to eventually come to the same conclusion.Most point-and-click adventures let you explore freely and take your time, it's all rather leisurely. And although there is plenty of room to explore around Fabletown, taking your time really isn't an option. At all. To me, though, this only adds to the tension and excitement you feel as the story unfolds. The game is highly cinematic in nature, so that if you step away or stop paying attention for one moment....you could miss a critical clue, lose your sway in a conversation, or worse. You must constantly be on your toes and ready to make decisions that help shape the way your character is perceived and solve the case. Not only that, it makes the game nearly impossible to want to stop playing, and that's a very good thing. I found myself glued to the seat and highly focused for each and every episode of this. The game reminds me of an old noir crime movie, with plenty of seedy characters, red herrings, blood, sex, brutal fistfights and relentless twists and turns. It's highly intellectual and really forces you to think for yourself, but I guarantee you will always be second-guessing yourself throughout, playing back old conversations and situations to make sure you did the right thing.  After all, the game is filled with varying choices, and it's these nuances that not only add to the first time experience of playing--but also offer replay value. I won't spoil the end, of course, but I will say only this: If you played the game as intensely as I did, you won't be able to stop thinking about it for at least a few days. And the best kinds of games are the ones that haunt you and stay with you like that, in my opinion.			"

												Exploring my library very bored.. gotta be some game I want to play.Finally see this gem. Yes.The Wolf Among Us I can say with certainty is one of my favorite games of all time (top 3). The story, characters, locations are all so beautifully written and illustrated in a great comic shell shader style that fits the game so well.The story is basicly fairy tales living ""Among Us"" (no pun intended) in New York. Honestly it sounds so wierd and dumb when you try to explain it but you REALLY just have to play it and realize how briliant it is. Speaking of playing it, you play as Bigby Wolf, aka the big bad wolf. You may think you're a villian but you're acctually the sheriff of Fabletown, an area in New York where most fables live. You basicly try to keep different fables from killing eachother.The gameplay is player driven, how you act and react to events and characters throughout the game will determine how the game plays out, and how characters will fear about you.It's an amazing game, it's worth its price now, and it's a steal for anythign less.

												I'm a major fan of Telltale games and have enjoyed playing both Walking Dead releases. The Wolf Among Us is a similarly designed walk and talk choose your own adventure with quick time events and an ending driven by the choices you make.This game is set in a New York where 'Fables' have fled after some disaster in the fantasy world, where they set up a community and have trouble policing and running it. You play Bigby (The Big Bad Wolf) as the sheriff of the community and investigate some rather naughty going ons.I would absolutely recommend that you buy this if you enjoy this genre.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is an incredibly well done melting pot of the epilogue of Fables and Fairy Tales that we grew up with. Even within the first episode I found myself pausing to consider the stories and personalities of the characters and how they matched what I remembered from reading when I was younger. I highly reccomend this for anyone who plays a game for the story first. Just remember to keep your wits about you for any surprises that may be hiding behind any door ;)<3~color			"

												I'm biased maybe because I love the graphic novels this game is based on -- and Telltale delivers a game that is more point and click than anything else even if it uses a controller. But, the graphics are incredible and just like the comic, and the world is immersive. It's worth the money since all we're buying on here is experiences anyways.			"

												Telltale hits it out of the park once again, with another excellent story-telling experience. The Wolf Among Us is one of Telltale's latest and greatest point-and-click story-driven adventures, but it is based off of the popular comic series Fables. Due to this, you'd think Telltale would have to play it safe so it wouldn't disrupt any of the canon of the comics. At the end of the first episode, though, you'll see that Telltale isn't pulling any punches. The first thing you'll notice about the game are its aesthetics. TWOU is using a color pallette Telltale hasn't used before, and it takes advantage of the Telltale engine and a neon color scheme. This game has a lot of shadows, which really fit the already engrossing atmosphere. Here I'm gonna give a review of each episode released so far, then once Cry Wolf is released, I'll give my thoughts on that and give a final review of this game.---Episode 1: FaithThis episode helps setup the main narrative of the entire series, and makes it so you really don't need to know much about Fables to understand the plot. Right away you're thrust into the role of Bigby Wolf and given some choices on how to react to an emergency that's happening in the main setting of the game, Fabletown. So, during these first 10 minutes, you have multiple choices and a great action sequence that introduces you to 4 very important characters. As this episode progresses you learn more about Fabletown and its residents, and start wondering about all the little secrets that may lie unknown in this little town. The episodes length is roughly 2 hours, but is very replayable for the Book of Fables entries and the other choices you can make. The choices made in this episode drastically impact the rest of the story, so you're going to need to choose very wisely. Overall, this episode is a 9/10---Episode 2: Smoke and MirrorsThis is the episode we waited for for over 4 months, and I'd like to say it was worth the wait. This episode explains the cliffhanger ending from the first episode (WHICH TOOK 4 MONTHS TO RESOLVE) and reveals some more insight into the character of Bigby Wolf and of his other friends. From the very beginning you're able to make difficult choices on how to handle bad situations, which are reflective on your playstyle, and what type of mental state you think Bigby is in. What makes up for the tragic wait for this episode is the devastating conclusion and realization at the very end of the episode, leaving you on a cliffhanger to start episode 3 with. 9/10---Episode 3: A Crooked MileThe best episode by far. Everything in this episode is expertly made, from the beginning, to the choices, to the end. This is one of the longest episodes by far, but I can't really go into detail without spoiling it. Truly the pinnacle of Telltale's story telling, 10/10---Episode 4: In Sheep's ClothingA lackluster episode when it comes to length and decisions, but a good one nonetheless. This episode of TWOU is an example of Telltale's episode 4 curse, where they can't seem to deliver with their penultimate episodes. This episode is probably the shortest one out of the bunch, but is thoroughly enjoyable. The cliffhanger will have you drooling and counting down the days until Episode 5's release. 7/10			"

												From the makers of The Walking Dead game series comes a unique murder mystery series about a world of famous fable characters forced to don human appearances in order to live among the human world.  You play as Bigby Wolf, A.K.A, the Big Bad Wolf, tasked with the safety of Fabletown where he and his fellow fables reside.  Suddenly, after several years, a fable is murdered and their decapitated head is left outside Bigby's apartment building to find.  Now there's an ever growing number of suspects to the murder, and it's up to Bigby to decide which of his fellow fables is the killer.If you've played The Walking Dead, this title will be very familiar to you.  Branching story, difficult descisions, outstanding writing, QTE action sequences, it's all there.  You can pretty much refer back to my Walking Dead reccomendation for how the mechanics go here, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, as the star of the show is the story and how you decide what to do in it, and boy is it a gripping one indeed.  Just like before, it's episodic, so one $25 purchase will be good for all 5 episodes to come!  If you're a lover of fantastic video game story, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up!  Actually, just do it, ya ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												9.6/10 -  Another TellTale SlamdunkIt's not easy to make a choose your own adventure game, but TellTale has it down. This game is up there with walking dead. Great graphics, engaging plot and different paths to take. I would pay full price for this game. About 9 hours of gametime. Worth $20 or so. Get on sale if not. I'd buy the sequel.

												The Wolf Among Us is inspired by the Fable comics. Let's speak clearly: it's a great hommage to this comics series, both respectful and capable of adding to the original. The game is an adventure game that works as a serial, with strong characters and a solid thriller story. The game's not about difficult enigmas our strange environment but it's more about trying to tell a story in an unprecedented format (except for The Walking Dead game). And it does a great job at it. Really, being the main character, choosing your answers, your way around and chasing who you think is the suspect has a real impact on the way you enjoy the story. Once again, a masterpiece for Telltame Games.Compared to The Walking DeadThough very similar to The Walking Dead (which I enjoyed), this video games series seems better to me. Despite its link to childhood themes (fairy tales coming to life), it eems more mature and works around topics like : taking responsability for your action or passion versus reason. It sure isn't as much of an emotional roller coaster as TWD. More of a philosophical tale. Besides, this one definetely has more interactivity than TWD			"

												And here we go again, another fantastic game by the creators of Game Of The Year winning The Walking Dead. This follows the Sheriff of Fabletown. We know him as The Big Bad Wolf but here he is called Bigby Wolf. We follow him to uncover the murder of a fable.What do I think of this game?I think this is better, darker, more mature than the Walking Dead series. The voice acting is superb, the environment is engrossing to the story line, the story is more in depth then Lee and Clemintines survival of the Walking Dead, in search of her parents. What is better is that this game is a prequel to the comics, so you can go  spend over 200 dollars on the entire collection! No seriously, don't do that. Anyway, telltale has provided us with another fantastic game. Do I expect a Season 2?I would love one but since this is a prequel you'd have to read the comics first then play the next season, unless they do it straight after the end of Episode 5, and 5 does leave you on the edge of your seat. So yeah, I expect one but don't have your hopes up. "

												Прекрасная история, которая вкупе с отличными персонажами и атмосферой развратного города на выходе даёт потрясающией результат. В Фейблтауне у каждого есть свои скелеты в шкафу, все что-то скрывают, замалчивают, но Большого и Страшного Серого Волка это не останавливает. Он упрямо движётся к своей цели, несмотря ни на что. Его не останавливают даже заряды дроби в упор. От эпизода к эпизоду напряжение всё нарастает, становится всё запутаннее и интереснее, но в конце концов весь этот клубок тайн и загадок раскрывается нам в конце, который, к слову сказать, всё же кажется немного слитым, ибо градус напряжения в нём ощутимо меньше чем раньше. Но всё это не портит и без того прекрасную игру.9/10. Маст хэв.			"

												Dear player: you are dumb. You're such a socially inept nerd, you probably can't even interpret facial expressions or voice pitching. That's why we will inform you with those neat ""XYZ will remember that"" boxes. Also we really love to delude you into buying the thought that ""every decision can have enormous consequences"", even though in the 9 hours you will play this game, there are only like 3 occasions were this statement would really be the case. No matter what you do, the plot line will always head in the same direction, at the same speed. There's no branching path or shortcut at all. So even if you connect the clues the game gives you, you may wait a very long time till your ingame character does so. The choices you can make are once again very limited.So much for rambling about the bad points. Now onto the good stuff, which imho fortunately outweighs everything mentioned previously.The game is based on the DC Comic Series ""Fables"". Once you are into the game you immediately got that gritty noir vibe going. It's atmospheric, stylish and quite unique in the gaming sector. The cell-shading graphics fit that base very well. From what I can tell the voice acting also is very professional and completely flawless. Even though the story tends to be stereotypical at times, the characters are believable in their own motivations and actions. There's no black and white run-of-the-mill evil villain to find here. It's almost like the story arc - just like the artstyle, the music and voice acting - is once more another plattform for the twisted and crazy, but often still very likeable characters to shine through.I played through the complete game in about 9 hours and the standard price would be 22,99€ in Europe (Tier 1). That is a lot of value for your money, considering that this game feels more like watching an entire season of an interactive series then anything else.Here you go. The 'Call of Duty' of adventure games. Just like Activision took the essence of action games and multiplied it by 10 for the sake of entertainment, while leaving out the more interesting aspects of gameplay, Telltale do the same thing in their own genre. It's extremely dialogue-heavy and entertaining, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay.. go look somewhere else.			"

												This game is supposed to be a prequel to a comic book series called Fables. It is about all sorts of fairy tale characters we know (e.g. Red Riding Hood, Beauty and Beast) who live among us as they were forced to leave their home. In Fabletown (which is part of New York) they try to blend in with the humans (who they call ""mundies"") and for those not having human form it proves to be difficult: an enchantment called ""glamour"" is a must to change forms, otherwise they are sent to ""The Farm"" which is not exactly a place any Fable wants to be.The game takes place in the '80s and the player assumes the control of the Wolf from Red Riding Hood. Big Wolf - or Bigby - acts as the Sheriff of Fabletown and is set out to solve a crime that ended in the death of one of the Fables. He is aided by Snow White and other fairy tale / folklore characters we may or may not recognise.Now, if you have already played a Telltale adventure game Wolf Among Us will be familiar to you:--- there are a relatively few places where objects can be picked up or interacted with (we have the option to investigate our surroundings while the rest of the game gives us a mainly film-like experience with lots of cutscenes and dialogues)--- your inventory does not really get full of items and if an item can be used with another one in the environment the game tells you that --- there are lots of characters to speak with and during conversations you have a limited time to pick an answer - these affect the relationship you have with these people and a choice can often have dire consequences--- due to the availability of choices a 2nd or even a 3rd walkthrough can easily yield you new results (the changes can even affect the end game)--- during action sequences quick-time-events are common but the pop-up buttons are easy to hit - this is not a difficult game (the main idea here is the immersion)Wolf Among Us sports an interesting story and it entertains you from start to finish while you try to find the killer of Fabletown. Since prior to this I played the Walking Dead series I can make a comparison between the two: Wolf has more action sequences and while there's drama it certainly is less emotional. Oh, and make no mistake: just because it is about fairy tale characters gore and violence (along with cursing) is common.For fans of Telltale adventure games this is a recommended title - for newcomers it's also worth checking.

												I made a mistake by playing the first chapter way back when it first released because you have to remember all the details, at least it helps. As of now I have gone through all 5 episodes 3 or 4 times each so it does really pay off to remember the small details.       You are Sheriff Bigby Wolf, in our world, New York. The fables try to keep regular citizens(Mundies) out by using glamours to appear normal. When a few heads start to roll in Fabletown it's up to Bigby to solve this dangerous mystery that will keep twisting. As for the gameplay, the mechanics are typical for Tellatale. They are QTE prompts but you are the choreographer of the fight scenes which is why I love The Wolf Among Us, as well as its well designed consequence system. If you have read Fables by DC Vertigo you would understand more but you still have a great story either way.Personal Score(Average for all episodes): 9.6Really impressive story telling on Telltale's part; hopefully we can see another season!!!!!!!

												It's hard to talk about The Wolf Among Us without comparing it to its older brother The Walking Dead as they practically share the same game style. Tell Tale did a great revamp with the point and click adventure genre and what truly shines for their newer instalments are the players dialogue and action inputs that affect that story as you progress.Playing as Fable sheriff Bigby Wolf (The big bad wolf) you have a bad reputation for having a temper and violent tendencies. The games theme is based around judgement of character and lets you choose to whether live up to your tenacity or redeem yourself in the folks that you serve and protect.Always thinking about your actions and seeing your consequences unfold blurs the lines of good and bad and that's what makes TWAU really stand out. Will you assert your authority? Show remorse? Keep your cool? or unleash who you really are?Solve the case, help clean up Fable town. And show your true side.... Your bite maybe worse than your bark.			"

I really like the fact that pretty much everyone could be the murderer but i don't want to spoil anything.

												If you liked The Walking Dead you will also like this. It's a bit more action-oriented. I wouldn't call it ""noir"" (or at least not too much) or ""mature"";  it's basically fairytale characters, gritty & edgy version in a crapsack modern-ish world. But the execution works really well in my opinion.You play as the big bad wolf (hence the Bigby name), there's snow white, there's the dwarves, there's beauty & the beast, etc. it's  a bit of an adult mix of the stories of your childhood, wrapped up in a thriller/murder/investigation package.It certainly feels better paced and more interactive than The Walking Dead to me but both have different aims & goals.

												I went into The Wolf Among Us blissfully ignorant. All I knew was that it was in a smilar vein to the excellent The Walking Dead games and had the same developers. I was rather delighted by an absolutely fantastic surprise of a game. An ultra-violent film noir mixed with a fantasy world. The story sounds odd on paper but is very smart and oozes style. Basically, it's about the classic characters of fairy tales (Snow White, The Big Bad Wolf, Three Little Pigs, Beauty and the Beast, etc) having to leave their magical homeworld to escape destruction and they settle in Manhattan, in an area called Fable Town. Use of a drug called ""Glamour"" conceals their non-human form (if they are non human, characters such as Snow White and Beauty don't have to) and if they cannot afford Glamour, they are sent to a rural enclave, some would say prison, known as The Farm. The well off and high-ups live in an apartment complex called The Woodlands, whilst the under-classes and wretches of society live in the impoverished fringes. It's a world much like our own, far removed from any magical connotations. Don't think of the themes as being child friendly too. It's a very mature game with mature themes, with violence to boot. Think of it as the characters of Disney in the world of a film noir murder mystery. Fast forward to the modern day. You play as Sheriff Bigby Wolf, aka The Big Bad Wolf, who is tasked with keeping law and order in Fabletown. He's a typical hard talking, hard living, gritty detective of classic film. A serial killler, a completely new thing for Fabletown, is on the loose and you have to stop him. During this investigation many questions are raised on class boundaries, injustice and the hardship faced by citizens of Fabletown. Bigby's moral compass is tested and sometimes he fails to keep the wolf inside him from coming out, quite literally. It's enthralling. The game plays very similarly to The Walking Dead. It's a point and click adventure focused on player choice and story. I think it rises above Walking Dead in that the story is more compelling, the characters more interesting and overall the artistic license gives the writers more room to maneuver and craft a better story. The art direction is absolutely fantastic too. The game looks lovely, with animations being a much improved area. The soundtrack is brilliant, very subtle but never fails to convey a particular mood or sense of place. The first episode was about 2 and a half hours long and I enjoyed every minute of it. One of the best story based games I've had the privilege of playing and if the rest of the episodes live up to this then it'll be one of the best games I've ever played. Heartily recommended. Near perfect in what it sets out to achieve.			"

												Episode 1 or “Faith” is an excellent first 2 hour or so long chapter in The Wolf Among Us story. The presentation is in every way fantastic, with the one down side being the somewhat jarring frame problems during transitions, these are largely neglectable and they managed to make this world of fables come alive. If you are looking for a game that features many puzzles and gives you plenty of room to uncover its secrets, you are unlikely to find it here. Gameplay is greatly paced during the fight scenes, but not so much when you are given free roam. If you are however looking for a great universe with great story, characters and dialogue.. well, you need not look further.With episode 1, The Wolf Among Us is looking like it will be a fantastic episodic experience to play through.

												Genre: Interactive Story - Fantasy/Film NoirA very good telltale game. It stands up to the Walking Dead and it had me enthralled from start to finish. Episodes will be staggered, on writing this there was only one released. It links to the Fable comics that I have briefly looked at before, and they seemed an interesting concept.			"

												As you make your way through the dialogue options The Wolf Among us, the game periodically give you little notes about how your choices affect the story and the other characters. A little alert might pop up to tell you something like:<!> You told the truth<!> You connected the evidence<!> Snow will remember that you took her sideOf course, a more honest alert might sound more like this:<i> Your decision has been carefully recorded for posterity and immediately flushed down the toiletNothing you decide in this game matters, which wouldn't be a huge deal except for the fact that decision making is the sole game mechanic. It's tough to give players real choices because it requires a lot more content for the same amount of play time. Other games have run into this issue and some have found innovative solutions.The Stanley Parable leaned right into it, making the very concept of player agency part of the story. Gone Home, a game in which literally everything that happened happened before the the protagonist even entered the narrative, built uncertainty and used environmental storytelling keep the player engaged. Wolf unfortunately has no tricks up its sleeve to balance its series of pointless ""choices.""Maybe the biggest problem isn't that the choices aren't meaningful, it's that the game won't let you forget how meaningless they are for even one second. Between chapters it asks the player to sit through a recap of the previous chapter and a preview of the next, both of which serve as reminders of how linear and immutable the plot is. It's as if the game wants to constantly remind you about all of the events that are going to happen no matter what you do.It doesn't help that the plot sometimes feels like an arbitrary string of red herrings and unconvincing fake-outs. We may see a character shot in the chest in one scene, only to to be told in the next that they're fine because of magic or whatever. In a fictional universe where the rules of magic are never totally spelled out, these kinds of deus ex machina moments are inevitable and they don't need to ruin the story, but too many of them in a row can make the stakes just seem very, very low.It's kind of a bummer because there are some great things about the game. The voice acting is perfect and the writing faithfully recreates the weird, gritty fairytale world of the comics. The art is also pretty much dead-on in matching the comics while adding some dynamic elements, although some of the character movements push it into the uncanny valley. You can also expect to spend a few minutes on google trying to figure out how to fix the game's totally hideous lack of anti-aliasing (luckily it is fixable). I marked this review, ""not recommended"", but my thoughts on it are more mixed than that. I do intend to finish the game, I'm just disappointed.			"

												Quite simply one of my favourite Tell tale games. I would say joint favourite with Walking Dead Part 1.A thoroughly engrossing storyline that twists and turns leaving you a little confused by the credits. If i would say anything negative then it would be the game length and replayability. I easily finished in 9 hours and haven't felt the need to pick it up again.Goes regularly on a steep discount so maybe better waiting for that. "

I was wrong. I have played back the game 3 times fully and some bits again and again, wether it was because I wanted to hear more interactions between characters and see different choices, or just to play a fun scene or battle again. It isnt alot for what you're getting especially thanks to its surprising replayability, get it to see the fully complete, epic, mysterious, and brutal tale of The Wolf Among Us!			"

												I may update this as a later point; but for now, I'll write some quick thoughtsThe Wolf Among Us was suitably badass, compelling and intense in all the right places. The characterisation was outstanding and I really formed an emotional bond with the characters. The moral conundrums were dilating and thought provoking. My judgement was consistently clouded and my decisions didn't always seem morally right. Bigby has to make difficult choices.The narrative is a stellar noir, with complex characters in an interesting setting, it's unlike anything I've seen before. I wanted to learn more about everything and the unlockable Book of Fables provided me with that.10/10 Actually, I really want to know what happened of Bufkin's alcohol addiction.1/10Alright, Bigby is pretty cool9/10			"

												This is the first Telltale game that I've completed, and it was worth every penny and minute. The Wolf Among Us has a great story throughout which included very adult and real themes at time, its impossible to not end up feeling emotionally attached to some of the characters. You can either allow Bigby stay as the big bad wolf or try and turn a new leaf with the dialogue and action options, I personally tried to turn over a new leaf but sometimes someone just needed a little threatening.On top of this the design of the game from menu screen, to each episode of the game, and the credits is lovely. My favourite character designs are Bigby Wolf - the subtley of his changes and his final form are great - and Bloody Mary - her true form design is so good; the sounds accompanying her when walking, and how she shatters. I'm just insanely impressed with how well this is put together.Its fairly straight forward to complete the game with 100% achievements but there are a few things that you might miss depending on choices you make - some areas you need to pick to go to a certain destinaton first - but there are guides that'll help you figure out what you're missing and which chapters you might need to replay at the end.

												surveyRus and eng engThe final episode of ""The Wolf Among Us"" have proven to me, that Telltale writers can add a lot of depth and complexity to even a simple story. A lot of seemingly insignificant choices you make throughout the game end up having big consequences.And by the end, just when you think that you got it all figured out, with but a single phrase they deliver another twist that makes you look at everything that happened in a new light. Well done, Telltale and Bigby.RusФинальный, пятый эпизод The Wolf Among Us, убедил меня, что в Telltale работают ребята, которые могут рассказывать простые истории так, что в итоге все оказывается ой как непросто. Многие не значимые выборы на протяжении четырех эпизодов оказываются важными, а многие ""простушки"" оказываются значительно сложнее, чем вы могли подумать.При этом, в самом конце, когда все уже встало на свои места, Telltale продолжает крутить игроком вокруг пальца и одной фразой дает пересмотреть все события, что имели место с самого начала.

												An extremely fun game that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. If you're a fan of Disney, Supernatural beings, Fables and Telltale games such as the Walking Dead series, then this is the game for you. Based off the 'Fable' Comic Books, this game is fantastic and extremely addictive. And only the first two episodes are out, that says a lot. Compared to the Walking Dead series, decisions  in The Wolf Among Us ACTUALLY affect the storyline in a big way. And depending on what choices you make, certain chapters of the story and episode are changed. Deciding on where to go, who to see, investigate and what you say to people make a BIG difference in how the storyline plays out. This is one of my favourite games that I have played simply based on these reasons. And who doesn't love being able to interact with their favourite fable characters?  "

The game itself looks nice and the selection of colours used within the game help bring its world and characters to life more and it really suits the game overall.

If you want a game focused on a story, this one is the best out there. Nerissa & Faith theories GO!			"

												a murder mystery involving legends, archetypes, fairy tales.  excellent writing, artwork, cinematography.  atmosphere only vertigo can bring and brilliantly punctuated by excellent voice acting and music.it seems like there's lots of choices which sometimes obviously and sometimes subtly change the game - or maybe the designers just made it feel like you have a ton of choices in a linear plot.doesn't matter - every episode is absolutely engrossing, if a bit short.update after chapter 5:still recommend this, but chapter 5 was a big letdown.  aside from the awesome encounter with one nasty character the rest is terribly predictable and a let down due to the marked drop in quality of writing.  everything seems rushed and the dialogue, so good in the first 4 chapters, is weak.

												This game... is so fun. The fight sequences have been improved from walking dead. It also includes more of a Sam and Max puzzle solving (some of it in the first episode) and walking dead. The game also gets even more better if you have read the Fables comic books, which are without a doubt, very good. The music is also superb and fit the scenarios very well.			"

												Gonna first talk about the things I don't like about Telltale games:1. You can't skip the ""next time on The Wolf Among Us"" parts after you finish an episode. If you are like me and surprise is a big part of your enjoyment in games, these unskippable previews feel like spoilers.2. If you're not playing on PC, there's intermitent lagging.3. There are some choices, but gameplay can feel linear, a lot of choices lead to the same results, and game hold your hand in terms of find clues and stuff via showing delectables targets over items you can interact around. It might be better if game gave you a reasonable time limit when finding clues/searching for evidence and your lack of finding everything created different results. But maybe as a developer that might be too complex a thing to do, idk.Gonna close by saying TWAU was awesome. I liked it better than Walking Dead because it introduced a new universe that you couldn't find on TV (lord knows how many zombie themed shows/movies we've seen recently). The big choices DO feel like big choices when you are making them, and the experience is like being part in an episodic shows ala Game of Thrones, True Detective, etc. I loved the universe, the art is beautiful, and the scripting gives every character some depth.I think Telltale is making some good interactive viewing for us video gamers, but they still have lots of room to grow. If Chrono Trigger on SNES can do 13 endings, they can do multiple endings too! Oh and I seriously suggest waiting for an entire season to come out before playing, I did so and playing through the entire season with some drinks nearby was nice :D			"

												With all the episodes finally being released and seeing what happens at the end, all I can say is I hate the cliffhanger ending as I still want to find out what happens next in this story.It's a great game, with a interesting storyine. Good music and voice acting to add to the feel.The only negative comment would be some of your choices, don't feel like they have as big an impact as they should. For example in the first episode I managed to save a characters life and from then on, they only appeared as a background character whereas you would think they could help.But overall, with everything this game has done right, you should definetly pick it up yourself, give it a try and get yourself invested in the backstory of everyone you meet.

												I dont want to write a massive review like some nerd, but I feel I have to ask people to buy this game. I thought when I bought it it would be 2 hours every episode and I would be done. I was wrong. I have played back the game 3 times fully and some bits again and again, wether it was because I wanted to hear more interactions between characters and see different choices, or just to play a fun scene or battle again. It isnt alot for what you're getting especially thanks to its surprising replayability, get it to see the fully complete, epic, mysterious, and brutal tale of The Wolf Among Us!			"

												The wolf among us is a detective game, but unlike most; while you certainly need to connect the dots, the evidence you get is fairly easy to uncover and your character can pretty much supplement any 'connecting the dots' you failed to do. No, 'The Wolf Among Us' is more a story about your choices and how you mold this world you're in with these choices.The story is set in modern day New York City, primarily in the Bronx from what I remember, where the characters of fairy tale stories have moved after their former residences became obsolete with modernisation. This secret community of fables is referred to as 'Fabletown', and you, the Big Bad Wolf from the story about the three little pigs, are the sheriff. No one likes you, mostly due to what you've done previously in fairy tales.Choices you make directly impact how the game plays out; there may be two leads you need to follow but only have time for one, or perhaps you need to choose whether you wish to spare a character or not. The leads present themselves naturally through story progression, but nearly always you're forced to make touch choices as to whether you will follow a lead or not. Parts of the story will open or close themselves depending on which route you take; following one lead may or may not help you solve the mystery, and may just bring more questions than answers.By the very nature of the game, character development was excellent, with characters changing dynamically throughout the series; the art style was memorable and does not age easily, looking fantastic even now. The sound also stays with me even now, fitting the theme of the story very, very well.'The Wolf Among Us' was a rollercoaster ride for me, and was a memorable game, easily one of my favorites to have played.

												While not as DEVASTATINGLY EMOTIONAL (thank god) as the Walking Dead series, this is one cool as hell mystery that combines some very mature noir sensibilities with fairy tale characters. That alone is pretty much enough to sell it to me, and it delivers on the promise of dark, gritty twists on classic characters while also involving you deeply in the world around as it unveils itself right along with the mystery you're tracking. It's mature and has plenty of adult themes, but it doesn't indulge in these things just for the sake of them. The darker content fits very well with the sleazy underworld it's showing to you, and the writing and acting are consistently excellent from start to finish. Mystery, black humour, sudden brutal violence, and a great cast of weird, slightly crazy characters makes this one of the most enjoyable worlds to dive into in recent years. Telltale really knows how to capture a fictional setting well, so if you're into point and click adventures with emphasis on story over puzzles, you can't go wrong with this one.			"

There are some quicktime events in each chapter, but nothing that distracts from the story and are easy to overcome (for thos like me that dislike them a bit).In short, a very engrossing tale with some unique characters and an excellent art direction.

I love the art style, the dark purple colours on the city is just beautiful, the game really looks like a dark graphic novel. Story wise the game is very interesting, it always keeps you on edge and doesn't get boring. You play as the big bad wolf ""bigby"" the sheriff of fable town, where characters from fairytales live in the human world, bigby must find out whose behind a series of gruesome murders.

												Telltale had a tough act to follow after the huge impact of The Walking Dead, but The Wolf Among Us lives up to those standards. It is strikingly atmospheric, with high-quality writing and voice acting throughout. The final episode was truly compelling, and I found myself siding with the villian for a while.Aside from a few jarring animation glitches (especially in the second episode), the only real criticism I have is that it all feels too short at under eight hours - but it's hard not to want more of such a good game. Hopefully season two is on the horizon.			"

												This is the first Telltale game that I've completed, and it was worth every penny and minute. The Wolf Among Us has a great story throughout which included very adult and real themes at time, its impossible to not end up feeling emotionally attached to some of the characters. You can either allow Bigby stay as the big bad wolf or try and turn a new leaf with the dialogue and action options, I personally tried to turn over a new leaf but sometimes someone just needed a little threatening.On top of this the design of the game from menu screen, to each episode of the game, and the credits is lovely. My favourite character designs are Bigby Wolf - the subtley of his changes and his final form are great - and Bloody Mary - her true form design is so good; the sounds accompanying her when walking, and how she shatters. I'm just insanely impressed with how well this is put together.Its fairly straight forward to complete the game with 100% achievements but there are a few things that you might miss depending on choices you make - some areas you need to pick to go to a certain destinaton first - but there are guides that'll help you figure out what you're missing and which chapters you might need to replay at the end.

A Paladin's Steam Review: The Wolf Among Us. Telltale does it Again, But I Have Concerns. Genre: Telltale Adventure Game. Developed & Published by: Telltale GamesPlatform: Windows and Mac OSXBusiness Model: Episodic, Season is Complete. Copy Purchased by Myself PreambleThe Wolf Among Us, a point-and-click story with some quick-time-events abound set in a fantasy mystery in modern day. When I saw the announcement trailer for this one, I was intrigued. I tackled TWAU after all episodes were released as I don’t like waiting for each episode to come out. What I got was an experience that was both fun and worrisome. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAs far as the overall game is concerned, the quality ranges from really good to questionable. I think it shows many of the weaknesses of either Telltale as a game developer or the episodic model that they’ve chosen to go with. Episode One is great, with its introduction to Bigby, Snow White and the rest of the usual suspects. But then episode two comes along with its abruptly short and limited story. I can only imagine how ticked people were if episode two was all they got for a while. Episode three and four are much better, reaching about the same length and quality level as episode one. However, despite what must have been a wake up call for Telltale, they then seem to almost fall asleep on episode five.  Episode five being rather linear with a lot of cutscenes being shown with little input from myself. QA also seemed to slip as I experienced a rather nasty epilogue bug that caused a few cut scenes to be... cut...from the story along with all the choice dialogue text. Sure, a quick restart to the previous save point fixed that, but, it seemed like that should have been caught in testing. PC SettingsSettings include resolution options, Quality/Texture sliders (it's a quality slider, not a fan) and AA on/off. Keep in mind that its FXAA only unless you want to force higher quality AA through Nvidia’s settings. Instructions on forcing that can be found at this PCGamingWiki article[pcgamingwiki.com]. V-sync is on by default but can be forced off through settings. You’ve also got audio sliders and subtitles options. It’s not the greatest setting options I've seen but I’ll grant that the game probably doesn't need much more than this.  Final ThoughtsI really liked TWAU. I enjoyed following the Big Bad Wolf in his journey to solve the murder mystery. The aesthetic, the atmosphere and the character interactions are great. What I really enjoyed most is that everyone has a backstory. Even the main villain has a good reason for what he’s doing. Even if the means aren’t justified. These characters are dealing the best they can with a terrible situation. Most of my problems with this game lay with the questionable quality of each episode and some of the bugs that cropped up. If you haven’t finished the story due to episode two being rather poor, I still recommend you finish it out. I’d like to see a second season of this game at some point but there hasn't been any announcements just yet.Read this review and other Telltale Games reviews on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												The Wolf Among Us doesn't exactly fall within your typical definition of a 'video-game,' but whatever it is, it's good.   	The game's mechanics operate similarly to TellTale's other title The Walking Dead: time-constrained player-made decisions that drive the plot.  These mechanics, however, are not what make the game's mark.  The creative setting that intertwines folklore and  modern-urbanized living provides a refreshing break from the popular, less ambitious titles of late.	The Wolf Among Us neither pulls punches nor over-dramatizes its events, but rests in a pseudo-believable valley that realistically explores the implications of blending these two distinct universes.  The fanciful innocence of the “fables'” (folklore characters) lore is often juxtaposed with the gritty, desperate, and unfortunate reality of modern poverty and social inequality. 	All in all, The Wolf Among Us is an excellent title that deserves a spot in any plot enthusiast's library.			"

												Wait until all the episodes are out before spending money on this. While it's a good game for what it is (point and click and giving the illusion of choice) the episodes so far are somewhat short. Without skipping dialogue I put 2-something hours into episode one, and around 90 minutes in episode two (single playthroughs).The time between new episode releases seems to be long as well. I'd wait. Personally I wouldn't have spent 15 euro (it was discounted, I think) on this if I didn't get free money from selling TF2 items.			"

												Once again Telltale has created a masterpiece out of a masterpiece. The Wolf Among Us is part Detective Drama and part Fantasy Horror. The voice acting was among the best I've heard in any game; the writing equally compelling. As a fan of brief reviews- I will end this with a simple message. Buy it, Play it ... worth every dime.

												I am actually surprised more of my friends haven't played this game. It's by Telltale Games, who produced The Walking Dead, Tales From The Borderlands, and Game of Thrones.Prequel game to a comic series called Fables.Telltale's signature move of presenting you with options that might be a little lose-lose or ambiguous always bite back later, of course, and as the Sheriff Bigby Wolf, you're dealing with your not-so-great reputation of being too much of a violent hardass right alongside the various plot and subplot. Naturally, your decisions and the way you handle things have a direct impact on people who may be your closest allies in this game. Work to solve the mystery and help the residents of Fabletown!			"

												While not as DEVASTATINGLY EMOTIONAL (thank god) as the Walking Dead series, this is one cool as hell mystery that combines some very mature noir sensibilities with fairy tale characters. That alone is pretty much enough to sell it to me, and it delivers on the promise of dark, gritty twists on classic characters while also involving you deeply in the world around as it unveils itself right along with the mystery you're tracking. It's mature and has plenty of adult themes, but it doesn't indulge in these things just for the sake of them. The darker content fits very well with the sleazy underworld it's showing to you, and the writing and acting are consistently excellent from start to finish. Mystery, black humour, sudden brutal violence, and a great cast of weird, slightly crazy characters makes this one of the most enjoyable worlds to dive into in recent years. Telltale really knows how to capture a fictional setting well, so if you're into point and click adventures with emphasis on story over puzzles, you can't go wrong with this one.			"

I absolutely loved the storyline it had and you can't go wrong with how much fighting there was (in comparison to The Walking Dead games). However, this game felt very short; you could easily finish the season within a week, a few short days, or even a day-long binge session.Still, I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Telltale's interactive story games, the Fables comic series, fantasy genre, and fairytales in general.

												Another great addition to your library from Telltale, bringing their point-and-click adventure game to the universe of Fables, which in itself is heavily drawn from Grimm's fairytales. Just as the other games from telltale it's based more around story/dialogue/qte's and solving easy puzzles while solving crime as the big bad wolf. While this game is slightly shorter than other games published by telltale it still holds up and includes something that other games don't, replaying chapters to find all of the ""lore"" which is nice to show you the other side of some of the larger choices in the game. Overall great game 8/10.			"

												The Wolf Among Us was one of the best games I have ever played. I finished all five episodes in a total of 11 hours over the course of maybe a week and a half. During my first playthrough, I made the ""good"" choices for the main character, Bigby Wolf. And after seeing the outcomes of what happened, I want to play again and make new choices for the character. And yes, maybe I loved this game as much as I did because I am a huge fairytale fan, especially for shows and movies like 'Once Upon A Time'. This game reminded me of that show a lot but Tell Tale Games added the nitty gritty and violence that was needed for this game. It was entertaining until the very end and it made me wonder, ""what the heck just happened?"" at the ending. And I sincerly hope that Tell Tale Games is creating a Season 2 for this series. I would definitely pay for that. Although I bought this game during a sale, knowing how amazing this game is, I would've paid full price if I hadn't waited. 10/10.			"

												I may update this as a later point; but for now, I'll write some quick thoughtsThe Wolf Among Us was suitably badass, compelling and intense in all the right places. The characterisation was outstanding and I really formed an emotional bond with the characters. The moral conundrums were dilating and thought provoking. My judgement was consistently clouded and my decisions didn't always seem morally right. Bigby has to make difficult choices.The narrative is a stellar noir, with complex characters in an interesting setting, it's unlike anything I've seen before. I wanted to learn more about everything and the unlockable Book of Fables provided me with that.10/10 Actually, I really want to know what happened of Bufkin's alcohol addiction.1/10Alright, Bigby is pretty cool9/10			"

												Telltale games have done it again (played after all episodes released).I got this after it was recommend by friends and when I was told it was like the Walking Dead.A great game that I have been enjoying for the last few days (one episode a day but I did the last two today because I got so caught up in it).I never read the comics so I don't know how the game relates to the comics but the game is awesome and is well worth playing.*The characters are all amazing and you get caught up in their story.*There are some good choices and influence on the game plot where you get to decide where you go which is very appealing to alot of gamers.*Game is well designed and looks great.*Story line is great although I think the fourth episode was a little lacking compared to the others.*Some great plot twists if you can spot them.During the whole game I had only one issue where it kept saying *this choice is blank* but I just started the chapter again and it worked fine.Achievement wise they are all easy to get but you do have to redo a few chapters and make different decisions to get some of the fable achievements (if you like achievements).I would highly recommend this game.

 I thoroughly enjoy Telltale Games and the content they make but TWAU is definetly one of the best. I'm gonna go over the pros and cons of the game.  Pros -Lifelike characters and likeable characters.-The Telltale art style.-Amazing extras, lot's of detail about the many Fables you meet along your story.-Absolutely Stunning soundtrack.-Seeing The Little Mermaid topless.-Strong Narrative.-Astounding voice acting.-Nearly all desicions have impact on your story, large or not. Cons -No Season 2.-Will break your Q key.-You only leave the friendzone with  Snow White  in the comics.- The ending is somewhat a cliffhanger, as you do dispose with the Crooked Man then left with nothing really. -Not a lot of replayability at all, ending is still fairly the same  You catch and dispose of the Crooked Man -Can only change choices if you restart the chapterOverall one of my personal favorite telltale games ever made, worth every cent wether on sale or normally priced.

												This was like a 7 hour long interactive movie about a sheriff caught up in a dark murder mystery.  It's dark, gritty, violent, and well written.  As soon as the game starts within the first 5 minutes, you really get an idea of how the tone for the entire game is going to be.  The characters are all well written, and the voice acting is well done all around.As you go throuth the games 5 episodes, you will be forced to make a lot of choices, and often times the game doesn't give you a lot of time to think which makes the siutations that much more tense.  These decisions have very serious consequences that last over the course of the entire game.  You will find youself regretting choices, and wondering what could have happened if you had chosen another course of action.  At the end of each chapter the game gives you a break down telling you what % of the players made the same choices you did which gives an interesting point of view.The game ending for me at least was very satisfying, maybe if I had chosen differently I would have felt differently, but this is really an amazing game overall, with potential replay value in going back to replay the story and make different chioces just to see how the decision have a ripple effect on other events.  An amazing game, highly recommended.			"

If you're a fan of Disney, Supernatural beings, Fables and Telltale games such as the Walking Dead series, then this is the game for you. Based off the 'Fable' Comic Books, this game is fantastic and extremely addictive. And only the first two episodes are out, that says a lot. Compared to the Walking Dead series, decisions  in The Wolf Among Us ACTUALLY affect the storyline in a big way. And depending on what choices you make, certain chapters of the story and episode are changed. Deciding on where to go, who to see, investigate and what you say to people make a BIG difference in how the storyline plays out. This is one of my favourite games that I have played simply based on these reasons. And who doesn't love being able to interact with their favourite fable characters?  "

												Telltale’s recent foray into the comic book world of Fables is wildly successful and maintains their reputation as being one of the best companies for video game adaptations of popular media. The Wolf Among Us is an excellent multilayered mystery narrative that involves all your favorite fairy tale characters in a much darker context than you remember them. Like most Telltale games it’s more interactive story than game, one that is pretty much set on a predetermined path, but the specific choices you make can lead to some pretty crazy variations here and there and the final episode's last few minutes are still a subject of considerable debate among fans. If you're looking for a casual story-driven game with a cool art style you should pick this game up; prior knowledge of the Fables universe isn't necessary but I suppose it doesn't hurt.			"

												surveyRus and eng engThe final episode of ""The Wolf Among Us"" have proven to me, that Telltale writers can add a lot of depth and complexity to even a simple story. A lot of seemingly insignificant choices you make throughout the game end up having big consequences.And by the end, just when you think that you got it all figured out, with but a single phrase they deliver another twist that makes you look at everything that happened in a new light. Well done, Telltale and Bigby.RusФинальный, пятый эпизод The Wolf Among Us, убедил меня, что в Telltale работают ребята, которые могут рассказывать простые истории так, что в итоге все оказывается ой как непросто. Многие не значимые выборы на протяжении четырех эпизодов оказываются важными, а многие ""простушки"" оказываются значительно сложнее, чем вы могли подумать.При этом, в самом конце, когда все уже встало на свои места, Telltale продолжает крутить игроком вокруг пальца и одной фразой дает пересмотреть все события, что имели место с самого начала.

PresentationProbably most of today's adults grew up with stories about Snow White and the seven dwarfs or the Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf that was after her, making The Wolf Among Us' background known to almost everybody. Later on, DC Comics decided to publish Fables, a comic book about those same characters from everyone's childhood and explain what happened to them after their stories ended. So now the fables, as they are called, live in New York, hiding from the others using glamour, a spell that allows them to take human form, allowing them to blend in with the rest of the humans. In The Wolf Among Us you play as the Big Bad Wolf from all the stories you knew as a kid, but this time around he is no longer the heartless beast you knew, as you can see that he regrets his past and the fact that most of the other characters hate him or at least fear him. Now he is the sheriff of Fabletown, home to most fables and following the recent events he must investigate the murder of one of the fables, something that will lead him to all kinds of places and make him lose control of his temper sometimes, showing you that no matter how much he tries he will always be the Big Bad Wolf inside, but kicking everyone's butt along the journey while smoking a cigarette, similar to another DC character, John Constantine, isn't a bad thing, as it will take you on an unforgettable experience in the steps of the Big Bad Wolf, allowing you to take decisions that will influence the outcome of certain events and characters, similar to what you have seen already in The Walking Dead.Rating: 9GameplayThis is a Telltale game, so before anything expect consequences for every decision you take, as dialogue and conversation is an essential part of The Wolf Among Us' gameplay, as it will influence the outcome of certain events, scenes and change the approach that a character might have the next time he or she will speak to you. Of course choices can also be as small as telling someone a lie or hiding a piece of information from them, but from time to time you will also encounter instances where you have to choose who will you go after or even where you want to go first, something that may offer you different outcomes on some events, while other times just missing one little piece of information, without affecting how the puzzle looks in the end. Unlike Game of Thrones where people you kill stay dead, here just like in any comic book, the characters can look dead and yet come back without a problem, and while I understand that Fables are hard to kill you are never truly sure as what will kill it and what will only leave a mark on these characters unless the game tell you exactly that, otherwise anything can be considered to leave just a scratch, such as an axe in someone's skull. Just like in other Telltale titles before it, gathering information and looking around is done in the same way, by clicking dots that appear around you in order to check out an item or interact with a certain character, which may lead to an important clue or just a pointless item that your character will have something to say about.Rating: 9GraphicsThe graphic style used by Telltale nowadays fits this game perfectly since it is based on a comic book and while it had some stutters and rare glitches, those cannot prevent you from enjoying the amazing story that The Wolf Among Us has to tell. The characters look amazing and crafted following the world from which they come from, and putting them all together in such a miserable environment that is Fabletown with all of its problems shows a new side of each one of them, different from the one you remember from the stories.Rating: 8.5AudioThe Wolf Among Us shares a lot of the voice actors with The Walking Dead, which is only for the best as they provide high quality voice acting and give unique personalities to their respective characters, and while long term Telltale fans will easily recognize their voices, the way in which they have been cast makes each actor take over a character that suits him or her perfectly. The soundtrack fits the theme perfectly, and while the game does feel like it's missing a few extra tunes here and there, the quality of the overall audio makes up for it.Rating: 9ExtrasThis time around Telltale decided to offer some replay value in the form of Fable Entries and some achievements that come with them, and since most of the episodes have entries that you can miss the first time around since you can take different routes and visit different places depending on your choices, the game is worth another playthrough eventually.Rating: 8.5VerdictThe Wolf Among Us proved that Telltale Games is more than a one hit wonder thanks to the huge success of The Walking Dead, as The Wolf Among Us takes every great aspect of that game and finds a place for it into the world of Fables, crafting with it an amazing world full of unforgettable experiences and a story worth following every minute.Rating Overall: 8.8Check out the full review and a lot more about The Wolf Among Us at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=313 "

												Would I recommend this game? Oh, yes I would.Am I impatiently waiting for Episode 2? Yes, I do.Am I b*tching about it? No.Games like these mesmerize me with their visuals and story. And although I'm aware that at the end story is more or less linear, I'm not dissapointed with the plot, so far.For me it is almost like watching a complete season of my favourite series. ;)I will replay first episode soon, aparently there was life to save and I a missed that because I was too much into the Big Bad Wolf.

												pros - - solid voice talent & compelling enough story- some of the twists are genuinely impressive- QTE's used sparingly, well- likable characters make you want to play all the way through- fables really deserves its own game- dialogue options are flexible enoughcons - - obvious issues in production mean that sometimes trailers for a chapter show things that never happen (in the same vein, achievement names for finishing chapters don't match up with what happens)- since this is based on a larger comic books, certain characters wear obvious plot armor- classic telltale stutters and frame drops at some points- occasionally feels like your choices don't matter that much			"

												This is my fourth Telltale game and I can tell you that it doesn't disappoint!The Wolf Among Us brings you onto a mysterious murder case that you have to solve. It's like CSI but with old fairytale characters. The story kept me guessing throughout the entire playthrough. It really drew me in.Although, compared with some of Telltale's other games, this one definitely has a darker backdrop to it. Of course, that's how it has created such a great atmosphere that really makes this mystery shine. You've got this dark, overshadowing vibe that follows you as you play through each scene.This game is really fighting for the top spot of Telltale's games. If you like playing their games, this one is definitely one to play through. You won't regret it.See you on the other side. Godspeed!			"

												a murder mystery involving legends, archetypes, fairy tales.  excellent writing, artwork, cinematography.  atmosphere only vertigo can bring and brilliantly punctuated by excellent voice acting and music.it seems like there's lots of choices which sometimes obviously and sometimes subtly change the game - or maybe the designers just made it feel like you have a ton of choices in a linear plot.doesn't matter - every episode is absolutely engrossing, if a bit short.update after chapter 5:still recommend this, but chapter 5 was a big letdown.  aside from the awesome encounter with one nasty character the rest is terribly predictable and a let down due to the marked drop in quality of writing.  everything seems rushed and the dialogue, so good in the first 4 chapters, is weak.

												Do you like games with awesome storytelling? Do you like making choices that affect your story? Playing Cluedo, or any other detective in that matter?Did you enjoy fairytales as a child? Always wanted to talk to the Magic Mirror (Snow White) yourself? Have you always wanted to see the Little Mermaid naked?Then this is the game for you! TellTale once again wins big time by delivering an astounding game, with a very original concept, in which fairytale characters have trouble adjusting to the 'real' world, after being forced out of their story ones. The 'Fables', as they're called deal with divorces, anxiety, money problems and severe depressions. It's like the gritty, dark part of your childhood that was hidden away, but for which you are old enough now, and this all set in a murder-solving overhaul.Apparently, not in every fairytale they live happily ever after.But seriously. This game is awesome. Check it out.8.5/10			"

												Telltale had a tough act to follow after the huge impact of The Walking Dead, but The Wolf Among Us lives up to those standards. It is strikingly atmospheric, with high-quality writing and voice acting throughout. The final episode was truly compelling, and I found myself siding with the villian for a while.Aside from a few jarring animation glitches (especially in the second episode), the only real criticism I have is that it all feels too short at under eight hours - but it's hard not to want more of such a good game. Hopefully season two is on the horizon.			"

												Easily the best Telltale series ever.The Wolf Among Us focuses more on the narrative so there is less gameplay than The Walking Dead. Choices made in the game carry much higher weight than Walking Dead has, except you won't be restarting every time you hurt Snow White lets say (You would restart everytime you hurt Clementine).But the 5th Episode was a bit underwhelming won't reveal why because you must play this game for yourself!9/10			"

The game also gets even more better if you have read the Fables comic books, which are without a doubt, very good. The music is also superb and fit the scenarios very well.			"

												Excellent game, highly recommended! The art direction is superb, with beatifully rendered characters and backdrops, and some top notch music to accompany each scene.The story is a crime investigation with a very noire style, with a lot of twist and turns and some surprises along the way. There are some quicktime events in each chapter, but nothing that distracts from the story and are easy to overcome (for thos like me that dislike them a bit).In short, a very engrossing tale with some unique characters and an excellent art direction.

												If you love interactive stories with a good pitch, in which the choices you make have an impact, this game is for you. I have yet to read the comics so I won't venture on the subject of how faithful it is to the source material, but as a standalone, it's good. The ambience is that of a film noir, and the dark take on fairytales characters is a pleasure. It's exciting to place them and their tales, and see what the creators made of them. Sheriff Bigbie - the hero - is a bit of an archetype: brutal, taciturn, with his rough edges, his cigarettes and his bourbon, but it's one I enjoy. Prepare to investigate some gruesome murders and dive into the darkness of Fabletown.Careful if you're operating with an AZERTY keyboard, make sure to configure it as a QWERTY before starting, as (as far as I know, but I didn't look far into it) you cannot change the commands and part of the game relies on your ability to press the right key quickly.

												I am actually surprised more of my friends haven't played this game. It's by Telltale Games, who produced The Walking Dead, Tales From The Borderlands, and Game of Thrones.Prequel game to a comic series called Fables.Telltale's signature move of presenting you with options that might be a little lose-lose or ambiguous always bite back later, of course, and as the Sheriff Bigby Wolf, you're dealing with your not-so-great reputation of being too much of a violent hardass right alongside the various plot and subplot. Naturally, your decisions and the way you handle things have a direct impact on people who may be your closest allies in this game. Work to solve the mystery and help the residents of Fabletown!			"

First of all the style is gorgeous, the colors, the animation on the face, all of this is really nicely done. I really have the impression to watch a movie, but hey , a really awesome movie, the shots are great, some slow motion at the right time... You don't get bored, and the QTE are not like in Heavy rain, they have a meaning :DAs far as I am ( chapter 5 not released yet) the story is fascinating. I don't know if the choice that you made will really change a lot the final ending ( like in TWD), but I had a great time playing it. They tell tales and good ones.Can't wait for their next series ( Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands)!			"

												The Wolf Among Us follow's the Telltale interactive storyformula that we've come to know and mostly enjoy over the years. Basic on the Fables comic series, which I'm not directly familiar with, the story has you in control of Bigby Wolf (Big Bad) Sheriff of Fabletown as you get to the bottom of a murder mystery involving many other famous characters from children's stories and sides of them you haven't seen before. You have the usual Telltale dialogue choices, which usually can be narrowed down to whether you're a good cop or reverting back to your Big Bad Wolf days of intimidation and violence. I didn't feel that the payoff for a lot of these decisions was all that interesting, which is no surprise with Telltale's history. But the overall story is enjoyable thanks especially to the interesting atmosphere of the characters and town. I want to note that I did have a surprising number of crashes during parts of the game, and lost progress occasionally, but with PC gaming it's hard to say whether it was the game's fault or not. All in all, definitely worth a play.			"

Fantasy mash-up meets nitty gritty streets of New York in a tasteful edgy noir comic book artstyleThis was totally up my alley in terms of the kind of games I like to play: a fantastic storyline combined with great artwork. I sat down and played Episodes 2-5 from start to finish within 2 days, it was that good. This game also offers easy achievements with a very attainable 100% if you're into that - though that is expected of most Tell Tale Games.This game actually got me interested in the original comic series ""Fables"" created by Bill Willingham. I was anxious to find out what happened right after the first episode when I finished playing it, and this was shortly only after episode 1 has been released. So while waiting for the next episodes to release, I hunted down the original comics. I was a bit surprised by how different the artstyle was from the comic, but after reading the comic a bit, I believe Tell Tale did a great job adapting the story and art to a game. Both the comics and the game differ in experiences, but I really enjoyed what they both had to offer.Pros  Very likeable main character, accompanied with well rounded and developed side characters  Edgy dark comic book style artwork used throughout the characters and environments that enhances the story  Amazing soundtrack  QTEs that have a good balance of challenge versus fun; they were mostly forgiving and very doable  Compelling 'whodunnit' narrative that will have you guessing  Was mostly serious but also successfully injects some humor now and thenCons  The Antagonist in the end was a little bit disappointing, I felt like there should have been a bigger twist there?  Your choices won't really impact the story too much aside from a few achievements "

												The wolf among us is a detective game, but unlike most; while you certainly need to connect the dots, the evidence you get is fairly easy to uncover and your character can pretty much supplement any 'connecting the dots' you failed to do. No, 'The Wolf Among Us' is more a story about your choices and how you mold this world you're in with these choices.The story is set in modern day New York City, primarily in the Bronx from what I remember, where the characters of fairy tale stories have moved after their former residences became obsolete with modernisation. This secret community of fables is referred to as 'Fabletown', and you, the Big Bad Wolf from the story about the three little pigs, are the sheriff. No one likes you, mostly due to what you've done previously in fairy tales.Choices you make directly impact how the game plays out; there may be two leads you need to follow but only have time for one, or perhaps you need to choose whether you wish to spare a character or not. The leads present themselves naturally through story progression, but nearly always you're forced to make touch choices as to whether you will follow a lead or not. Parts of the story will open or close themselves depending on which route you take; following one lead may or may not help you solve the mystery, and may just bring more questions than answers.By the very nature of the game, character development was excellent, with characters changing dynamically throughout the series; the art style was memorable and does not age easily, looking fantastic even now. The sound also stays with me even now, fitting the theme of the story very, very well.'The Wolf Among Us' was a rollercoaster ride for me, and was a memorable game, easily one of my favorites to have played.

												A highly story driven, largely cinematic and very fun SP experience. If you liked Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" you'll definitely like The Wolf Among Us. It's the same basic mechanics and emphasis on writing. TWAU is a bit more ""racey"" than TWD imo (bit o nudity and related themes, somewhat more violent), so head's up if you're touchy. All the episodes are out now, so if you pick it up in the future, you won't have to wait months between episodes! :DAgain, mechanics are very simple: choose what to say, how you meander around, and occasionally QTE sequences. The QTE sequences don't feel as grossly out of place as they do in some other titles, and the checkpoint system is very forgiving. It's all about story and all about writing. Personally, I love how the adapted the art style to this title. I won't detail the story, but the premise is an investigate drama. You represent the law, and you are trying to figure out what is going on in the background and why. I completed two full playthroughs and very much enjoyed the experience. Collin's take on Machiavelli made me lmao.			"

If you liked Walking Dead, this is much the same thing, but mystery and replacing the gun with, well, the wolf among us....please don't let that line steer you away. I will say, tiny con. If you want this game, get it for the price of $15, which is three episodes. Episode 2 is, regrettably, the low point of the game. Does that make it bad? No, by no means. It just does not shine in comparison to the others. Episode 4 falls flat in the same way, but manages to learn from the Ep. 2 mistake to make it at least a tiny bit better. Effectively, you'd be paying for the price of three really fantastic episodes: the start, the middle, and the finish, while the other two episodes act as building blocks so that the next episode is entirely that much better.tl;dr - Seriously, buy it. It's flaws are omittable because this game is a fantastic 7-10 hour experience, and while I would reccommend it on sale, I would suggest to buy it at any price to support TellTale for their fantastic work. I'll give it a damn 11/10.			"

												The wolf among us is another masterpiece from tell-tale games based on the fables comics and is just as good as the walking dead. I love the art style, the dark purple colours on the city is just beautiful, the game really looks like a dark graphic novel. Story wise the game is very interesting, it always keeps you on edge and doesn't get boring. You play as the big bad wolf ""bigby"" the sheriff of fable town, where characters from fairytales live in the human world, bigby must find out whose behind a series of gruesome murders. If you enjoyed the walking dead or any other tell-tale game you will enjoy this!			"

												Excellent game, highly recommended! The art direction is superb, with beatifully rendered characters and backdrops, and some top notch music to accompany each scene.The story is a crime investigation with a very noire style, with a lot of twist and turns and some surprises along the way. There are some quicktime events in each chapter, but nothing that distracts from the story and are easy to overcome (for thos like me that dislike them a bit).In short, a very engrossing tale with some unique characters and an excellent art direction.

												If you love a good story and fairy tales then this is your game!The game is all about making you own choises that will lead to your own ending of the story. You can either play as good cop or bad cop or perhaps you're a silent type ...The story is great, the characters are amazing, and you get the typical Point and Click gameplay such as from The Walking Dead.This is one of the best games I have played in a while. I even bought the graphic novels of Fables.I'll give this masterpiece 11/10! ^^			"

												9 out of 10Telltale has done it again if you liked to play The Walking Dead so is The Wolf Among Us a game you MUST buyThe art style is yet again amazing The gameplay has developed and the action scenes are much smoother and fun to play this time around. This goes for most mechanics and the game feel more polished than previous titles. There is also some investigation and interrogation scenes that add variation to the gameplay.The story is unique and the familiar characters you meet all have some twist to them that makes them feel more human than they are. It is an interesting world we get to exploreFor fans of fantastic storytelling in video games, or a great experience in general, this is an easy buy :-)			"

												I went into The Wolf Among Us without knowing anything about the back story of the game. I never read the comics (I have now though) and I never read any wiki before playing the game. Let me just tell you that out of all the Telltale games this is hands down my favourite one.The story about the book characters leaving their lives in the books behind to live a ""normal"" life in the ""normal"" world infatuated me to no extent. The whole world the authors of the story built, made me want to read every single thing about the story after the game ends, because I just didn't want the story to end.Graphically it's a Telltale game so it has cellshading graphics. The voice acting and sound design is top notch, and it really helps to bring out the story, because by the end of the game you're really rooting for the characters you invest your time into.10/10 hands down the best Telltale game I've played to date.

												This is one of the most BA games when it comes to storytelling. This game puts you in the shoes of Bigby Wolf(the big bad wolf), and lets you make difficult Choices for him and play through his amazing story. The game is also beautiful to boot, i love the comic book look and the art direction. WARNING: this is not a game for kids, you'll meet some twisted characters and you yourself can do some messed up things in this game. I can't say enough about how great of a game this is, the story, the characters, the look, it all matches. While i dont say this often, i must say this here, this game beats the daylights out of telltales the walking dead(which is still an amazing game), and could be telltales best game yet. 10/10			"

												One of the best games I have ever played.. Right now I am sooo sad that there isn't a second season and I really don't understand why :(((( There is nothing boring about this game. Characters are interesting and well adapted, the story is really well woven and captivating, graphics are great, fights and other stuff are really well balanced, point and click mechanics are good (as they allow you to move around with keyboard and mouse like a third person game, it doesnt even feel like point and click. Also the same about fight mechanics) voice acting and animations are also so good that I felt like I was watching a tv show. Once you start playing this game you cannot stop! I found only 2 minor cons about this game. Sometimes camera angle makes it hard to see some stuff but not a big deal. And there is a time limit to make a choice between the dialogues. Sometimes you need to be fast and it can be a problem if english is not your native language or you are a slow reader. Well english is not my native language either but I didnt have trouble with it :)Just buy the game and give it a try ;)			"

												*SPOILER-FREE REVIEW*The Wolf Among Us is a game where you can beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of just about every villian in the story....10/10.But seriously, this has to be one of my favourite games from Telltale yet, with some of the noiriest music you will ever hear with one of the best atmospheres that you will ever get from a game like this.I friggin' love The Wolf Among Us for its characters, setting and the most important of all; story.  The game is set in a fictional New York City where you (Bibgy Wolf) are the sherriff of a secret part of New York called Fable Town, where you enforce the laws and protect all of the town's citizens.  And if you cannot tell, this game is full of fairy tale characters ranging from old myths, to goblins & trolls.  The game is also based upon a comic book series I had not heard of until I heard of this game about last year, and soon after I had heard of this game's existence my sister had gotten Fables: Deluxe Edition vol. 1 from her old boyfriend, and I ""borrowed"" it from her big library of books and had a bit of a read.  It got me interested in what the game was about and had this urge to play the demo on my PS3, and after I played it I was extremely excited for the day that this game came down in price on Steam...that day finally came one morning during a Steam Summer Sale and I purchased it immediately...I can safely say, that that was a wise choice, as this was quite possibly one of the best story-based game expriences since The Walking Dead.I love the graphics.  The cell-shading was a great choice for the game as it fit the comic's art style and if you look at the game from a certain distance, you could swear that you are looking at a comic panel.  I think Telltale did a marvellous job re-creating the look of a comic really well, and at the same time, capturing the comic's noirish tone and style.The voice acting is amazingly done, with Adam Harrington nailing Bigby in both voice and tone, while also putting his best into the character.  He easily did the best job out of all the other voice actors in this game, and I salute him for his great performance.The writing and story are also really well-done, as per usual from Telltale at this point,  and really put you in the mind of the Big Bad Wolf.  The writing is smart, and occasionally kind of hilarious, adding just that little bit of that trademark Telltale humor...sort of.  And the best part about the story is that it isn't confusing...it's easy to understand and if you haven't read the comic, then you don't have to worry about not knowing everything about this franchise's lore because this game's chronologically set before the events of the comic...THANK YOU, TELLTALE!And I really like the characters...especially Toad, because...he's a toad, 'nuff said.  But I also really like Bigby, because he is a well-written character with an interesting personality that almost any gamer can enjoy getting to know.  And all the ""villians"" always try to worm their way out of just about every situation you throw them in, and I punch them in their faces every time, and I find the villians incredibly well-written, (especially one certain villian that I won't spoil) and it makes making important decisions even more thought-provoking.Overall, this is a great mystery story with fantastically well-written characters, amazing voice acting, great soundtrack by Jared Emerson Johnson, astounding atmosphere and terriffic art style...that's why I recommend The Wolf Among Us.

												I've played the walking dead series and those games are truly awesome, great story and an overall fulfilling experince. I'm sure we all grew up watching some sort of ""fable"" or what have you or at the least we understand who they are. For example, the big bad wolf, snow white, three little pigs, etc. Now imagine them all in an adult like setting pretty much fighting crime and/or  being the main cause of it, to me that is just a well thought of way to incorporate our childhood to adulthood and that is what ""The Wolf Among Us"" has done. If you enjoyed those stories as a child do yourself a favor and play this game.			"

												I'm starting to sound like an old broken record by now, ""late to the party""... yadda-yadda. But what a party, man! It feels like you've been on a really good high (not that I know how's that like, I've never been near drugs - honest) and now you're starting to come back to earth.A murder has been commited in a town full of fables, glamored to look like regular human beings - at least the ones who are animals, and the sheriff - The Big Bad Wolf, a.k.a. Bigby Wolf - needs to get the bottom of it. Once the investigation starts, there are so many twists and turns that after two episodes, you don't know what you're feeling anymore. Are you angry? Sad? Happy? Excited? WHAT?! WHO DID IT?! JUST TELL ME! ... that was me almost at the end of the second episode. Not only that, who's dead? Who's alive? What is really real in this world?!... Alright, let's go back three years and to get back to the ""broken record"" thing in the beginning of this review. I finished the first season of The Walking Dead and as many others I LOVED it, it was such a thrilling ride of emotions. Along came ""The Wolf Among Us"" and for some reason I didn't like it back then. Don't know why, just didn't. I got the game in an Humble Bundle some weeks ago and since I didn't have anything else to play (blantant lie by the way, I've got hundreds of unfinished games, besides point though) I thought I'd give TWAU a go. Now I'm here, I've joined the wagon and I want a sequel. Telltale, pretty please, make a sequel for us? Get on it.			"

												This, is as honest as a review as I can possibly give, and I'm going to do it chapter, by chapter, hopefully without giving any spoilers. I'll tell you basically what you can expect without slipping too many plot points in, because ultimately, this game is worth experiencing first-hand, rather than experiencing vicariously through me.Chapter 1:You learn you're the law in Fabletown, and you've got a lot of mess to clean up. Crimes (I'll not specify, as that spoils the plot) start occurring, and you get to be the investigator. You get four choices in most conversations, which will lead you to making either good decisions, or bad ones, making you the atypical good guy or the monster everyone already thinks you are. The end of the first chapter has enough suspense to make it feel like you're out of toilet paper after dropping a log down-river, if you know what I mean.Chapter 2:As interesting as ever, primarily due to the exposure of mammary glands in a fable themed game, which definitely helps enforce the fact that this game is meant for adults (as if all the usage of the word ""♥♥♥♥"" wasn't enough in the first chapter). The somewhat expected plot twist at the end of the chapter was, as previously mentioned, expected, but written well enough to pull it off.Chapter 3: As you'd expect by now, the chapter begins with a bang. Bigby finds himself in even deeper, and further along the line, one formidable femme fatale reveals herself. The twist to the end of this chapter however, was unexpected. I've found myself rather compelled by this series so far, each chapter has me gripped. So far, I've nothing bad to say, beyond a glitch here and there that causes reponses to come up as blanks, but a simple reload of the game fixes that.Chapter 4:The good news is, you ain't dead yet! Old friendships can keep you going, you'll even have an opportunity to make amends. Bigby continues his investigations irrespective of whether or not he's injured, and the true villain finally makes an appearance, well, more of an appearance than they did in the previous chapter (which was just an arm and a silhouette). This time, you see the villain's face. God damn this game's making me want a Huff N' Puff™ cigarette.Chapter 5:You find yourself in the lair of the villain, and it the chapter begins with a violent start. Bigby's rage reaches a new height, and things get a little wild. The conclusion to the chapter is a reasonable one, a great couple of choices to be made. Ultimately, the end leaves you wondering if there wasn't more happening beyond the primary villain.Conclusion:The Wolf Among Us was an incredibly well written story within the game, the character diversity and representation was fantastic. The violence was incredibly pleasant and plentiful and the theme itself was indulgent. The music wasdefinitely a catchy, mood setting experience, and although the game had a few glitches here and there where it suggested there were blank responses, reloading the game fixes that and you lose no progress due to the game's autosave.This game was not a waste of money, in fact, I'd happily spend hours on a sequel as I have on this. I'll be remembering this Telltale classic for a while. I've gotta give this a solid 10/10, as there haven't been many games that have warranted this kind of review from me, or have pulled me in and kept me immersed for as long as this one has. I strongly, STRONGLY, recommend this game.			"

												An excellent Noir story with a compelling aesthetic, good characters and impressive writing.My only real criticism is that the story is very ""American"", and that the characters in large part are more defined by their Noir-story American archetypes than their originating fables, which unfortunately causes the otherwise interesting setting conceit to be somewhat buried beneath the genre trappings. I ultimately found this particularly true for the main characters, Snow and Bigby, who felt like they had almost none of their original fable character traits left, replaced entirely by Noir archetypes.

												Setting in a place called Fabletown, where the characters from original child stories reside, The Wolf Among Us puts you into the coat of the infamous ""The Big Bad Wolf"", who acts as the Sheriff of Fabletown, who has put his past aside to start a life fresh and without violence. But conditions push him otherwise and you will stand up against a murderer who tries to force you to return to your bestial ways while you try to uncover the mysteries of serial murders that put everyone in Fabletown at risk.

												This game brings what The Walking Dead series has lacked--a great setting full of flavor, a very strong story that has a beginning and end, a whole lot of intrigue and discovery, etc. I LOVE both, but this game beats TWD for me, and I was pleasantly surprised. I truly feel as though I am creating a story and drastically impacting the tone of it, where in TWD I felt like I was just managing relationships. The setting is interesting, full of history, and it is all in the background for the most part. The story is intense, with somewhat frequent actions sequences and a great feeling of risk-reward scenarios, and you are truly shaping how Bigby--the Big Bad Wolf--is seen among society and how people react to him. 10/10 so far (still waiting for 5).

Every screenshot looks like a page out of a graphic novel. As per the rest of Telltale's catalogue, this is a slow paced experience with plenty of dialogue and interaction mostly limited to multiple choice menus and quick time events.			"

												The Wolf among us starts really strong and episode one is easily the best part of the game. The last four episodes won't quite catch the greatness of the first one, but are still very interesting to play through. Each episode takes about 1,5 - 2 hours to complete so the whole season one is done in about 8 - 9 hours.What makes this game great is the freedom to make the main character your own. You can play the whole game as a complete brick or as a fair servant of justice. Of course the game forces you to make chooces which consequences aren't so clear to predict. Other characters of the game constantly reminds you about the choises you made in the past what really makes the feeling your choises matters. However you can't make that much difference on the main story line and most of the events are going to act the same way no matter what decisions you made.The retail price of 23 euros is too much for 8 hours of gameplay but game is regulary -75% off. Game has some replay value as you might want to see what happens when you do all vice versa.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												I would like to tell you more about why I loved this game, but ""these lips are sealed.""Just kidding.This game has a very strong and interactive storyline that people of all ages will enjoy. The characters are all based off of the fairytale characters I grew up with; the Big Bad Wolf, Snow White, the Beast, Ariel, and the list goes on. Most of the time the game doesn't flat out say who these characters are either, so it is a fun guessing game to see whom you can pick out, and who you need to speak more with to discover their true identity. Like I mentioned before, all of these characters are fictional characters from fairytale land, however, they have moved from the ""Home Land"" to Fable Town. All of these characters must use something called a 'glamour' to keep them disguised as a human, so they can hide amongst the other humans, unnoticed. Things start to get a bit messy when a series of murders are brought to the attention of the Business Office. You play as Bigby Wolf, trying to gather as many clues and trying to form as many relationships as you can to help you uncover the truth behind these murders. Are they related? Who is to blame? Is it something much bigger than a few murdered fables?I recommend this to gamers of all abilities. I have said in other reviews, I am a beginner gamer, and I was able to complete this game series with little difficulty. However, for more competitive players, there are options for many achievements as well as unlocking information about all the fables that you could meet throughout the game.			"

												Telltale Games may catch♥♥♥♥♥♥for not having much ""game"" play in their games, but they sure as hell know how to make an amazing ""Choose your own adventure"" experience.It's a testimony towards the excellent writing and characters that make The Wolf Among Us (TWAU) stand out as a memorable experience.  I would like to see Telltale start adding a little more adventure game inventory puzzles in future releases.  Give us something to logically solve like in the older point and click adventure games.   In TWAU and Walking Dead games we find an item and very shortly afterward use it, leaving no attempt of creating a future puzzling solution.   I want to also feel the choices I'm making matter, but I understand why they can't accommodate every branching choice and tell the story in a finite way.  All they can offer is an illusion of choice to make us feel like we're shaping the story.Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing story and game.   Just embrace the illusion and go with the flow and enjoy the ride.			"

												I went into The Wolf Among Us without knowing anything about the back story of the game. I never read the comics (I have now though) and I never read any wiki before playing the game. Let me just tell you that out of all the Telltale games this is hands down my favourite one.The story about the book characters leaving their lives in the books behind to live a ""normal"" life in the ""normal"" world infatuated me to no extent. The whole world the authors of the story built, made me want to read every single thing about the story after the game ends, because I just didn't want the story to end.Graphically it's a Telltale game so it has cellshading graphics. The voice acting and sound design is top notch, and it really helps to bring out the story, because by the end of the game you're really rooting for the characters you invest your time into.10/10 hands down the best Telltale game I've played to date.

												With the Wolf Among Us Telltale have delivered another brilliant interactive story. This game plays similarly to the Walking Dead in that it's a point and click game where you have various dialogue choices as well as other choices to make that effect the story of the game. The Wolf Among Us is based on the Fable series of comics. It's set in a part of New York inhabited by the characters from the nursery rhymes and fairytales such as  Snow White and  Mr.Toad. All these mythical characters had to move to our world after there Homeland was destroyed.It sounds like it might be a story for children but anything but with the characters inhabiting a gritty dark world where they have to deal with inequality and poverty and the politics that go with it. In the game you play Bigby (The Big Bad Wolf) who is the sheriff of Fabletown. He gets embroiled in a murder case and indoing so finds himself caught up in the politics of Fabletown itself as he tries to solve the crime. As already said the gameplay is very similar to the Walking Dead as is the comic book style of animation which looks great. The games main strength is it's story which i found enthralling and it really hooked me in. The characters in this game are brilliant as well and you'll meet a lot of memorable characters from the fairytales you would have heard as a child. The great thing is the characters are all very realistic in that they have their own problems like being alcholics or struggling to pay rent and feel a lot more fleshed out than the more 2 dimensional characters they are in the old fairytales.The Good:-Fantastic story with some really characters-Game looks nice with that comic book style of animation-All episodes are released now so no waiting a month or two for the next episode.-Game has decent replay value as it's worth playing again but making different choices to see how it changes the story.The Bad:-Not a lot really. I suppose the only one i can think of is that the gameplay is identical to that off the Walking Dead. Wold have been nice to see some new ideas introduced in this area.Overall I loved this game. More than i enjoyed the Walking Dead. I know this game will mostly appeal to WD fans but this is really great in it's own right and should be a must-buy for anyone looking for a game with a great story. Especially now all the episodes have been released. 10/10			"

												The pure experience with this kind of game. Making the review seems very difficult because everything is perfect to me. But here we are:Pros:- Graphic: All games of TallTaled have very well-done drawing, simple but eye-catchy, the grammar is made beautifully.- Music: Sound, Song, and character talk has the emotion in them. Not too loud to annoy me ear. Not too silent for making sleepy.- The story: Even the game is based on Story driven but Choice matters, and a lot of plot twist involve. Replayable ability makes a strong consideration based on achievement and community of TellTales.- Gameplay: The interaction is not much but very satisfying, and the ground gets strong effect of my choices.- Other: Playing as the strongest character is just cool as its finest.Cons:- Alot of emotion confuses me, and moreover, too hard to consider which choice to pick.- Sometimes, bug and glitch appear and make the choice boxes blank.Ultimately Strongly Recommend: 10/ 10			"

												I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. It's more of a movie where you get to make a few choices (even if you don't like any of them) and for some reason they throw in quicktime events which is obnoxious but I suppose not participating in them is a choice in itself.  The theme, art style, music, and setting are all terrific. The voice acting is spot on. There are adult themes like nudity and swearing but they don't seem forced which is difficult to do. The story is well done but has a few plot holes. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and if you can pick it up on a steam sale it's definitely worthwhile. Probably the best Telltale game I've played.			"

												A tremendously well-crafted prequel to Bill Willingham's ""Fables"" comics, Telltale's interactive story The Wolf Among Us is a murder mystery on the surface, but it quickly becomes an engrossing character drama and an often subtle indictment of a deeply unjust society.  The fairy-tale inhabitants of Fabletown, a magical community in modern-ish New York City that must continually conceal its existence from the mundane world, are guarded by one Sheriff Big Bad ""Bigby"" Wolf, who makes his best effort to keep his inconsistently grateful brethren from tearing each other apart ... at least, if he wants to.There's not much traditional gameplay, but it does as much as it needs to: you can move Bigby manually in small environments and click on objects and people to interact with them.  You technically have an inventory, but you generally don't need to manually drag objects to use them in the environment; special context prompts pop automatically when needed so you don't waste time with trial and error.  Fights and action sequences are quick-time events, sometimes with ""did you remember which door the bad guy used"" challenges, but most of your time is spent watching cutscenes and making choices in menus.If you haven't played a Telltale game of this sort, dialogue usually gives you up to four choices and a realistic but lenient time limit.  Bigby is a deeply interesting character who genuinely wants to do the right thing for a community that isn't always honest or trusting, but he doesn't have a lot of patience or decorum, so whether you play him as sort-of-compassionate or brutal and merciless, it feels plausible either way.  Choices sometimes follow more of an intelligent/""what's-the-point""-stupid dichotomy than straightforward good/evil as it is, but it's worth noting that a few isolated sections feel railroaded for the sake of drama.Many of the most interesting aspects of this role-playing come in the form of Sheriff Bigby's adherence to Fabletown law, which makes logical/pragmatic sense but often interferes with the day-to-day lives of the community, especially its poorer inhabitants who often have trouble affording the spell needed to maintain the human appearance that allows them to keep their home.  You can choose to selectively enforce or effectively loosen some of these laws, but the game maintains its morally gray atmosphere by making pleasing everybody impossible.You're arguably better off the less you know about the comics, because as a prequel, some of the choices in The Wolf Among Us are consequential to how the game plays out but are rendered moot very early in the books.  You meet a wide variety of fictional and supernatural characters whose interpretations and stories (such as how Beauty and the Beast are getting along, which ties into the well-focused plot) feel very adult without coming across as unsuitably 'edgy.'  The story gently introduces the rules of the setting and the attributes of its characters as it goes, and the most interesting thing about this magical community is how utterly realistic it feels, such that you might not notice some of the more fantastic aspects until stray lines of dialogue point them out.Graphic content is usually handled well: some fights and other scenes are intensely and shockingly gory (ever set a protuding bone via QTE?), and the sexual content and its impacts on the storyline are introspective and often disturbing enough to keep from feeling like needless fan service.  The language and--if you're not used to this from the story universe--the smoking seem much more gratuitous but are probably the dialogue's biggest ""flaws,"" so to speak.  Performances are astonishingly well done all around, especially from the few child characters, and some characters feel more likable/less standoffish here than they do in the early Fables volumes.The characters themselves are generally everything except boring: admirable, treacherous, cynical, rage-inducing, sympathetic, admirable, heartless, psychotic, selfish, perverted, resourceful, and even funny on a scant few occasions (often more than one of these at different times) in what is otherwise a very serious tale.  You'll be encouraged to feel a wide variety of emotions, usually without feeling like the story is stretching for or depending on them.  You'll probably have your heart broken more than once, and while the story has its share of twists, the journey and the conclusion feel satisfying even as the first episode is arguably the best and probably the longest (about two hours when the whole set took me roughly six) and most informative of the five.  At the end of all episodes except the last, there's a TV show-style epilogue that sets up the events of the next installment, and each episode shows you how your choices compared to other players', no matter whether a given dilemma was popularly difficult to resolve or wound up heavily tilted toward one outcome.  You can revisit individual scenes in an episode--the game will note when this overwrites your progress--so you don't have to replay the entire thing to see different outcomes, fill up the secrets gallery, or recall how a certain moment played out.  The characters have their own little biographies that are well worth reading, even as some of these showcase the same events in very different lights, and these segue well into the books if you do (and in my opinion should) go on to read those.With a wonderful and thoughtful story designed to appeal to adults who can accept its mature and intense subject matter, incredible art design that easily looks as good as the comic it's based on, and plenty of replay value (even if you can't bear to play Bigby as dim or 'evil'), The Wolf Among Us is a more than worthy entry into the Fables universe.

												This game is based off of a graphic novel series that features characters from old fairy tales, that are now living among the regular humans in New York city. The main character that you play is a wolf named Bigby Wolf albeit he is in human form most of the game. He's for the most part a cynical sheriff that is assigned to solve cases and take care of minor disputes. If you have ever seen the show ""Once upon a time"" on T.V., it's similar to that concept only this one is rated R.Basically the whole game is based around one murder case you must solve. This is heavily based on the player's decisions, as well the player can choose from different answers and sometimes other characters will react to different answers. I really love the dialogues in the this game which is humorous and entertaining. You can really get into the different characters of this game. The game style is very similar to D4: Dark Dreams don't die if you have happened to play that. The acutal gameplay is really simple. Even in investigating crime scenes it's pretty obvious what you have to look at. There's no heavy action play, you just have to be a bit fast in clicking A,S,D and W. Movement of the character is a bit awkward. I don't know if that's because of a cross platform issue (not sure which platform came out first), or if that's just how they are made to be. Actually this would have been an excellent game to play on my Xbox One but the steam sale made it so cheap! The ending actually left me with wanting to play more. I would definetly recommend this game. I'm tempted to see if I can find the graphic novels just to see what his original chioces are compared to my own chioces.			"

												This is one of the most BA games when it comes to storytelling. This game puts you in the shoes of Bigby Wolf(the big bad wolf), and lets you make difficult Choices for him and play through his amazing story. The game is also beautiful to boot, i love the comic book look and the art direction. WARNING: this is not a game for kids, you'll meet some twisted characters and you yourself can do some messed up things in this game. I can't say enough about how great of a game this is, the story, the characters, the look, it all matches. While i dont say this often, i must say this here, this game beats the daylights out of telltales the walking dead(which is still an amazing game), and could be telltales best game yet. 10/10			"

												This is a great game I didn't read anything about this game before I started it so I came into it fresh. I thought it was going to be a werewolf murder mystery trying to figure out who is the werewolf. I was wrong but, what it turned out to be is so much better. I believe Telltale has made an amazing IP here and I hope they keep making more and more of these games. I love how they used fables in this and I thought it was cool seeing what could have happened after thier tales ended. The music has a great fit to everything you do. I really like the title theme with bigby walking down the street and the chapter ending theme as well. I'd like to see Telltale start talking to Hasbro see if Hasbro/wizards of the coast will let them make a few games like this based off dungeon and dragons stories like the Legend of Drizzt now that would be something great.p.s.

												I just finished my first playthrough and I will just say no matter how you play this game, you are the one who gets played by the end. There is no doing right and you will feel like a failure no matter what decisions you take. But the game has a solid plot and at this point I would love to go through a second playthrough. Each episode takes about an hour to complete and you can play this game very casually. As far as point-and-click games go, unlike Life Is Strange where you get your sweet time to decide, this one will require your undivided attention because the QTE action sequences are  fast and mildly surprise you in their suddenness. People may complain about the timer on dialog selection, but I feel it is a nice way to maintain pacing in the game and forces you to take decisions as you would in real life. In a way this forces you to live the story and live with your decisions. Little note: this game looks really good in 3D and I would definitely recommend it. This game has some nudity in episode 3(I think) and some mild profanity(just the f-bomb really), and some graphic content(lots of blood and severed heads). If that turns off some people around you, be sure to watch out. Or don't. What do I care?			"

												Chapter One made for a fun couple of hours. The atmosphere was great and the art style of Fables really works well with Telltale's Art Direction. Of course the ""adventure"" parts could be a bit more invoved than just ""click everything clckable then talk to people"". The choices all work with Bigby's established character and for readers of the comic books the dynamics between characters should be an extra treat. Where the game is let down are of course the QTEs that also plagued the Walking Dead game, though the action sequences work better in this game, once you remember to always have a hand resting over Q+WASD and another on the mouse. People who do not read the comic may be at an advantage when it comes to enjoying the mystery, not knowing how various characters' futures will work out. A nice extra is the Book of Fables, a collection of Lore unlocks giving background on characters and the world.			"

												Picked this game up in the summer sale for £6.45 or something like that after a little debate, stepping into the world of fabletown is a story led adventure with your actions having more of an effect compared to the walking dead series in which a case is presented infront of you.Having an interesting take on fairy tale characters & a few others from your childhood memories, set in a dark 18-rated game. You will become hooked & wonder what decisions to choose as well as there consequences. Would highly recommend for the 7hours of play. The only downsides are the £20ish full price & the 7 hours play time, however I can see myself playing through again & choosing different actions to see how it pans out.			"

												You play as the sheriff of Fabletown (within New York) Bigby Wolf, AKA The Big Bad Wolf.  Fairy tale creatures of all kinds have taken refuge here in modern day society, and must try and find their way through this very new life.  It's a rather grim world, and things get worse when a string of murders begins.  You must investigate them and get to the bottom of what turns into a much larger scheme than just some murders.  Handle things kindly, or go in fighting.  Depending on your actions and how you talk to people, you will get different reactions from them and others throughout the game.  Really fun, probably worth playing multiple times.			"

												This game had me on the edge of my seat at all times. The storyline is compelling and unfolds differently depending on the decision you make during your playthrough. People familiar with TellTale games already know that the ""gameplay"" isn't about the quicktime events, instead it's about making the story your own personal experience through different dialogue options. The voice actors did a fantastic job and the music together with the fantastic look makes for an incredible atmosphere. To me TellTale games are interactive movies and if you are willing to spent around 7-8 hours in a fantastic universe you should buy this game.			"

You investigate the murder of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as Bigby Wolf, former known as the Big Bad Wolf, and as the story progresses you have to decide whether you get back to your former behaviour or you stay side-by-side with your righteous partner Snow White. Fantastic dialogues, hard decisions and a story without good and evil about the Fables and their society make this game to the best game Telltale ever made.			"

												The Wolf Among Us pretty much caught me by surprise. Not sure how I managed to avoid any advertising / hype, but after Telltale's previously excellent zombie adventure, I didn't need to consider for long.The first thing that struck me was how good the game looked. The comic book-styling seen in The Walking Dead is taken notch further, with heavier contrast and brighter colors, painting very vivid film noir-look, accompanied with appropriately smoky and moody soundtrack. Easily the most stylized adventure by Telltale so far.Most observant eye may catch some familiar animation frames from TWD, but such detail is lost to the imaginative and lively character cast. It's this godforsaken bunch of familiar storybook characters on the junky Brooklyn backdrop that I really started growing into. The trope isn't especially new, with McGee's Alice and also Batman Arkham series having played with the idea, but instead of gothically twisted version of themselves, being thrown in the middle of Chinatown(the movie) works itself to much juicier drama (and healthy dose of brutal violence).I wasn't previously familiar with the series, but the game does good job introducing you to the universe, with both pacing and further reading. Although the writing in the game is as serious as any good noire story is, it does leave some space for character's to self realise on the absurdity of their existance, where a bunch of comedy is derived from.The gameplay is familiar 80% dialogue with some QTE'ish action thrown in. The action scenes seemed to take a bit more cues from the yesteryear's Jurassic Park, but kept the rumble short and sweet. Kudos for the game to cleverly disguise a puzzle in form of dialogue I didn't realise I was doing until towards the end.As the end credits rolled, only thing I felt bad about was that I didn't wait long enough, that I could've just hopped straight to the next episode.

												Another master piece from Telltale Games. I purchased Wolf Among Us because I loved the first season of The Walking Dead (TWD) by Telltale Games and somehow, Telltale have managed to surpass what they portrayed so perfectly in TWD. The story, characters, art style, soundtrack, decisions and gameplay mechanics are all vastly improved in Wolf Among Us. The story of The Wolf Among Us reolves around the character known as Bigby who is the detective of Fabletown and is the Big Bad Wolf Fable character. Bigby is on the case to solve the mystery of a certain Fable's death (Spoilers). This leads you to meet a ton of fascinating Fable characters in Fabletown like Snow White, Woodsman, Toad, etc. Every single Fable character you run into is fascinating to listen to and Telltale go the extra mile by having a character profile for every Fable character if you're interested in the lore of the universe. The art style is gorgeous, it has this handdrawn vibrant noir style that looks beautiful in all scenarios, especially outside Fabletown in the colorful areas. The soundtrack suits the games themes of mystery, hopelessness and noir perfectly, there's a soundtrack for every moment, whether it's action, detective scenarios or depression, Bigby's Apartment theme is a favourite of mine. Considering this is a Telltale game, it's still a point and click adventure game just like all their games and the gameplay isn't exactly what you would call, ""fun"", but it's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be a game that makes you think, question your morality, your choices, who you trust, what you say, where to go, etc. Every decision you make affects the outcome of the story, the characters you meet and the detective case at hand and that's what makes the game so enjoyable to play. Without a doubt, Wolf Among Us is one of my favourite games of all time, Telltale have done it again and I can't recommend this game enough, especially with all 5 episodes now released, it's a must buy.10/10			"

												I recommend this game, but with reservations.I have to start by admitting, I really am not interested or familiar with Fairy Tales – and this game, or “tale”, does a good job at making sure that that isn't a disadvantage.  The graphics work well with this environment, and should even work with APU graphics.  As with other Tell Tale titles everything is polished, works well, and thought out.  It is a well engineered game.The last episode is really disappointing.  The boss battle is laughable the way it ends, I'll spare you the spoiler details, but you will laugh.  After the boss battle the game ends with about 30 minutes of talking with various characters as the story wraps it self up.  It was very anti-climatic.  The second, third, and fourth episodes were the best.  The first and fifth were slow and uninteresting.  Overall, The Wolf Among us can feel like a chore.  A bit like watching a movie that started good but lost your interest.  But the middle of the series was so good I have to recommend this game.  Its worth a play.  Many of the decisions that you have to make will leave you with regret, and that's what makes Tell Tale games great.			"

												I came to The Wolf Among Us after already reading the first nine graphic novels in the series. So in that respect this review is a bit biased because I love the books. I gotta hand it to Telltale; they did a damn fine job with this story. I am assuming it's canon, but even if not it nicely dovetails with it. And getting to see these characters moving and talking is a treat in and of itself.SPOILER:In the graphic novels, you get to meet Icabod as a fugitive, but you never get a full explanation as to why, although his obsession with Snow White is mentioned in passing. And he is up to even worse when they catch up to him!The story here is full of great twists and surprises. Every chapter has some unexpected turn that carries the storyline in a new direction. You also get to face some choices that have consequence about where you go, who you choose to trust, and whether or not other fables trust you. Bigby is as much the main character here as he is in much of the series.I hope that if a second season is made that they decide to get creative and do something different from the noire-style crime thriller. The strength of Fables is that it's not a one-note story. The series offers an amazing spin on these characters in a variety of situations and plot lines. There's plenty of interesting stuff a second season could delve into without repeating the over-arching theme of season one!Rating: 9/10Play it and then go pick up the graphic novels! "

												Telltale games really does do a great job at adventure games.  They made The Walking Dead seem interesting and I think the TV show is boring beyond belief (haven't read the comics).  The Wolf Among Us is just amazing.  They take characters from various fairy tales and put them in the ""real"" modern world and make it work.  To be honest, I had to be goaded into playing it.  I am very glad I did.  This made The Walking Dead seem weak in comparison.  There is no action, just a story.  A great story.  I cannot discuss that story without giving any of it away so...  Anyway, if you haven't already done so, play this game!  Oh, and I have heard that this is based on a comic as well.  Of course, I haven't read it either.			"

												DISCLAIMER: ""Recommend"" here is based on the quality of the game, NOT value for money. The game can be beaten in around 6 hours.TL;DR version:No gameplay BadGreat voice acting GoodShort on lore/content BadCool setting GoodEpisodic release BadGreat characters Good""Fake"" choices BadConsequences in character reactions GoodLong version:So you see 11 hours in there? These 11 hours are actually 8 as I left the game open and went to go do some irl business. And anyone who knows me, knows I take my sweet time when playing games, exploring every nook and cranny and pretty much trying to see everything there is to see, sometimes restarting from checkpoint just to see this different location to get the codex entries. That should give you some idea as to the length of the game. At a healthy pace you'd finish it in around 6 hours, and that's accounting for repeating unskippable intro.The absence of gameplay is really unnecessarily shortening the game. It could have been done with action-style navigation, with lots of secrets and lore (audio logs, diaries, you name it), maybe even side quests. It could have really used some puzzle solving, maybe recreating crime scenes, all that stuff. It could have and it would have been much better for it, but instead they decided to spend money on long QTE fights/chases and stuff. The game is very popular and costs quite a lot for it's length, so I highly doubt putting some extra dosh into gameplay to elongate the experience would result in any notiable losses for the devs, they just didn't do it because they didn't want to stray away from the formula they know well.The meat of the game: dialogues and characters are good though. I played Walking Dead (the first season) and I didn't like it and didn't even finish it mostly because of how boring and annoying the two main characters are. This was not just my complaint and TellTale took it to heart with Wolf, creating a set of amazing characters, the most amazing of which is the primary character duet: Wolf and Snow. They have very complex histories and relationships and it really plays towards sucking you into the world and the story. There's even some sort of hint at a romance there, but it's just a hint though - while well-written and thorough, there is no really in-depth exploration of any of the characters in the game. Not even the primary: the Wolf.Choices in the game are mostly fake. Aside from ""Where do I go"" choices, most of the options result in minor fluctuations of the lines without actually changing the story or content in any way. This is no Witcher 2. That's not to say there's no consequence. Sometimes characters will support you in an argument or ""argument"" if you are nice to them. Stuff like that. But it's not like you make a choice between colouring blue and colouring red. Most of the time it's more like colouring or not colouring at all, and the main plot revolves around you either being good or bad. Again this is no Witcher 2. Also about Witcher 2: this game has no failure states. You will proceed with marginally different outcomes regardless of how well you perform in the ""fights"".I don't read comics and I didn't know what to expect going into this one, as I knew Telltale are good at making plots, but I didn't like Walking Dead. Wolf Among Us impressed me with it's unique settings, it's interesting mix of fairy tales that I heard when I was a kid and extremely gruesome Noire-style scenes. I mean you get to literally fix an open arm fracture, stick claws into eyes of a famous fairy tale hero that all little kids heard of, or rip limbs off people. Not to mention seeing ""Little Merimade"" as stripper in a club. Talk about ruined childhood...It's an awesome game that seems very skimped on content and has no gameplay. I would not recommend it at it's full price, but definitely would recommend it with a discount. Even 25% off is a good enough discount to justify the purchase. I am not a fan of this episodic releases, games aren't movies and this crap really breaks the pace, so now that this season is done, would be a nice time to purchase it. It's definitely better than Walking Dead in almost every single respect: better characters, setting; while having just as good and sometimes better voice acting, animations (admittedly most animations are manual and it's not a physics-based engine, so impacts and movements might seem a bit floaty) and definitely better locations: they have  more meaning due to the detective story premise. The ending answers almost all questions, but is still a cliffhanger so Season 2 is most likely on it's way. I hold no hopes that it will actually have gameplay, but it should be interesting nonetheless. So good luck to TellTale and have fun solving this case to the players.PS: I suspected the right person all the way to the end! Yey! I'm such a good detective (although the game made absolutely NO effort whatsoever to reward or even acknowledge that fact, when the truth is revealed)...			"

												The Wolf Among Us is the a great farming simulator, really in depth gameplay and farming, but the real bit of the game shines through when a blood moon arises and the werewolfs attack! Now choose what resources to turn into weapons and what to keep to sell on to improve your farm the next day! Really great crossing of two types of games, really kicks up the farming, though there is an option just to farm with no blood moons that I really liked, it is always great to give your players more options.

												Initially the premise of this game seemed kinda corny. Faitytale characters? Really? But once I started playing and got an idea of what I was going to be working with, and got to know some of the characters in their new form I was immediately hooked.The game is very dark and mature with tons of adult language and content. I found the story to be very compelling and after making my way through chapter 1 I was immediately hooked and couldn't stop playing. I just had to know what would happen next and who was behind these murders.The voice acting was great as were the graphics, the soundtrack and game playability. The storyline came together really well, although I admit Chapter 5 was a bit of a letdown, I just expected more than it was and for it all to wrap up a little more coherently. But I still give this game a solid 9.5/10 and cannot wait for Season 2. "

												Wait a second....I haven't reviewed this yet?!?!?!  Well, let's get started then!I want to preface this whole review by saying I am not a point and click fan.  I had never played any point and click games prior to TWUA (including TWD).  I had also never read (or heard of the comic Fables).  I heard alot of good things about TWUA and was kinda on the fence about it.  On one hand the visuals looked slick and the story sounded interesting, but I had never played a point and click and thought they were mostly boring.  Well, it went on sale last summer and I figured ""what the heck"".  WOW this game blew me AWAY.  I am a big movie buff, especially the ""Coen Brothers"" films, famous for terrific screenplay and writing as well as memorable characters.  TWUA is like a Coen Bros game.  No, really.  ALL of the dialogue is real.  None of it sounds canned or corny, it is visceral and tremendously voice acted.  The characters are one of a kind, each with their own personality.  I really don't want to say too much about the story because I don't want to spoil any of it.  It is best going in knowing as little as possible.  This game is a masterpiece, however it is very much a ""mature"" title.  Alot of games get the ""M"" rating but make no mistake this game earns it.  It has lots of violence, language, and deals with very dark subject matter.  However, the game doesn't just throw all that in there just to be ""cool"".  It all contributes to the overall atmosphere and tone of the story, and deals with said items in a sophisticated manner.  It was one of those games I powered through in 1 sitting.  After each episode I just HAD to see what happened next.  Every moment you haven't experienced this game you are doing yourself a disservice.          EDIT: If you are still on the fence about purchasing it you can play the first episode free on the app store (iOS and Android)			"

Graphics are excellent and it does feel like reading a comic. They really did well with colors and the ambient.The game is more of an interactive movie. You really don't solve any complicated puzzles which is probably why the game feels short. However, the plot, characters and even the QTE keeps you wanting more.

They really do have a standard that is well above the normal level for most game developers and is really shown through in this game. The Wolf Among Us is honestly one of the best games I have had the pleasure to play, just like The Walking Dead games by Telltale. So, if you are looking for a game to change your aspect on video games, you should really get this game, and let it show you that there is a lot more to a game then guns, gore, and explosions.

Undoubting one of the best tell tale games with a great storyThis game is one of the best tell tale games out there. Don't think this game one of those boring fantasy games. Even though you hate fantasy and fairy tales you should try this game. Story is super good , a murder suspense mystery thriller! ✓ Great story , story is dark and very impressive with plot twists , I am sure you won't get bored of the story. If actually feel a part of the story because of the character and according to the decisions you make the story will change a bit. The character build is great , will you show you a complete different side of the fairy tales. ✓ Great voice acting  ✓ Graphics are fine too.✖ Not a game you can play again and again. Story lasts around 10 hours. You may find it boring to play the story again after you finish it.Nominated this game for The “Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award			"

												Another example of very good Telltale story-telling games, this game is overall very great, very colorful, nice graphics, if you played The Walking Dead Telltale games you most likely would like this one too. You play as a guy named ""Bigby Wolf"", this game is based on comics about him, he is that ""Big Bad Wolf from Little Red Riding Hood"", all the characters are form different stories, books, etc, they live in our world, but hiding that they're ""Fables"", is how they call them selves (all characters that come from these stories, books, etc), the one's that don't look like humans use ""glamours"" to look like them, but it's not a cheap thing, and the one's who can't afford it live in ""The Farm"" a little place separated place from human living zones. Bigby is a sheriff who solves crimes like a detective, finds the responsibles, facts, to help other Fables, etc, because of his past(in the tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"") some Fables are afraid or don't respect him, but he is a good guy, who cares about his friends and about others, but nervous and sometimes little aggressive. The game is basically a detective story with magic and magic/story/fairy creatures involved, the ""Fables"". There is a crime happening in ""Fabletown"" and you need to figure out all information, depending on your choices happens different things, and other characters have different relation with you.Rating by Episodes:1st  Amazing2nd Amazing3rd Amazing4th Good5th RegularOverall very enjoyable game, I liked it a lot, not more than The Walking Dead, but is awesome and not grayish, you will like it if you like storytelling games with amazing stories.

												Although the game feels shorter when compared to other similar games such as ""Life is Strange"", the game is worth your time.  Graphics are excellent and it does feel like reading a comic. They really did well with colors and the ambient.The game is more of an interactive movie. You really don't solve any complicated puzzles which is probably why the game feels short. However, the plot, characters and even the QTE keeps you wanting more. A must buy if you are into telltale games.			"

												Telltale game did not disappoint us. The story so far is simply amazing. When I played my first walkthrough of the first episode, I was truely shocked about the development of the plot. It made me feel like watching a thriller movie. Lost of questions were arisen in the first episode. I'm sure those are to be answered in the next episode. Without a doubt, I will give this game a 10/10.			"

												Overall, a nice interactive adventure from Telltale. The game is based off the Fables graphic novels, which is an amazing concept. I love the game's style, humor, plot, characters, and I would also say writing if it had been more thought-out.It's a game entirely devoid of common sense at times: ""Why would you do that, Bigby? What's wrong with you? Why you can't you ___ or ___!"". Well, why? Because I was almost murdered an abundant amount of times, because these people are suspected of murder, because I'm just trying to get information, and etc. And, the dialogue is based off these outlandish notions that have no sense to it.It's not a small issue, but extremely prevelant, so much so that I find myself stuck with these or similar thoughts almost every single scene in the game. There's a whole lot of whining, going circles and circles, in a story that's otherwise extremely interesting. Still, it's a very nice adventure I'm glad I took.Edit done to cut down on unneccessary length.			"

												Story based game with some action scenes. Your dialogue choices in game will determine the direction of the story and events that occur throughout your progression. You are Sheriff Bigby Wolf (Big Bad Wolf), the sheriff of Fabletown, a group of fairy tale characters that are living in New York disguised by magic. You are investigating a crime when you uncover much bigger things going on in FabletownI highly recommend this game, especially now that all the chapters are out. I purchased it when only the first chapter of the game was out. I did not have to pay anything else other than the initial purchase price to get access to the additional chapters (there are 5 in total). The animation is good and the gameplay fun. The writing for the story is excellent and can really draw the player in. I would definitely give this game a try, especially if you can pick it up on sale for a good price! I have no qualms in saying, though, that, even if you pay full price, this game is worth every single penny you'll spend. TellTale really hit the nail on the head with this one.			"

												By now the Telltale games shouldn't be much of a surprise in terms of gameplay. It's an interactive story. So the real question is what does TWAU have to offer you?I liked The Walking Dead series, so I decided to jump on this. I'm glad I did.This is a WEIRD world set in 80s NYC and somehow it works. It looks like the 80s in that the clothes, cars, neon setting, etc. all give it a realistic feel. Now populate that world with living, breathing fairy tale creatures like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and the Magic Mirror  interwoven in a murder mystery and you have the makings of something unique. You're Bigsby Wolf - The Big Bad Wolf - and it's your job as Sheriff to investigate this murder.Along the way, you'll find a dark tale that shows that even fairy tales don't have happy endings - murder, slavery, depression, suicide and prostitution - all come into play. It's a great story made greater by a very interesting setting. As always, these ""games"" are more interactive stories and less game. The voice acting is well done and the plot interesting. The typical Telltale art style works well in this setting.Overall, this is one of the best Telltale-type games and I wholeheartedly recommend it for fans of the material or game style.			"

												It's not really the murder mystery that makes me keep playing The Wolf Among Us. It's the meta-narrative that let's this game stand on it's own besides all the similarities with Telltales award winning The Walking Dead series. Bigby is not only a stereotypical noir detective, he's also a metaphor for the stereotypical gamer. The often needless violence itself becomes a topic of the story and there's this one question Bigby and the player need to ask themselves: Do you enjoy it?			"

												Once upon a time, in a land far away... actually, in modern times and in the middle of New York City, a community of fairytale-characters is living a life in secrecy. From Snow White to Beauty and The Beast, you know the tales. Being supernatural beings, they resort to a form of magical enchantment called ""glamour"" to appear human. To break the spell and show one's true self is strictly forbidden and would pose a threat to the entire community. The Fables, which is the name the residents have chosen for themselves, are kept in line by their own communal government, and there to enforce its will is the sheriff, Bigby Wolf aka The Big Bad Wolf - The protagonist of The Wolf Among Us and your character. Trouble is brewing in Fabletown, and Bigby is out to investigate.Gameplay-wise, this is your typical Telltales game. If you played The Walking Dead, you know what to expect from The Wolf Among Us, which uses the same mechanics (quasi-quicktime events with button-mashing, mouse-controls and a lot of dialogue).Of course this also includes the typical Telltales-style of graphics, utilising a hefty amount of cell-shading to give it that cartoony/comic look. This is an adventure-game more than anything else and, as usual, the player's choices are heavily advertised to cause a great impact on the game's later story. All dialogues have a multitude of possible answers for you to choose (including silence) and characters you talk to will remember how you have treated them in the past.The Wolf Among Us is an interactive story, and you choose the details.Before I blindly recommend this game to everyone, I should mention that it is not yet complete. In Telltales-fashion, TWAU is released episodically, with a delay of at least a month between new installments. You do get all of them for free after purchasing the game, but keep in mind that as of now, only the first episode is out, with the second one coming out in early February.Apart from this minor inconvenience, TWAU is well worth a look. The story so far is very interesting, has enough twists and shock-moments to keep you interested and really makes you wish for the next episode. Being based on the Fables-comics by Vertigo, the game has a very unique setting that should offer a fresh experience to all those who did not even know about the franchise (including myself). If you enjoyed how The Walking Dead played out, give this one a shot.			"

												Another great point and click game from the guys at TellTale. Play through the whole game at least one, before you try and replay each chapter to see what will happen if you choose a different path. The ""choices"" do not matter, but it won't hinder you from enjoying the action, characters, story and plot. 


The ""pay for mods"" thing won't last, it will go away eventually. Here's a little something to remember it by.

If this inaugural episode of The Wolf Among Us is any indication of the rest of the season, then Telltale's latest adventure game is set to provide an adventure every bit as memorable as Lee and Clementine's.

												I'm conflicted about The Wolf Among Us. I did enjoy the game and its story, but I feel like the pros and cons evened outPros:- I loved Bigby. I thought he was an excellent protagonist. One of my big gripes with games is when the main character isn't likeable. Bigby is a misunderstood bad guy turned good, and I think it worked well. The choices in the game also let you tailor Bigby to the kind of sheriff you want him to be.- It's a classic Telltale game. Episodic, story rich, and has choices you can make in the game.- The end of every episode left me wanting more. Luckily I bought the game after all the episodes came out.- Even though the game's idea isn't an original one, I still loved it. Fabled characters trying to adapt to the real world.- Wonderful voiceoversCons:- Even though I fell in love with Bigby, I disliked pretty much every other character except Toad and his son. I don't know if that is Telltale's fault or the comics, but I literally didn't care about most of the cast of characters.- The story kind of fell apart toward the end. It just got weird, and I felt it went downhill once Bloody Mary and the Crooked Man started playing a role. Also, Bloody Mary is probably one of the worst enemies I've ever witnessed in a game.- The illusion of choice: your choices in the game don't affect the story at all. The game hardly adapts at all to the choices you make.I say buy this game, but don't have high expectations.Also, there are no jump scares.			"

												Okay, so it's the new episodic quest game from TellTale Games, the guys behind Sam&Max and The Walking Dead, among with Back to the Future, Jurassic Park and more. That's why the question ""Well, how's the game?"" sounds absolutely dumb. The first episode is great, full of investigations, dialogues and combat (remember, that we play as Sheriff, infamous known as Big Bad Wolf). Telltale also made another step to non-linear plot, because now even events within one episode can turn it one way or another - like with ""new"" feature of timing (there are 2 places where you have to be urgently, and you have decide where will you go). Now it's not ""Save one or another, and he'll die 5 minutes after"" dillema from TWD - your choices really matters... Or the illusion is way stronger - it's hard to tell about that now, after just one episode.After all... If you like interesting plot with many twists, hard choices and good dialogues with great characters (some of them were taken from DC Comics) with a sweet taste of violence (there are many really violent fights, and some of them are avoidable) - come and get it. Geniuses from Telltale deserved it.			"

												If you are already familiar with The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us is the same game set in a new world, with new characters and a new narrative. Like the former, it's also based on comics.It's still a playable movie that lets you choose what to say, affecting the future of the story. At times it also turns on the pick-up-and-investigate mode, which is what adventure games like The Secret of Monkey Island are known for.Although the characters of the game having names from fairy tales and references to those tales can be a little bit confusing, putting those aside you get a pleasing detective experience only L.A.

Decide which path you will take as your actions will change the storyline. So be careful what you choose and think about the consequences.

												The Wolf Among Us is an episodic game adaption to the comic series Fables. The game takes place in a fictional New York City borough of Fabletown, where various mythical characters live. The game starts with a murder case that Bigby (Big Bad Wolf) and Snow White must solve before the killer strikes again. Their investigation leads to a dark underworld more extensive than they ever expected and the deeper they go, the harder their choices become.The game is more an interactive narrative, with lots of dialogue but there are also some light action scenes to break up the pacing. Your influence is largely felt through the choices you make, like you use your fists to beat clues out of a criminal instead of talking it out, or investigate one potential lead at the expense of another.The biggest accomplishment of The Wolf Among Us is that you really get a sense of what it is like to be Bigby. There are plenty of moments where a specific action will probably help you solve the crime, but ultimately make Fabletown residents hate you.The Wolf Among Us is a full interactive story.  As you progress along the narrative, you are also presented with choices. Each choice has consequences to the story which adapts based on the decisions you make.The visuals looks good. Overall the colours used are bright and appealing. The comic stylings manage to emulate the look of the books to a very high degree. The voice acting is amazing. Also the soundtrack is fantastic and really helps create the mood in the Wolf Among Us.The Wolf Among Us offer a great replayability, it is a fantastic game. I can completely recommend The Wolf Among Us to all who liked The Walking Dead from Telltale and also to all others.Sounds 10/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I had played the first episode of this 5-episode series about a year ago and (as has become custom for me with Telltale’s episodic content) completely ignored it as episodes 2-4 came out.Picking up where I left off with episode 2, I plowed through the rest of the game yesterday. In addition to producing episodic content on a regular schedule with consistent quality (something few have mastered over the last couple decades) Telltale does a great job of summarizing previous episodes with their “previously on” segments. This made it easy for me to jump back in.All told, The Wolf Among Us was another excellent Telltale game, chock full of difficult choices and fun quick time events. Ultimately I feel that (compared to The Walking Dead) the decisions in The Wolf Among Us were easier to make. In The Walking Dead I feel like I’m always choosing between extremes, while the world of The Wolf Among Us is mired in layers of gray. In the end The Wolf Among Us was a great hard-boiled detective story with interesting characters, in an interesting world and I’m looking forward to another season should one come along.			"

												Unlike most, I waited until all chapters were released before playing - and I can understand some frustration in purchasing the content while it is being released.  Being able to play the entire story in one go was certainly worthwhile, and the story was amazing.  This is seriously a 5 star game.  You'll get drawn into the world, as well as the mystery and you won't want to play anything else until you're finished.  Game play itself isn't that long, and sadly it doesn't have any replay value (unless you want to try making differing decsions, which isn't as interesting as you know how everything turns out).  I would definately recommend this game, but as with all episodic content, wait till everything is released and play it all at once.  You'll be purchasing this game for the story - which certainly is at a high level of quality.			"

												Please bare in mind that all reviews, no matter who they are by, are subjective to the reviewer and their opinions. In my opinion, after the first episode, I would DEFINTELY recommend this.As PC Gamer put it:“…deftly merges Walking Dead's moral quandaries with a noir murder mystery”That sums it up really; I'm not going to detail the story as that would probably result in spoilers, I recommend that you figure out the plot and characters for yourselves as it is (in my opinion) a lot more fun.If you want The Walking Dead style gameplay, classic Telltale storytelling and L.A. Noire-esque elements in an interactive experience tailored to your personal choices within the game, then this will defintely be money well spent...			"

												Another jewel in Tellatale's crown. If you are a fan of the walking dead or interactive storytelling, this is an absolute must have. And the feelings of nostalgia that came of noticing the fables that were my childhood put to life (granted in a much darker sense) made the expierience that much more interseting and enjoyable.

												A fine mix of dark fantasy, mystery, suspense, and many metaphors to real-world problems. Although the story is very well-told and filled with moral dilemmas, it is not complete. A lot of loose ends and unanswered questions make the player wanting more after that...  deja vu .

Basic OverviewStory? 7/10Controls? 5/10Replayability? 5/10Detailed ThoughtsI'm pretty sure this is my first Telltale game I've played and the first I've finished. It was a pretty solid story throughout - compelling, exciting, me wanting more (I thought it reminded me a lot of the TV show Once Upon a Time after the first episode). Then came the ending. It sucked. It came too quickly, it felt rushed, and it felt incomplete leaving many unanswered questions behind. It was unsatisfactory. I can't justify giving this game a thumbs down just because the last episode (there are 5 episodes in total) was awful, especially since the first four were amazing, but it's something to be mindful of. Moreover, if you're looking for a game where your choices actually impact the final outcome, this is probably not the game to play. Even though I've only done one run through, from the answer choices, it's easy to tell that your choices have little to no impact on the actual story - this is more like watching a TV show rather than playing a choice-matters game. On controls, maybe it's because this is my first Telltale game but the controls for moving your character were uncomfortable (FYI I'm using a keyboard); at some points it felt awkward to move around - the controls during the action cutscenes (attacking, etc.) were just fine and worked well. Regarding replayability, well like I've mentioned before, it felt like my choices didn't matter. While the story was compelling throughout until the very end, I don't feel the need to play it again and again until I've seen all the endings (heck, I'm not sure if there are any other endings or alternative routes), and probably the changes the choices make are minor and have little to no impact on the story. The only reason I'd see to replay this, is to unlock all the Book of Fables characters in the story (this consists of 5 achievements you can get). However, I'm not an achievement hunter and don't feel the need to do this, it would feel like a chore.Verdict?It's a solid story until the ending; the game doesn't really encourage replayability due to the little impact your choices make - so in my opinion, it's a one time run-through game.Worth at it's full price? Not really.Worth it if it's on sale? Eh, probably if you were interested and had this on your wishlistBundled? Lol, yes.			"

												The Wolf Among Us has had a strong first two episodes. While not emotionally draining like The Walking Dead, it is just as well written. The characters are fully fleshed out and well acted. The user interface has been streamlined from The Walking Dead's so that you have actual dialogue boxes to select and various actions to click without needing the scroll wheel or number keys. I highly recommend this to those that liked The Walking Dead.			"

												Telltale is killing it right now. I have a feeling their episodic games are going to have me addicted. This has the same gameplay and storytelling style as The Walking Dead. Telltale's developers have improved upon their combat and timing skills since they've made TWD.  The choice system gave you less time than in TWD. In TWD, you had enough time to think about the direction your response may take you which gave me a bias. In The Wolf Among Us you have just enough time to read the choices and decide. This lead to much more genuine gameplay on my part. Overall, I would highly recommend this game if you're a fan of The Walking Dead game style and you're cool with a storyline including characters from fairy tales.			"

												I love adventure games, and I love Western-style comic books and graphic novels. This is an adventure game based on a comic book series written by one of the principal writer's of Image Comics, 'The Walking Dead' series. The adaptation for television is now a blockbuster tv show. The gist of the 'Wolf Among Us', series is that Fables have been forced to update themselves in NYC, and you are the Big Bad Wolf, and Fabletown's Sheriff. There has been a murder in Fabletown, and as Sheriff you have to play the gumshoe and solve the case. Simple gameplay, with lots of story. Finally, your decisions, wise or otherwise, have a large effect on the results of the game. If you like the genre of this game, then its well worth the try.			"

												This game comes from the Telltale Games, creators of The Walking Dead games series and it feels pretty much the same. It's not a game per se. more like an interactive movie, with interactivity limited to several point-and-click scenes, a handful of QTE and a couple of plot-developing choices. However it still mananges to keep you glued to the screen for the (short) duration of the game. Its strenagth lies in the plot, setting and character design that feel like they came straight from the comic books. My main gripe wth the game is its price - for a two-hour experience it's a bit too much. Hopefully the DLC will come ant a discount			"

												First of all, you need toknow that i might not be clear sometime since I am French.First TellTale Games are pure genius. Why?, They created a game where your choice as an impact on the story. After I have played The walking dead ( who was awesome too ) I saw this little jewel in the steam store. You are playing the character of Bigby, Alias The Big Bad Wolf, In fable town. In this game you will see a lot of character from the stories you read when you were little. And , in this game, you are a detective and you are trying to find the murderer ( won't tell more since it could be consider as a spoil).So first, I would comment the story. I don't have anything negative about this since it is rich and like i said before, if you do an action, the story would be different than if you had done another.Secondly, this game, in my opinion, is worth the price. You will have a lot of fun, and some time the choice are difficult to makes. You will have approximatively, 1 hours and 30 minute fore each chapter minimum. It might not sound a lot but it is. But I need to say that this game is not for everyone since it is not a FPS where you have a lot of action everytime. It is sometime a point and click, so if you don't like that, do not buy it .Now about the graphics. For me a game with such content can't be bashed on his beauty. If you want me to compare, it looks like borderlands. A bit cartoony if I can say this like that but still beautiful (IMO). I just want to point out that it is not skyrim with all the mods on.If you did not buy the game already, you'll see that all the episode are there since today actually. I just want to point out that they are doing an episode every months I think. In this game all the 5 episode are already out, so you'll already have all the episodes when you will buy the game. But if in the futur you see another game form Telltale Games, do not be suprise that the episode are not all out. In conclusion, If you want a game that looks like a Tvshow, but you are interacting in it, you should buy this game. If you found that, with my argument, this games looks good do not even think about it.Buy it, you won't regret it. I hope I have help you all out and I am open to comments, I love to discuss. So in final I give this game a 9/10! Have a goodtime and a great day.			"

												Yet another incredible story driven game by Telltale ! If you're used to their games, the graphic and artistic styles won't comes as a surprise.I felt they really improved on this one. I specially appreciated how they depicted a dark but lively world, with magical creatures that try to adapt to live in our modern times and end up in the lowest part of our society.The story , a mature world, with sex and violence, gore and profanity. NSFW or whatever; is absolutely amazing. Well written with tons of mystery, it takes the Fables, all the classical, and put them together into a completely new context. All the characters that we encouter are charismatics, some of them even bringing in comedy; and i would have liked to know more about them to be honest. The voice over actors did a very good job, but unfortunately sound quality wasn't quite there. At least the music was great : the main theme is amazing for example, it just sticks in the head, but not in bad way.3 complaints i have : I felt that the game, on the overall, was too short, even after exploring most of the possibilities. There's not enough action or investigation moments, and unlike The walking dead or Back to the Future for example, i am not satisfied by what choices were offered.Secondly, QTE, i never liked them, but here they added frustration during my playthrough, either i didn't have time to type the right button at the right time, or i didn't mash Q fast enough. And sometimes, it's impossible to even do them so why bother ? I am not againts them, but QTE should be arranged in a way that is suited for this kind of game.And third, i fear that we won't be seeing a sequel anytime soon considering that TWD season 2 isn't finished and there are two new titles coming this very year from Telltale : Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones. I am a bit curious about them but i can't say i appreciate seeing their other IPs probably getting delayed because of that. I am particulary sad they choosed to adapt Game of Throne, there is far too much hype around this about everywhere already.To conclude, I still have hope there will be some good news later this year. And I still have to get season 2 of The Walking Dead. But as of now, The Wolf Among Us is my new favorite Telltale game, and what makes it special for me, what makes it the best Telltale game as of yet ? Well, the one thing i really appreciate in a story is when i get to live most of the human feelings through it. And that is their only game that managed to do it so far.			"

												Wolf Among Us is a perfection of the storytelling model Telltale presented through The Walking Dead. Instead of focusing on a story of survival, the game has players don the role of Bigby Wolf and investigate the truth behind murders taking place in Fabletown. The story is engaging and the mechanics do a good job of supporting the plot in order to create an engaging narrative.			"

The wolf among us is with no doubt the best Telltale game so far and is one of the best games from all time! YES! its even better then the walking dead season 1 and 2! I love the walking dead! Not only the games but the comics and the show, to be honest i never read any comics about this one. The wolf among us is a perfect game in all ways possible. Amazing story, graphics and design are just freaking awesome, and have the typical gameplay for telltale game, if you love the others games, you will love a lot this one. This game is based in the Fables storys we all known from our young times. You play as ""Big Bad wolf"" is the detetive short a say, and typical one, i mean looks awesome, cigarrete always, very straight guy and so on. This is a crime/drama game, and it is what makes this game so awesome! Review: 10/10			"

												The wolf among us is an amazing adaptation of the comic series ""Fables"".The story in this is very captivating, and the way the player can control the choices using both dialogue and quick-time events really helps the immersion factor. It is also very in line with the tone that is set in the comics, with a good amount of humour thrown in as well. The characters are also well portrayed in this, if a little jumbled up because I don't beleive it uses the same canonical sequence of events.The art style in this game really captures the style of the comics, but in its own unique manner. I did see a few graphical issues while playing, but nothing major. Telltale also did a good job at converting the setting of the comics into a 3D environment, as well as continuing the style in adding new locations.The soundtrack in this game is brilliant. It does a good job at adding ambiance to the story, as well as the environments.I've only played the game once, but I do see a lot of replayability in the future, as there are plenty of choices that could affect the outcome of the entire story.Overall this game is well deserving of its awards, and definitely worth a buy if you want a game with a good story to it.

The story is super immersive, for the duration of the episodes I'm just completely taken over by the world of Fabletown, I connect with the characters and I genuinely care about what happens to them. You feel like your decisions hold true weight, and it's your choice to either be the Big Bad Wolf, or the Wolf that is not as bad as everyone says he is. (I personally chose the latter). Purely up to you.I also recommend picking up the Fables comics, if you haven't yet. tl;dr: 10/10 stop reading this and play the game already			"

												This is a great interactive story that lets you choose how the story unfolds. If you are looking for lots of gameplay, then this may not be suited for you although playing through multiple times and making different choices is also fun to do to see how your actions affect the rest of the story line. I really like how the story has multiple scenarios that the player can choose to play through and that there is more weight on some descisions than others making for some interesting gameplay.The story in itself is very intriguing as you play as dectective Bigbie Wolf(The big bad wolf) trying to solve crimes around the fables in Fabletown.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story based games, murder mysteries, or point and click games. Play it for the story not the gameplay.			"

												(9.5/10)I really was not sure what to expect out of this game.  I was not familair with the 'fables' source material, and enjoyed, but did not necessarily all-out love the prior telltale outings (sam & max, walking dead, etc).Well... 15 minutes in I pretty much was hooked.  The characters feel very well realized, and I was emotionally bound up in the story more deeply than I've been with a game in years.  The quicktime events are mildly frustrating, as they pretty much always will be in games, but this is no ""Tomb Raider"" and you can miss a few of those triggers now and again without it ruining the game for you.  The ""silence is always an option"" actually had me sometimes seriously sit back and wait, as the prepared responses simply didn't feel right, and generally the non action was more the action I felt was right and fit well.Certainly very highly reccomended on many levels for all who love adventure games, noir in general, and fables or other 'darker' ediger modern fairy tale stuff in general.  I dare you to not just play it all the way through... assuming you have the time of course.			"

Only downside of this game for me is it is a bit short 10 hours, but every one of them is very intense so i would say it is worth it.You can decide to roleplay in it, but the biggest thing for me in this game was that i leared alot about myself, by the choices i choice through out the game and it really got me thinking, i hope you people do as well.

												When I first heard of this game from a friend, I was like ""Meh, maybe I'll check it out."" A month later, my friend was still bothering me about it, so I watched the first episode of it via YouTube. In the first few minutes, I was absorbed. The game already had a good developing story line, and I LOVED the characters. At that one moment, I decided to give TTG all my money and buy The Wolf Among Us not only for one system, but for two (my Xbox 360 and my Steam). And now that the season is over, I can assure you all that this game is a work of art, and while I also thoroughly enjoyed the Walking Dead Series and S2 (Still currently enjoying) I can say that The Wolf Among Us definetley had a stronger feeling to it. I was the law, but I didn't get free donuts or anything. I got mean glares, and I got in trouble (frequently). I got to play the good guy, who wasn't popular or loved, but hated. I was the Big Bad Wolf, the sherriff, yet I still had life hard for me. And there was so much drama and suspense sometimes that the Wolf had to make descisions that would ruin him and any others. This really pulled me in, having a position so powerful and matching it with a character who doesn't always play by the rules and still had the ability to ""Lose.""The Wolf Among Us is for people who enjoy a good mystery, action, and  suspense. So yea, I highly recommend it, and you should all give TTG all of your money for making such a masterpiece like this. Bravo, TTG, Bravo.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is another superb game by Telltale. I think the biggest testament I could give to it is that even though I spoiled the whole game for myself before actually buying it, I still went through it and finished it without complaints, in 5 days straight.Length-wise, it might not seem worth it; one playthrough took 9 hours for me. But these were 9 hours of superb entertainment. Hell, I even hooked up my TV up to my laptop, and to be fair, it was far better than anything that was actually on TV.Where do I begin? The story is really great, and it uncovers a bit more of the mystery in every episode -- just when you thought you knew everything, the game throws you a new curveball. Your choices might not matter that much (as in, the plot goes roughly the same direction whatever you do), but what's great about the game, is that most likely (unless you consciously try to play otherwise), you won't be a ""black"" or ""white"" character, if you will -- but you'll probably end up in one of the shades of ""grey"".The presentation is splendid. The Walking Dead (season 1, to be exact) had moments where graphics left some things to be desired, but Telltale really upped their ante here. The visuals feel like truly out of a comic book, with many vivid, lively colours around that, contrasting with the shadows, contribute to the noir-ish atmosphere. The sound is really good, as is the voice acting... but anyone who has played Walking Dead season 1 might find the re-use of the voice actors... pretty jarring.And for the end... the gameplay. It is a QTE-thon, if you will, but those QTEs really get you involved in the game and make the experience truly complete. The way the developers used quick-time events to represent your character's strength... it is really apparent, and is the last piece of the immersion puzzle.Overall, I strongly recommend The Wolf Among Us. It seems Telltale are not stepping off the right track, as I can't honestly say I've played one of their games I didn't enjoy so far.			"

												Interesting characters and storyline. If you are a fan of Changeling: the Dreaming or Changeling: the Lost, you should give this game a try. A very nice interpretation of classic folk tales. (I know it is based on a series of comic books, but I met the univers in this game and I think it is working well in this medium.)While you don't have much time to make up your choices in the game and the character movement and overall pace of the game is rather slow, the animation and the voice acting is perfect, thus the problems are not so disturbing. Choices have a significant effect on the story, however, due to the slow pace of the game, I'm afraid that the replaying of the game will not be so satisfying.			"

												The Tell Tale games are great when you just don't have the energy for other games.  They are like interactive movies that both enterain and engage.  I find the company's games perfect for a quiet night in where I can stuff my fae with food and still be able to easily engage in a game (I am not very good at multitasking food and games!).  The Wolf Among Us is based in the universe of the Fables comic book series.  It felt very true to the series for those who are big fans.  The first season surrounds a mysterious murder of a Fabletown inhabitant that the main character, Bigby Wolf (The Big Bad Wolf) encounters very early in the story.  There is mystery, murder, magic, and fantasy as well as some good old fashioned gore.  There are several plot twists that are quite catching.I personally look forward to another season of this series.  I have enjoyed it just as much as The Walking Dead.  It's a different genre but the story gets better and better as you go.  It's been years since I really have enjoyed point-click story games.  Tell Tale Games has done a great job with everything I have played of theirs so far.  Even if it is not my cup of tea, I have picked up their games and always found myself enjoying the story.  I hope you will give this one a chance.  You may fight yourself pleasantly surprised by the darkness twisted into our childhood tales.			"

												This is one of my absolute favorite games of all time! I may be a bit biased due to the fact that I am a hardcore Disney and fable fan but regardless of that I think this is right up there with The Walking Dead. I think The Walking Dead was a bit more emotional for me and hence I tended to like it a bit more than The Wolf Among Us but the characters and the references are what really appealed to me and won me over here. Try this game if you like darker themed Disney or fable stuff. I have a feeling you'll like it! :3			"

												I would've played this game months ago had I known it was a noir detective story set around fairytale refugees living in grime and magical squalor in the underbelly of New York, and the protagonist is The Big Bad Wolf trying to reform himself and leave his huffing and puffing in the past.Made by the same guys who did The Walking Dead series, this is a choose-your-own-adventure story with great replay value. It's just the right length, and simple enough that even people with little or no gaming skills can still appreciate it. It's dark, delicious, and just the right amount of evil.			"

												Wolf Among Us is easily one of the single best video games I've ever had the chance to play, and has stuck with me after beating it like only a few games before it had *Games like Halo 1 when I was still feeling the pre-pubecent sting of young adult hood or Kotor with its many branching paths plus emphasis upon ones actions*.  A combination of maltese falcon meets the wire, Wolf Among Us firmly places the player into the shoes of gruff no nonsense sheriff Bigby Wolf as he has to navigate the seedy underworld of fabletown amidst the squalor of 1980's New York to either reaffirm himself as king supreme of bad dudes everywhere or as a miscast man trying to make up for the pain he's inflicted upon his fellow fables in years past. If you love crime drama's and have a taste for the strange, then I whole heartedly recommend this game. For that matter I can't help but recommend this game to everyone willing to divest their time in a good story driven by player choice and the consequences that follow! 10/10 Dogecoins			"

												What can I say? This game had everything: an opposite-werewolf, a flying monkey, New York City, and office supplies! My only complaint is that the office supplies never took a prominent role in the story. How am I supposed to get any real detective work done when I don't have any pens? How can we expect Fabletown to run without staplers and fax machines? I hope season two expands this element of the game, and goes the extra mile by including kitchen supplies and vaccuum cleaners. If there is a pig living in my apartment, I need some way to clean it!			"

												The Wolf Among Us is a typical modern Telltale game. An adventure game which focuses on story with minimal interactivity (QTE gameplay with no puzzles). What saves the Telltale games is that they are good at writing stories and even better at presenting them (for the most part).The Wolf Among Us has the best story in a Telltale game so far, and that is all you really need to know if you played any other modern Telltale game, the only thing that really differes in them is the story. And with an excellent story you get a really enjoyable game.8 / 10			"

The gameplay is somewhat hamstrung by the fact that most of the time there's... really not a lot to do, and even the trademark Telltale storyline branching isn't that interesting here, as the story is mostly linear, at least compared to something like The Walking Dead.BUT what is here is great - fantastic characters, exciting plot and just all-round a really fun game!It doesn't reach the heights of The Walking Dead, but it's a great game nonetheless!

												Extremely entertaining, thus said, this is not a game... It is a story that has been ""gamified"", meaning that, it has interactive momments, but it is mainly just an animated series.The story is a completely different take on classic fables. Snow white, beauty and the beast, big bad wolf (what you play as), etc. They now live in the real world, with real problems...First of all, for those expecting action, there isnt much. Some reaction buttons here and there, but like i said, its mainly an animated series with a couple of player interactions. Not like ""Shenmue"", so dont worry about having to be fast lol... About mechanics and what you can do? Well, you pick frases and actions everynow and then, that sometimes affects the storyline but usually just affects the outcome of the conversation... slightly...  What i should point out, is that this action/words choice, is not like bioware games. It definetly doesn't change the game as much, but it will make you think more.The choices here are emotional, it is not about the item you want or how you want to behave, but more about how you react emotionally. They feel important and heavier. Mainly because this game is a drama and there is a time to pick your choice, so that it feels like an actual conversation. Wierdly enough, you will feel realism here, eventhough its cartoonish and 105% fiction.It is a refreshing and original experience that earned TellTale their name and fame. Imo the best game they have, since it  works ontop of classic children fables while bringing a police/drama theme. Will ""magically"" distort your reality a few times, making you react in ways you would and wouldn't...			"

												Yet again an amazing story by telltale games. In the wolf among us you play as bigby wolf AKA: the big bad wolf, you work as the sheriff in fabletown, a small place in new york. Fabletown is occupied by civilians called ""fables'. Fables are characters from old fairy tails like snow white, little mermaid, and little red riding hood. The story is really dark, and has a lot gangs, murderers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and black magic. When you play the wolf among us you'll experience something that just tingles you with excitement. You should totally give the wolf among us a try. But dont forget gameplay isn't the main priorty. In my opinion i'd give The wolf among us a 8.5/10			"

												This game is similar to Telltale's The Walking Dead in that most of the gameplay comes in choosing different dialogue choices or choosing where to go first.

If you enjoyed Telltale's The Walking Dead, you'll like this game.  I thought the story was even better than The Walking Dead.On the other hand, if you didn't like The Walking Dead (for any reason other than zombies, zzzzzzz) you won't like this.  If story is unimportant and gameplay is king, then the handful of QTEs in this won't satisfy you.			"

												I origanally thought The Wolf Among Us was going to a game like The Walking Dead.  Like TWD the game is story based and the decisions you make throughout the story impact the game and the ending.  TWAU however focuses on a noir and mystery based story instead of survival.  The game is a prequel to the Fables comic books, you play as Bigby Wolf, the sherif of Fabletown.  The Fables in the game are entertaining and the game has many decisions which can lead to many outcomes.  The graphics fit the game nicely and the game's atmosphere as well.  If you are a fan of the Fables series or Telltale games and you don't have the game yet, why haven't you bought it?  If you haven't played any Telltale games before, I suggest you try it.			"

You feel like your decisions hold true weight, and it's your choice to either be the Big Bad Wolf, or the Wolf that is not as bad as everyone says he is. (I personally chose the latter). Purely up to you.I also recommend picking up the Fables comics, if you haven't yet. tl;dr: 10/10 stop reading this and play the game already			"

If you are looking for lots of gameplay, then this may not be suited for you although playing through multiple times and making different choices is also fun to do to see how your actions affect the rest of the story line. I really like how the story has multiple scenarios that the player can choose to play through and that there is more weight on some descisions than others making for some interesting gameplay.The story in itself is very intriguing as you play as dectective Bigbie Wolf(The big bad wolf) trying to solve crimes around the fables in Fabletown.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story based games, murder mysteries, or point and click games. Play it for the story not the gameplay.			"

												One of the things I appreciated right from the start of A Wolf Among Us is its unique premise.  I was genuinely hooked from the beginning.  Similar to The Walking Dead, they drop you into the middle of a layered situation which creates a lot of questions in your mind which, in part, compells you to play more to gain the answers.  They did a really good job at gradually feeding you bits of information while at the same time creating more questions, it felt like a good ratio.  Because of this, A Wolf Among Us never stopped being exciting to play.  Having also played The Walking Dead it is actually somewhat difficult for me to decide which I liked more; that's high praise.			"

												My rating for The Wolf Among Us is four stars. It narrowly misses out on top marks due to the above-mentioned technical hiccups. It also feels like Telltale is just emulating Walking Dead’s winning formula instead of innovating. If I had to compare the two, I would say that Walking Dead made more of an emotional impact on me. The Wolf Among Us however edges out the contest for most colourful characters, thanks to its cast of fairy tale stars. Story wise I would say that TWAU is the better of the two, as its mystery yarn is more interesting than a zombie apocalypse tale. TWAU also has a powerful ending, which trumps Walking Dead’s “fishing for a season two” finale. Should Telltale ever abandon video game production they should consider entering the marketing business instead. Just like The Walking Dead, after finishing The Wolf Among Us I am interested in sampling the comic it is based off. They are in effect making interactive adverts that I am happy to buy!			"

												The Wolf Among Us is a typical modern Telltale game. An adventure game which focuses on story with minimal interactivity (QTE gameplay with no puzzles). What saves the Telltale games is that they are good at writing stories and even better at presenting them (for the most part).The Wolf Among Us has the best story in a Telltale game so far, and that is all you really need to know if you played any other modern Telltale game, the only thing that really differes in them is the story. And with an excellent story you get a really enjoyable game.8 / 10			"

												One of Telltale's best games.  This is where they solidified their formula, and presented us with some of the most riveting and engaging story-driven gameplay yet produced.Wat for this one to go on sale, as it seems to happen quite often, and nab all five episodes.  The story is second to none, the art style is amazing, and the voice acting SHOULD have been award-winning.  This is a game that treats you like an adult, and plays so well and so smoothly that you'll be driven to complete the story.  There is even a fair amount of replay value to try out different choices and see how the story changes.  Sure, the big story doesn't change that much, but just like life, it's the little things around you, and the people you directly interact with that can make enough differences to keep you coming back, and playing a different Bigby many times.

												Well... I'm not sure how to put my feelings about my game in to words. I picked up the game and got so in to it, that I beat it the same day. I literally just beat it, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's 2:14 friggin' AM when did that happen... ANYWAYS, this is seriously an amazing game. If you've never heard of the comic series it is based on, 'Fables', that's fine. I hadn't either, and I still enjoyed the game immensely. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I'm tempted to go out and find the first issue of the comics and give it a try. Not gonna spoil anything, but I will say that the game reels you in as the episodes go on, before yanking you in and out at the end. The guys over at TellTale did a REALLY good job with the visual presentation on this, and personally... I prefer it over TWD games. I know, shoot me now. But I REALLY LOVED THIS. And I loved TWD too! But I still have to admit it that it didn't suck me in to it's world as much as TWAU did for me. If you haven't played a TellTale games episodic, then I whole-heartedly recommend starting here. And if you have, yet haven't picked this up... I'm just gonna give you a questioning look over the internet now. Yep. Can you feel it? That's the stare of questioning. Well enough staring, I'm gonna go to bed... Pick up the game though. Seriously. It's amazing. Tenouttaten.			"

												Wowzers, two chapters in and I adore this game.  I am a Fables fan, so that would nearly be enough to please me, and I've enjoyed other Tell Tale games, but this exceeds both of those factors in spades.  The writing? Great, entirely up to Fables standards, and unique enough to stand on its own.  The visuals?  Comic-like, yet fluid and dark and vibrant, and just, wow, it's what I've always envisioned when I though of pulp and noir at the same time.  The gameplay?  The best I've ever experiences in a Tell Tale game.  Everything I loved about the first season of Tell Tale's Walking Dead. only better, if possible!  I love this game!  My only complaint?  I wish I had more time to play it!  Now... bed at a reasonable hour... or another episode... hm...			"

												I'm going to keep this short. If you want a detailed review, look at someone elses.Story: Murder investigation with action that have a side-optionI enjoyed the game. It like walking dead but more of 'who did it' investigation with fighting action here and there.Pros: I don't want to ruin the game for you guys. If you want to know the pros, look at someone else's status.Cons: They cussed almost every single time. Every single line. It's not like Walking dead where you only cuss when they are angry and they are attacking you.... You and them literately cuss even when everything is perfectly fine.Another thing, You might encounter a bug where you can't finish the ending of 4 and 5 episode, due to a glitch in the 'Choose your options'. Warnings: Breast Naked Girl dancing in the strip club. Cussing every few minutes. 4-5 episode have ending bugs (you may or may not encounter them) but to fix them, you have to go to the menu screen and continue the game again.Would I play it again:   No. It's depressing. Good story but it one of those games where it isn't worth repeating. You'll know when you play all of it.I don't rate things. I just enjoy games. So I'm not rating anything.

												Really glad I picked this up. Was a little hesitant after playing The Walking Dead. Whilst I didn't hate that series. I was a little tired of the zombie thing and it grew stale for me.This was interesting, from the word go. It's short enough to play in short burts, or long enough to play all episodes in a day or weekend, which made it the perfect break for a few other games I've got on the go.The characters are all interesting and I wasn't actually aware of their 'backgrounds' until I started playing the game as I'd not done a whole of a previous research into this game. I'd recommend giving it a shot. Especially if you pick it up on sale, but even for $30 I don't think you'd be wasting your money.			"

												Ok where do I start. Smart Brutal Noir Masterpiece 10/10. If you are going to buy this, you are so lucky you don’t have to wait a Full year to get from Episode 1 to Episode 5, but the wait For Season 2 will kill you. I am a fan of the Comics since I was very young and was angry and hopeful about Telltale messing with one of my favorite comics, but Telltale deliver on their own brand of Quality and Respect the source material as they create their own universe around it. As a very Noir Game, This is a Detective story in the real world with a Fairytale cast, and you will soon find out there is no such thing as Happily Ever After. The Story will abuse your personals feelings, play with your mind, and test your own sense of morality. How far are you willing to go for answers? Did you do the right choices? Why are you really doing this? Who can you trust? Are you the Big Bad Wolf? If you ever want to make the case of Video Game=Art, this should be in your list. Can’t wait for Season 2			"

												Good Lord this game has a fantastic story. From the moral descisions you have to make in the space of a few seconds, the tense action scenes, and the well-written dialoge (both from the characters and your own character) make this an absolutely superb story-telling adventure.In the Telltale Games style, it is mostly a point-and-click adventure, but it's so much more than that. The colors are vivid, and in this particular case, sometimes oversaturated to give the feel of NYC and to make it look much like the Fables graphic novels came to life. The voice acting is just as good.You play as Bigby Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf of ye bedtime stories of old, turned sherriff of Fabletown, a small neighborhood in New York City. A murder (or two...or three...or four) has just happened in the most gruesom fashion, and you're given the task of finding out who committed it, and why. It's up to you if you'll be the bad cop, or the good cop, who your suspects are, who you'll convict, and, if proven guilty, their sentence.The story is based on the characters of the Fables graphic novels and so you'll meet characters you already know (albiet with a very different personality then you remember) such as Snow White, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, Ichabod Crane, Belle and Beast, and Bloody Mary, just to name a few. Some characters that were ""good"" in the fairy tales are now a little shady, and others that were shady are now (seemingly) trustworthy. While it is certainly not necessary to read the graphic novels to understand and appreciate the characters and the story of this masterpiece, I think it'd be worth your time to pick up the first three issues or so and read them, just to get a feel for the characters and their personalities. They're free the internet somewhere, so no extra cost.But I digress. Top-tier story, sublime voice acting, gripping action scenes, beautiful artwork, and excellent dialogue and dialouge choices make this a definite purchase even if you're barely contemplating it.			"

												Yet another incredible story driven game by Telltale ! If you're used to their games, the graphic and artistic styles won't comes as a surprise.I felt they really improved on this one. I specially appreciated how they depicted a dark but lively world, with magical creatures that try to adapt to live in our modern times and end up in the lowest part of our society.The story , a mature world, with sex and violence, gore and profanity. NSFW or whatever; is absolutely amazing. Well written with tons of mystery, it takes the Fables, all the classical, and put them together into a completely new context. All the characters that we encouter are charismatics, some of them even bringing in comedy; and i would have liked to know more about them to be honest. The voice over actors did a very good job, but unfortunately sound quality wasn't quite there. At least the music was great : the main theme is amazing for example, it just sticks in the head, but not in bad way.3 complaints i have : I felt that the game, on the overall, was too short, even after exploring most of the possibilities. There's not enough action or investigation moments, and unlike The walking dead or Back to the Future for example, i am not satisfied by what choices were offered.Secondly, QTE, i never liked them, but here they added frustration during my playthrough, either i didn't have time to type the right button at the right time, or i didn't mash Q fast enough. And sometimes, it's impossible to even do them so why bother ? I am not againts them, but QTE should be arranged in a way that is suited for this kind of game.And third, i fear that we won't be seeing a sequel anytime soon considering that TWD season 2 isn't finished and there are two new titles coming this very year from Telltale : Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones. I am a bit curious about them but i can't say i appreciate seeing their other IPs probably getting delayed because of that. I am particulary sad they choosed to adapt Game of Throne, there is far too much hype around this about everywhere already.To conclude, I still have hope there will be some good news later this year. And I still have to get season 2 of The Walking Dead. But as of now, The Wolf Among Us is my new favorite Telltale game, and what makes it special for me, what makes it the best Telltale game as of yet ? Well, the one thing i really appreciate in a story is when i get to live most of the human feelings through it. And that is their only game that managed to do it so far.			"

												A great series that doesn't lurk in the shadow of The Walking Dead, but rather stands on its own for its own merits. A great storyline, well-written characters, and the Fables universe make for one hell of a noir murder mystery setting. The series is rougher than TWD I belive. Nudity, lots of language, drugs, stalking, and other unpleasantries make for one seedy Fabletown. There is a LOT of cursing. Some may be bothered by the amount here. Any fan of the Fables comics, Telltale games, or just great narratives should check this out. The whole season is great, except for that cliffhanger ending. >_> I hate you Telltale.Oh, and by the way. You play as The Big Bad Wolf and can fight the Jersey Devil, Grendel, and Bloody Mary.

												Although I'm not a huge fan of point & click games, this game is amazing.It's fun to play, has a nice humor touch to it, and it keeps you in the dark most of the game when you try to go on with your investigation - which could be frustrating at times but it is so well done that you just get the feeling of wanting to keep on playing to see what happens next.I couldn't stop playing it after finishing the first season and ended up playing the whole game (all 5 seasons) in one run (which took a couple of hours).The only thing that I find bad in this game is that it's very short, and that there are some scenarios which it doesnt really matter what option you choose - the result will stay the same.I'd give a final rating for this game but ""these lips are sealed"". :)			"

AUDIOMoodyVISUALComic BookDIFFICULTYEasyVIBENoirCRAVINGInteractive FictionON SALEOccasionallyPROS: Great action scenes and an interesting story. The artsier parts (openings, transitions) have a gorgeous 80's style with moody color schemes, though they seem to taper off per episode (I certainly hope they become more frequent in season 2!) The ""fairy tale reboot"" is one of the most annoying things to have started in recent years, and yet still I did not mind this at all. The voices and animation/models are excellent. Climax is very enjoyable.CONS: : I actually ran into two glitches in Ep 5 that required restarts from previous checkpoints. That was very surprising, for a game that has you on rails from start to finish. Some QTEs have absolutely no bearing on what happens (No success or failure until you move forward.) Not much of a QTE, eh? Alongside the lack of failures and deadends, this first season does not branch very much, story-wise. While discovering that through replays, I found the save files to be a bit confusing.WORTH: The chances of a season 2 seem increasingly slim. It'd be a little sad to start in on a series nobody has any intention on finishing.OVERALL: The cliffhanger ending may be infuriating, but I'm pumped for season 2 and plan to buy the episodes on release (if that ever happens.) I'd love to see consequences having more weight in the coming games.SCORE: 8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												The Wolf Among Us makes improvements in two areas over The Walking Dead, those being technical and presentation. Technically the game is much smoother, and is totally free the character stutter that plagued The Walking Dead, especially in season one. The other noticeable improvement was the HUD, it's far cleaner and just much nicer to look at now, the on-screen prompts were also well done and clearer to see.What put this game over The Walking Dead for me was the setting, I absolutely loved it! It was basically Once Upon a Time sprinkled with Grimm and I'm all over that. The story was well written which I've come to expect from Teltale and you were constantly left guessing right up until the end, I am still confused about what actually happened 30 minutes later, which honestly I didn't like, I much prefer clear cut endings over the whole ""let the player decide what really happened"", it's like the cinema shutting off the tape 5 minutes before the end and telling you to imagine the ending. That being said it didn't hurt the game and I have my own theory!Teltale have opened my eyes to a genre I never explored before and I thank them for that, I have been really enjoying just sitting back and relaxing in bed deciding people's fates in these interactive films.

												The Wolf Among Us is very familiar if you have played The Walking Dead.  The game is more like an interactive story and it is very difficult to fail or 'lose'.  It is an ambiguous detective tale involving anti heroes, prostitution, murder and some hard choices.  It fails in terms of challenging gameplay, but it's not really about that.  The game excels in graphics, art direction, voice acting and story.  The game is split into 5 episodes and some of them are certainly stronger than others.  I can certainly recommend this game for its positives as I've mentioned and despite it not being difficult or challenging, it has an interesting story that is worth following from episode 1 to episode 5.  It is a high quality game and I found it to be an excellent one to throw on when I didn't really want to have to concentrate on a more difficult game.So try The Wolf Among Us if you are interested in games like The Walking Dead, but make sure you are not looking for any puzzles or real challenge.  It's a good story and could certainly give some modern TV shows a run for their money and that's the main reason I would recommend this game.			"

While this game doesn't have The Walking Dead juggernaut franchise to back it up, it follows the lesser known fairy-tale centred  Fables comic series and does so beautifully.This isn’t a game for The Walking Dead fans, this game is BETTER than Telltale’s The Walking Dead.

												Probably the best story plot ever or at the very least has one of the best character that has ever been made in video games.  Bigby the main character is the Sheriff and the Big Bad Wolf.  Truly genius with the plot set in NYC with the characters being from various fairy tales.  Lots of awesome and funny dialogue between characters and sometimes spine chilling detective work.  I don't like having my one and only favorite game but if I did Wolf Among Us would be a contender.  I'm not comletely sold on this game though because it is only Season 1 that has been released and my paranoia of money grabbing studios sets in with the anticipation of Season 2.  So far though it has been the best game, story wise, I have played in a while.  And don't get me started on the art work.			"

												This is a pretty fun murder mystery story set around the late '80s where characters from fairy tales have a little community in New York. Even though the game is mostly point-and-click, the action sequences are a little bit different to mix things up.The only downsides I found were the last two episodes being very short; it would have made more sense if they combined the two into a single episode considering the time it takes to complete each of the first three. The other thing is your choices only seem to affect whatever is happening in that moment and don't really have a noticeable impact on the story being told.I found it to be enjoyable enough to play through three times to see the other characters' reactions: once as a good guy, once as a jerk, and the last saying as little as the game would allow me to. It only needs to be played through a single time, but if you want all of the achievements, certain parts need to be played differently (make the opposite choice, go to a different location first, etc.) so you can grab those last few fable entries.Overall, this game isn't Telltale's best work but it's definitely worth picking up when it goes on sale.

												Telltale has done it again. Wolf Among Us is a brilliant story-driven fairytale noire adventure game masterpiece. You play as Bigby Wolf, sole defender of a town of exiled characters from fairy tales, folklore, and other literature. It's clear from the beginning that Bigby cares about the job and the people he protects. However, the laws of Fabletown aren't making him any friends, since any Fable who can't afford a very expensive Glamour to hide their unnatural appearance is sent to The Farm - the equivalent of a life sentence in prison. When a murder investigation goes sideways, Bigby has to pick up the pieces of a town brought to its knees by corruption, inequality, and despair. His hot temper has earned him a reputation for ruthlessness. Maybe some folks just can't let go of the stories they left behind in the story books. Or maybe they all still have good reason to fear the Big Bad Wolf.If you like making game-changing decisions at a moment's notice, and don't mind sacrificing traditional adventure game puzzles for a story that grabs you by the hand and runs, then you will love this game. Also, if you enjoy a second playthrough once you know the story, the many choices available to you make it worthwhile.			"

												An interesting take on classical fairytale characters. The world is dark and gritty, and the old adage of living happily ever after is revealed as a myth. There is a host of social ills experienced by the citizens of Fabletown, and it is your job protect and serve as you investigate the murders. Of course, your reputation as being one of the most heinous fables of legend does not make that job any easier.The camera is limited and there is no open world, but you won't be bored as you progress through the well written story and interact with NPC's that you will care about.

												A really good adaption of the great Grapical novel called Fables. Its a lot like The Walking Dead, and old scool point and click games. It takes place 20 years prior to that series, so there are no huge spoilers. Telltale are as usual tellig a great and uniqe story that will keep you interested all the way trough. The choises you make will have an impact to the rest of the story.			"

												First episode is a bit on a short side, and it leaves you craving for the next one. I'm absolutely sure that this game will be loved even by those, who never play videogames. It's based on original IP, it's not a spin-off, rip-off, spoof, sequel or a cover. That makes it even more better. Though I had some minor issues with a mouse (v-sync maybe) but it won't spoil fun for me.All in all, the game is a real gem.			"

												This game took me approx 7 hours to finish, and overall its a solid 5/7 for me.Wolf Among Us is an Adventure, Point & Click game, but actually, It resembles more of a visual novel for me, not always of course, but most of the game. Why?- Yes there are outcomes of your choices, like people may like you more, or you may try to make a particular someone to make you like you, or just be a jerk. But the thing is, your overall choices doesn't really effect the outcome of the main storyline. You can sometimes choose if a person is going to be killed or not, but that doesn't change the actual storyline, it adds pepper and salt.So;PROS: - Art & sounds are great. I like the artstyle a lot actually, its alluring.- Story is thrilling. There will be lots of question marks and gasps, believe me.- Gameplay, well, I like visual novels, but point and click games are annoying for me most of the time. I'm not really good at making connections so item based ones are always a pain for me. But this game is actually easier, you can clearly see what you can click, there are not much to use. This can be CON to someone probably but you can close the visual of clickables.- Characters. FABLEEEEES. Great set of characters.- It's definetely not children friendly, but its makes appealing for me heh. Some gore and blood and♥♥♥♥♥♥makes the game a lots more visual.CONS:- If you're more of a detective type, this can be a little bit easy for you. Not in terms of story, but in terms of gameplay.- As I said, you can't really change the somethings, even though you made a choice against that particular something.Overall: Get this, It gets %70~75 sale on recent sales and its a great game.

												Well first of all I'd like to say that I got this game as a gift, I have seen my friend play the 4th episode before so I wouldn't have bought it myself, but after completing the game, I've changed my mind. The game tells a story about sheriff Bigby Wolf and his attepmts to solve the mysterious murder of a working girl. The game's characters are from various fairytales living in a place called Fabletown. The characters are all really unique and interesting, you wouldn't imagine them living their lives as criminals or alcoholics etc., as you may expect them to be heroic and mighty. The stoy in The Wolf Among Us is very interesting and has a lot of twists. There are a lot of quick time events that I've enjoyed doing. Interacting with people in various ways will affect how they interact with you, your choices really matter. If you're looking for a game with a great story, I'd defintely recommend  buying this game.			"

												NOTE: This review was written before Episode 5: Cry Wolf was released. This review may be revised, at a later date.Alright, so I just got done with playing this game, so it's pretty fresh in memory for me. I've never read any of the Fables comics before playing, but I gotta say: This game really has me interested. It's like someone took the concept of Shrek and gave it a more mature, more modern spin to it.Well, as I start discussing gameplay, I'll go ahead and say this now: If you don't like point-and-click adventures, don't buy this game. This game may not change your general thoughts about the genre. For those who are still here: The game's mechanics are pretty much lifted from Skybound/Telltale's own The Walking Dead game, so you should know what those are like, if you've played those games already. If not: You mostly go around certain areas of the game, clicking on stuff to examine it, talk to people, or use items. You also get sections where you must escape peril by means of Quick-Time Events. The game is also heavy in cutscenes with selectable dialogue, which you're having to select before a timer runs out. What choice you make and when you make it will affect minor details of the story, like what a certain character will remember about you or what event may occur next. Either way, like with The Walking Dead, the game's story is still linear and never really branches off into a path, unless you count the choices you make.The story here is really great, I gotta say. You play as Bigby Wolf (the Big Bad Wolf of fairy tales), and you are teamed up with Snow White to investigate a serial murder that's been going on in Fabletown, with hopes of ending it before another victim is claimed. You and Snow White meet a lot of fairy tale characters along the way, who are all connected to the murder case in some way. The way characters remember your previous actions and use that alongside other story elements in their character development is really excellent, though your choices are still minor development for them. Oh yeah, the story's pretty great, too. Not spoiling anything, so why don't you play for yourself? XDThe graphic style...I LOVE IT! Okay basically, they took the graphic style of The Walking Dead and gave it a much more colorful and contrasting lighting system, to give it a much better comic book style. Lots of blacks to give it that dark, mature feeling, mixed in with a whole lot of vibrant colors to aid in that comic book feel that I mentioned, which some unique outline effects for when an object is covered up in a shadow. I'm at loss for words here. All I can say is that I just love it. I want more games with this kind of graphical style DXThe voice acting in this game, as expected of a Telltale game, is phenominal...albeit hard to hear, if you don't have headphones plugged in. Okay, this part really gets on my nerves: I don't like it when the voice acting in a movie/game/TV show is so quiet that I have to turn the volume up, and then all the sound effects are so loud that I have to turn it back down. Sadly, it's the case with this game, too. I wish there was better balance with multimedia productions, with this stuff. But regardless, I really like the dialogue spoken in the game, and the voice actors chosen for each of the characters really fit well with the character and what they say. Oh yeah, the musical score's pretty neat, too.This game has some replayability, though you're always going to get the same story every time. Some parts may be different based on your choices, but that's about it. I guess that may be worth it, if not to collect the Book of Fables entries, but it won't be for everyone.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. Mechanics-wise, it does feel like a step above of The Walking Dead, though maybe not that much. May be more noticable in a second playthrough. Either way, if you really enjoy the Fables comics or Telltale's games, or you just want a good point-and-click game with an engrossing story, pick this game up.			"

												I thought I should play this game and review it. This game was amazing, it really followed the Fables storyline(The Wolf Amoung Us is the preview to the comic books called Fables), I noticed a few characters who were in the game and not in the story. Bigby Wolf was so badass, he did his job and always tried to do the right thing no matter what the cost. I wish more people would read the books. The humor was dark and funny, the city was controlled by the crocked man. It really fit the detective parts of the first book. I am excited for season 2, I hope they keep following the story of Fables. I give this game a 10 out of 10 for sure.			"

												I didn't know much about The Wolf Among Us going into it other than that it was based on a comic book series, however not much background was needed. Prior knowledge of the Fables universe is not necessary as the events of the game happen before those in the comic book series. The story is also relatively straightforward and easy to follow while still managing to capture your interest- the cliffhangers at each episode's end made it imposible to wait before playing the next, so I'm glad I purchased the game once it was released in its entirety; I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much had I been forced to wait months for each new episode. The only real complaint I have about the game is the playing time. I finished it in about eight hours, and it has little replay value as it focuses more on story than on actual gameplay (the game is essentially point and click dialogue, with a few battle scenes that are near impossible to lose). I would not buy this game at full price for the short playing time alone, however I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as a sale purchase.			"

												I am a fan of the Walking Dead game series by Telltale but went in knowing nothing about the world that this story is set in (also fearing the concept a bit gimmick-y sounding being about fairy tales etc)...BUT it took about a minute or so to be draw into the game and lose myself in what could be discribed as an interactive comic book movie. More so, now having just complete part four of The Wolf Among Us I am going to be hanging out for the final chanpter... and pretty much anything by the producers as they make great story driven games.While the game play could be called minimalistic I feel like I could easily have just joined somebody on the couch and watched them play it through and enjoyed it just as much for the tale being told. I will be playing it through again to try all the options I missed for sure and look forward maybe being a badder big bad wolf. Totally recommended for my part.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is one of the finest examples of story in a video game that I have seen in my 20 years of gaming.Like other Telltale Games hit, The Walking Dead, the sheer amount of choices available to the player, both in your dialog options as well as your ability to choose to threaten, maim, or even kill many of the characters you interact with gives the player a game that they can play several times over and still find new and interesting aspects of the story to uncover.There is not a single thing not to love about this title. The sound design, voice acting, animations, etc. are all phenominal. Hell, the game even made QTEs enjoyable for me, a person who hates QTEs with the fiery passion of 1,000 George Foreman grills.You would be an absolute fool to not give this game a go, and with an asking price less than half that of the AAA schlock that gets released these days, it is an absolute STEAL.

												When I first heard of this game from a friend, I was like ""Meh, maybe I'll check it out."" A month later, my friend was still bothering me about it, so I watched the first episode of it via YouTube. In the first few minutes, I was absorbed. The game already had a good developing story line, and I LOVED the characters. At that one moment, I decided to give TTG all my money and buy The Wolf Among Us not only for one system, but for two (my Xbox 360 and my Steam). And now that the season is over, I can assure you all that this game is a work of art, and while I also thoroughly enjoyed the Walking Dead Series and S2 (Still currently enjoying) I can say that The Wolf Among Us definetley had a stronger feeling to it. I was the law, but I didn't get free donuts or anything. I got mean glares, and I got in trouble (frequently). I got to play the good guy, who wasn't popular or loved, but hated. I was the Big Bad Wolf, the sherriff, yet I still had life hard for me. And there was so much drama and suspense sometimes that the Wolf had to make descisions that would ruin him and any others. This really pulled me in, having a position so powerful and matching it with a character who doesn't always play by the rules and still had the ability to ""Lose.""The Wolf Among Us is for people who enjoy a good mystery, action, and  suspense. So yea, I highly recommend it, and you should all give TTG all of your money for making such a masterpiece like this. Bravo, TTG, Bravo.			"

												Another telltale game played, another amazing experience. I enjoyed Wolf Among Us  even more than TWD1. The voice acting and the characters were really outstanding. Not too many QTE, and a story keeping your interest turned on till the end. A great game, a great game indeed. Maybe it's better to call it an interactive movie, but it doesn't matter. If you are looking for a very immersive experience and you are ok with minimal gameplay, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Now that the fifth episode is out I feel like I can finally say something about this. So, if you've played telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" games then you should have no trouble playing this. The controls are very similar, if not, the exact same. As for the game itself, it's not very difficult but I think that is on purpose so that the player can become more immersed into the story. The story, of course being the main highlight of the game. If you're the type of gamer who loves a great and unique story, then this is for you.			"

												As a reader of the comics, I was skeptical about them pulling this off. Shaky start with Snow's voice (I kept seeing Carly) but overall, a really great attempt to put such a wonderful story into a game. Love the noir look and the 'book of fables' for those non comic book fans. I finished episode 4 yesterday and I'm still thinking through my choices and regretting earlier decisions which for me is a sign of a really good game. If you want fairytale/horror story (sort of) and nursery rhyme characters emersed in a story of sex, murder and embezzlement with a load of swearing thrown in .. then this is the game for you :)			"

In my opinion, after the first episode, I would DEFINTELY recommend this.As PC Gamer put it:“…deftly merges Walking Dead's moral quandaries with a noir murder mystery”That sums it up really; I'm not going to detail the story as that would probably result in spoilers, I recommend that you figure out the plot and characters for yourselves as it is (in my opinion) a lot more fun.If you want The Walking Dead style gameplay, classic Telltale storytelling and L.A.

The characters are memorable (and you already know most of 'em anyway), the dialog is great and the mystery upon which the plot circles around is actually pretty interesting and intriguing - replaying this game later after all the episodes come out will definetely be on my To Do list.Speaking of the episodic nature of the game, a lot of people complain about the six month-ish delay between the first and the second episodes, but as a fan of the A Song of Ice and Fire series I don't really think I'll have problems waiting. And if you do, go read the ♥♥♥♥ing comicbooks of which the game is based on, Fables. It's awesome and you should give it a read.TL DR the game is awesome and it's worth muh monnies.			"

												I didn't know much about The Wolf Among Us going into it other than that it was based on a comic book series, however not much background was needed. Prior knowledge of the Fables universe is not necessary as the events of the game happen before those in the comic book series. The story is also relatively straightforward and easy to follow while still managing to capture your interest- the cliffhangers at each episode's end made it imposible to wait before playing the next, so I'm glad I purchased the game once it was released in its entirety; I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much had I been forced to wait months for each new episode. The only real complaint I have about the game is the playing time. I finished it in about eight hours, and it has little replay value as it focuses more on story than on actual gameplay (the game is essentially point and click dialogue, with a few battle scenes that are near impossible to lose). I would not buy this game at full price for the short playing time alone, however I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as a sale purchase.			"

												I haven’t really heard of this game before, but luckily a friend recommended it to me after he played it. After checking out a few trailers and some reading it didn’t take long till’ it was added to my cart.I absolutely loved the cartoon style of the game, it’s really fitting to the awesome written story. It’s a really exciting crime story which you can uncover any way you want in classic Telltale Games style xDI also loved the nostalgia feeling I got from interacting with all the fairytale characters I used to hear as a kid. Like Snow White and The Little Mermaid, especially the way they’re displayed through everyday people, with certain likenesses of they fairytale counterparts.Worth every penny :P			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It's in the same almost point and click style as The Walking Dead, which works in this story telling style. The story is the main point and the gameplay evolves around it, which I'm fine with as they do it well.This is a great game for fans of the Fables graphic novel series. I haven't enjoyed the last couple story arcs of the comic, but the writers of this capture the early series feeling very well. This is also just a good game if you want to play through a good story. Some of the in-jokes will go over your head but I don't think it will make a diference. I really hope they make a season two, if they can keep up this level of writing.			"

Instead, secrecy and violence reigns this fairy tale where the death of a ""fable"" as they call these characters has breed mistrust amongst the fables.

												This game comes from the Telltale Games, creators of The Walking Dead games series and it feels pretty much the same. It's not a game per se. more like an interactive movie, with interactivity limited to several point-and-click scenes, a handful of QTE and a couple of plot-developing choices. However it still mananges to keep you glued to the screen for the (short) duration of the game. Its strenagth lies in the plot, setting and character design that feel like they came straight from the comic books. My main gripe wth the game is its price - for a two-hour experience it's a bit too much. Hopefully the DLC will come ant a discount			"

												I love adventure games, and I love Western-style comic books and graphic novels. This is an adventure game based on a comic book series written by one of the principal writer's of Image Comics, 'The Walking Dead' series. The adaptation for television is now a blockbuster tv show. The gist of the 'Wolf Among Us', series is that Fables have been forced to update themselves in NYC, and you are the Big Bad Wolf, and Fabletown's Sheriff. There has been a murder in Fabletown, and as Sheriff you have to play the gumshoe and solve the case. Simple gameplay, with lots of story. Finally, your decisions, wise or otherwise, have a large effect on the results of the game. If you like the genre of this game, then its well worth the try.			"

The gameplay is somewhat hamstrung by the fact that most of the time there's... really not a lot to do, and even the trademark Telltale storyline branching isn't that interesting here, as the story is mostly linear, at least compared to something like The Walking Dead.BUT what is here is great - fantastic characters, exciting plot and just all-round a really fun game!It doesn't reach the heights of The Walking Dead, but it's a great game nonetheless!

												Extremely entertaining, thus said, this is not a game... It is a story that has been ""gamified"", meaning that, it has interactive momments, but it is mainly just an animated series.The story is a completely different take on classic fables. Snow white, beauty and the beast, big bad wolf (what you play as), etc. They now live in the real world, with real problems...First of all, for those expecting action, there isnt much. Some reaction buttons here and there, but like i said, its mainly an animated series with a couple of player interactions. Not like ""Shenmue"", so dont worry about having to be fast lol... About mechanics and what you can do? Well, you pick frases and actions everynow and then, that sometimes affects the storyline but usually just affects the outcome of the conversation... slightly...  What i should point out, is that this action/words choice, is not like bioware games. It definetly doesn't change the game as much, but it will make you think more.The choices here are emotional, it is not about the item you want or how you want to behave, but more about how you react emotionally. They feel important and heavier. Mainly because this game is a drama and there is a time to pick your choice, so that it feels like an actual conversation. Wierdly enough, you will feel realism here, eventhough its cartoonish and 105% fiction.It is a refreshing and original experience that earned TellTale their name and fame. Imo the best game they have, since it  works ontop of classic children fables while bringing a police/drama theme. Will ""magically"" distort your reality a few times, making you react in ways you would and wouldn't...			"

 The Wolf Among Us was one of the best games of 2014, and arguabely stands as Telltale's best game to date. I was first cautious to purchase this game. It was based on a source material that I knew nothing about, and seemingly featured fantastical themes which weren't really my 'thing' - werewolves, fairytales and the like. However, I took the plunge when episode five was released and I didn't look back.The Wolf Among Us is sleek, atmospheric, and out-right dark in places. Based on the comic  Fables , you play as Bigby wolf,  the  big bad wolf, sheriff and protector of Fabletown, a community of 'fables' and mythical creatures in New York after their banishment from their own world. A murder has occured, and you must put the pieces of the puzzle together to find the culprit. Without spoiling any more, The Wolf Among Us grows with every episode, the stakes become higher as Bigby uncovers more than he could have imagined from a single murder case, until the intense finale of episode five. The story is superbly written, the characters interesting and well developed - some of which you become very attached to. The environments are extemely atmospheric, and the music compliments them very well (the soundtrack is  amazing! ). The puzzels are fun, although not too challenging, and as with most Telltale titles take a back seat in favour of branching dialogue. All combat is QTE, which is done alright with this game, but I know many people get annoyed with these controls - point and click isn't for everyone! Overall it is a fantastic adventure game worth paying for, in my opinion level with Walking Dead Season 1. Tentitive to purchase it primarily, but now I am a fully-fledged fan of the game.  This is worth buying at full price - especially if you loved The Walking Dead. You will love this too!  One final word on people's biggest moan about Telltale: choices. ""Your choices don't matter...they don't affect the plot...it's all an illusion"" is what is said all of the time in comments. While it is true they don't affect the plot in drastic ways, they affect two things: the protagonist, and the player. The protagonists in all Telltale games are shaped by your choices. Will Lee be a hopeful person, and try and teach Clementine to hold onto the old ways of civility? Or will he adapt, and teach her survival at any cost. Similarly Bigby can try and prove himself to be a caring and decent sheriff, or live up to his name as the big bad wolf. Finally the player is shaped by the choices: your perception of the game/story will change depending on what you pick, how you feel about other characters, how you feel about yourself, and, for me anyway, they stick with me and undoubtedly change my mindset for the rest of the game. So yes, the choices do have value, just not really plot-wise, which seems to be the only thing which matters to some people.			"

												My rating for The Wolf Among Us is four stars. It narrowly misses out on top marks due to the above-mentioned technical hiccups. It also feels like Telltale is just emulating Walking Dead’s winning formula instead of innovating. If I had to compare the two, I would say that Walking Dead made more of an emotional impact on me. The Wolf Among Us however edges out the contest for most colourful characters, thanks to its cast of fairy tale stars. Story wise I would say that TWAU is the better of the two, as its mystery yarn is more interesting than a zombie apocalypse tale. TWAU also has a powerful ending, which trumps Walking Dead’s “fishing for a season two” finale. Should Telltale ever abandon video game production they should consider entering the marketing business instead. Just like The Walking Dead, after finishing The Wolf Among Us I am interested in sampling the comic it is based off. They are in effect making interactive adverts that I am happy to buy!			"

Fabletown is occupied by civilians called ""fables'. Fables are characters from old fairy tails like snow white, little mermaid, and little red riding hood. The story is really dark, and has a lot gangs, murderers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and black magic. When you play the wolf among us you'll experience something that just tingles you with excitement.

												Becuase this game has been reviewed in a positive and beaming light so many times, I'll forego discussing its pros and cons and instead depart my impression of the experience.A gruff man who took the mantle of the only authority in a beat-up city that can enforce the law had me sold off the bat, but mixing it with a sincere backstory of his attempt to redeem himself throughout the murder mystery itself was honestly the best canon I could've hoped for in a game like this.The moral options that you're given in this game can really surprise you with their outcome; quite a few of them have no serious repurcussions such as taking money from Georgie's safe, Crane's coat pocket, the package at the Tweedles' office, etc. I found it great, because it can really help you decide what kind of moral road you'll be taking through the game by deciding what you'd do when no one's looking or going to burn you for it.This is the kind of character development anyone should crave if you seek moral development and/or redemption in a relatable setting.SPOILER BELOWI haven't seen any reviews that mention it yet, but I'm almost positive this game mind♥♥♥♥ed me in the end. Here's why:When Nerissa begins to walk away in the epilogue, Bigby begins remembering all the things she's said that were almost identical to what Faith said in the first chapter. All because of the phrase ""you're not as bad as they say you are.""It's incredible to think that Nerissa, who lied to incriminate and convict the Crooked Man, claims to have placed Faith's head at the Woodlands entrance, and claims to have sold out and watched Faith die, is heavily hinted to either be Faith or somehow an alternate version of her or something. After all, Swineheart never gave results on Faith's body. No one knows what ended up happening to the Donkeyskin Coat. She also refused to take the ribbon off.The biggest hint of all for me was the fact that when other characters such as Lily and the Crooked Man would ask for your initial motive, you always had the option (which I always took) to say that it was all for Faith. That's just too big to ignore. Regrettably, I didn't save Prince Lawrence in my plathrough, so I don't know if and what that alters. "

Typical Telltale, they give you just enough choices to satisfy you, and make you feel as though your choices have some influence on the future of your game. I was easily able to sit through two playthroughs without boredom hitting. The colour pallete is exquisite, and the music is great. Even a fan of the comics can appreciate this game for what it is.

												I can't even describe how good this game is! It got such a good gameplay and the story is just so freaking good. You can play with such a brutal playstyle or you can play as a nice detective. The best thing with this game and all the Telltale games is that you can play them so many times over and over again because you can alway play different. When I first saw the game I never thought I'd buy it, but when I saw a let's play of the game already ten minutes in to the video I couldn't think of a better game to spend my money on. I haven't yet and I never will think that it was a waste of money buying this game. A really strong 10/10!			"

												Love the story!  Makes me want to go back and play a few more times to see the outcome of various key decisions.  My only complaint is that after they way then ended the season there still has been no mention of Season 2!  Telltale seems to have forgotten about this and TWD in favor of Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones.  C'mon people!  You can't end the season like that and then let it collect dust for this long!			"

Everything is just perfect! The scene and the feel of the game are so immersive, every time i finished an episode i just wanted to play more. Recommend this game to everyone and consider it a great achievement from Telltale games!			"

 The Wolf Among Us  A Film Noir Drama, that loudly goes nowhere.. (I realise that this will easily be the most controversial piece that i have ever written, but you cannot archieve fame/notoriety without being a bit of a tosser.)Well, that subtext kinda reveals my point without explaining. I have a right tonne of stuff to nitpick.. However, i'm not going to fight hyperactive fanboys over this point. Instead of fighting, i'm just going to point out the problems in this particular series. Whilst attempting to cut out all the possible spoilers and trying to tie everything in to a cohesive critique..( All whilst suffering from bronchitis and tanking painkillers. ) The review has a lot of references to the Graphic novel series, so unless you have read them. Please refrain from posting bad arguments. The game starts in a way that i find very solid, like in the graphic novels. (Yes, i have now read all the books.) But unlike the novels, the game seems to have a rather obvious pacing problem. Maybe due to the episodic nature, but before you nag about it being the same in the novels. The novels had a very clear notion of what is happening, having an isolated short story in each issue and having small hints for what might happen next.The game attempts this storytelling method, but manages to muck it up slightly.. Or moderately. This is the part where i turn very biased, so if you excuse me for a minute...TellTale has a reputation of making some very good episodic titles, one of my personal favourites being the Sam & Max series. But no matter how well you manage to create a story and setting for the characters in question, there are always some lurches that manage to appear. Sam & Max fans know what i'm talking about here.. That certain episode that was listed as ""A waste of time"" even by Sam & Max themselves. These lurches appear usually when you have ""Too many irons in the furnace"". If i managed to translate that correctly, or if that metaphor didn't work. Lets just say ""Having too big of a sip from an icy slushie and getting a brainfreeze"". Having too much stuff that you can actually manage. Causing everything they do, a little half-baked. And by that i mean; A raw slob of dough that you kept in the oven for only 15-Minutes and though it was properly cooked. Wow! My metaphors are terrible when i'm sick.. But back to review before i get distracted more...Like i was trying to explain, by my metaphorically deprived way; The game is not that good. I took some time to discuss this problem with one of my friends and we came to a conclusion that the pacing was off. Amongst other things..So the ""friends video-game club discussion"" that we had, came to a conclusion that the games pacing was along the lines of a badly edited TV-Programme. Starting in a solid way, then getting cut as everything got interesting and after that filling some time faffing about, then finally ending in a cliffhanger. Oh f*ck! i just spoiled the ending.And speaking of the ending, after spoiling the cilffhanger. Its one of those endings that gives closure to the story, but explains absolutely NOTHING. The game already had some holes in its plot like a colinder has for flour,  Why am i fixated on baking all of the sudden?  and none of those thing are even remotely explained during the ending. The rest is a bit of a spoiler, so i'l black it out for you..  The ending that is the one chatting up to Nerissa, explains nothing more than the things connected to Lily the first murder victim. Nerissa explains, that it was her who left the head in front of the Woodlands Building. Bridging in the missing pieces on how she died, but thats it.  So even with that ending, i felt confused and dazed. Since i felt, as i mentioned, that nothing was explained.And those are the problems i have with this particular series. I'm not going to copy-paste the usual, ""Great visuals"" ""Marvellous atmosphere"" And all the other faff. Since you know (if you have read any of my other reviews) i don't really give a damn about visual style.I just realised, that i really haven't been writing a review. Rather i have written a long line of nitpicking.. But even with being a nitpick, it still has a decent point and the point being: ""The game had terrible pacing, some obvious plotholes and an ending that explains nothing."" And i cannot do nothing else but to get annoyed at the fact that TellTale are going to attempt to explain the stuff in the second season, if there even will be one..But all my narking aside..The Wolf Among Us, is a quirky but enjoyable story set in the Fables universe. But i cannot really recommend it over the books, but i will recommend it as a spinoff title, even with its problems.Rating? i quess.. Thinking about it, as my painkiller buffed brain can cope.I think a reasonable B+ is in order.Reasons being: plotholes, pacing issues, the ending and TellTales time management.			"

												I have to say I'm terribly pleased that Telltale Games have finally decided to compose an adventure set in this delightful universe, it must also be added that I greatly approve of the direction the company is heading. TWAU is a wonderful story that's both strangely comic and poignant; it's imbued with a sort of breezy, heart filled spirit which begins in episode one and endures throughout all the subsequent episodes. I also like that there are many ancillary characters who are unapologetic about their lack of conscience, and who don't seem to suffer in consequence. The inclusion of adult subtexts such as adultery and prostitution is a pleasant surprise to those who are unfamiliar with the comics. I've personally enjoyed the game and sincerely hope that Telltale Games continue with the franchise.9/10 "

												Much like The Walking Dead, ""The Wolf Among Us"" is based on a popular comic book series that uses many of the same features and art style. I'll be honest, I never completed TWD game, but I have a far greater urge to witness the next installment of this five part series. Once again, TellTale has gone for the interactive story style of ""gameplay"" and your choices affect the outcome. You ""play"" as Bigby Wolf(Big Bad Wolf) and attempt to solve a complex murder mystery. For a good two hours expect to mash the 'E' key repeatedly, and choose your words quickly yet carefully. If you enjoyed the ""Fable"" comics or looking for something similar to TWD, pick this up for $25. Though we all know how Steam is. You can always wait for a deal, or until all the episodes are released.			"

												The wolf among us is an amazing adaptation of the comic series ""Fables"".The story in this is very captivating, and the way the player can control the choices using both dialogue and quick-time events really helps the immersion factor. It is also very in line with the tone that is set in the comics, with a good amount of humour thrown in as well. The characters are also well portrayed in this, if a little jumbled up because I don't beleive it uses the same canonical sequence of events.The art style in this game really captures the style of the comics, but in its own unique manner. I did see a few graphical issues while playing, but nothing major. Telltale also did a good job at converting the setting of the comics into a 3D environment, as well as continuing the style in adding new locations.The soundtrack in this game is brilliant. It does a good job at adding ambiance to the story, as well as the environments.I've only played the game once, but I do see a lot of replayability in the future, as there are plenty of choices that could affect the outcome of the entire story.Overall this game is well deserving of its awards, and definitely worth a buy if you want a game with a good story to it.

												The Wolf Among Us is what happens when you mix ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" with fairy tales and a choose your own adventure book. It is actually the canonical prequal to the comic book series Fables. In it you play as Bigby ""The Big Bad"" Wolf. Bigby is the sheriff of Fabletown which is a small neighborhood within New York. It is where all the Fables were exiled to after they weren't allowed to be in their stories anymore (one too many direct to VHS Disney movies I'm guessing) and ended up in a ""Mundie"" (normal human) city.Story: I don't want to give away much about the story so i'll just say there was a murder and it is your jub to find out ""who done it."" Gameplay:If you have ever played Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" you'll know exactly how this game plays. In short TWAU is a gameplay-light story-heavy choose your own adventure book. That is not a bad thing by any means, but for many people that could be a turn off. There are almost no puzzle elements and the few that there are I would not even call puzzles. Overall:TWAU is a great game. The game's first episode starts out very strong, but the length and impact of each episode lowers as the story progresses. The characters are great, the QTE's are manageable, Bigby's chest hair is highly strokeable, and the voice acting is top-notch. If you have enjoyed a Telltale game before you'll love this.Final score:Four dancing werewolves out of three Japanese sweet fish cakes.[cdn.justonecookbook.com] "

												This game is so addicting I found myself thinking about it during the day. Bigsby is a GREAT character to control, there is nothing worse than a main character who doesn't speak or react. Bigsby is raw, he acts on impulse and he has a history, a pretty gory one.I don't read comics so I cannot comment on what was better storywise but playing this game made me want to read the comics. Playing threw the various fables in a corrupt, dirty fable town was more fun than I care to admit. Yes, this game is very wordy and I worried about that, I am known to skup cutscenes with to much text, but I really enjoyed reacting to the situation. A lot of the choices led to the same outcome but I still enjoyed getting there.At the end you see the percentage of Steam players who chose a specific option/path. I was glad to read that over 80% didn't choose to send Colin to the farm. I was heartbroken for him. I want to replay it but I wish there was a way to skip the text that I have already played threw.			"

												My first exposure to a Telltale game was The Walking Dead, which I thoroughly enjoyed despite how depressing the story was.  This wasn't the fault of the game itself, mind you, but rather just a natural fact of any zombie story worth its weight in brains.  I expected nothing less.  When I picked up The Wolf Among Us, I was skeptical.  I didn't think that another story could exceed or even live up to what Telltale did with TWD.  I didn't think there was another fictional universe that Telltale could use to create a compelling, story-driven game with so much emotional punch.  I was wrong, and I'm comfortable admitting as much after playing only the first chapter.  The first thing about this game that stood out as exceptional was the visual style.  It's brilliant to look at, and you're drawn into this fictional universe from the beginning.  It's dark and brooding with high contrasts of colors that remind you that you're in what is essentially a fairy tale.  I've always been a fan of graphics that look amazing, but aren't hyper-realistic.  I loved the style of Borderlands and Borderlands 2 with their faux cel-shaded graphics.  Same with the game XIII.  Telltale's TWD had a great visual style as well, but it was nothing like this.  It's like a comic book that's come to life before your eyes without it turning into a cartoon.  The biggest draw of this game is the story.  First off, the entire premise of Fables is wonderful.  I was completely ignorant of the comic book series before I heard about this game, and I've since read a bit of it to edify myself on the lore and backstory of the characters.  I love the idea of dropping fairy tale characters into a modern New York City, and Telltale does an exceptional job of portraying this in the game.  There are many winks and nods to the source material while the game tells its own, standalone story.  I was pulled into the plot almost immediately, and by the end of the first chapter I was left with my mouth hanging agape, my mind racing with what-ifs, and most importantly wanting MORE.  The gameplay is standard Telltale tropes with some new ideas thrown in.  Meaningful decisions, quick-time dialogue and actions, and point-and-click exploration are all here.  These things would make for a boring game otherwise, but with the exceptional story you're never bored.  Adventure games are an interesting genre in this regard.  Some gamers who prefer more interaction in their games may not understand how a game like this can be exciting.  It is in the same way a good book is exciting, with an interesting story filled with great character interaction and unexpected plot twists.  Without these, the game would fail.  Telltale show off their story-telling chops here.TWAU is an exciting story that has a unique premise, interesting characters, and a main story that will make you want to play the entire chapter in one sitting because you just HAVE to find out what's going to happen next.  I think if Telltale adds some more interesting, neutral characters for Bigby to interact with in the next episode, the game will be even better.  If you're a fan of adventure games, you can't go wrong with this one, especially if you appreciate a good ""whodunit"" mystery set in a gritty, noir-filled world.			"

												My god, this game. I can honestly say it is the best game that I have played in 2014, even though I started it in 2013. But I just finished it. The story is amazing. I was really compelled by the different characters and specifically the interactions between Bigby and Snow. I really enjoyed this game and the art style was quite beautiful. I would highly recommend this game. And if you are on the fence, just try the first episode and see if you are not compelled to finish the game.			"

												A stylish mystery in the TellTale mold based on the Fables comics. Doesn't benefit much from the episodic format (other than artificially keeping the mystery going) but now that you can play all the episodes at once I have no problem recommending this.			"

												Probably the best game by 'Telltale games' (not including 'The Walking Dead').It's interesting and it's a prequel to comic book named 'Fables', after the game you probably'll read the original comic book.Soundtrack is amazing, story is very interesting and the game got a lot of difficult choices that can twist the storyline upside-down.

												tl;dr scoreboard:+ Great characters, awesome voice acting+ The Fables universe is fascinating+ Interesting plot- Not a whole lot of gameplay- Storyline doesn't really branch, so choices made don't feel that meaningful- Oh, how I wish it was a bit longer!Telltale do what Telltale do best: They've created an AMAZING story in a really interesting universe (Fables). The gameplay is somewhat hamstrung by the fact that most of the time there's... really not a lot to do, and even the trademark Telltale storyline branching isn't that interesting here, as the story is mostly linear, at least compared to something like The Walking Dead.BUT what is here is great - fantastic characters, exciting plot and just all-round a really fun game!It doesn't reach the heights of The Walking Dead, but it's a great game nonetheless!

												Extremely entertaining, thus said, this is not a game... It is a story that has been ""gamified"", meaning that, it has interactive momments, but it is mainly just an animated series.The story is a completely different take on classic fables. Snow white, beauty and the beast, big bad wolf (what you play as), etc. They now live in the real world, with real problems...First of all, for those expecting action, there isnt much. Some reaction buttons here and there, but like i said, its mainly an animated series with a couple of player interactions. Not like ""Shenmue"", so dont worry about having to be fast lol... About mechanics and what you can do? Well, you pick frases and actions everynow and then, that sometimes affects the storyline but usually just affects the outcome of the conversation... slightly...  What i should point out, is that this action/words choice, is not like bioware games. It definetly doesn't change the game as much, but it will make you think more.The choices here are emotional, it is not about the item you want or how you want to behave, but more about how you react emotionally. They feel important and heavier. Mainly because this game is a drama and there is a time to pick your choice, so that it feels like an actual conversation. Wierdly enough, you will feel realism here, eventhough its cartoonish and 105% fiction.It is a refreshing and original experience that earned TellTale their name and fame. Imo the best game they have, since it  works ontop of classic children fables while bringing a police/drama theme. Will ""magically"" distort your reality a few times, making you react in ways you would and wouldn't...			"

 The Wolf Among Us was one of the best games of 2014, and arguabely stands as Telltale's best game to date. I was first cautious to purchase this game. It was based on a source material that I knew nothing about, and seemingly featured fantastical themes which weren't really my 'thing' - werewolves, fairytales and the like. However, I took the plunge when episode five was released and I didn't look back.The Wolf Among Us is sleek, atmospheric, and out-right dark in places. Based on the comic  Fables , you play as Bigby wolf,  the  big bad wolf, sheriff and protector of Fabletown, a community of 'fables' and mythical creatures in New York after their banishment from their own world. A murder has occured, and you must put the pieces of the puzzle together to find the culprit. Without spoiling any more, The Wolf Among Us grows with every episode, the stakes become higher as Bigby uncovers more than he could have imagined from a single murder case, until the intense finale of episode five. The story is superbly written, the characters interesting and well developed - some of which you become very attached to. The environments are extemely atmospheric, and the music compliments them very well (the soundtrack is  amazing! ). The puzzels are fun, although not too challenging, and as with most Telltale titles take a back seat in favour of branching dialogue. All combat is QTE, which is done alright with this game, but I know many people get annoyed with these controls - point and click isn't for everyone! Overall it is a fantastic adventure game worth paying for, in my opinion level with Walking Dead Season 1. Tentitive to purchase it primarily, but now I am a fully-fledged fan of the game.  This is worth buying at full price - especially if you loved The Walking Dead. You will love this too!  One final word on people's biggest moan about Telltale: choices. ""Your choices don't matter...they don't affect the plot...it's all an illusion"" is what is said all of the time in comments. While it is true they don't affect the plot in drastic ways, they affect two things: the protagonist, and the player. The protagonists in all Telltale games are shaped by your choices. Will Lee be a hopeful person, and try and teach Clementine to hold onto the old ways of civility? Or will he adapt, and teach her survival at any cost. Similarly Bigby can try and prove himself to be a caring and decent sheriff, or live up to his name as the big bad wolf. Finally the player is shaped by the choices: your perception of the game/story will change depending on what you pick, how you feel about other characters, how you feel about yourself, and, for me anyway, they stick with me and undoubtedly change my mindset for the rest of the game. So yes, the choices do have value, just not really plot-wise, which seems to be the only thing which matters to some people.			"

												I'm a really big fan of Telltale's games. The Wolf Among us certainly does not disappoint. I am of the opinion that The Wolf Among Us is better than both seasons of The Walking Dead as well. If you like The Walking Dead, surely you'll like this game as well. Telltale, as always, has done a great job with an interactive story that keeps you guessing and makes you wonder if you made the right decisions along the way.			"

												Wauw. A very good mature game, where your decisions decide the game, and your choices really can come back and bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥later on. This telltale game i would say is about, morality and what you ""think is the right choice"", which we all have diffrent opinion on, and it is gonna be hard finding other people whose choices are the same as yours. Only downside of this game for me is it is a bit short 10 hours, but every one of them is very intense so i would say it is worth it.You can decide to roleplay in it, but the biggest thing for me in this game was that i leared alot about myself, by the choices i choice through out the game and it really got me thinking, i hope you people do as well.

												First off this is more of an interactive storybook than a real game. That said, the story is extremely compelling, the art style beautiful, and the characters complex and believable. The gameplay itself goes by really quickly so make good use of that pause button or you'll feel rushed and make mistakes. Most of the game is looking for and putting clues together, and most games either make the clues so easy to work with that you feel like a coddled child, or so difficult to work with that you get frustrated and give up and look everything up on a wiki. This game though does the clues PERFECTLY, and you will really feel a sense of accomplishment when you put things together. You will also feel very in control of the story, even when you're not. The choices you get to make as Bigby Wolf really let you define his character. Are you a good man with a terrible past, trying to redeem yourself? Are you simply a law-enforcer, tired of fighting?  Or are you still just 'The Big Bad Wolf'?			"

The overall story is good/interesting, great bunch of characters, has very few minor things left unanswered which I only picked up having played the four episodes in a row in my second playthrough).I didn't have the same emotional attachment to this as I did with the Walking Dead series, but the game is worth your time & money & hopefully it get you into reading the 'Fables' comic.

												The Wolf Among us Is a story Driven point and click game Made by Telltale Games. The game puts you in the shoes of the famous fairy tale character The big bad wolf  Known as  bIgby Wolf a sherrif of fabletown Full of fairy tale legends who have left the old world  and have come to Our world  trying to fit in with the mundys (Humans) disguised to look like them. Sheffif bigby leaving his history behind trys to become a better person by being the law. The story puts you in a murder mystery case you and Snow white are trying to solve with shocking revelations that you uncover along the way and well executed action scenes with quick time events that are done well. The game from start to finish is a fantastic game with a story that has you so interested to find out what happens next and the shocking cliff hangers just force you to play the next episode for sure.This is along with great characters that you will meet and that you will recognise from a story such as Snow white, one of the 3 little pigs, the woodsman, Toad and many more but how you interact with them is up to you. You can be the meanest by choosing all the bad choices that will all in some way have an outcome that might effect you in some way. Or you can try and be the nice guy trying to not allways be the d*ck that the whole of fabletown know you as but even sometimes you have to be that guy to get your answer's out of people whether thats intimidating characters or just plain beating them up. This game has got beautifull cell shaded graphics that bring the comic book style to it which looks great with the vibrant stand out colors. While playing episode after episode of the game i couldnt help but notice that the soundtrack is awesome and comes in at the right times in the game at appropriate times in scenes. In the game their were some parts with interaction with characters that i felt that wasnt needed and just felt pointless some episodes are weaker than overs. Also when you are looking for clues you have a load of interactions with clues and objects but if you interact with a certain clue it will just move you on and not letting you fully explore what it has to offer you. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall The wolf among us as a whole is well written                                                                  well voice acted                                                                  well animated                                                                  A immersive story to be played                                                                 with good characters I recomend to all Definitely			"

Which is amazing, great voice acting and the scenes are very well played out, moving around is easy and basically anyone who wants a good story game to interact with and have friends sit and watch, this game is for you! Trust me. Haha even though you beat it sometimes you like to go back and just try out new things, get achievements, just play for the different choices.			"

												Pros:-Bigby Wolf is a fun character to play as. You can play him in many clear ways and even combine different paths you can take.-The world of Fables is fascinating because you are familiar with many of the characters in this game already, but not in the way this world represents them, which really kept me engaged. -Being a badass investigator solving a murder mystery in a world styled like a comic book is something I've never experienced in a game before and this game does an amazing job of combining all these elements into one. -The way the game quickly switched between dialogue to action sequences was fantastic and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Cons:-The consequences and choices always seem pretty dire in the heat of the moment, but sometimes the results are the same regardless of your path. -The typical frame rate problems between loading screens (Telltale Games are kinda known for this) -The ending of the game left too many questions unanswered. It kinda begs for a Season 2. So if there isn't a Season 2, this game really didn't get a proper ending. Overall:As far as Telltale Games goes, The Wolf Among Us is my all time favorite. I really fell in love with how these fairy tale characters were put into a setting that modernized them and changed my way of how I thought of them. Telltale did a great job of combining the murder mystery LA Noire feel with the style of a comic book, which bring together a fantastic looking game. You really do feel like Bigby Wolf trying he's best to solve the murder mystery and also trying to obtain acceptance from the other Fables. So will you be the good cop or the bad cop?Rating: 9/10			"

The tension in decisions is a real treat and it is nice to see an underrated comic book getting a well deserved mainstream game.

												I'm going to keep this short. If you want a detailed review, look at someone elses.Story: Murder investigation with action that have a side-optionI enjoyed the game. It like walking dead but more of 'who did it' investigation with fighting action here and there.Pros: I don't want to ruin the game for you guys. If you want to know the pros, look at someone else's status.Cons: They cussed almost every single time. Every single line. It's not like Walking dead where you only cuss when they are angry and they are attacking you.... You and them literately cuss even when everything is perfectly fine.Another thing, You might encounter a bug where you can't finish the ending of 4 and 5 episode, due to a glitch in the 'Choose your options'. Warnings: Breast Naked Girl dancing in the strip club. Cussing every few minutes. 4-5 episode have ending bugs (you may or may not encounter them) but to fix them, you have to go to the menu screen and continue the game again.Would I play it again:   No. It's depressing. Good story but it one of those games where it isn't worth repeating. You'll know when you play all of it.I don't rate things. I just enjoy games. So I'm not rating anything.

												I am a fan of the Walking Dead game series by Telltale but went in knowing nothing about the world that this story is set in (also fearing the concept a bit gimmick-y sounding being about fairy tales etc)...BUT it took about a minute or so to be draw into the game and lose myself in what could be discribed as an interactive comic book movie. More so, now having just complete part four of The Wolf Among Us I am going to be hanging out for the final chanpter... and pretty much anything by the producers as they make great story driven games.While the game play could be called minimalistic I feel like I could easily have just joined somebody on the couch and watched them play it through and enjoyed it just as much for the tale being told. I will be playing it through again to try all the options I missed for sure and look forward maybe being a badder big bad wolf. Totally recommended for my part.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is one of the finest examples of story in a video game that I have seen in my 20 years of gaming.Like other Telltale Games hit, The Walking Dead, the sheer amount of choices available to the player, both in your dialog options as well as your ability to choose to threaten, maim, or even kill many of the characters you interact with gives the player a game that they can play several times over and still find new and interesting aspects of the story to uncover.There is not a single thing not to love about this title. The sound design, voice acting, animations, etc. are all phenominal. Hell, the game even made QTEs enjoyable for me, a person who hates QTEs with the fiery passion of 1,000 George Foreman grills.You would be an absolute fool to not give this game a go, and with an asking price less than half that of the AAA schlock that gets released these days, it is an absolute STEAL.

												Whether or not you like this game is going to boil down to one simple question: How much are you willing to pay for quality story writing?  Because at its core, that's what Telltale Games is offering.  Without a doubt, this is a truly excellent interactive story which is a hell of a blast from beginning to end.  I can't emphasize enough that the story is really, really good, a bright star in a sea of darkness that is AAA story writing.But (and this is where people will chew me out): That's all there is, a great story.  And for some people, that's enough.  But this sort of game is not for everyone.The game is composed entirely of walk-around segments where you look for clues that are relatively easy to find, and QTE segments which are relatively easy to beat.  I've never been a great detective, but when the game makes it as easy as these ones do, I don't feel like I need to be all that smart to figure out what's going on.  I'm also a terrible button masher and I'm even worse at QTEs, and I still beat every QTE sequence with very little struggle to speak of, and never once died.  It is an outright challenge just to die in this game.There is also relatively little in terms of ""length"" in this game.  As of this post, I have logged about 16 hours.  Of those, perhaps 10 were honest gameplay.  The rest were either moments when I left the computer running while doing errands, was forced to reload segments due to dialogue bugs, or was purposely rewinding to finish my Book of Fables achievements.  The game will not keep you playing for very long, unless you don't mind going through the same story multiple times even after you know the ending.And that would be less of a problem if there were replay value, but there is effectively none to speak of.  Telltale's tagline that ""your choices matter"" doesn't extend nearly as far as you'd like it to.  Certainly, there are actions, and there are consequences, but they are not as significant as the game makes them appear.  There are NPCs you can save, but their role is relatively minor from that point on.  There are parts where you can be a total prick (I was) and go around mauling and killing, and it'll result in only minor changes to a few lines of dialogue here and there.  There are locations that you can choose from, but oftentimes you'll end up visiting both locations anyways, and the only ""changes"" will be minor ones.  The story is effectively set in stone and there's pretty much nothing you can do to change its course.  The sole reason to go back and replay any segments is to unlock alternate Book of Fables entries, which I did on a few occasions.Now I should reiterate what I said earlier.  This is not a bad game.  The story is excellent, and for what it's worth, I had fun while playing it.  I would even go so far as to say that, for the $12.50 I paid for it, this game effectively gave me my money's worth.  So I want to make that perfectly clear before people get on my case.But with that said....this sort of game is very polarizing in the gaming community for a reason, and I can't in good conscience tell all my friends that this is a ""must-buy"" game, because it isn't.  It's a fantastic story, but as a game, it has weaknesses that will turn some people off.  This game is great for people who want a great story experience with minimal, very forgiving gameplay, and obviously for fans of any previous Telltale game.  This game is definitely not for people who don't care much for story, or for people who want serious and/or less forgiving gameplay, or for people who (in general) buy a game expecting countless hours of gameplay.The best summary I can give is this: Buying this game, as with all Telltale games, is effectively like purchasing a book with some gameplay attached to it, where the only real ""replay value"" is in reading the story again.  And if that's okay with you, this is definitely a worthy pickup at pretty much any price.  If it's not, this is probably not the title for you.			"

												If you enjoyed Tell Tale's Walking Dead series, you must give TWAU a try. An innovative and enchanting story arc guides the player through a classic point and click adventure style game where the fun is in carefully fostering relationships and building bonds of trust or just being a malevolent♥♥♥♥♥♥ Replayability value is also present; many of the decisions the player makes are binary, however, if you must make 6 binary choices an episode with five episodes you end up with 5 * (2^6) or 320 possible unique playthroughs.

												This game has around nine to ten hours of game play. I found the story very imersive and extremly compelling. I liked discovering childhood fairytales in a new light. I won't tell you much else so it can all be kept a surprise for you as well. The plot was hard to figure out which was nice for a change. I don't like a lot of mindless combat in games but I can say I actually looked forward to action scenes because they were fun to play.			"

												Fantastic point-and-click adventure game, where you play the Sheriff Bigby Wolf, aka The Big Bad wolf, each action out may affect future decisions.While including many of the fable characters from childhood, I found this game very entertaining. The in-depth storyline kept me going throughout, some of the choices that you have make really keep you on the edge and make you think how you want to be perceived in the game.As an added bonus you get to see a percentage of other peoples choices at the end of each episode which really brings it home.I would be happy to recommend to a friend. Keep up the good work Telltale on future releases. "

												This game is so addicting I found myself thinking about it during the day. Bigsby is a GREAT character to control, there is nothing worse than a main character who doesn't speak or react. Bigsby is raw, he acts on impulse and he has a history, a pretty gory one.I don't read comics so I cannot comment on what was better storywise but playing this game made me want to read the comics. Playing threw the various fables in a corrupt, dirty fable town was more fun than I care to admit. Yes, this game is very wordy and I worried about that, I am known to skup cutscenes with to much text, but I really enjoyed reacting to the situation. A lot of the choices led to the same outcome but I still enjoyed getting there.At the end you see the percentage of Steam players who chose a specific option/path. I was glad to read that over 80% didn't choose to send Colin to the farm. I was heartbroken for him. I want to replay it but I wish there was a way to skip the text that I have already played threw.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is another good narrative by Telltale, let down by a rather low playtime, even compared to their previous effort, The Walking Dead Season 1. The game only takes 6-8 hours to play through, and there's not a whole lot of replayability; though there are alternate scenes and locations that can occur, at the very least. It's well-written and well-made, as usual, and it's an enjoyable experience, but a rather brief one. I don't recommend it at full price, but on sale it's certainly worth a look.A few downsides; the swearing and gore felt a bit excessive at times, for sure. Just 'cause you have an M rating doesn't mean you need to flaunt it all the time. Again, the choices don't matter particularly much, either, and there's no challenge to be had as well; I never died or failed in any way once throughout the entire game, which certainly wasn't the case for TWD Season 1. These are only minor gripes overall, though, I still enjoyed this for the 75% off price I paid for it.			"

												Whether or not you like this game is going to boil down to one simple question: How much are you willing to pay for quality story writing?  Because at its core, that's what Telltale Games is offering.  Without a doubt, this is a truly excellent interactive story which is a hell of a blast from beginning to end.  I can't emphasize enough that the story is really, really good, a bright star in a sea of darkness that is AAA story writing.But (and this is where people will chew me out): That's all there is, a great story.  And for some people, that's enough.  But this sort of game is not for everyone.The game is composed entirely of walk-around segments where you look for clues that are relatively easy to find, and QTE segments which are relatively easy to beat.  I've never been a great detective, but when the game makes it as easy as these ones do, I don't feel like I need to be all that smart to figure out what's going on.  I'm also a terrible button masher and I'm even worse at QTEs, and I still beat every QTE sequence with very little struggle to speak of, and never once died.  It is an outright challenge just to die in this game.There is also relatively little in terms of ""length"" in this game.  As of this post, I have logged about 16 hours.  Of those, perhaps 10 were honest gameplay.  The rest were either moments when I left the computer running while doing errands, was forced to reload segments due to dialogue bugs, or was purposely rewinding to finish my Book of Fables achievements.  The game will not keep you playing for very long, unless you don't mind going through the same story multiple times even after you know the ending.And that would be less of a problem if there were replay value, but there is effectively none to speak of.  Telltale's tagline that ""your choices matter"" doesn't extend nearly as far as you'd like it to.  Certainly, there are actions, and there are consequences, but they are not as significant as the game makes them appear.  There are NPCs you can save, but their role is relatively minor from that point on.  There are parts where you can be a total prick (I was) and go around mauling and killing, and it'll result in only minor changes to a few lines of dialogue here and there.  There are locations that you can choose from, but oftentimes you'll end up visiting both locations anyways, and the only ""changes"" will be minor ones.  The story is effectively set in stone and there's pretty much nothing you can do to change its course.  The sole reason to go back and replay any segments is to unlock alternate Book of Fables entries, which I did on a few occasions.Now I should reiterate what I said earlier.  This is not a bad game.  The story is excellent, and for what it's worth, I had fun while playing it.  I would even go so far as to say that, for the $12.50 I paid for it, this game effectively gave me my money's worth.  So I want to make that perfectly clear before people get on my case.But with that said....this sort of game is very polarizing in the gaming community for a reason, and I can't in good conscience tell all my friends that this is a ""must-buy"" game, because it isn't.  It's a fantastic story, but as a game, it has weaknesses that will turn some people off.  This game is great for people who want a great story experience with minimal, very forgiving gameplay, and obviously for fans of any previous Telltale game.  This game is definitely not for people who don't care much for story, or for people who want serious and/or less forgiving gameplay, or for people who (in general) buy a game expecting countless hours of gameplay.The best summary I can give is this: Buying this game, as with all Telltale games, is effectively like purchasing a book with some gameplay attached to it, where the only real ""replay value"" is in reading the story again.  And if that's okay with you, this is definitely a worthy pickup at pretty much any price.  If it's not, this is probably not the title for you.			"

												First of all, you need toknow that i might not be clear sometime since I am French.First TellTale Games are pure genius. Why?, They created a game where your choice as an impact on the story. After I have played The walking dead ( who was awesome too ) I saw this little jewel in the steam store. You are playing the character of Bigby, Alias The Big Bad Wolf, In fable town. In this game you will see a lot of character from the stories you read when you were little. And , in this game, you are a detective and you are trying to find the murderer ( won't tell more since it could be consider as a spoil).So first, I would comment the story. I don't have anything negative about this since it is rich and like i said before, if you do an action, the story would be different than if you had done another.Secondly, this game, in my opinion, is worth the price. You will have a lot of fun, and some time the choice are difficult to makes. You will have approximatively, 1 hours and 30 minute fore each chapter minimum. It might not sound a lot but it is. But I need to say that this game is not for everyone since it is not a FPS where you have a lot of action everytime. It is sometime a point and click, so if you don't like that, do not buy it .Now about the graphics. For me a game with such content can't be bashed on his beauty. If you want me to compare, it looks like borderlands. A bit cartoony if I can say this like that but still beautiful (IMO). I just want to point out that it is not skyrim with all the mods on.If you did not buy the game already, you'll see that all the episode are there since today actually. I just want to point out that they are doing an episode every months I think. In this game all the 5 episode are already out, so you'll already have all the episodes when you will buy the game. But if in the futur you see another game form Telltale Games, do not be suprise that the episode are not all out. In conclusion, If you want a game that looks like a Tvshow, but you are interacting in it, you should buy this game. If you found that, with my argument, this games looks good do not even think about it.Buy it, you won't regret it. I hope I have help you all out and I am open to comments, I love to discuss. So in final I give this game a 9/10! Have a goodtime and a great day.			"

												Awesome game. The story is quite intriging and it really makes you want to quench your curiosity. It is very interesting seeing these characters in this grim light. Like other story games with pre-made answers, there are some instances where you may think ""hey, I would have said it like this..."". Otherwise, the immersion into the story and characters are awesome.			"

Unlike TWD, this has an old DOS point and click Mystery vibe, along with core elements from Telltale's other games, suck as Quick Time Events, Q and E mashing.I REALLY like this vibe, Especially in Point and Click games like this, it adds more story and suspense, Heck, even more enternainment.

												As a reader of the comics, I was skeptical about them pulling this off. Shaky start with Snow's voice (I kept seeing Carly) but overall, a really great attempt to put such a wonderful story into a game. Love the noir look and the 'book of fables' for those non comic book fans. I finished episode 4 yesterday and I'm still thinking through my choices and regretting earlier decisions which for me is a sign of a really good game. If you want fairytale/horror story (sort of) and nursery rhyme characters emersed in a story of sex, murder and embezzlement with a load of swearing thrown in .. then this is the game for you :)			"

I'm surprised to see one of the most honest discussions of crime appearing in a game starring fairytale characters.  Your choices really do matter to the outcome in this game, and while each choice eliminates possible future paths, the game doesn't punish you for making unusual decisions.I hope the rumors of future 'seasons' are true.  I also hope we'll see more of the unusual art, and excellent music, that appears in intro.  That art style and music is absent from the rest of this game. "

												The Wolf Amoung Us is a game by Telltale games where you can make your own decisions which will affects later episodes,Story:I will only mention the first episode story in a nutshell, most characters are all from fairytales stories like Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, Red Riding Hood and many more, Bigby (AKA Big Bad Wolf) is the Sheriff of Fabletown and have to protects all other Fables (Fairytale stories characters) from each other.*SPOILERS ALERT*The story begins as Bigby in a taxi cab on his way to Toad's apartment to help him, once arrived there was a lot of noise caused from the second floor, Bigby discovers that the Woodsman started attacking a women (with anger as she does not remember him as a hero from the Red Riding Hood) Bigby stops the Woodsman and attacked him, endding while jumping out from a 2nd Story window and landing on Toad's car, Bigby then is still attacked and being suffocated while the women grabbed his axe and hit him on the back of his head, after a little conversation Bigby then returns to his appartment and have a little chat with Colin before going to sleep, later Snow hurried to Bigby to show a chopped off head of the women (who was in Toad's appartment earlier) in the appartment's doorstep (you can decide whether to investigate or not), you will then investigate who she was, she is discovered to be Faith from the story Donkeyskin and then visit her husband Lawerence, but a call is recieved from Toad asking for help, this when to decide who to go to first, the story will change depending on who you visit first, the story ends in the Trip Trap Bar and having a small conversation with the Woodsman, but then attacked by Gren, after the battle Dee will enter and you will have a choice to either arrest the Woodsman or Dee (who was in Lawerence's home) and then find another murder was commited and this time Snow's head was on the doorstep.*SPOILERS END HERE*Gameplay:Playing the game is very simple, you move Bigby with WASD (Up, Left, Down, Right respectivly) and use the mouse to interact with things and people, like picking up evidence, talking to people, opening doors, etc., but during fights it consists of Quicktime events like tapping the Q button rapidly, pressing W or A or S or D to avoid things when shown and land hits on your opponent you will need to positionate the mouse cursor on the location shown required to attack him. (Please note you can't move freely and land your own hits, the game will show you what you buttons or clicks you need to perform in order to complete and win the fight)Looks/Soundtrack:If you played the walking dead you will notice it looks similar, it also looks similar as the art of Marvel comic books, everything looks great, the 3D models are great, backgrounds are also great, there nothing more to say, while the Soundtrack there is not much to listen to however the voices are very clear with subtitles, and the background noises are all fine.Length:The length of each episode should be about 30 to 60 minutes, but once you finish an episode, you will end up starting a new save file with diffrent decisions to amaze yourself with all the diffrences occuring in later episodes.

												When I first heard of this game from a friend, I was like ""Meh, maybe I'll check it out."" A month later, my friend was still bothering me about it, so I watched the first episode of it via YouTube. In the first few minutes, I was absorbed. The game already had a good developing story line, and I LOVED the characters. At that one moment, I decided to give TTG all my money and buy The Wolf Among Us not only for one system, but for two (my Xbox 360 and my Steam). And now that the season is over, I can assure you all that this game is a work of art, and while I also thoroughly enjoyed the Walking Dead Series and S2 (Still currently enjoying) I can say that The Wolf Among Us definetley had a stronger feeling to it. I was the law, but I didn't get free donuts or anything. I got mean glares, and I got in trouble (frequently). I got to play the good guy, who wasn't popular or loved, but hated. I was the Big Bad Wolf, the sherriff, yet I still had life hard for me. And there was so much drama and suspense sometimes that the Wolf had to make descisions that would ruin him and any others. This really pulled me in, having a position so powerful and matching it with a character who doesn't always play by the rules and still had the ability to ""Lose.""The Wolf Among Us is for people who enjoy a good mystery, action, and  suspense. So yea, I highly recommend it, and you should all give TTG all of your money for making such a masterpiece like this. Bravo, TTG, Bravo.			"

												Excellent game, the gameplay is just amazing. You can adjust the story to your own preferences and your personality will reflect on the end story. Theres also the replay, if you not happy about something you can always go back to the chapter you want to.Definitely recommend this game.			"

												I've never read the Fables comics that Wolf Among Us is based on, but I really enjoyed Telltale's previous adventure game The Walking Dead, so I was pretty confident that I would like this game too and that absolutely turned out to be correct.Wolf Among Us is set in Fabletown, where famous fairy tale characters such as Beauty and the Beast and Snow White live in secret amongst normal Humans. The player takes control of Sherriff Bigby Wolf (the Big Bad Wolf), whose job is to make sure the Fables follow the law.The excellent main story revolves around a murder investigation, while also adding details to how these Fables live their lives day to day. The characters are very well written with complex personalities, and have fantastic voice acting.Gameplay is mostly about dialogue, choosing how Bigby should respond during conversations with the other Fables. You can also make some decisions about how to proceed with the investigation, and your choices can influence how the story plays out. There are a few small crime scenes where you can walk around and examine clues, then use what you learned in future conversations. And there are some fights and chases that are controlled by QTEs, but these are quite forgiving, most of the time missing a button press just makes you progress in a different way. I never ended up in a failure state that required me reload and try again.Controls are not rebindable and I don't like wasd, so I played with an Xbox 360 controller instead, which worked fine. I didn't encounter any bugs, there were a couple of times that I was worried I had suffered a crash, but it just seems that sometimes loading of the next scene can be a bit slow.If you like a good story, I definitely recommend Wolf Among Us.

												I was reluctant to type up a review before the release of episode 5 because I thought they might screw up in the end, but it certainly wasn't that disappointing - quite the opposite, really. Being well written as it is, TWAU provided an insightful and action-packed conclusion to the game, and actually gave you some control over the stream of events. Not to mention the very well done action sequences and an absolutely amazing soundtrack.			"

												This game is just as enticing and story-riched as the graphic novels it is based on. Honestly, I think anyone who likes mysteries, graphic adventure games or even if they like the style of visual novels, would get their money's worth if they purchased this game. Not only was the story increabibly well told, the atmosphere and graphic were perfection. And the disversity of the characters was just as impressive. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys mysteries and/or adaptations of European fairy tales.			"

												Let me start out and say ""The wolf among us"" is one of the first ""Point and click"" games i've played. With that being said, i honestly feel like this game has left me without speech. You find yourself sinking in, deeper and deeper the rabbit hole of this plot, becoming one with it. Feeling emotions floating you when things happen in the game. The Animation, voices and choreography are straight forward Amazing! Telltale really delivered with this game and i can't wait for season 2. Well done Telltale!			"

The game is a great adventure game, it may be even better that The Walking Dead, to be fair I have never been into the the tv show. However I love to read books, and fairy tales are some of the most entertaining.  Play the game you wont regret it.			"

												I thought I should play this game and review it. This game was amazing, it really followed the Fables storyline(The Wolf Amoung Us is the preview to the comic books called Fables), I noticed a few characters who were in the game and not in the story. Bigby Wolf was so badass, he did his job and always tried to do the right thing no matter what the cost. I wish more people would read the books. The humor was dark and funny, the city was controlled by the crocked man. It really fit the detective parts of the first book. I am excited for season 2, I hope they keep following the story of Fables. I give this game a 10 out of 10 for sure.			"

												(9.5/10)I really was not sure what to expect out of this game.  I was not familair with the 'fables' source material, and enjoyed, but did not necessarily all-out love the prior telltale outings (sam & max, walking dead, etc).Well... 15 minutes in I pretty much was hooked.  The characters feel very well realized, and I was emotionally bound up in the story more deeply than I've been with a game in years.  The quicktime events are mildly frustrating, as they pretty much always will be in games, but this is no ""Tomb Raider"" and you can miss a few of those triggers now and again without it ruining the game for you.  The ""silence is always an option"" actually had me sometimes seriously sit back and wait, as the prepared responses simply didn't feel right, and generally the non action was more the action I felt was right and fit well.Certainly very highly reccomended on many levels for all who love adventure games, noir in general, and fables or other 'darker' ediger modern fairy tale stuff in general.  I dare you to not just play it all the way through... assuming you have the time of course.			"

												Wauw. A very good mature game, where your decisions decide the game, and your choices really can come back and bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥later on. This telltale game i would say is about, morality and what you ""think is the right choice"", which we all have diffrent opinion on, and it is gonna be hard finding other people whose choices are the same as yours. Only downside of this game for me is it is a bit short 10 hours, but every one of them is very intense so i would say it is worth it.You can decide to roleplay in it, but the biggest thing for me in this game was that i leared alot about myself, by the choices i choice through out the game and it really got me thinking, i hope you people do as well.

												First off this is more of an interactive storybook than a real game. That said, the story is extremely compelling, the art style beautiful, and the characters complex and believable. The gameplay itself goes by really quickly so make good use of that pause button or you'll feel rushed and make mistakes. Most of the game is looking for and putting clues together, and most games either make the clues so easy to work with that you feel like a coddled child, or so difficult to work with that you get frustrated and give up and look everything up on a wiki. This game though does the clues PERFECTLY, and you will really feel a sense of accomplishment when you put things together. You will also feel very in control of the story, even when you're not. The choices you get to make as Bigby Wolf really let you define his character. Are you a good man with a terrible past, trying to redeem yourself? Are you simply a law-enforcer, tired of fighting?  Or are you still just 'The Big Bad Wolf'?			"

The overall story is good/interesting, great bunch of characters, has very few minor things left unanswered which I only picked up having played the four episodes in a row in my second playthrough).I didn't have the same emotional attachment to this as I did with the Walking Dead series, but the game is worth your time & money & hopefully it get you into reading the 'Fables' comic.

												The Wolf Among us Is a story Driven point and click game Made by Telltale Games. The game puts you in the shoes of the famous fairy tale character The big bad wolf  Known as  bIgby Wolf a sherrif of fabletown Full of fairy tale legends who have left the old world  and have come to Our world  trying to fit in with the mundys (Humans) disguised to look like them. Sheffif bigby leaving his history behind trys to become a better person by being the law. The story puts you in a murder mystery case you and Snow white are trying to solve with shocking revelations that you uncover along the way and well executed action scenes with quick time events that are done well. The game from start to finish is a fantastic game with a story that has you so interested to find out what happens next and the shocking cliff hangers just force you to play the next episode for sure.This is along with great characters that you will meet and that you will recognise from a story such as Snow white, one of the 3 little pigs, the woodsman, Toad and many more but how you interact with them is up to you. You can be the meanest by choosing all the bad choices that will all in some way have an outcome that might effect you in some way. Or you can try and be the nice guy trying to not allways be the d*ck that the whole of fabletown know you as but even sometimes you have to be that guy to get your answer's out of people whether thats intimidating characters or just plain beating them up. This game has got beautifull cell shaded graphics that bring the comic book style to it which looks great with the vibrant stand out colors. While playing episode after episode of the game i couldnt help but notice that the soundtrack is awesome and comes in at the right times in the game at appropriate times in scenes. In the game their were some parts with interaction with characters that i felt that wasnt needed and just felt pointless some episodes are weaker than overs. Also when you are looking for clues you have a load of interactions with clues and objects but if you interact with a certain clue it will just move you on and not letting you fully explore what it has to offer you. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall The wolf among us as a whole is well written                                                                  well voice acted                                                                  well animated                                                                  A immersive story to be played                                                                 with good characters I recomend to all Definitely			"

(So don't start this if you're in a busy time period). The graphics are also very pretty. I like the comic-style drawing. It's easy on the eyes and very appealing. Controls are simple and comfortable and I might even go as far as to say they are beginner-friendly. I would definitely recommend playing this game (it's also fun to play with some friends watching).

												Excellent, intriguing, and mature story. In games like this one it's usually hard to make a difference with your choices, but I felt most of my choices mattered in the end. I even regret some choices I've made during this first playthrough. The end left me with a few unanswered questions, but I think it was on purpose to make me want to read the comics (Wolf Among Us is based on a series of Comic books titled ""Fable""), or maybe because they are preparing a Season 2. The quicktime events were a little too easy most of the time. It took me 8 hours to finish, but I'll definetly play it again some day to try other options. Personally I like short games with good story, because I don't have the same patience, passion or time I used to have for video games, unfortunately. If you want a short, simple game, with an excellent interactive story, look no further. You have no reason to pass this one.I'd give it a 8.5/10.			"

												Pros:-Bigby Wolf is a fun character to play as. You can play him in many clear ways and even combine different paths you can take.-The world of Fables is fascinating because you are familiar with many of the characters in this game already, but not in the way this world represents them, which really kept me engaged. -Being a badass investigator solving a murder mystery in a world styled like a comic book is something I've never experienced in a game before and this game does an amazing job of combining all these elements into one. -The way the game quickly switched between dialogue to action sequences was fantastic and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Cons:-The consequences and choices always seem pretty dire in the heat of the moment, but sometimes the results are the same regardless of your path. -The typical frame rate problems between loading screens (Telltale Games are kinda known for this) -The ending of the game left too many questions unanswered. It kinda begs for a Season 2. So if there isn't a Season 2, this game really didn't get a proper ending. Overall:As far as Telltale Games goes, The Wolf Among Us is my all time favorite. I really fell in love with how these fairy tale characters were put into a setting that modernized them and changed my way of how I thought of them. Telltale did a great job of combining the murder mystery LA Noire feel with the style of a comic book, which bring together a fantastic looking game. You really do feel like Bigby Wolf trying he's best to solve the murder mystery and also trying to obtain acceptance from the other Fables. So will you be the good cop or the bad cop?Rating: 9/10			"

The tension in decisions is a real treat and it is nice to see an underrated comic book getting a well deserved mainstream game.

												TellTale does it again!I just finished the entire game, all five episodes although I haven't gone back just yet to see about other choices and how it can impact the game, but I can say right now that Wolf Among Us is just as engaging as the Walking Dead games, something that I am truly impressed with.The gameplay is a point and click adventure, streamlined for casual players. Clickable items are shown with orbs, and most things to discover really aren't too far out of reach of newer players of the genre. The game also has a mode where you can turn that off if you want a challenge, but on your second playthrough you most likely remember where everything is, so if you want to go with this option, I'd do it on your first playthrough.A lot of really cool characters, top notch voice acting, and some genuinely intense moments (although I've found that they are far more intense in the Walking Dead games by Tell Tale which I would also really recommend checking out). The graphics, while not going to be something that take advantage of your four SLI Titans, are bright, colorful and undeniably charming. They look like they popped out of a comic book.I'd recommend it.			"

												Now that I've finished the entire game, I can comfortably say that this is another great Telltale game in the vein of The Walking Dead Season 1.  I DEFINITELY think anyone who enjoyed TWD S1 would enjoy this game. It doesn't have the best pacing, but the story has plenty of twists and turns with a lot of likable characters and (thankfully) it ends strong. Also, it really doesn't matter if you have no familarity with the Fables comic series the game is based on - the game does a good job of introducing the world in an accessible way.If you have any interest in interactive storytelling this game is unquestionably worth the $12.50 it's on sale for right now.

Other than that? meh...Get it on sale if you want, but full price is too much for a railroaded illusion~of~choice game that was completely changed 2 episodes in because the mystery was so poorly scripted everyone figured it out already.I could have written the same review months ago, figured I'd give it a chance, but the ending was less than thrilling.I felt like I was being dragged kicking and screaming towards an end I didn't want and just when I thought I had escaped it's grasp it kicked me and spat in my face.

												This is an excellent game. If you are looking for a game with real story where all your choices make an inpact on how the game plays out then look not further. Wolf Among Us brings you in the Fabletown and introduces you to each of the characters. As you learn about them you get a feeling of who they are and begin to enjoy seeing them again in other epidsode. The story is very gripping and has you coming back for more with each episode. I can't wait until season two to see what Bigby will do next.			"

												What a fantastic surprise this game was! I really enjoyed the comics, but I was not prepared for how awesome this game would be. First of all it's visually beautiful. The animation and music create an atmosphere of film-noir-like detective story but with a bit of Constatine movie coloring. Absolutely stunning. The whole choose your own adventure idea where your choices build the story is great. I like that we don't have much time to pick an answer when responding to the world - makes the experience so much more exciting (although as a non-English user I sometimes struggle to read them all in time). And of course the story - gripping, touching and fun. I was lucky to stumble upon this game! This is still - in my opinion - the best of Telltale games.			"

												Adventure game based on a line of graphic novels named ""Fables"", where characters from old fairy tales have come to live in human society. It's typical Telltale-style gaming here, so no surprises about the mechanics or playstyle. I felt the source material was treated quite well which is great - I ended up marathoning the game and it did not leave me disappointed. It was certainly able to hold my attention. A few of the twists were telegraphed well enough that I caught them, but for the most part I didn't mind. A sequel would be great since I'm left wanting more, luckily it was based on those graphic novels so I can just go grab a few of them to get my fix. The only regret I have for this game is that I didn't play it back when I bought it, as it was certainly worth the playtime I put in.			"

												Even though only one episode is available right now, this game/series already seems very promising.  The gameplay itself is simple point & click, but the story and characters are so gripping that you are drawn in right from the start.  In just a couple of hours, the game created a world and characters that I cared about (I haven't read the comics that this game is based upon, though after playing episode 1, I may have to go out and buy them); by the end of the first episode, I've already become invested in these characters and cannot wait for the next episode to be released!  The game also offers you the ability to make choices which impact the story (and often there are no clear right or wrong choices) - so the game seems to have great replayability value.  The art style is amazing, the music fits the theme, and the voice acting is well done.			"

												I highly recommended this game. The beautiful and vibrate cartoonish cell shading art style really matches the grim story of the Fables within Fabletown. The story thus far is about The Big Bad Wolf, Mr. Bigsby, following the recent murders in Fabletown. So much like The Walking Dead game (both are made by Tale Tell Games) is episode based and choices made within the game will reflect throughout the game. Even in the first episode your choices do make significant changes within the game. The in game fight/decision system is great. It’s much better than The Walking Dead in game fight/decision system. I do feel the investigation aspect of the game is lacking and maybe it’s the first episode. I feel that The Walking Dead is better in that area. Overall that game is great. The story, gameplay, art style and overall feel of the game work very well. Overall: 9/10 -- Not sure it’s worth $30 currently (only one episode) but definitely if it is on sale.			"

												I love adventure games, and I love Western-style comic books and graphic novels. This is an adventure game based on a comic book series written by one of the principal writer's of Image Comics, 'The Walking Dead' series. The adaptation for television is now a blockbuster tv show. The gist of the 'Wolf Among Us', series is that Fables have been forced to update themselves in NYC, and you are the Big Bad Wolf, and Fabletown's Sheriff. There has been a murder in Fabletown, and as Sheriff you have to play the gumshoe and solve the case. Simple gameplay, with lots of story. Finally, your decisions, wise or otherwise, have a large effect on the results of the game. If you like the genre of this game, then its well worth the try.			"

												The Wolf Among Us (Episode 1) is the latest game from Telltale Games and the first of a new series. Based on DC Vertigo's ""Fables"" comic series, you play the role of Bigby Wolf (formerly the Big Bad Wolf of Little Red Riding Hood fame) and now the sheriff of Fabletown - a hidden world of fable characters in New York City. The last Telltale series I played was ""Sam & Max"", so I wasn't expecting the more ""graphic novel"" approach to the game. There are sections of the game which play more like traditional point-n-click adventures, but with all the potential hotspots in the area highlighted for you, it's less about hunting for things on screen and more about clicking on everything to unlock more of the story. The story is an extremely violent affair dealing with a murder in Fabletown. This is not a game for kids. The language is bad, lots of cursing, and the violence is pretty violent. The characters, voice acting and art are all absolutely first rate. The game itself is fun, but pretty easy. Even the action sequences, which involve hitting keys quickly in order to cause actions or avoid harm, are pleasantly forgiving. The game is more about choices than action, however. The game tells you when you've made a choice which will have lasting impact on the game. One downside is that the episode is on the short side. I played it from start to finish, including the tutorial, in under 2 hours. The ending came abruptly and left me sitting at the keyboard wondering what to do next. The game provides some feedback at the end of the episode about how your choices compare to other players of the game (38% of players make the same choice you did, for example). It's an interesting statistic, and from a psychology standpoint, it would be really cool to see more stats and more detail, but I suppose there's a limit to what they can show you without making it boring or spoiling future episodes. It's a great story so far. I found myself lost in it for the 2 hours it took to complete. If you can pick it up on sale, I recommend that - it makes the shortness more palletable. I know there will be more episodes, but if they are all roughly the same length, we're only talking about 10 hours or so gameplay for the season. That seems low for the full price cost of the game - no matter how good the production values are. I highly recommend The Wolf Among Us, at any price, but with the holiday sale going on, there's no reason not to get it if you can score the discount.			"

												Telltale is killing it right now. I have a feeling their episodic games are going to have me addicted. This has the same gameplay and storytelling style as The Walking Dead. Telltale's developers have improved upon their combat and timing skills since they've made TWD.  The choice system gave you less time than in TWD. In TWD, you had enough time to think about the direction your response may take you which gave me a bias. In The Wolf Among Us you have just enough time to read the choices and decide. This lead to much more genuine gameplay on my part. Overall, I would highly recommend this game if you're a fan of The Walking Dead game style and you're cool with a storyline including characters from fairy tales.			"

The difference (besides the setting) is the general story-type: while Walking Dead is about survival in general, this is a detective story. And a story about redemption. And while it does have some minor flaws in characters, in logic and stuff, overall the story IS quite good. At least I did enjoy it. I think I'll give it 7/10, 'cause latest episode messed up dynamics a bit.			"

												Well... I'm not sure how to put my feelings about my game in to words. I picked up the game and got so in to it, that I beat it the same day. I literally just beat it, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's 2:14 friggin' AM when did that happen... ANYWAYS, this is seriously an amazing game. If you've never heard of the comic series it is based on, 'Fables', that's fine. I hadn't either, and I still enjoyed the game immensely. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I'm tempted to go out and find the first issue of the comics and give it a try. Not gonna spoil anything, but I will say that the game reels you in as the episodes go on, before yanking you in and out at the end. The guys over at TellTale did a REALLY good job with the visual presentation on this, and personally... I prefer it over TWD games. I know, shoot me now. But I REALLY LOVED THIS. And I loved TWD too! But I still have to admit it that it didn't suck me in to it's world as much as TWAU did for me. If you haven't played a TellTale games episodic, then I whole-heartedly recommend starting here.

												This game completely surprised me, when I first saw it on steam I avoided looking into it solely based on the gameplay. However after giving it a shot it has to be my favourite game of 2013. This game is the best example of what story can do for a videogame. The gameplay is bland and sometimes straight annoying when it interrupts a great scene, but it doesnt matter because the story is fantastic. Despite my distatse for the gameplay I cannot help loving this game 9/10			"

												Well, it is only the first chapter. But it will make you fell angry, sympathetic, nervous. It will make it look like your choices matter, and trust me, they do. You'll have to live with the regret or the certainty you made something right. And a game capable of evoking these emotions, along with presenting us with some really nice art, characters, action sequences and music, must be a truly great game. If you haven't done it, buy it right now.			"

												It's impossible to explain what can you feel in this game. You just have to play in it. All of these characters is simply amazing and Telltale perfectly shows it in this game. Sometimes you feel sorry for some characters (for example it's Toad and his son) and you can be shocked when you'll see some story unexpected twists. Also, you can affect on Bigby actions by your decisions. And I should say that i can see how these decisions playing their role in this game. About the soundtrack....No sh*t, it's f*cking amazing. Just give it a try:

												I just finished Episode 1 ... this game definitely has the same feel as The Walking Dead, but it is also different. It is certainly more action packed, for one thing. I would even say that it is more violent, which may be hard to believe at first. In The Walking Dead, you mostly shoot people. With a gun, you have more distance -- both physically and emotionally -- between you and the person you kill. But, in The Wolf Among Us you have to brutally beat people up, with your bare hands. It is a much more visceral experience. I liked it. There were times when Snow's dialogue disrupted the immersion of the player, especially when it was painfully obvious that the developers were using her to basically tell you what to do. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints. The art style is vibrant yet edgy at the same time. There are a host of interesting and complicated characters. It's just a great game so far. i'm looking forward to playing Episode 2 and the remaining episodes when they are released.			"

Episodes 3 and 5 are where the game is really going to prove itself, if TWD was any indication. This means that complete opinions cannot be formed until we see more, but what has been shown so far has great potential.			"

												The Wolf Among Us is another solid Telltale adventure game that plays like an interractive comic book. If you have played The Walking Dead, then you will enjoy this as well. My only gripe with this game is that it is extremely short for the price. I would advise those interested to wait until all the chapters are released or until a good sale.It is hard to go wrong with a story pulled from a well-liked graphic novel and I found this one extremely fun to be at the helm of.

												This game comes from the Telltale Games, creators of The Walking Dead games series and it feels pretty much the same. It's not a game per se. more like an interactive movie, with interactivity limited to several point-and-click scenes, a handful of QTE and a couple of plot-developing choices. However it still mananges to keep you glued to the screen for the (short) duration of the game. Its strenagth lies in the plot, setting and character design that feel like they came straight from the comic books. My main gripe wth the game is its price - for a two-hour experience it's a bit too much. Hopefully the DLC will come ant a discount			"

												I didn't expect to, but I really liked this game!  The dialogue and voice-acting were phenomenal.  The artwork made the whole game seem like I was participating in a living graphic novel.  Having read the Fables comics while in college, I was afraid that the characters might not hold true, but they were exactly as I remembered them.  Wonderfully done.I also want to point out that the game was not immensely long.  Completion only took about 10 hours for me and I did backtrack once or twice to change a decision I had made to see other outcomes.  It's something you can sink into for short sessions and come back to with ease.My only complaints -- and they're pretty minor -- were some slight graphic issues when dialogue was about to occur.  Also, I wished I could have dialed up the difficulty as I sometimes felt the game was handing me a easy win.9/10 Excellent storytelling!			"

I won’t say anything else about it because if more people can be surprised by it, it’s well worth it.   Like all other Telltale games the engine fells old and choices don’t really matter, but at least you can pause it whenever you want. The story is OK but it’s the setting that really makes this game. The only real complaint I have is that the “next season” spoilers are unskippable. Rating: Insanity Wolf. Recommendation: This is definitely one of the better visual novel games out there.http://pixelloot.com "

												As of this review, I had just finished Episode 2 of 5. Those of you familiar with The Walking Dead  game made by Telltale Games will definitely enjoy this game. The game plays very similarly in many aspects such as quick time events and the same style of conversation choices. This game takes a fun twist on the Fables you grew up hearing about and takes it to a very dark place. The twists and turns of the story will keep you on edge and keep you playing. Each episode has lasted roughly 1 & 1/2 to 2 hours so far so in the long run i'm assuming it'll be 8-10 hours of gameplay total for an entire playthrough. Telltale Games continues to deliver with another unique story and entertaining game with The Wolf Among Us. I picked it up on a Steam sale for $8 and it was well worth it.			"

												The Tell Tale games are great when you just don't have the energy for other games.  They are like interactive movies that both enterain and engage.  I find the company's games perfect for a quiet night in where I can stuff my fae with food and still be able to easily engage in a game (I am not very good at multitasking food and games!).  The Wolf Among Us is based in the universe of the Fables comic book series.  It felt very true to the series for those who are big fans.  The first season surrounds a mysterious murder of a Fabletown inhabitant that the main character, Bigby Wolf (The Big Bad Wolf) encounters very early in the story.  There is mystery, murder, magic, and fantasy as well as some good old fashioned gore.  There are several plot twists that are quite catching.I personally look forward to another season of this series.  I have enjoyed it just as much as The Walking Dead.  It's a different genre but the story gets better and better as you go.  It's been years since I really have enjoyed point-click story games.  Tell Tale Games has done a great job with everything I have played of theirs so far.  Even if it is not my cup of tea, I have picked up their games and always found myself enjoying the story.  I hope you will give this one a chance.  You may fight yourself pleasantly surprised by the darkness twisted into our childhood tales.			"

												Amazing story and amazing characters. If you're a fan of The Walking Dead, you'll def. love this game. It's filled with a lot more action and doesn't pull at your heartstrings like TWD does, but it's still an incredible game! As soon as you start it pulls you right into the action. It's best to buy it now since it's on sale, especially since you'll get all 5 episodes with it when you buy it! If you're a fan of fantasy, get this game. You won't regreat it.			"

This is one of the best games I've ever played in terms of an immersive story, that has a whole lot of replay value that just makes me want to play from start to end without stopping. If you've ever read a choose-your-own-adventure type of book, then this is the thing for you. It's like one of those books actually came alive into an animation!

												I am only at the beginning but I can tell right away that this is not hype on those very positive reviews. This game is so beautiful; not only the graphics have this noir style but the storyline. This is really well thought out. As you expect there is little interaction. This is an interactive story more than a game. I knew this and it was part of the reason I haven't got it. I thought I would be bored. On the contrary, this stuff is awesome.			"

												Telltale graced our lives with some amazing games in the past and this is no exception. Walking Dead was an amazing story that we had the chance to live through as we suffered a multitude of consequences for our decisions. The Wolf Among Us has upped the ante and breathed new life into the comics for the gamers lucky enough to play through the world of Fables. I admit that I did love Walking Dead Season 1, but TWAU blew me away. The maturity of the creators after their journey into the world of zombies has increased exponentially and it shows. I have always had an interest in zombies and read Walking Dead before ever playing the first Telltale Games ""story"", but with Fables I've only been briefly introduced and now yearn to not only collect the graphic novels but also to cross my fingers that Telltale continues to put out such masterpieces of storytelling (including another Fables storyline) because I'm hooked.Honestly, it blows my mind how interested I am in this style of gaming/storytelling. I've loved comics since a young age, but my gaming preferences have always been geared toward RPG or FPS-style action. I grew up playing Wolfenstein and Final Fantasy so those two genres always keept me with an itchy trigger finger and a brain thirsty to digest the epic stories and adventures that took all too many hours of rest away from my youth. Yet here I sit after playing through my second Telltale game and I feel like I've found a new love in this style of gameplay. It might not be the best for action-oriented gamers, but for those of you who may enjoy a good story and don't mind occasionally sitting back and not taking much action then THIS is the game to play.Without a doubt I would recommend this game to anyone who even remotely wants to live in the comics. Anyone who has ever read through plenty of choose-your-own-adventure books, loves to be a part of a good story and deal with the consequences, or just wants a relaxing game to play through between bouts of COD or whatever the kids may play these days. Give it a shot. After all, I want to see my RPG/FPS/story-telling come to life in the Borderlands game that Telltale is supposed to hand deliver to me (at least I can dream) and this is the way to help fund them to make more beautiful games.

												I don't usually write reviews for games, but I enjoyed this one so much that I really want to share how awesome it is. I won't get super into detail, but basically; if you ever wonder whether or not you should play this, play it. The graphics are beautiful, it feels like you're literally interacting with a comic book, and the noir-style storytelling is so satisfying to watch and play with. The characters, from the original comic and the new ones, are so well-written. The plot is fantastic, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was playing. I'm ashamed it took me this long to get around to playing through it.My new favorite Telltale game! If you love mysteries, comics, fairytales or noir stories, you'll love it too!			"

												When I first heard of this game from a friend, I was like ""Meh, maybe I'll check it out."" A month later, my friend was still bothering me about it, so I watched the first episode of it via YouTube. In the first few minutes, I was absorbed. The game already had a good developing story line, and I LOVED the characters. At that one moment, I decided to give TTG all my money and buy The Wolf Among Us not only for one system, but for two (my Xbox 360 and my Steam). And now that the season is over, I can assure you all that this game is a work of art, and while I also thoroughly enjoyed the Walking Dead Series and S2 (Still currently enjoying) I can say that The Wolf Among Us definetley had a stronger feeling to it. I was the law, but I didn't get free donuts or anything. I got mean glares, and I got in trouble (frequently). I got to play the good guy, who wasn't popular or loved, but hated. I was the Big Bad Wolf, the sherriff, yet I still had life hard for me. And there was so much drama and suspense sometimes that the Wolf had to make descisions that would ruin him and any others. This really pulled me in, having a position so powerful and matching it with a character who doesn't always play by the rules and still had the ability to ""Lose.""The Wolf Among Us is for people who enjoy a good mystery, action, and  suspense. So yea, I highly recommend it, and you should all give TTG all of your money for making such a masterpiece like this. Bravo, TTG, Bravo.			"

 The Wolf Among Us  A Film Noir Drama, that loudly goes nowhere.. (I realise that this will easily be the most controversial piece that i have ever written, but you cannot archieve fame/notoriety without being a bit of a tosser.)Well, that subtext kinda reveals my point without explaining. I have a right tonne of stuff to nitpick.. However, i'm not going to fight hyperactive fanboys over this point. Instead of fighting, i'm just going to point out the problems in this particular series. Whilst attempting to cut out all the possible spoilers and trying to tie everything in to a cohesive critique..( All whilst suffering from bronchitis and tanking painkillers. ) The review has a lot of references to the Graphic novel series, so unless you have read them. Please refrain from posting bad arguments. The game starts in a way that i find very solid, like in the graphic novels. (Yes, i have now read all the books.) But unlike the novels, the game seems to have a rather obvious pacing problem. Maybe due to the episodic nature, but before you nag about it being the same in the novels. The novels had a very clear notion of what is happening, having an isolated short story in each issue and having small hints for what might happen next.The game attempts this storytelling method, but manages to muck it up slightly.. Or moderately. This is the part where i turn very biased, so if you excuse me for a minute...TellTale has a reputation of making some very good episodic titles, one of my personal favourites being the Sam & Max series. But no matter how well you manage to create a story and setting for the characters in question, there are always some lurches that manage to appear. Sam & Max fans know what i'm talking about here.. That certain episode that was listed as ""A waste of time"" even by Sam & Max themselves. These lurches appear usually when you have ""Too many irons in the furnace"". If i managed to translate that correctly, or if that metaphor didn't work. Lets just say ""Having too big of a sip from an icy slushie and getting a brainfreeze"". Having too much stuff that you can actually manage. Causing everything they do, a little half-baked. And by that i mean; A raw slob of dough that you kept in the oven for only 15-Minutes and though it was properly cooked. Wow! My metaphors are terrible when i'm sick.. But back to review before i get distracted more...Like i was trying to explain, by my metaphorically deprived way; The game is not that good. I took some time to discuss this problem with one of my friends and we came to a conclusion that the pacing was off. Amongst other things..So the ""friends video-game club discussion"" that we had, came to a conclusion that the games pacing was along the lines of a badly edited TV-Programme. Starting in a solid way, then getting cut as everything got interesting and after that filling some time faffing about, then finally ending in a cliffhanger. Oh f*ck! i just spoiled the ending.And speaking of the ending, after spoiling the cilffhanger. Its one of those endings that gives closure to the story, but explains absolutely NOTHING. The game already had some holes in its plot like a colinder has for flour,  Why am i fixated on baking all of the sudden?  and none of those thing are even remotely explained during the ending. The rest is a bit of a spoiler, so i'l black it out for you..  The ending that is the one chatting up to Nerissa, explains nothing more than the things connected to Lily the first murder victim. Nerissa explains, that it was her who left the head in front of the Woodlands Building. Bridging in the missing pieces on how she died, but thats it.  So even with that ending, i felt confused and dazed. Since i felt, as i mentioned, that nothing was explained.And those are the problems i have with this particular series. I'm not going to copy-paste the usual, ""Great visuals"" ""Marvellous atmosphere"" And all the other faff. Since you know (if you have read any of my other reviews) i don't really give a damn about visual style.I just realised, that i really haven't been writing a review. Rather i have written a long line of nitpicking.. But even with being a nitpick, it still has a decent point and the point being: ""The game had terrible pacing, some obvious plotholes and an ending that explains nothing."" And i cannot do nothing else but to get annoyed at the fact that TellTale are going to attempt to explain the stuff in the second season, if there even will be one..But all my narking aside..The Wolf Among Us, is a quirky but enjoyable story set in the Fables universe. But i cannot really recommend it over the books, but i will recommend it as a spinoff title, even with its problems.Rating? i quess.. Thinking about it, as my painkiller buffed brain can cope.I think a reasonable B+ is in order.Reasons being: plotholes, pacing issues, the ending and TellTales time management.			"

												Wauw. A very good mature game, where your decisions decide the game, and your choices really can come back and bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥later on. This telltale game i would say is about, morality and what you ""think is the right choice"", which we all have diffrent opinion on, and it is gonna be hard finding other people whose choices are the same as yours. Only downside of this game for me is it is a bit short 10 hours, but every one of them is very intense so i would say it is worth it.You can decide to roleplay in it, but the biggest thing for me in this game was that i leared alot about myself, by the choices i choice through out the game and it really got me thinking, i hope you people do as well.

												I started playing The Wolf Among Us with no preconceptions of any kind. I'd read no reviews, had not talked to my friends about it or read any of the comics. I bought it because of the strength of Telltale's other adventure game.This made the experience quite a surprise, especially to start with - hookers and talking frogs etc! I loved the neon, purple art style and the music. A very fresh and stylish game with some interesting twists and decisions to make. The quick time event combat sections were very hit and miss for me, some were intense and entertaining but others felt a bit shallow and unnecessary.I really enjoyed the detective elements of the game although at points the story or game mechanics would undermine that factor. To summerise my feelings about the game, it's was a fun ride that I'm pleased to have experienced. Original, well written and with great visual style but it wasn't edge of your seat stuff and although there were some difficult decisions and a few emotional moments it wasn't quite up to the same standard as Telltales Walking Dead series.7/10			"

												This game is so very good.This has such a great story. I purchased this game not knowing the Fables comic book series. I have since read quite a few issues. The visuals are comic book based, going along with the theme, but look good. There are a few 'choices' that you make that may affect the outcome, but what happens is going to happen. This is not really a game, so much as it is an interactive movie--a very intriguing movie. Much like all the other people who play this, I fully recommend it. Oh, and read the comics.			"

And the game was outstanding!The gameplay and storytelling was incredible, and the art style for this game is just perfect. Every time i play it i sit im my chair full of excitement like it were christmas when i was a child.The main character you play, Bigby wolf is an amazing character to be able to play. He used to kill and eat fables before, so in in this game he have went from the hunter of fables to the protector of fables. The fact that he is the Big Bad Wolf is very cool, cause whenever there is trouble he have the strength to handle it.Even if you might not like Point and Click games you should give this game a try. It is way more than ""just a normal point and click"" game. Telltale did unbelievable job and for that this game is one of my favorite games of all time. 10/10			"

												Well... I'm not sure how to put my feelings about my game in to words. I picked up the game and got so in to it, that I beat it the same day. I literally just beat it, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's 2:14 friggin' AM when did that happen... ANYWAYS, this is seriously an amazing game. If you've never heard of the comic series it is based on, 'Fables', that's fine. I hadn't either, and I still enjoyed the game immensely. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I'm tempted to go out and find the first issue of the comics and give it a try. Not gonna spoil anything, but I will say that the game reels you in as the episodes go on, before yanking you in and out at the end. The guys over at TellTale did a REALLY good job with the visual presentation on this, and personally... I prefer it over TWD games. I know, shoot me now. But I REALLY LOVED THIS. And I loved TWD too! But I still have to admit it that it didn't suck me in to it's world as much as TWAU did for me. If you haven't played a TellTale games episodic, then I whole-heartedly recommend starting here. And if you have, yet haven't picked this up... I'm just gonna give you a questioning look over the internet now. Yep. Can you feel it? That's the stare of questioning. Well enough staring, I'm gonna go to bed... Pick up the game though. Seriously. It's amazing. Tenouttaten.			"

												First of all I'd say this is more of a Visual Novel than a Point and Click adventure game. You don't need to hunt anything on the screen, everything is obviously highlighted. The gameplay is not at all about testing your power of observation and patience its all about making diaglogue choices under a time pressure. Which is the crux of telltale's style. Every dialogue tree comes with a timer, you have to pick something to say in that time or you say nothing. Which is a valid option and sometimes the ""best"" one.The story and atmosphere are great, if you like the whole hard boiled detective (sherriff in this case) theme. Not quite Noir and its not all dark and stormy nights but Bigby Wolf has it tough and he's even tougher.It'll take well under 10hrs to complete, but its worth the money. The TellTale niche of making VN's that use QTE (google it) combat to inject some action and adrenaline into proceedings works quite well. While its far from perfect, you will want to finish the story and you should probably take some satisfaction from being the Big Bad Wolf however you choose to play him.Highly recommend unless the idea read/watching a game instead of playing it is a huge turn off.

												Finished the entire season and wow, what a good game. What ruined it for me is that at the very end it tells me that I should read the comic to find out what happened next. Why? The walking dead tv show is immensely popular but is it's own entity and doesn't have to follow the comics much at all.  No disrespect to the comics but the artistic style of this game doesn't even resemble the source material.Reading the comics after playing through this masterpiece is like buying a new bicicle and then deciding to use the stationary one at home. It just doesn't compute. All I have to say is that there better be a season 2 or this game could be leaving fans at the altar. Comics look interesting, but aren't the same as a game where you get to choose what happens next and get to play so many different ways. Face it Telltale, this game deserves at least another season.			"

												If you liked The Walking Dead from the telltale studios you won't be dissapointed by the Wolf among us. If you also read the critically acclaimed Fables comics you will definitely love the Wolf among us. Point and Click adventures aren't that en vogue at the moment and probably will never be as in demand as they have been in their prime (Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Broken Sword etc.)  but tWau definitely tries to revive the genre and seems to be succeeding so far. The story is dark and grasping and might even surprise an avid reader of the comics. Furthermore it has one of the most stylish protagonist you'll ever get to meet in an adventure game.  Not only is the voice acting supreme, but also his looks, be it transformed or normal. In addition he is very easy to identify with as you can feel his frustration and the urge to let it all go to hell and let the Big Bad Wolf out sometimes.Now for the bad parts:The gameplay can be a bit annoying sometimes as every fight is mostly just evading by pressing the right buttons at the right times, but it doesnt really matter if you get beaten bloody by opponents as the game will go on anyways. Furthermore the dialogs can be a bit repetative as every character has a certain angle: Bluebeard is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and needs to be constantly reminded of that fact, crane is a creep and needs to be constantly reminded of that fact, toad wont get glamoured and needs to be..........Nevertheless the Wolf among us is a very fine piece of software and well deserves all the positive receptions it gets at the moment. I can only strongly suggest that you buy this game, play this game and be very happy with this game.  "

												Fully recommended! Gameplay-wise it works similar to The Walking Dead, but personally I found the story more engaging and interesting. Instead of trying to survive in a world that is already dead you're a detective among a vibrant community of fables (animals from your bed time stories, that live among human disguised with special charms) trying to catch a murder.Telltale's finest work yet, if you're into graphic novels/noir/story driven games.

												If you are looking for a well written detective story with a very unique setting and narrative undertone (known from the awesome graphic novels), you are in for a treat.Aside from the story, that will not let you return to your desktop until you finished a chapter, the graphics are super smooth and close to the origin of the IP and the music and VOs are top notch.If you liked Walking Dead but don´t want to be uber-depressed after a game and always wanted to be a wolf detective in human shape: Go for it!

												A truly fantastic experience unlike any other I have seen in a computer game. The storyline is honestly one of the best I have ever read/seen in any form of storytelling. Disguised as human beings, fairytale characters, referred to as 'Fables', live among us in New York City in the mid 1980's. Scraping to get by, these characters live in a world in which even their own government is unable to help them. The underworld of Fabletown seeks to take advantage of these innocent characters and it is up to Sheriff Bigby Wolf (known more famously as the Big Bad Wolf) to keep these characters safe. When the decapitated head of a Fable is found out the front of Bigby's apartment, a murder investigation begins that sees the player delving deeper and deeper into the world and sufferings of Fabletown.By Telltale Games, The Wolf Among Us is an 80's noir-murder mystery adventure game. More like an interactive movie than a computer game, the player takes on the role of the impatient Sheriff, discovering clues as well as questioning/interrogating characters to discover the killer of the murdered Fable. You decide how Bigby will respond when characters such as Snow White and Bloody Mary talk to him. These decisions have an effect on how the story plays out. Some effect your relationships with characters and some alter the overall story. This game perfectly contrasts the seemingly innocent fairytale stories that we all know and love, and places the characters from them in a truly dark, gritty, seedy and violent world. Telltale have created something that I am truly enthralled with. I think about this story and this world all the time, constantly wanting to know more about it. The writing of this game, as well as the dialogue is so damn good, I can think only of using the word 'professional' to describe it. The voice acting is flawless and incredibly powerful and the characters are extremely layered, believable and despite being Fables, suffer from real human problems that the player can relate to. Combined with a synthesized and memorable soundtrack that PERFECTLY creates the feeling of an 80's noir film, this game is nothing short of the word fantastic.Overall, The Wolf Among Us delivers in every way. Easily one of the coolest games I have ever played, with the Bigby character easily one of the most interesting/badass characters I have ever seen. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. I give this game a solid 9 out of 10.			"

Engaging story, beautiful artwork and interesting game style. It's like an interactive T.V show and now that it's over, I'm wishing there was another season available. Seriously. You can't do me like that!The basic storyline is about fairy tale characters and what would happen if they had to integrate with the real world. Their lives aren't as Glamour’d or as they once were and the characters try their best to change that. Your choices impact the game and the characters opinions of you! Very neat and lots of room for replayability. Only one con. . . now I have to buy all the comics. My wallet is going to hate me "

												The story is very nice, the beginning is a bit boring, but the things get interesting every chapter, and as I didn't read the wolf among us comics the plot seemed to me as fresh and nice, also the design is great, they found the style =) But, (this actually goes to all Telltale games, I do not understand why they write the disclaimer at the start, that your actions are meaning anything for the plot) the line of events is straaaight, you decide nothing, make no actual decisions. Its just a nice tv show format, genre they ""invented"" not a game in common way. So you are just a spectator to be true. And I'm thinking that they really should change game designer but promote a writer and director, cause the ""gaining control"" moments are just as they always are, as in Walking Dead were, and as in Game of Thrones are =( But, nevertheless I like interesting stories, so I give thumbs up.

												I am sure at this point you are really suspicious from any and all ""player choices"" in story-driven games, especially with things from Bioware ( SWtOR, Mass Effect ) and possibly Black Noire where if you make the most hatefull comment towards this 1 goon you do not like in the end the game will still ""force"" you to behave like best buds because the game needs to continue in some fashion, right ?Now I will not say that this game does not share any of those caracteristics, but it seems to have its stuff sorted out way better than any games I have played thusfar. I do not expect for Mr Toad to ever get his Glamour on depending on your choices or anything, but things like that do however ""feel"" right since Mr Toad is one of those guys you will just love to hate for his scumbag behaviour. Ofcourse you are playing as Bigby, the big bad wolf, so creating a story that really feels more interactive is probably way easier than lets say, for a blank slate. And I say they really pulled it off well.In short, ever fancied reading an interactive book while lounging back in your chair with your hands on the WADS keys and your mouse ? Pick this thing up. I played though the game once and used a guide to collect the missing ""collectables"" and I got 16 hours out of it. Now I know I picked it up at a Steam Sale ( Summer 2014 ) but if I knew I would have gotten this much fun out of it I would just have paid the (*checks current price*) 22.99 Euro's for it.Then again if you are not sure if you would like the game that amount of pricing might scare you off. I know I was scared off by it, especially since I never heard of Fable. Same thing with The Walking Dead, and do I really want to go Back to the Future ? If they are even remotely similar by looks and voice and general aestetics I can vouch for them, but since I am not sure if I want to play their other titles I'd really like to at least taste the atmosphere of those games, perhaps a demo of 1-2 chapters ( 1/6th or 2/6th of an episode ) with all but the ""remain silent"" and the least picked option availible ? Cus I'd like to try it, but I am not going to pay 22.99 Euro's just to get my feet wet and decide that the pool has too much clorine in it for my taste			"

												Lately I have been very impressed with Telltales works.The first season of their 'The Walking Dead' series successfully made me care for the characters and story, in such a way that I don't think that anything felt particularly forced. Of cause it has it's own share of convenience, as often seen in TV series following the same sort of formula. The way they force players to quickly take decisions, both in dialog and action sequences keeps the flow going though, even in the very few areas of 'filler'.Moving on to 'The Wolf Among us'!I were not aware of the graphic novel before I saw this game on the Steam store page, but I got hooked right from the start.The graphic style, which worked very well in 'The Walking Dead', has been improved here with a deep ink-y feel. It's like a graphic novel in motion and the overall aesthetics do a very good job at setting the tone and the colors are very pleasing too.The gameplay is very simplistic, it is basically a modernized point and click adventure. I don't count that as a negative though. It isn't the same kind of, combine chewing gum with bottle cap, then interact with door to produce advancement in plot, point and click deal, but a more modernized version, focusing on plot and the pacing of gameplay (please, Monkey Island, I mean no offence, you are still very dear in my heart). You will go through slower parts were you investigate crime scenes and engage in chase & fight scenes alike. It all seems very well paced.I really don't know what more to say right now without spoiling it for you.TotalBiscuit has a very good video about this game, and I share a lot of his opinions.

It has a pretty cool art style. I liked the Telltale Walking Dead series a lot of well but I was less familiar with Fables, so it was a brand new story and universe. I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Walking Dead was also an original take on a series but it wasn't a whole new universe. The story is dark and has a lot of memorable characters. Good writing and voiceover.			"

The Wolf Among Us is based on the DC (Vertigo) comic series Fables. The plot involves fairy tale characters living in a modern day city. Your main character Bigby Wolf has to investigate a series of gruesome murders linking to someone targeting fairy tale creatures. What unfolds is a conspiracy that will shake the foundations of their world.I love TellTale Games! Therefore i might be biased. But in all honesty, this is a damn good game.The question is should you buy it? Well, it depends on what you are looking for in a game. I personally love games for their storylines and this game gets top marks for that. The film noir-esque atmosphere, the design and environments all work in the game's favor and build an atmosphere that really complements the game's story. But, the question still remains. What do you look for in a game.Gameplay comprises of Quick time events and some point and click style stuff. You pick dialogue choices which influence the story.For those of you familiar with TTG's formula, this is nothing new. For those of you who come in expecting puzzles, you will be disappointed.This is more akin to a çhoose your own adventure book' or an interactive movie than a classic point and click game. For me, that is not a problem. The story was epic and satisfying. The characters felt alive. The action sequences well paced and your decisions can have a real impact (even on the survival of some characters).Bottomline:If you are familiar with TTG's formula and like it, or if you are looking for a game with a good story or you are a fan of the original comic series, Get the gameHowever if you are looking for a puzzle laden point and click game than this is not what it is.The game has a fair bit of replayability, just to see what different outcomes you can get, which people you can save.My Recommendation: Buy it!

												Telltale has managed to catch lightning in a bottle with their episodic adventure game series and like Walking Dead before it, Wolf Among Us is an intensely engaging rollercoaster of an experience. While in Walking Dead you are often quite aware of the effects of your actions (even if the morally objectable actions have very good justifications to keeping you and the other survivors alive), in Wolf Among Us, you must weigh reputation against efficiency, protecting the few or the many, maintaining the status quo or ultimately tearing down a flawed but well-established system...and hurting all the people that entails. Your decisions are much more morally gray, much more difficult to predict the outcomes of. In this way, it can oftentimes be a much more intense experience than Walking Dead (which in itself was incredibly intense). There is no decision to be made about which one is better, of course. They are both amazing in very different ways. But if you enjoy the comic Fables, you will enjoy this. If you enjoy ""hidden world"" narratives of mythical creatures living among us, you will enjoy this. If you enjoy compelling narratives surrounding intensely enjoyable and fleshed-out characters, you will enjoy this. If you enjoy Telltale's way of telling a story through these sorts of games, you will enjoy this. If you enjoy turning into a giant f***ing wolf and ripping out some dude's juggular after he hassled you for three episodes...Well, you get the picture. There is a good chance that if you breathe and have functioning eyes, you will enjoy this.			"

												where do i start? the graphics have a unique noire kind of look, absolutely breathtaking story, and I love how telltale games made their games revolve around what choices you make. you play as Bigby Wolf (or the big bad wolf from the stories) as a detective in fabletown, a place where all fairy tale people fit in with the mundies (what the fables call humans) by using a potion made by witches called Glamour to make the inhuman look human. but this elixer is not free, it is very expensive. two members of fabletown were murdered and Bigby Wolf will do whatever it takes to solve his case and get justice to bring a little more peace to fabletown... This game is worth every penny and I am suprised that it isnt more... the whole game is emotional and twisted... As of the time I am writing this review, I just finished this game. it was honestly the best game I have played this year. I would rate it a 10 out of 10, more than that if I could...

Amazing story, graphics and design are just freaking awesome, and have the typical gameplay for telltale game, if you love the others games, you will love a lot this one. This game is based in the Fables storys we all known from our young times. You play as ""Big Bad wolf"" is the detetive short a say, and typical one, i mean looks awesome, cigarrete always, very straight guy and so on.

												A fantastic story, in a game that mix Heavy Rain with the Changelling RPG. It feels like a interactive novel, in witch most of your actions as a player are just choosing what to say, make decisions, follow one lead or the other. The combat also feels incredible, since it's highly cinematic, and plays with your sense of control over the game.The story is about Fabletown, a obscure neighbor in New York where characters from fable storys live now, after leaving the Homelands. But nothing is easy in the mundane world, so in the game most of the ""happy ever after"" never happened. Princes and princess got separeted, innocent girls from ancient tales hook for a living, and the Big Bad Wolf is the sheriff of the town.Now that all of the 5 chapters are out, it's really worthy buyng it, as there is no more waiting time for the next part to be produced. The final chapter is a special thing. All your actions, decisions, everything you said will have consequences when it comes down to the end.This is cinema, in a game language.			"

												I have to say I'm terribly pleased that Telltale Games have finally decided to compose an adventure set in this delightful universe, it must also be added that I greatly approve of the direction the company is heading. TWAU is a wonderful story that's both strangely comic and poignant; it's imbued with a sort of breezy, heart filled spirit which begins in episode one and endures throughout all the subsequent episodes. I also like that there are many ancillary characters who are unapologetic about their lack of conscience, and who don't seem to suffer in consequence. The inclusion of adult subtexts such as adultery and prostitution is a pleasant surprise to those who are unfamiliar with the comics. I've personally enjoyed the game and sincerely hope that Telltale Games continue with the franchise.9/10 "

												Much like The Walking Dead, ""The Wolf Among Us"" is based on a popular comic book series that uses many of the same features and art style. I'll be honest, I never completed TWD game, but I have a far greater urge to witness the next installment of this five part series. Once again, TellTale has gone for the interactive story style of ""gameplay"" and your choices affect the outcome. You ""play"" as Bigby Wolf(Big Bad Wolf) and attempt to solve a complex murder mystery. For a good two hours expect to mash the 'E' key repeatedly, and choose your words quickly yet carefully. If you enjoyed the ""Fable"" comics or looking for something similar to TWD, pick this up for $25. Though we all know how Steam is. You can always wait for a deal, or until all the episodes are released.			"

												Haven't reviewed this yet, eh? I best get started in light of the Summer Sale. The Wolf Among Us is another great from Telltale. It's so great in fact that it rivals their Walking Dead series and is actually quite better in a lot of ways. It takes the characters and setting from the graphic novels and really brings it all to life. So it's like this. Fairy tale creatures are living in modern day New York City. They use magical concealments called glamors to maintain human appearence. You play as Sheriff Bigby Wolf. Or as the fairy tale folk know him as, The Big Bad Wolf. You're familiar with many of the characters as you've heard about their stories before. But there's a darkness behind their backstory's and it's interesting to see how they cope with our world as they try to escape theirs. As you play you'll make tough choices, get into some crazy fights, and unravel a huge mystery. The game is short and sweet and totally worth any sale price. I highly recommend The Wolf Among Us. Especially if you enjoyed Telltales Walking Dead series.			"

												This game is fantastic, draws you right in and you don't stop until it's finished. Amazing characters, voice acting and art. Could always play through more than once and watching others (Such as sips) play is still as captivating as the first play through. Highly recommend.			"

												A more polished installment from TellTale than the first season of The Walking Dead.  Each episode makes me want to play more and find all the Book of Fables entries.			"

												Wolf is another iteration of the Telltale Games studio that is more like a cirtual story, where you have some choices. It takes place in the tough world of Fables based on a DC/Vertigo comic book series. It's mature and captivating. The heroes in the series face unique challanges every day and the main character is a very likeable character, even though apparently everyone hates/ fears him. I can't wait how the series will end and I also hope that Telltale will continue to produce games in this world. I really love the graphics as well having this comic book feeling. The colours and atmosphere is just amazing.			"

												T.W.A.U Is an amazingly deep and clever reimagining of various different Fairytale and nursery ryhme characters plots and settings compiled into a fantastically fun and well animated game. As The Fables comics are what this is based of, you can see why the unique and attractive comic book-esque graphics are used. All in all, a tense and thought provoking game about the phisolosphy of BEING a Fable,(Fairytale or nursery ryhme character living in modern day New York's ""Fable Town"")Plus also the game mechanic of the multi choice descisions allows for many playthroughs in different styles and ways!Totally recommended!

												I came into this not knowing anything about ""Fables"" or that it even existed. I simply bought this on the merit of The Walking Dead and I love the style and writing Telltale Games is going with. Let me say, that I am a bit blown-away with this game. The characters are so interesting with some excellent twists and turns in the story that is allowed because of the rich background of the game.My only gripe is that the last two episodes are considerably shorter than Telltale has demonstrated with The Walking Dead. But that's my only gripe. The writing is great and how seedy the game is with its story model really comes home scene after scene.It's also refreshing that you are actually making a difference in the order you decide to do things. You can save people by going one direction vs the other or you can miss clues by going to the wrong location.Great game. Get it.			"

												The Wolf Among Us has had a strong first two episodes. While not emotionally draining like The Walking Dead, it is just as well written. The characters are fully fleshed out and well acted. The user interface has been streamlined from The Walking Dead's so that you have actual dialogue boxes to select and various actions to click without needing the scroll wheel or number keys. I highly recommend this to those that liked The Walking Dead.			"

												Based on the Fable comics, play as Bigby Wolf. AKA the Big Bad Wolf in the Bronx.There's a Serial Killer in the midst and you as the great sheriff of Fable town must decide what leads to follow, and potentially who lives and dies. . .			"
