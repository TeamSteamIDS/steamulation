												I am neither a big LEGO fan nor a big LOTR fan (I mean, I have seen the movies, but that is the extent of my interest in LOTR). But this game is super beautiful, the game mechanics are easy to grasp, and puzzles while somewhat challenging at times, never held me up for more than a minute or two. The devs has done well to find a way to nearly-constantly trigger my brain's pleasure center (with rewards, sounds, and visuals) that I don't tire of playing it. I can safely recommend this title to gamers of all ages and skill-levels. :) Buy with impunity!			"

												This to me was a departure from the slightly old feeling formula of the past games and an attempt to do some new things. I think this game is definitely a fun game even if there are annoyances to be found.The game uses audio from the movies, which is good and bad for me. The audio is well done and as always it is nice to hear those familiar voices, but it does kill the humor and creativity of a lot of the cutscenes. I wish they had went back to no audio for the voices.The character wheel in game is useful but can definitely be cumbersome as it becomes an extra step in getting to the full roster, which when you have a lot of characters of when free roaming is very important.The questing is crap to me. Making me go back again to other levels and get items is not fun, it is boring. This is a feature I think was fixed well in more recent Lego outings.The mythril equipment was very good and I think brought creativity to the game, especially with the musical shoes and the Disco Phial.Combat was so so, I actully thought fighting would be improved for a game like this but it was the same.Level design was done well and I think encapsulated those scenes very well. If not for the many game breaking glitches and the ability to somehow get 1 or 2 extra minikits or items over the limit effectively keeping you from reaching 100%.Overall I would recommend this game with a 7.5 / 10. The newer games have improved this formula but this one is left in that time between old and new.			"

												Though it might seem to dismiss all the hardwork of the developers who make them, when I play a Lego game I’m not expecting to be so much impressed or surprised as I’m looking for a particular sort of fix. Over the years developer Traveller’s Tales has refined a very particular mold with which they create each Lego game, perhaps changing a few things here and there to fit a particular license, but largely sticking to now ubiquitous design principles that have shown themselves to be resilient and endlessly applying to practically any franchise.And honestly I’m pretty alright with that. To me, Lego games are a bit of a gaming standby, something you reach for when you want a familiar, easily enjoyed experience kept fresh by whatever new skin has been fitted on it. It’s one of a few series I’m largely content remaining as it is, and from what I can tell that’s a sentiment shared by most people who play Lego games.In a lot of ways then Lego Lord of the Rings is what I expected and wanted it to be. It transforms a franchise I’ve a great fondness for into adorable bricks, giving me a world to run around and destroy (to then build up again), while getting to revive three movies I know by heart in a new way. The addition of voice acting surprised me in how quickly I grew used to it and valued its inclusion, something I was concerned about prior to playing but found helped in retelling a rather complicated story that grunts and chuckles would have had difficulty in doing. In its levels Lego Lord of the Rings is mostly indistinguishable from any other Lego game, and as such occupies a space that you likely already know if you want to take part in.The bad news is the outside of these levels, Traveller’s Tales has made some less than desirable changes to the formula. At first it was a welcome refreshment to the series, adopting a more traditional RPG design with a sizable open world, quests given out by NPCs, minimal crafting, and an equipment system that does away with removes the need for specific character skills. The more I played around in this system though the more I became bored and frustrated at its simplicity and tediousness.While there’s a definite largeness to Lego Lord of the Rings’ world, much of it is empty and bland. The sparseness of locations and characters within this environment creates a feeling that there’s less here than there actually is. There is a huge amount of stuff to do and collect in Lego Lord of the Rings but getting to it took me through such a dull vacuum of space that eventually I couldn’t bring myself to be bothered. Lego games have traditionally been exceptionally adept at making me want to seek out absolutely everything that’s been packed inside them, but here it was only ever more dots on my map and the area stretching between them.With the lack of vehicles (even horses are difficult to come across) or flying characters, the size of Lego Lord of the Rings’ world became a huge detriment to me wanting to continue playing it. The vague questing system made things worse by making it difficult to even know what direction I should be heading in. When I began to spend hours running around finding nothing and coming away having barely moved the progress bar, my enthusiasm with continuing the collectathon dissipated and the overwhelming number of things still left to find weighed down on me enough to ensure I had no desire to go back.I don’t wish to imply that Lego Lord of the Rings is a bad game, and if you’re the sort of player who only cares about the critical path then it’s as recommendable as any Lego game. The problem is the portion I’ve always considered the core of a Lego game - the scouring of levels for every last doodad and thingamabob to arrive at that satisfying 100% - was insufferably tedious and drawn out. With the ridiculous number of other superior Lego games to choose from, Lego Lord of the Rings feels like a tough sell, even as a huge fan of the source material. I admire Travellor’s Tales willingness to try new ideas with the game, but in this case it amounts to more of an example of how strong the Lego formula already is and that tampering with it isn’t nearly as foolproof.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Of all lego games, this is the best one. Really fun and exiting, you can spend dozins of hours playing this and new things still happen. Simply very awesome game with the real voices from the real actors. You can experience all the awesome battles not just watch a cutscene of them. For an example the battle with the Balrog of Morgof :D You acually play the part where you fall down with the Balrog. And besides the real levels you can do quests, find secret places, do a bonus level, craft funny hats, weapons and more, you can gain money to buy all the awesome characters, red bricks, and so on. Don't compare this Lego game with another Lego game, because this is totally diffrent, in a very good way. Would absolutely recommend this for anyone. This game, is worth every single penny. 100/10			"

												Lego LOTR - it was genius idea to implement, but does the game lives up to its expectations? In general yes, however there are some flaws. The strongest thing imo in the game is the sandbox mini-middle earth, player can roam through all locations known, from movies, and books. There is plenty characters to unlock even Tom Bombadil who was cut out from the story in the movie! Nice and new feature is the forge which allows player to forge special items. Those items can grant abilities of some characters to every character in the game, even those created by player. Game has quite modern graphics, but not as good as hobbit, yet still very eye candy. The music is taken from the move, and it never gets old, so I'd say it was good decision to use original music from movie trilogy. Despite game is really enjoyable it has few cons. There is a bit less humor in the game than in previous lego games. I think that the original voice lines from movie don't fit lego characters to well, it breaks the humor, and makes the game little less understandable for children. Lego games are targeted for children and families so I'd say its a con. The game has a huge amount of collectibles to unlock, therefore its is very glitchy and in most cases player usually stucks in the game progression in about 98%, because the couple last collectibles were not counted, or some level got bugged and is showing 0/3 collected items despite all of them were found, and player has them in inventory. Another annoying glitch is that sometimes player model is falling under the ground just after it was spawned, and keeps falling for eternity. I rode that console version was patched, however no one fixed PC version :(. There is few codes that player can use to unlock everything so if somebody got stuck in 98-99% of the game due to glitch he can use them but again it doesn't help with ever glitch. As far as the main story goes everything is usually fine, but when player wants to get maximum from the game it turns out to have few game breaking bugs.Taking into consideration all aforementioned arguments I would recommend the game for every lotr and lego fan, however some players that love to unlock everything in lego games might get vastly disappointed once their game is stuck at 98 %, after countless hours of playing in order to unlock everything, and the ""cheat fix"" is not satisfying solution. Still the game is worth to play and it brings much fun, just don't try to finish the game in 100%, and you wont face any disappointment.			"

												Matching the intensity of Peter Jackson's iconic films, while staying true to the Lego based games with it's sense of humor and cooperative gameplay, Lego Lord of the rings shouldn't dissappoint fans of both the Lego brand and The Lord of the Rings franchise.Best part about it all: The original cast from the films play as their characters. :D			"

												This was a pretty stellar game. I have played this off and on over the last couple years, lol....but that is no indictment on the game. Actually, my interest in both the topic and the LEGO aspect kept bringing me back, even though my gamer ADD often took hold. The humor added to a mostly dark adventure was perfect, and as somebody who knows the LOTR inside and out, I really appreciated all the subtle jokes and such. Often, they really said what a lot of fans were thinking. The gameplay itself is fairly standard LEGO game fare. Engaging and simple enough that anybody can pick up this game and play it through to its conclusion. I also like how they broke the game up into three books with credits at the end of each. That was appropriate IMO.The extras such as free roam and so on all are also what you would expect and could literally add countless hours to your game. My only complaint is that a played a couple chapters offline, and the game never synced those trophies afterwards, so it is kind of odd seeing my completion without some of the end of chapter achievements (like the Weathertop one for example).All in all, I would consider this a must own for LOTR and/or LEGO game fans. Very well done. Let's see, 16 rings of power out of 19 possible with one ring to rule them all.			"

												I'm very mixed on this one. On the one hand, its a charming and often funny adventure where you re-enact LOTR... with legos! I'd never played one of these lego games before, so I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a fun game with plenty of content taking a serious storyline and making it goofy as well....And yet this game frustrated me. Alot. For one, it's a terrible console port. There's no mouse support, so you have to do everything with the keyboard. I did manage to get through this, but it makes playing a little awkward. Worse for me is the platforming parts, where you have to jump around to reach hidden areas or to progress further in the levels. Trouble is the camera can be annoying with this, and it is far too easy to fall off ledges or into water, and then have to try again and again. I got seriously frustrated at a few parts, though ultimately I made it through. I'd call the platforming the worst part of this game.So it's a fun game with some frustrating elements. This is one of those cases where a ""maybe"" recommendation would be ideal, but ultimately I'll lean towards ""yes"" on this one because the good bits outweigh the frustrating bits. Have fun! :)			"

												Take the characters, plot, world building and lore of The Lord of The Rings, add goofy humor and collect a ton platforming game play and you have this awesome game.This game really surprised me. The voice over and soundtrack are the same used in the movie trilogy. The're impeccable. The graphics are really nice. The characters models are, well legos. They are nice and all, but what robs the spotlight are the environments and the various middle-earth places and structures they created. Everything is very well done and you can recognize all of the places show in the movies.The game if filled with eater eggs. The majority of them form the movies, but some from the books too. This combined with the goofy humor really adds to the experience.Game play wise, the game is a collect a ton platformer that made me remember the good days of N64 and PS1 (Banjo-Kazooie , Crash, Donkey Kong, Spyro) with some basic rack and slash and puzzling. It's fun, but it hardly presents any challenge.My only criticism about the game are some 2 or 3 buggy platforming sections that were really annoying. In the end, it's a really nice game, and a great experience for Tolkien fans.			"

												The Lego games are the only games my wife will play with me, which is understandable.  So, suffice it to say that we have a lot of Lego games.  LLotR is not a bad addition to the franchise.  It's fun, they've added a lot of new functionality to the gameplay and it's a Lego game.  We both like the game quite a bit.  The one thing we do both agree on, however, is that the actual movie voice acting is weird at best.  We enjoyed all of the previous Lego games because the characters only grunted and made noises while explaining the plot.  This added quite a bit of humor and fun to the games as you would have to think about what they were basically acting out for you.  Now with the actual voice acting, the games sort of lose that playful sort of feeling.  Regardless, the game is fun, but I would still take many of the last Lego games over this one.			"

												I'll write a full review later. For now, all you need to know is this:My nominee (and should be yours too) for Steam Awards: Best Use of a Farm Animal. Seriously. The sheep in this game are small, but can destroy plants, rocks, and all manner of things simply by hitting them with their hooves of iron. Sauron riding around Middle-Earth on the Cute Little Sheep of Doom might be the single best thing in this game.EDIT: Finally got around to writing the full review!Quick version: Good for fans of both LOTR and LEGOgames. If you're a fan of the LEGO games but not LOTR, however, you might want to skip this one.Long version: Honestly, gameplay-wise, this is definitely the worst of the LEGO games I've played (it's also the most recently released, hmm). A large part of my problem with it is the boss fights and other special sequences are BO--RING. They weren't that great in the other games, but almost every boss fight in this game consists of ""Dodge the boss's very easy-to-dodge attacks for a while until he gets tired, and then knock one heart off. Repeat."" I cannot stress enough how un-fun of a mechanic this is. Other more interesting scenes are accomplished simply by hitting the ""Special"" key a bunch of times and watching a scene unfold itself. Another really annoying bit is the fact that certain parts of levels (especially the more cinematic parts) require you to play as specific characters, IN FREE PLAY MODE, which goes against the entire spirit of Free Play.Thanks to weird camera stuff and gameplay mechanics, some of the little challenges in the Middle-Earth hub world are also unreasonably hard. In places where in older games you could hold down the ""Special"" key to have somebody perform an action, you now have to repeated press the key or else have to start the action over. They ruined the character customizer (although that's not new to this game). Adding voice acting makes the cutscenes take too long and really diminishes the delightful silliness that characterized the older LEGO games, making the cutscenes rather more boring. The distribution of abilities among characters is not very good - way too many characters without any sort of special ability while Sam can do almost everything naturally. Too many times in-level where you have to sit still and watch stuff happen. Blacksmith process takes too long to forge stuff. Save statues would be lovely if they worked properly, but they can bug up certain aspects if used in Free Play. No other playable characters wandering the hub (admittedly, it's getting to petty quibbles at this point, so I'll stop.)All of this totals up to an experience that is inferior to that of the other LEGO games, and makes this game not a great buy, IMO, for non-LOTR fans.However.This game is recommended for a reason. If you like LOTR like I do, then the game's fun value goes up dramatically. Probably almost half of the fun I've had with this game has come from the fact that it IS LOTR. Getting to play as all of the different characters, in all the different locations, is fun - and they even throw in characters from the books but not the movies - diehard fans will be pleased to see names such as Radagast the Brown and Tom Bombadil. And the game does do a pretty good job of incorporating a bunch of cool scenes into the levels. My first playthrough, I'd keep having moments where I would think, ""Wow, they put this in the game, too? Cool!"" Stuff like the Gandalf-Balrog fight while falling down the pit in Moria, or climbing around on oliphaunts, might get boring on a replay, but it's really really cool the first time.While kind of silly in a way that I don't like, the treasure item system also lends itself well to good-silly fun with the characters, like Faramir running around in the purple gardeny sunhat or Tom Bombadil fighting with his fancy umbrella. And while the big Middle-Earth hub world isn't so great from a gameplay perspective, it is really cool to run around and offers some other fun stuff to do (climbing all the way up Orthanc, anybody?)So while this game is inferior to the other LEGO games, LOTR fans will find that the fun to be had from that aspect of the game makes up for it.

												'One does not simply walk into Mordor'- BoromirWould anyone like to take a guess at what I just did?So, here I am, Dayvis2, reviewing this game that I purchased from Steam about a month or two ago while it was on sale for £3.74, which, seeing as the story alone has given me 12 1/2 hours of fun gameplay, is a freaking bargain! Anyway, here's my review.PLOTThe story follows the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, using cutscenes with sound clips from the films and levels with some brilliant gameplay. There are 18 action-packed levels to play, each about 25-45 minutes depending  on how much time you like to spend fighting, collecting etc. GAMEPLAYYou can play as loads of different characters from Frodo to Tom Bombadil to an Orc. In the levels, it's obvious that there are some new features, such as Ring Mode, where you can enter the wraith world and discover new objects that only ring-bearers can make, along with horse rides including the frankly epic Ride of the Rohirrim in Return of the King. There are cooking puzzles that require collecting of items that are then put in a pan, and the ability to use the Palantir in both Film 2 and 3 in order to travel between Frodo and Sam's and Aragorn Gimli and Legolas's stories. There is also the Eye of Sauron to look out for when you finish Fellowship, because its sight will cover areas, blocking access until you play a certain level, after which the eye will shift to a different area. This is so you don't just play all of Frodo and Sam's journey and none of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas's journey.OPEN-WORLDOne of the best bits is the Open World, a complete map of all the areas explored in the story. You can visit the stone trolls in the Trollshaws, sail down the Great River and then past the Argonath, walk into Mordor, complete quests, forge items and collect gold and red bricks. Areas you can explore include: Hobbiton, Bree, Weathertop, Trollshaws, Rivendell, The Misty Mountains, outside of Moria, Lothlorien, The Great River, Amon Hem, Fangorn Forest, Rohan, Isengard, Helm's Deep, Edoras, Dunharrow, Minas Tirith, Emyn Muil, The Dead Marshes, Ogsgilliath, Minas Morgul, The Stairs, Shelob's Lair, Cirith Ugnol, The Black Gate and Mordor! You'll be able to switch the world from day to night and back again when you've completed the story, and inbetween levels you'll be journeying through the land. I must say that I prefer some aspects of the Hobbit world more than this one (see my LEGO Hobbit review for more detail) because of Eagle travel and the different locations, but that's just my opinion.GRAPHICSGraphics are pretty good even with the medium settings I had to use on my seemingly ancient computer.OTHERThe game doesn't feel rushed, but some levels, such as the Caradhras level, do feel a little stretched out. I particularly like the main menu screen that has four different versions, one with a map of Middle-Earth for the very first one, another with Hobbiton for Fellowship, one with the alignment of Isengard and Bardadur for Two Towers and Baradur with Mordor for Return.CONCLUSIONThis is a great game that feels like an epic bargain if you get it on sale. The LEGO games do go on sale often, so try and grab this one quickly if you see it on sale! Still worth the money at the usual price, too though. All in all 9/10.			"

												Very fun game, follows the storyline from The Lord Of The Rings films accurately, a lot of the cutscenes are also exactly the same as the films, but with a bit of added humour (the bit where the Nazgul had the surfboard had me rolling). The open world is incredible, it's a scaled-down version of Middle-Earth which you can roam around when you're not playing story levels, fetching items and finding collectibles. Excellent game overall.			"

												I grew up with Lego as being one of the most constructive toys and am quite fond of it today. This time, Lord of the Rings gets a Lego make-over, turning the trilogy into a funny, silly, doofy adventure to destroy the One ring. You have the same vibe and feel as with other Lego games and the adaptation to the trilogy succeeds on a very comical level.+ Fun, interactive, lego-made Middle Earth to explore+ Many characters, unlockables, achievements+ Puzzle-solving and fighting in a LEGO world+ Well defined LOTR details+ Local Co-Op- Gameplay might seem repetitive- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)Personal Ranking: 7/10 "

												As far as LEGO games go, this game is definitely... well, a LEGO game.What I mean by this is that if you have ever played a LEGO game in your life then you already know everything there is to know mechanically about this game. In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard Harry Potter fan would tell you that the Harry Potter LEGO Games are the best.Overall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the ""latest and greatest"". Buy a flavor you love, and I promise you won't be disappointed :)			"

 LEGO The Lord of the Rings  It is a very pleasant and humorous production modeled on the novel maded by Tolkien. In the game, we gonna play as the famous characters like Frodo, Aragorn or Legolas with its familiar plot from books or movies. No need to write much because the game is worth the time and money. The only thing that is made really bad are those side-missions, repetitive and boring. I had a lot of fun while playing and collecting everything on 100%. I recommend this title to anyone no matter their age, and those who like to do the game on 100% cause its not that hard.  "

												I've played many LEGO Games (Star Wars 1+2, Indie 1+2, Potter). This is my first one where the LEGO figures speak. Quite a change. It is nice and a little sad: The game cites many sentences of the motion picture and yet you do not have the original voices all of the time - it's kind of confusing. Nevertheless it uses very often the original voice acting from the movie. The combination works well. So play it in English for the original voices. The German edition has only new voices, no archive material from the dubbed films. That works also, but you do not get the complete LEGO movie feeling. The strong points are the new dialogues that wrap the story up and introduce minor changes from the original.The game is fun to play - especially in local coop, but it is not very different from any other LEGO game. Just another franchise with new minifigures and new funny videos. If you just don't have enough you might buy this one. The textures of not LEGO specific things look quite aweful. They should get better game by game and not keep the graphics from 2004...			"

												I'm voting this not recommended, but only just.On the gameplay side of things, it's mostly great. Plenty of things to do, great humor, LotR. However, there are a few headaches. Here's my list of cons for gameplay:*Planks. Why do these feel so difficult to move onto?*Inventory. So cumbersome. I don't see why we can't use the radial menu for mithril items.*Character swap. Sometimes you'll get stuck swapping between your player 1 and 2 characters. Other times you'll swap to your 2nd character who will then swap to the character you wanted. Both can result in losing your spot on a ledge. Then other times you'll have to loop through them for a long while to find the one you need or to open the giant menu of them.*AI. You're ally will often get stuck, keep dying, or expect you to hold their hand.*Custom character creation. Terribly limited in a number of ways. Only a few hairstyles, only a couple types of weapons, must have a cape, no extra abilities, can't have a female voice.Here's a list of cons for the technical side:*Crashes. Only had a handful of these, but it still set back progress.*Graphic errors. This only appeared in a certain puzzle room in Cirith Ungol, but caused me to believe my graphics card was dying.			"

												This game is chill af. The puzzles are pleasurable and do not feel dumbed-down for kids because some of them can be quite tricky, especially in Free Play where you will have to utilize abilities of all characters in solving intriguing puzzles. I found jumping puzzles the most challenging. The camera in this game is quite clunky plus the horrible character changing mechanism making the game a bit frustrating at some points. The camera can be panned but I found the lack of mouse support a bit annoying. The cutscenes now have voiceovers taken directly from the films, which may seem strange at first, given that previous LEGO games were silent, but it makes the scenes more memorable. The slapstick humour is of very high quality, as is usual in Traveller's Tales' games. Even the scenes from the films that always made me cry obviously made me laugh. Howard Shore's soundtrack is very well edited into this game and is playing non-stop in the background making everything more epic/enjoyable. I only didn't like that they changed the iconic music playing during the ride of the Rohirrim, the last march of the Ents and the Gandalf's Eagles rescue at the end of all things. (would cry again)8/10			"

												At this point, Travelers Tales has pretty much mastered the art of making a LEGO game. I really enjoyed LEGO Batman 2, but the open world was tons more fun to explore than the actual levels, which were ""okay"" at worst and ""really fun"" at best. LOTR gets the balance between story levels and open world exploration perfectly. The campaign is awesome and I played the whole thing with my 5-year-old son. Once the story is complete, there is a staggering amount of content to collect. Not to mention that the game looks shockingly good for a ""kiddie"" game. If you like LOTR at all, get this game. At $15 (50% off) this game is a steal. Precious!			"

												As much as I enjoyed this game, not only due to the Lord of the Rings Asthetic, but also because I quite like the LEGO games, this game had me more frustrated than anything. I enjoyed the initial playthrough, but several elements of the game, all after the Story mode, were highly irritating.I can recall 2 particular points during my attempts to collect the Mithril Bricks on the overworld, where the ""Parcour"" was completely glitched and faulty, leading me to several moments of raging. And I almost never rage during games.Because of this, amngst a few other smaller issues, I cannot give this game more than 7/10. Its a very good LEGO game, but lack of smaller bug fixes, which have been continously commented on by the community, means that it would be unfair to give this game a higher grade.TL;DR7/10Good Game, some annoying bugs that make 100% a real ♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Lego: Lord of the Rings is a wonderful, delightful little platformer, that doesn't disappoint. It is invariably plagued by all the usual issues of platformers, such as awkward camera angles, devolution of play style into repetitive button sequences towards endgame and iterative puzzles. Yet for all that it is entertaining to play, for any fan of the series (LotR or Lego). Telltale Games manage to make the game humorous, which is where its lasting appeal will lie. From ridiculous gags, such as carrot arrows stuck through Pippin's head and the inclusion of most of the comic relief scenes from Jackson's films, the game will at some point have you chuckling and deliberately rewatching some little humorous cutscene.The game is also fairly extensive with lots to do, and may require multiple playthroughs to see everything and acquire all the items. There are lots of little secret areas tucked away to find, some of which are quite beautiful, even if rendered in lego blocks! It is this encouraging of exploration where the games longevity will predominantly lie, so in terms of time to money investment it is worthwhile, especially as it is relatively inexpensive now.			"

												I've been replaying this game again after going through all the Lego Harry Potter and Batman games and I have to say, Lord of the Rings is far better. Despite the material, the jokes never feel out of place unlike the latter harry potter games and it feels very epic in that battle scenes despite, at the end of the day, yo're watching Lego bricks beat each other up. some of this could be from that fact they were allowed dialog and music from the movies.There are almost limitless fetch quests and characters to buy and obtain in the game. From famouse ones like Sauromon to lesser-known characters like Tom Bombidil. I have to admit I love playing this game over and over to uncover all the interesting secrets and crafting weapons as well as unlocking cheats to make it all the more easier.It's the best one Lego game I've played so far, but I still havn't played one or two of the newest ones yet.However, this game is very bugged and getting 100% is impossible unless it's fixed. most likly some community fix out there, but may affect achievements.

												I can't recommend it. It´s a nice typical Lego game and quite fun to play, but at the same time it's so glitchy and buggy.After beating the game (few crashes, stuck in the wall stuff), I wanted to collect all the stuff left. During ""Attack at Weathertop"" I had a game crash. After reloading and completing the level from the checkpoint (everything collected, treasures in pocket), I recognized that I still had 0/3 treasures. After a little research I know now that this is a glitch that can occur in any level. Playing through the level one more time didn't help. Now the level is bugged, I can't it complete it anymore (I still have the treasures but they don't count and I can't pick them up again...). I can't even reload an older save because there is only one save. Shouldn't have played the level from the checkpoint after it crashed. It's always fun if a game forces you to do research beforehand to avoid gamebreaking bugs that can ♥♥♥♥ up your savegame...			"

												""LEGO The Lord of the Rings"" is a game with a somewhat Open-World and is the game about Lotr, the world-wide famous book and movies. If you like LotR, this is definitely a game for you. It may not be very fun for you if you have not seen the movies or read the book, so I will recommend you to do that before playing this game. It is very funny and a bit challenging as some of the puzzles and ""quests"" needs fast reacting and it is not always that the camera is on your side :3 However, it is funny how the LEGO game about LotR is the best LotR. Buy this if you like LEGO games and want hours of fun (and if you have watched the movies, it is smart to do that before playing)!			"

Heart-felt fun as always, though a bit overstuffed with collectablesContains all the charm and fun Lego games are known for, and some surprisingly quality nods to Tolkien as well. An excellent choice for casual couch coop. A few areas feel lackluster (Minas Tirith being one room, for instance, and lacking any siege of Gondor level), but overall the world is well constructed and relaxing to gallop about.I'll say this though, the collectables are obnoxious and perhaps the numerical peak in the Lego series. Playing through the game you'll come across quite a few blocked off areas and currently indestructible bricks. At first this makes you eager to go back and satisfy that completionist urge, but the sheer number of them quickly becomes overwhelming. Unlike Lego Star Wars (where a thorough first try would net you the majority of a level's secrets), you'll probably have to play the same levels half a dozen times before being able to sit at a comfy 100%. But don't let that dissuade you from an otherwise enjoyable game! It's unadulterated Lego fun and a quality escape for a few lazy afternoons.			"

												LEGO: Lord of the Rings is one of the best games in the LEGO game series.Back when I was a le lad, I played LEGO: Star Wars the Video Game (Episode 1-3) on PS2 and then later on LEGO: Star Wars the Original Trilogy (Episode 4-6). I loved both of those games and continued onto other LEGO games when I got the Xbox 360.After all of my time with LEGO games, I decided that it was time to do some throwback and get a few games on my lovely PC. I was gifted this game from an awesome friend and bought the LEGO Batman Trilogy. I like this one the most out of the ones I have on Steam.Overall, I can rate this game a 8/10 simply because nothing can compare to the LEGO Star Wars games.			"

												Well... it's mostly like Lego Batman 2. Lego LOTR uses an open world as well and follows the story of Frodo and his companions in order to destroy the One Ring.Lego Batman 2 felt fresh because it didn't try to tell a story that had already been told. We all know the story of LOTR. We've all seen the movies by now, right ? While the gameplay is shallow but fun, it's nothing groundbreaking. And might I say I'm a big LOTR fan, so you can imagine my disappointment when I started playing this.The classic Lego humor is still there, but mostly subtle though. And the gameplay is solid as always. But since it's a retelling you kinda know what to expect, making the whole thing... less exciting. Yeah yeah, there's no other way to have created this game, I agree. But still...By the way, the low quality voice acting truly bothered me. It's like they ripped the sounds straight from a DVD or something.Lego LOTR shows us that not every tale can or should be made into a Lego game (Lego Avengers does look pretty cool, however...).For now, I think you're better off playing Lego Batman 2.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												Great game! The hub is fairly large, very accurate to the movies. During cutscenes, the characters talk using the original dialogue from the movies. There aren't horses to ride around in the hub, only at a certain point in the story, then they disappear. This game has many craftable items. Including a Mithril Disco Phial... it's so epic... ;) The game is well made and more serious than other LEGO games, which I like. Definetly worth getting, whether you're a LotR fan, LEGO games fan, or both. :)I wish it had more characters though... Maybe there will be more in the LEGO Hobbit video game...			"

												I've played a few Lego games. Harry Potter part I and II, lego star wars (complete edition) and clone wars, lego batman I and II (have the III), lego movie and lego superheroes (or something like that). So I'm not a newbie to Lego games. And yeah, I still love them to bits.Lego Lord of the Rings brings us the open world that I had seen previously in lego movie, lego harry potter and lego superheroes. Lego Star Wars has a somewhat open world, but not like this.Lego Lord of the Rings has one thing I did not like though. I like to be able to do missions and play with the charactes I've already unlocked in the free world. So I won't get tired of only doing story based missions. In Lego Lord of the Rings you can only play in the open world with the characters you have. For example, when I finish a mission with Legolas and Frodo I can only play with them until I do the next mission. Even if previously I was playing with Legolas, Frodo and Sam, if Sam for some reason disappears as that mission ends, I can't play with him. That annoyed me a little bit.It took me 9 hours to finish the missions (I did spend some time trying to get some bricks). Lego Lord of the Rings has the usual 10 minikits, has a ""blueprint"" that you must get in each mission and has 3 ""items"" you must also get in each mission. In the open world you can get bricks by completing races, getting to tricky places with some characters and do some quests for characters that you'll give you bricks or red bricks. The ""quests"" also exist in Lego Superheroes and somewhat in Lego Movie.Overall I liked this game like I do with every lego games. I wasn't too familiar with the story (I've seen one movie and am currently reading the books) and I liked it. I didn't think it had as much humour as the previous Lego games I've played but I did like it.And yeah, of course I'll buy another lego game when it is 4.99 again.			"

												Not recommended because of the missing mouse support and a bunch of bugs. Also this game crashes everytime for no reason. After one hour I playtime I was barely able to finish the first level since it crashed the 5 first times I tried. It may be one of the best LEGO games, but it is not working for me. Maybe I'll give it another try one day, but you shouldn't unless you have fun risking money just to see if a game works properly. Everything I mentioned was reported in several forums with no real fix.			"

												Lego and Tt Games have done it again. they have made another wonderful fun and funny game based off a popular movie franchise. Now i'll be the first to say that i normally do not play movie tie in games. But with it being a Lego game that doesn't  really matter. And here is why:THE GOOD:Each film that the game is based on lasts only 6 levels each and is told from the major parts of the film.The characters are all voiced by the same actors from the films.Fun repeatitive gameplay. Not once did i ever get bored with the building.Classic Lego humor we all know and love.THE BAD:Control wise all u use is the keyboard and that's it. Now me i have no trouble using that. But if you dont want to invest into a PC controller ore hate using just the keyboard then this and all other  Lego games for the PC are not for you mainly cause they all use just the keyboard. "

												¿Quién lo diría? El mejor juego de LOTR hasta la fecha es éste, sin lugar a dudas. Recrea fielmente la Tierra Media, sin dejar pasar ningún detalle de las películas de la trilogía original, y con algunos guiños a otros libros de Tolkien, por ejemplo aparece Tom Bobadil como personaje jugable, entre otros. El humor made in LEGO está siempre presente en su forma más absurda, que usualmente logra sacar carcajadas, cosa que no me pasó con otros LEGO. Las voces son directamente sacadas de las películas, y la música es la misma de Howard Shore, así que 10 puntos en la banda sonora. El juego es casi tan épico como las películas y libros. El mundo es gigante, podés ir y volver a tu antojo, siendo un semi-sandbox, donde hay tanto misiones principales como secundarias, novedad en los juegos de LEGO. Está lleno de coleccionables, que para conseguir es obligatorio rejugarlo. Hay decenas y decenas de personajes y artefactos que hay que forjar con un herrero, gastando las escasas, en un primer gameplay, piezas de mithril. Para el que quiere sacar todo, cosa que un casual no lo va a hacer, va a tener que pasarse horas y horas jugando y rejugando este juegazo.			"

												A great conversion of the films. Hours and hours of fun to be had, this game eats up the hours once you get hooked in.Nice touches are the real voices/audio snippets from the film and also the usual funny bits and Easter eggs. (Watch for Peter Jackson defending Helms Deep by throwing Oscars at the Orcs)Only little grumble is there are a few glitches still in the game, sometimes characters get stuck in scenery and one glitch is preventing picking up a collectable (which is needed for a 100% game finish)In summary, great fun and highly addictive.

												I picked up this game on a whim some weeks ago when I saw it on sale and have absolutely no regrets.  37 hours of gameplay logged and over 90% of the way to completing every task/challenge the game has to offer.  Great casual game for getting comfy and relaxing or just blowing off some steam after a rough day in the salt mines.Pros-Charming sidescrolling and puzzle solving gameplay that takes a rather tongue-in-cheek approach to the films and has a few nods to the literature.-Easy to pick up and play.  Controller support is good and the content is suitable for all ages.-Very, very humorous.  I had to pause the game quite a few times so I could finish laughing.-Sizable overworld to explore.  Hobbiton is very charming.-Lots of puzzles and secrets to search for in both the overworld and through replaying levels in Free Play mode.-Useful treasures that emulate the abilities of other characters.Cons-Aiming can be slightly annoying at times with the bow when enemies or allies insist on standing in front of you.-Gandalf's block puzzles can be rather frustrating at times with how precise you have to be.-Camera can be a little wonky at times.-Gollum is downright infuriating with his voice during the Dead Marshes level.-Not a very difficult game, unless you plan to 100% it by finding all the secrets/treasures/quests/etc.  Then it becomes moderately challenging, but you're still not ever going to see a game over screen.  Like I said above, it's pretty casual.-No online co-op, only local.Overall, I'd say this is an 8/10 and a solid game to add to your collection whether you're a diehard LOTR fan or just someone who enjoyed the films.  TT Games definitely put a lot of thought into this and you can tell it was a labor of love from the end product.			"

												My experience with the Traveller's Tales series of Lego games has been rather sketchy. I initially played the Star Wars titles on the Nintendo DS. These were buggy affairs with many show stopping glitches. But over the years I've found they have honed the collect the pieces / puzzle game play to a solid dependable platform.The previous Lego game I played on PC was Lego Marvel Super Heroes, this was heralded as the high water mark of the recent titles. I have to say, I was I little underwhelmed by the game. Perhaps it was the franchise that didn't resonate with me. I'm not up to speed with all the comic book characters and their special abilities, so the puzzle solving wasn't very straight forward. Also the sheer size of the game left me feeling there was a lack of focus. 6 hours into Lord of the Rings, it's a totally different beast. I've found the story mode hugely enjoyable. All the puzzle elements have been tied nicely with what you'd expect from the roster of characters. Sneaking around is Bilbo domain, given he has the ability to become invisible.  Legolas uses his bow to fire at hard to reach targets. Gimli uses his axe to power smash rocks, to open up new paths.All these features are embellished with some very faithful cut scenes and environments, which directly channel the Peter Jackson movies. Voice work is directly taken from the original cast which adds an extra layer of authenticity.  Howard Shore's themes are uses to great effect and add yet more polish to the mix.Lego games are simple affairs. You know what you are getting when you boot them up. I've found Lord of the Rings to be a great pick up and play title, colourful, engaging and just pure fun. I'd recommend it heartily, to kids of all ages.			"

												Lord of the Rings gets the Lego treatment and while it doesn't have quite the same amount of humour as the Lego Star Wars game, it is still immensely enjoyable and absorbing. Initially it can be a bit overwhelming in terms of the amount that you can (and need) to do in the game, but once you realise that aside from the main plot you can do any of the additional tasks whenever you like and in any order, it stops feeling so overwhelming and becomes the highly enjoyable romp that all Lego games seem to be. Great stuff!			"

Follows the trilogy strongly.If you love adventure and fantasy setting, get it already!This game moves along the path of the movie, using it's visual design and audio andadds LEGO's humor. The sheer amount of stuff to do, replayability and unlockable items/characters is staggering.Perfect 5/7P.S. If you have a chance, play with a buddy.

												Lego Lord of the Rings is, guess what, yet another Lego 3d-platformer from Travellers Tales. What a punchline that was. Came out in 2012, after Lego Batman 2. It also was released for consoles Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. Oh, and had handheld version for NDS, 3DS and Vita, which is kinda somewhat different but same. Well, lesser versions.PC version doesn't have DLCs that consoles have. Those are three character packs and one tools/stuff pack. I doubt that they are important in Lego game, but it still means that PC version isn't the best one. At least be happy that they still support non-Xbox controllers. Oh, and be happy that they finally implented achievements for Steam.Technically, it shows that Travellers Tales kept spitting out Lego games pretty much every half/full year. People complain about crashes and bugs, like getting stuck in geometry. Personally I had a bug where I lost control over character aside from jumping when he tried to ride the Warg beast in one of the levels. Had to restart the level. Also had character to jump high into air, like when hobbit was cutting ropes over Gollum's hands. Or when riding the Ent, huge tree character. At least it wasn't anything progress halting.And hey, it's yet another Lego platformer. Punch stuff to collect studs. Lose studs by dieing, but never have game over. Have simplistic puzzles of using right character to do something. Collect everything you can!Also, second game that has actual talking character and kinda-free-roam between levels. Lego Batman 2 was the first. Though this one is the first licensed after movie, so have your copy-pasted voice talents. Oh well, having plot still makes it more fun for me. And levels themselves are nicely done that they aren't annoying. When not glitching.Well, you can also craft. And ""crafting"" just means another way-around of collecting. Collect recipe, collect mithrill bricks, choose to craft them. And there are quest-givers, which are fetch-quests, mostly involing the crafting. Oh, and developers figured out that since they have split-screen then you can separate characters into two different scenes for some solo actions. Back in previous games they always would have at least two character in same area, slightly altering scenario. Now at least two characters but they can be in two different areas.Open world portion also seem to be a bit nasty at times. Most often you are probably going to walk by foot and there is only one spot on a map that has blacksmith. Heck, when I set it destination, game for some reason decided to change path mid-way through and showed me the path to bonus level. When I checked this level and quit, I was sent back to where I starter: opposite side of map.Bah, should have checked forums to see how to fast-travel.And once you unlock free-play you will notice that sometimes it behaves against players. Like, you climbed this tall tower while AI kept standing on the ground. That AI is Frodo. On top of tower you noticed Campfire that you can light with Sam. And if you change your character to Sam, instead the AI will change character from Frodo to Sam since they are both hobbits and it will change control to this character. Or because both Frodo and Sam are short. So either reclimb the tower or do even more things of changing characters around, selecting different races.Not to say that there is no positive. Actually, there are a lot. It just that it's so formulic that I got tired of talking about same things all over again. Still fun to whack everything. And such. And collect everything.I will rather talk about things that really matter. Like, did you know that They Are Taking The Hobbits To Isengard? Whole 10 hours! You don't simply get tired of such classic YouTube video.But eh. Yet another Lego game. With free-roam and voices.			"

												LEGO Lord of the Rings is one of many great games LEGO and Traveler's Tales have made. The game is based off of the PG   13 movie, but LEGO still adds some lighthearted humour to this dark story. Some of the levels can be a little intense for younger ages, and some of them can be little complicated. Still, there's a lot to be enjoyed in this; whether it's exploring the expanse of Middle Earth, or playing on your favorite characters from the movie. This is a good game if you're looking for a more lightheated version of the Lord of the Rings.			"

												I love the films, and I loved this game! I've tried a few of the LEGO games in the past and none of them really kept me interested.  LOTR kept me hooked throughout the entire experiance. Lots of variety in the gameplay with tons of mini games and puzzles, none of them seemed repetative or following some kind of dull formula. They follow a pattern but its so intertwined in the story you don't even notice. Having all of the original audio from the film, including dialogue, was a HUGE plus for the gaming experiance. Especially with all the added jokes and gags, which none were rediculously cheezy, they were perfectly executed. I feel this game by far surpasses the original games on the PS2, or any of the other LOTR video games. Collecting everything was a ton of fun and the more I collected, the more addicted I got. Definitely worth it, even if you didn't enjoy the prior LEGO games, give this one a chance.			"

												Lego Lord of the Rings is, at its best, the Lord of the Rings game to rule all others. It has many characters to unlock and play as, many side-quests and places to explore, armor and weapons to make, fully-realized towns to explore, and a good campaign. It is extremely true to the original movies, and that is great. It also has the original, awesome music. At its worst, it is repetitive and slow, with tons of puzzles that you have to do to cover fifteen seconds of the movies. It is a great Lord of the Rings experience, but if you don't like puzzles or silliness, you could pass it up and watch the movies again instead.			"

												LEGO The Lord of the Rings is a fun and simple game which does not require a lot of skill.  You take charge of a party of protagonists and work your way through the Lord of the Rings plotline (in the style of Peter Jackson's movie trilogy).  Along the way you collect lego bits as a currency, smash enemies and objects that get in your way, and solve an occasional puzzle allow you to progress ahead.  There are a bunch of optional side quests which allow players to collect/craft various items and have some fun outside of the storyline.As one might expect from LEGO-branded games, this one seems fit for young or new video gamers who don't want too stressful a challenge.  The only penalty for dying is losing some of the bits you picked up on your current level.  The story follows Peter Jackson's depiction of Lord of the Rings, however it does take a little bit of creative liberty.  The end of Boromir, for example, is more comedy than tragedy, in the LEGO telling of the tale.  This is almost certainly a necessity when making an E-rated game out of a PG-13 rated movie.  The musical score, character voice clips, and scenery right out of the film trilogy really make you feel like you are playing through the films, and not some alternate rendition of Middle Earth.  Except, of course, when creative liberty was taken here and there to cause LEGO-appropriate silliness.			"

												An excellent addition to the collection of any LOTR or LEGO fan!  As it happens, I am a fan of both!  There were some mild annoyances with glitches I had in the game, but nothing that made it unplayable.  It took me about 50 hours of gameplay to collect all of the achievements, and I had fun doing so.  It follows the traditional gameplay of all LEGO games, and sticks to the storyline of the movies (No book additions, unfortunately!)  in a family friendly way.  In fact, there are several cutscenes that left me laughing for a few minutes! All in all, 10/10!			"

												Ever since the PS2/PSP age. Lego Star Wars, Batman, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter were my favorite growing up as a little kid.Even though most of the games had the same props just copied over and edited sometimes. It brings me back to my childhood of such a great franchise. Tons of replay value after the initial walkthrough, with free play and tons of canisters/rares to collect. I play these games to 100% perfect and regret nothing.Don't forget about the cheats, theyre so fun to mess around end game though.			"

												I just started playing lego games not to long ago, and damn i gotta say, this is a lot of fun. Lego lotr covers the whole story in just 18 missions or so, and i really think its well made. For the first time in history, you can explore the middle earth by yourself. The game is filled with great voice acting, cut scenes and gameplay. If you like lego games, youre going to like this game.I did encounter a graphical glitch in the first couple of missions or so, but after a restart or two i never met the glitch again.Great fun for both kids and grown ups!8/10			"

												Good casual game you can pick up after a long day at work. Like other users have mentioned, there are some new mechanics not seen in previous Lego games. There are alot of fetch quests but I didn't really mind them. Getting to 100% and unlocking all the achievements didn't take too long nor felt too grindy apart from the one where you had to amass 10 billion studs. Staying true to the Lego line of games, there are alot of comedic moments which add to the lightheartedness of the game.			"

												A good retelling of the story with just enough of the signature Lego humor to keep things fresh.The gameplay is similar to past Lego games: use characters with unique powers/items to solve puzzles, switching between characters as needed, and exploring both open world and linear areas to uncover all the unlockables and secrets.Having to play through every level again to uncover all the collectables can be more than a little tedious (some are poorly marked and/or easy to miss even with powerups that should direct you to them), so if you enjoy finding every thing you may want to check out a guide to ease the process.Another solid Lego game from Traveller's Tales.

												Ok let first start by saying this is a great non-violent game there is violence, but its lego's the fun toy for kids, as well as adults such as myself for having fun. Pros:- Great graphics most even older gaming laptops should run close if not max. desktop users well you should easily max out. Integrated chipsets for either desktops or laptops should do research before trying to run as with most games. - Really fun game and I have only been playing for just a few minutes, but I also used to play lego games back on Nintendo DS.- I really can't say anymore other than if you like Lego based video games this is a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000% must have if there is such a digit.Cons:- No Mouse Support you may need to take a few minutes to adjust the in game keyboard settings for better control. But is very possable that you may need to use both hands depending on how you set the control settings.  Meaning for people who may not understand what I am saying this game is keyboard only unless you use a gamepad.			"

												If you like Lord of the Rings and like Lego poking fun at it, definitely play it for the story. To get it 100%, there are a lot of issues though. Some bugs regarding the achievements and very very (very very very) frustrating controls make it hard to gather all the collectibles. Jumping and controlling the camera is really awkward, which can be frustrating at times, but when playing the story it is not as prevalent. So if you just want to play it for the story, go for it. If you want to finish it 100%, prepare for some frustration.			"

												I don't usually review games, but i think this time i'll make an exception.I really like lego games. they are funny, unique, and creative, and can provide immense fun and enjoyment for everyone.This one is no exception; in my opinion, the finest of all lego games.The game spans throughout the entire LotR trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King), using audio and music directly from it. and of course, it is Lego, and they put their own unique spin on it. of course, the game (And cut - scenes) can't afford to be as long, so the very main points are in the narrative, while adding some well - known Lego homour, and to my surprise, i found that i enjoyed it very much, in it's own way.If you love lego, or LotR in general, (or both - i know i do), you'll most likely enjoy it very much.However, I encourage you to play the Demo (can be downloaded from the LEGO site) or see game walkthroughs, to form your own opinion, before you decide to buy it. (Which is always wise before thinking of getting a game). And, maybe the game will get you liking one of them, or introduce you to, if you weren't already. I will admit and confess that this game was my introduction to Tolkien's world, when i got it when it was first released. My love of lego games did that. and i'm so glad i did.If you identify with the points noted above, do consider getting the game. it is also on sale now at a very low price, until February 12. ($5 i believe).You really have nothing to lose here, in my opinion. only to gain. at least, i know i did.I hope very much that my review helped you form an opinion on the game.If it did, i would very much like to hear it. *I want to note that i already own the game in it's PS3 version (got it when it was first released), and seeing as my favorite LEGO game is on sale, i decided to get the PC version, as well.

												LEGO games have stole my heart since the first installement of the game I ever played Pirates of the Caribean. This being said every game itself has some slight variations.The LOTR version has the comedic LEGO style of story telling with (some) original movie dialog. The first playthrough as story play with a secondary playthrough option as free play allowing you choose all the (unlocked) characters of the games. The LOTR version has a free roam world of Middle Earth. In the free roam you will be able to get additional characters and red blocks, while both free play and free roam will be needed to get all items and mithril blocks.If you played a LEGO game before and didnt enjoy it, I would skip the LOTR version as nothing is new or refreshing enough to change your mind. If you do enjoy LEGO games, you will find the same familiar, entertaining gameplay in LEGO LOTR.			"

												Wonderful game with both open word and instanced missions. Features many unique characters with different skills, cosmetic and ability items, some unique animations for some chars and many references. Many collectibles and some game changing optional features as reward for some quests. Very fun to play.The downside is the physics engine which have some collision issues, especially at higher resolution settings. This may cause some minor glitches like stuck character, weird movement behaviour on some terrains. ""It won't be that easy!"" achievement may be impossible to get at higher resolutions and a few end-mission minikits where you have to smash objets while running and only controlling your side movement can be harder than usual to get at higher resolutions. None of these are gamebreaking though. The bad controls/camera sinergy is another annoying downside. Both issues combined can make plataform jumping a nightmare.TL;DR:This could be a 8.5/10 recomended at full price game, but because of collision issues and bad controls;camera interaction, it is actually a 6.5/10 recommended on a large discount.

												This is one of the more fun LEGO games I've played. It follows the full LoTR story and has a large overworld where you can seamlessly walk from Hobbiton to Mordor. The missions are fun with a wide variety of abilities for different characters and the overworld is full of side things to do between missions. The entire cast of LoTR characters is here (even characters that were in the books that didn't make it into the movie) and the missions use voice clips from the movies so the characters aren't just grunting all the time.The game isn't perfect though. Unfortunately the LEGO games have earned a reputation of having a lot of bugs and glitches, and this game continues that trend. The character creator is also seriously lacking, there are hardly any parts to choose from and they are all generic so it's difficult to create anything interesting and the created characters don't have much in the way of special abilities.Despite the (relatively minor) shortcomings this game was a lot of fun to play and I can easily recommend it to any LEGO or LoTR fan.

												As my first Lego game, I chose this one because many people told me it was the best.  I was never really all that interested in the series, but I'm looking forward to playing some others after this one.Gameplay is typical Lego, using the abilities of various characters to solve puzzles and find collectibles while you progress through the story and explore the game world.  There are a ton of characters to collect as well, some I don't even remember from the books.  This one follows the Lord of the Rings movies, and the majority of the voice acting is taken directly from them so it is very high quality.  Cutscenes are thankfully skippable, especially considering you are forced to replay story missions in order to find all the collectibles.  If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this game.I personally found the humor pretty weak and often forced, though it is generally considered one of the high points of the series.  A few areas in the game really made me wish there was a way to summon a horse so I could move around faster.  There are a number of bugs and though most of them thankfully minor a few can be quite annoying.  One in particular makes a couple platforming puzzles in the game extremely difficult.  When juping across these platforms, the game  slows you down in the air so you don't jump too far and fall off.  Unfortunately in certain locations, it always slows you down too much, causing you to not jump far enough and fall no matter how far you actually try to jump.  This makes it extremely difficult to actually finish what should be trivial puzzles.  I have also heard reports of a bug preventing 100% completion though luckily I did not run into that one.For the technical aspect of the game, it runs mostly smoothly except when loading a new area in the overworld and is very stable; I only experienced one crash in my playthrough.  The graphics are nothing special but it's a Lego game, not Crysis.  The game does not have mouse support like all Lego games so I would highly recommend playing with a gamepad rather than the keyboard.I enjoyed this game a great deal, more than I thought I was going to.  I can definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Lego games or Lord of the Rings.My wishlist for future Lego games:- A minimap (I believe this was added in Lego The Hobbit)- Proper mouse support with free look- A way to move faster later in the game- The ability to skip in-game cutscenes in addition to cinematic cutscenes.  Blacksmithing is quite tedious in this one.- Better autotargeting.  This game likes to loose the target when you hit the button to act on it.			"

												After playing several other LEGO games, and appreciating the wit and humor they brought to some of my favorite stories, I was very excited at the prospect of LEGO LotR. Sadly, this game did not meet my expectations. The wit I had experienced in the other publications was nowhere to be found. Instead of a fun and different take, I recieved soundbytes ported directly over from the movies, and overly complicated, boring puzzles which did nothing to contribute meaningfully to the story.			"

												Okay, I love lego games, I love the collecting, the humour, the everything but this one is one to give a miss to.It's just buggy and glitchy and badly implemented. Prety much all the things that were design choices that impede your ability to play are fixed in The Hobbit lego game. Unfortunately I played that first so while if it had been the other way around I might have been ooohing over the delights of The Hobbit as it was LoTR felt like I was playing a badly broken beta of it.The control scheme has it's awful moments, suddenly forcing you into unhelpful fixed camera perspectives, making it excedingly difficult to tell exactly how you are positioned relative to other stuff, the targetting screws up regularly meaning you may fall through objects you are trying to grab or simply swing wildy at things you are trying to hit. The counters on missions glitch making it hard to tell whether you have collected everything. The levels themselves sometimes just plain break as trigger points fail to trigger and your progress is entirely stopped. NPCs mis-position themselves and become unable to interact with. A lot of the achievements are buggy and if you aim for completion (I do on Lego games at least) you are looking at a reasonable amount of frustration as you may have to repeat the requirements for various achievements multiple times before you get them to trigger - and at time of writing I am still missing one, very easy to get achievement as it refuses to pop no matter how many times I complete it. Most progress stopping problems with the game can be fixed by killing it completely and restarting it. This will unfortunately not save you from the rest of the bad design choices though.Feel like walking miles? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = summon a mountStupid camera angles screwing up your positioning? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = helpful marker underneath youCan't hit/grab items? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = all works like a charmCharacter wants to hit random crap? LoTR = yes and there's nothing  you can do about it, Hobbit = you can aim anything even remotely rangedWant to change to a character with the ability you need? LoTR = well screw you, we've decided to turn the character following you into that one. And since you were half way up a jump quest at the time when we did this, the jumping character will not only fail to get the ability it needed, it will also immediately ambled off the edge of the jump quest to rejoin its now useless partner on the ground. I mean really this one♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so many times. There seems to be some inherant desire to keep characters the same size so if you have Legolas and say, Frodo (one big, one small) and half way up a jumpy thing you need  a rope so you figure you'll switch from Legolas to Sam, it will switch Frodo to Sam and switch your focus to him leaving Legolas to leap off the jump quest, and this is despite explicitly selecting the character from the menu of all possible characters etc etc. Amazingly in the Hobbit when you selected to switch to a different character, it just switched to a different character...Honestly, I played through it out of stubborness, but really if I had known how incredibly annoying it was going to be I would never have bought it. If you are a seriously casual player, don't care about completion and don't mind having to restart the odd level every so often in order to progress it might be an okay game for you. Unless you are really invested in Lego/LoTR though there are better games out there, better lego games and better LoTR games...			"

												I think what really makes this game great is that it's not too serious or dramatic about the storyline... or actually anything at all. Smashing Lego sounds quite boring, but challenges and storylines vary a lot thus giving it more play time even if you weren't interested in Lego or LOTR either to that matter. I was a bit disappointed about the fact that to play this properly I had to get a controller, but after I got one I wish I could play more games on it!			"

Overall, 8.5/10, needs more explaination on where to free roam and how, also the game didn't use the ""THEY'RE TAKING THE HOBBITS TO ISENGARD"" quote from Orlando Bloom.			"

The graphics are really improved (more blur and shading and just all the details they've put into this!) and I really enjoy the voice-acting in this game, normally in LEGO games the characters were grunning and stuff, but now they use the voice-acting and sound-effects and music! I really recommend buying this, although the game might be sometimes a bit hard to understand (new quests and places to visit) it's just sooo gooood!			"

												A good game. I'd say that about any LEGO based game and Tolkien Universe game, and this hits the spot. One thing I might improve on is that I couldn't seem to exit the splitscreen two player mode, until I exited the game and restarted. Also, the controls weren't really made clear enough, and so I spent about five minutes being stuck in one place before figuring out how to Jump (J). Still, a good game nonetheless.

Despite this game utilizing the speech from the movies, it still managed to bring some of the Lego charm with it.  Plus I totally dig the overworld.Overall, it was worth the money I paid for it.

SummaryIt's just another LEGO game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.ReviewIf you've ever played a LEGO game before then you already know exactly what to expect from LEGO The Lord of the Rings.  There are no surprises here.  Having said that, this is a fun and well-made game that fans of The Lord of Rings films will enjoy.  Of particular interest is the overworld which allows you to walk from one end of Tolkien's Middle Earth to the other with no loading screens.  Not at first, of course, since certain parts of the map will be locked off until you've completed the requisite story level, but once you've finished the story mode, you can walk from Hobbiton straight through to Mount Doom without stopping.  It's not to scale, so the trip will only take you a few minutes, but it's still very cool, and the sights along the way will be familiar to fans of both the books and the movies.The individual levels are very enjoyable and contain lots of puzzles and secrets, most of which can't be accessed your first time through since they require the right character, so you'll want to go back and play them again in Free Play mode which gives you access to every character on your roster; however, you may want to wait until you've beaten the game because then you'll have every character you need to tackle every challenge, and finishing the game isn't hard since it's virtually impossible to fail.  If your character dies, you lose some studs (LEGO currency that you use to buy special unlockables) and your character is immediately resurrected on the spot, so even the most ham-handed gamer should have no trouble being able to make it to the final cutscene.LEGO games are known for their humor, but I was somewhat surprised at just how funny these cutscenes are.  Since they use dialog from the movies themselves, the animators had to be creative, and there are endless visual gags like the possessed King Theoden briefly nodding off while talking and Grimma Wormtongue elbowing him in the ribs to get him talking again, or Lurtz taking down Boromir with bananas and chickens fired from his bow (trust me, you'll never look at Borormir's climatic scene the same way again).  Who knew that the films' relentless severity lent themselves to so much humor?The game looks good with its colorful, high resolution textures and lighting effects.  We're not talking Arkham City quality, of course, but it does the job, and the music is great because it's taken straight from the Howard Shore soundtrack, so no complaints there.  I did run into several minor glitches throughout the game, such as characters getting stuck in the level geometry or suddenly freezing in place while the game carried on around them forcing me to restart from a checkpoint, but this was relatively rare.  Finally, multiplayer works great with the innovative dynamic splitscreen, and my boys had fun playing through the game with me.  I might even go so far as to say that this is the recommended way to play.Buy this game if you're a fan of LEGO games and The Lord of the Rings, but if you've had your fill of LEGO games then move along because there's nothing to see here.

An Amazing journey!I've completed all achievements in this game and I suppose that deserves a review. I had a long break in Lego games, last one was about 9 or 10 years ago. It was a Lego Star Wars and feelings which I have to that game are so warm. Mostly because I am a huge Star Wars fan and the second reason - back in those days me and my friends gathered around the computer and played together. Yeah that was with the help of hot-seat mod. We had a lot of fun. One day my computer crashed and I had to repair it and reinstall everything. While i was doing that i forgot about Lego game.But time moves on so do I. I grew up and eventually thought that Lego games are for kids. However, once i got sick so I had to stay home for a while and I wasnt able to visit my University. By coincidence Lego LOTR was on sale only 3.14$ + I was a bit bored at home. Finally, main reason is that i am also a huge LOTR fan. I love universe which John Ronald Reuel Tolkien created. I've read his books. (LOTR of course, Hobbit, some parts of Silmallirion). Peter Jackson movies are also pretty good they have soul. The question is Does this game have a soul?StoryStory goes according to Jackson films. And it's being served in a funny way. Plot isn't a dump mass of stupid jokes, it has a story and behind this story jokes and gags are comming. Because of that each character's goals and reasons are explained to player. That makes player who is never touched LOTR universe to feel comfortable. Another plus is absence of jokes ""below the belt"" which are very popular in modern society. Map/WorldThis is a new feature to me. I was very happy to see this one. So now you have a world of Middle-earth (I mean locations where film scenes took part). Developers made a good job, areas are situated according to books and roads are matched with a story. So the LOTR fans couldn't argue much. But it's pretty exciting to walk your own way from Shire to Mordor. Also add to that ability to visit Helms Deep, Isengard, Weathertop(especially at night it's beautiful) and much more. This world isnt't dead you can find camps, citizens, orcs, dwarfs ( some of them have a quest for you). Another good trifle - sometimes if you are attentive enough you could find some references to Bilbo journey and to the LOTR universe itself. CharactersYou have bunch o these. Every person from films is present here even those who where cut Mouth of Sauron and those who weren't in films Tom Bombard. Each character has it's own special abilities. For example, Sam can set fire on, Orcs are strong and can pull specific lego objects, Golum climbs on the walls etc. Voicelines are good almost the same as original. So you will definitely have a lot fun with this number of characters. And yes you can build your own one. GameplayIt's hasn't changed much from the old Lego games (unless it's a Lego Legoland or racers he-he). But now we have more puzzles to solve and they are more interesting not just simply build that or put this by the Force. Now we have to feed hobbits or throw fish at Golum plus almost every character has different ability that makes game interesting enough. Also new features like stealth(yeah hiding from the Black rider), horse riding, Crash Bandicoot mode, Troll riding. Boss fights at first seems to be interesting but in the end of the game they are the same: this is boss ====> you cant hit him ====> stay on the platform and wait till boss attacks you ===> boss weapon is stuck in the ground/wall/water/dwarf/corn flakes ====>time to hit the bad guy ====> Boss destroys platform, rebuild the platform and repeat 3 times. Note: fight with Barlog is so long, boring and annoying. However after all gameplay was interesting and I wasnt bored too much.CollectablesAnother new feature to me. On each level you can find amount of items wich are needed for quests. Some of them give you special abilities and some are just ridiculous like mushroom crown. Also after completing level you will get mithril blocks with the help of which you can forge items. Items could be different like fire or ice bow, tripple shot bow, fast boots, disco ball( madness) etc.MusicOst deserves a big plus. Compositions are chosen perfectly. Howard Shore made music for the film and his compositions are present in this game. It's incredible hearing Shire theme in Shire or theme of Rohan in the Rohan lands. This is a great plus. Ost makes you smile. ConclusionDespite some repetetive moments and sometimes crazy camera this game is good. It is made with love to LOTR universe which makes me happy and not disappointed in developers. Hot-seat mode makes everything twice funnier though. Lego Lord of the Rings is worth buyingP.S. If you ask me about raiting I would give this game 8/10.			"

												Very fun. Stays true to the LEGO charm and the plot of LOTR. Also, the open world is amazing.It's a LEGO game, there's not much say about it. There's tons of collectibles, several characters, charming missions and plot. There's even dialog in this one. What does set LEGO LoTR apart though, are the side quests, because it is open world, there are a plethora of side quests, similar to an RPG. You can just gather side quests and burn some time doing those, or skip them and dive right into the plot. The side quests are fun though, I suggest doing them.This game is awesome. 9.4/10			"

												I've played the Lego Star Wars games and the Indiana Jones one and this one is by far my favourite Lego game. Adding dialogue straight from the movies makes it more awesome. Gameplay feels more refined and overall it's just awesome. I don't do the whole number-over-another-number thing so I'll just say if you like Lego games, Lord of the Rings, silly things or any combination of the above, buy it.			"

												This is probarly the best LEGO game I've ever played, if you see LEGO Star Wars is nothing compared to this, the whole storyline of the original books and films fit exactly into this game. The graphics are really improved (more blur and shading and just all the details they've put into this!) and I really enjoy the voice-acting in this game, normally in LEGO games the characters were grunning and stuff, but now they use the voice-acting and sound-effects and music! I really recommend buying this, although the game might be sometimes a bit hard to understand (new quests and places to visit) it's just sooo gooood!			"

												This is probably our favorite of the Lego video games. My boys (ages 7 and 9) love to play it too. You can actually get all the Steam achievements without excessive time/effort and the map (the area between levels) is very well done. You can see which levels you've completed and if you've unlocked all the stuff (unlike Lego Indiana Jones).			"

It is well produced, looks stunning and is worth the buy!COMPLETIONIST'S NOTE: Depends. it took me about 50 hours to complete this game, even the 10,000,000,000 studs achieve is easy if done right.

												It was quite a fun experience playing through this.  The PC version is a bit buggy, but I personally did not encounter anything that ruined my good time.I will say that I did prefer the older Lego games' form of communication full of grunts and miming.  Despite this game utilizing the speech from the movies, it still managed to bring some of the Lego charm with it.  Plus I totally dig the overworld.Overall, it was worth the money I paid for it.  If you're down for a wacky, blocky adventure in Middle-Earth, I recommend this game.			"

												Very fun. Stays true to the LEGO charm and the plot of LOTR. Also, the open world is amazing.It's a LEGO game, there's not much say about it. There's tons of collectibles, several characters, charming missions and plot. There's even dialog in this one. What does set LEGO LoTR apart though, are the side quests, because it is open world, there are a plethora of side quests, similar to an RPG. You can just gather side quests and burn some time doing those, or skip them and dive right into the plot. The side quests are fun though, I suggest doing them.This game is awesome. 9.4/10			"

SummaryIt's just another LEGO game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.ReviewIf you've ever played a LEGO game before then you already know exactly what to expect from LEGO The Lord of the Rings.  There are no surprises here.  Having said that, this is a fun and well-made game that fans of The Lord of Rings films will enjoy.  Of particular interest is the overworld which allows you to walk from one end of Tolkien's Middle Earth to the other with no loading screens.  Not at first, of course, since certain parts of the map will be locked off until you've completed the requisite story level, but once you've finished the story mode, you can walk from Hobbiton straight through to Mount Doom without stopping.  It's not to scale, so the trip will only take you a few minutes, but it's still very cool, and the sights along the way will be familiar to fans of both the books and the movies.The individual levels are very enjoyable and contain lots of puzzles and secrets, most of which can't be accessed your first time through since they require the right character, so you'll want to go back and play them again in Free Play mode which gives you access to every character on your roster; however, you may want to wait until you've beaten the game because then you'll have every character you need to tackle every challenge, and finishing the game isn't hard since it's virtually impossible to fail.  If your character dies, you lose some studs (LEGO currency that you use to buy special unlockables) and your character is immediately resurrected on the spot, so even the most ham-handed gamer should have no trouble being able to make it to the final cutscene.LEGO games are known for their humor, but I was somewhat surprised at just how funny these cutscenes are.  Since they use dialog from the movies themselves, the animators had to be creative, and there are endless visual gags like the possessed King Theoden briefly nodding off while talking and Grimma Wormtongue elbowing him in the ribs to get him talking again, or Lurtz taking down Boromir with bananas and chickens fired from his bow (trust me, you'll never look at Borormir's climatic scene the same way again).  Who knew that the films' relentless severity lent themselves to so much humor?The game looks good with its colorful, high resolution textures and lighting effects.  We're not talking Arkham City quality, of course, but it does the job, and the music is great because it's taken straight from the Howard Shore soundtrack, so no complaints there.  I did run into several minor glitches throughout the game, such as characters getting stuck in the level geometry or suddenly freezing in place while the game carried on around them forcing me to restart from a checkpoint, but this was relatively rare.  Finally, multiplayer works great with the innovative dynamic splitscreen, and my boys had fun playing through the game with me.  I might even go so far as to say that this is the recommended way to play.Buy this game if you're a fan of LEGO games and The Lord of the Rings, but if you've had your fill of LEGO games then move along because there's nothing to see here.

An Amazing journey!I've completed all achievements in this game and I suppose that deserves a review. I had a long break in Lego games, last one was about 9 or 10 years ago. It was a Lego Star Wars and feelings which I have to that game are so warm. Mostly because I am a huge Star Wars fan and the second reason - back in those days me and my friends gathered around the computer and played together. Yeah that was with the help of hot-seat mod. We had a lot of fun. One day my computer crashed and I had to repair it and reinstall everything. While i was doing that i forgot about Lego game.But time moves on so do I. I grew up and eventually thought that Lego games are for kids. However, once i got sick so I had to stay home for a while and I wasnt able to visit my University. By coincidence Lego LOTR was on sale only 3.14$ + I was a bit bored at home. Finally, main reason is that i am also a huge LOTR fan. I love universe which John Ronald Reuel Tolkien created. I've read his books. (LOTR of course, Hobbit, some parts of Silmallirion). Peter Jackson movies are also pretty good they have soul. The question is Does this game have a soul?StoryStory goes according to Jackson films. And it's being served in a funny way. Plot isn't a dump mass of stupid jokes, it has a story and behind this story jokes and gags are comming. Because of that each character's goals and reasons are explained to player. That makes player who is never touched LOTR universe to feel comfortable. Another plus is absence of jokes ""below the belt"" which are very popular in modern society. Map/WorldThis is a new feature to me. I was very happy to see this one. So now you have a world of Middle-earth (I mean locations where film scenes took part). Developers made a good job, areas are situated according to books and roads are matched with a story. So the LOTR fans couldn't argue much. But it's pretty exciting to walk your own way from Shire to Mordor. Also add to that ability to visit Helms Deep, Isengard, Weathertop(especially at night it's beautiful) and much more. This world isnt't dead you can find camps, citizens, orcs, dwarfs ( some of them have a quest for you). Another good trifle - sometimes if you are attentive enough you could find some references to Bilbo journey and to the LOTR universe itself. CharactersYou have bunch o these. Every person from films is present here even those who where cut Mouth of Sauron and those who weren't in films Tom Bombard. Each character has it's own special abilities. For example, Sam can set fire on, Orcs are strong and can pull specific lego objects, Golum climbs on the walls etc. Voicelines are good almost the same as original. So you will definitely have a lot fun with this number of characters. And yes you can build your own one. GameplayIt's hasn't changed much from the old Lego games (unless it's a Lego Legoland or racers he-he). But now we have more puzzles to solve and they are more interesting not just simply build that or put this by the Force. Now we have to feed hobbits or throw fish at Golum plus almost every character has different ability that makes game interesting enough. Also new features like stealth(yeah hiding from the Black rider), horse riding, Crash Bandicoot mode, Troll riding. Boss fights at first seems to be interesting but in the end of the game they are the same: this is boss ====> you cant hit him ====> stay on the platform and wait till boss attacks you ===> boss weapon is stuck in the ground/wall/water/dwarf/corn flakes ====>time to hit the bad guy ====> Boss destroys platform, rebuild the platform and repeat 3 times. Note: fight with Barlog is so long, boring and annoying. However after all gameplay was interesting and I wasnt bored too much.CollectablesAnother new feature to me. On each level you can find amount of items wich are needed for quests. Some of them give you special abilities and some are just ridiculous like mushroom crown. Also after completing level you will get mithril blocks with the help of which you can forge items. Items could be different like fire or ice bow, tripple shot bow, fast boots, disco ball( madness) etc.MusicOst deserves a big plus. Compositions are chosen perfectly. Howard Shore made music for the film and his compositions are present in this game. It's incredible hearing Shire theme in Shire or theme of Rohan in the Rohan lands. This is a great plus. Ost makes you smile. ConclusionDespite some repetetive moments and sometimes crazy camera this game is good. It is made with love to LOTR universe which makes me happy and not disappointed in developers. Hot-seat mode makes everything twice funnier though. Lego Lord of the Rings is worth buyingP.S. If you ask me about raiting I would give this game 8/10.			"

												LEGO LotR was so fun.I enjoyed the direct voiceovers from the films, the easy the playablility, and the fact that you don't need a mouse pad to play. One of my favorit aspects of the game was the hummor, it was the little slapstick that is a part of most lego games.On the down side, even for all the collectibles, the open world, and the side missions, this game didn't have much replay value for me. After I beat the main story, there were no more funny cut senes or any big adventer to compleat. I only played it for two or three days after beating the main story because there just wasn't enough to keep my entorest.This is definetly a game to play, but you should do what I did and hold off untill Steam puts it on sale, because I would't want to pay full price for a game I may only play once.

												I remember way back when I was just a wee babby I bought a game called LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game for the PS2.I loved that game to death.LEGO The Lord of the Rings made me feel just as I felt when I played LEGO Star Wars 10 years ago. It's been 10 years already? Geez.If you've played any other LEGO game by Traveller's Tales you've pretty much played all of them. There's not much to say.I fôoking luv dat.This game is through and through a 10/10, it brings some needed nostalgia to me, remembering me just sitting at home playing Lego Star Wars all day not caring for anything else than getting the game to 100%.Though if I had to gripe about something is that the new open world thing TT is making in their games is weird, I liked the small hub world that had easy access to every stage, the shop and the mini-kit vehicles.Look at Dexter's Diner from LEGO Star Wars and Mos Eisley Cantina from LEGO Star Wars 2 there was something charming with those places.Though it's also great because there are tons of side-quests in this open world for you to complete.The second thing I'm not really 100% okay with is that there's voice-acting ripped straight from the movies, sure it may be easier to understand the story but there was something charming when there wasn't any voice acting.Screw it, my childhood was 10 years ago and there has to be some changes in the game design.

												It's the old Lego formula (ie, smash everything for coins, and do missions), this time with the LotR characters, and voice-overs straight from the movie trilogy.If you enjoy the LEGO gameplay, you'll love this game too. Missions are new this time around (I think, haven't played Lego Harry Potter yet) and add a little touch to what is really just a bunch of Fed-Ex quests.Co-op this time around comes with a dynamic splitscreen which I think works very well, and several times during missions player one will be fighting a 'boss battle' (for example: battle between Gandalf and Saruman, and fight against the Balrog) while player 2 is continuing on with the mission. I thought this worked very well.The open world is great. The areas are small, of necessity, because you can seamlessly walk from Hobbiton to Mount Doom. Without loading. This is just awesome.I recommend it in SP, and if you have someone to play co-op with, it's a must-get. Only thing is: Use a controller. M/KB is a terrible way to try to play the game.			"

												Best lego game i've played to date. Not perfect, has many gliches and bugs but still great. Unlike other lego games where you have a 'lobby' with your different levels in seperate rooms in this you travel a miniturised middle earth and can find many secrets and many references to other games, films and videos across the land; I've found around 20ish. One thing that bugged me was how many of the sounds have been cut directly from the movies. This was particularly prominent in the helms deep cutscene where you could hear the rain when characters were speaking (from the scene in the movie where it was raining) but in game there was no rain (or if there was it had no sound). Other than a few bugs and gliches that can be found (some amusing but many irritating) this is a great game. Its hard to describe it if you havent played a lego game before but if you has almost everything you didnt like (or at least thought could be better) in the older games have been improved in this one. Many hours of fun even after completing all the missions and unlocking loadsa stuff. Cant wait for a lego hobbit game!			"

												The gameplay is this game is very good, but the only thing I don't like is that there isn't a sort of area where you can do everything like buy characters and crafting and stuff, instead it is spread all through out the map and is very complicated. But if you only care about gameplay, this would be a good game for you :)			"

												Awesome game for kids, plus for LOTR fans its awesome, follows up every moment in LOTR and shapes it in a humourus way. THeres also cool hats like flower pots and mushrooms. Its 10 dollars but if you wait for a sale it will be 2.613 US dollars. I recommend you buy it on the sale.			"

												Your standard TT lego game formulae adapted for the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, somehow remains fresh and exciting. The levels are all well crafted and offer plenty of replay value, and the minikits are not to easy to find. The characters look great in lego form, and the open world of Middle Earth has plenty of side quests to complete after the main story. Call me old school but it still doesn't seem right the minifigures talking, and not just doing some signing and slapstick. Overall a great game, but doesn't offer that much different to most other lego games.			"

												as i write this review, i am not yet play all lgeo games on my library, just this one and 2 lego harry potter gamesand i like this one more than the harry potter, mainly because Lego LOTR more oriented on action and Lego HP more on puzzle stuffeven though this game a little bit shorter than what i expectedwhat i love the most on this game is the excellent game design and cut sceneas for the replayabilty, as usual Lego games, the replayability really high, you can't unlock everything on first play, and theres a hidden cutscene if you can complete it 100%i really reccomend this game for LOTR fans or lego games fans, it's fun and enjoyable8.5/10			"

												This is really a great game. I really like some of the differences from other lego games, like the mythril items you can craft, as well as the items you need to find in levels. The way they  have the items, and the vast map, makes this game feel more RPG-ish compared to most lego games. This is also the only lego game I've completed 100% on steam, and second lego game I've ever got 100% on across all consoles. Like all of the lego games, this still has local co-op, so you can even enjoy the game with a friend. It's well worth it to get this game.			"

												9/10 Awesome game!  Well crafted cartoon style graphics consistant with the Lego theme. Lego parts feel like they have real weight/function in the world.  Challenging and rarely frustrating missions. Few if any bugs I can think of; one minor case of temperary clipping.  The dialogue is spoken, so no-Lego babble, can be a pro or con depending on your likes. Tons of extra content to un-lock!First, I'm a LOTR and Lego fan, so I am biased.  Even so, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes games with a good sense of humor.Some of the earlier Lego games may have turned off ""serious"" gamers, but imo they are definately getting better. I haven't played them all, but this one was a very positive surprise.First, they put all the main LOTR movies in one game, so there is very little padding (un-like say in the Star Wars Lego games).  The main story goes through most of the major plots points in well designed, fun and most importanly non-frustrating levels/missions. Once you leave the Shire the world opens up, offering plenty of exploring. Its not a GTA game of course, but the world is intuitive and fun.Once you finish the main stories, you can unlock free-play. I found this easily added a good chunk of play hours.  There are entire mini-levels that you would miss completely if you had not unlocked the required mini-figs to access them!Final word, get a decent gamepad, leave your cynicism at the door and have fun.

												Great game. Fun, good sense of humour, and an enjoyable way to follow the narrative of The Lord of The Rings trilogy. I love the fact that there is local co-op on Lego games on the PC. Played through it with my girlfriend and then finished the achievements on my own afterwards. It's casual to an extent, but maintains a good balance between difficulty and fun. Oh, and if you're going to be a completionist and finish everything, bear in mind there are a few bugs and some awkward controls at times. The game crashed at one point and refused to register certain items and lego pieces I picked up during a level. Turns out there are some codes floating about which fixes the problem if you're close to 100% of lego pieces.			"

												After the first 10 minutes of gameplay I really didn't expect to finish the game. Because...• The combat is boring and really repetitive and jet I continued playing.• The puzzles are super simple AND repetitive and jet I continued playing.• The bosses are boring and tedious and repetitive and jet I continued playing.• The sidequests are boring (sample size: 3) and jet I continued playing.• The collectibles are boring and unnecessary and jet I continued playing.Why? Because it made me giggle every 15 minutes or so. The humor in cutscenes saved this game for me. There something really neat about seeing an scene from the movie play out with the original dialog and some visual jokes in the background.If you are a LotR fan and feel like you could look past all the gameplay issues this game has go for it. It's almost good.  "

												I bought this game for my 5 year old brother that is a big fan of Lego, and I must say it's not a bad Slasher at al.Pros and Cons-Pros:1. Nice textures and graphics, runs smoothly on my GTX 770.2. Easy menu and easy controls when you understand them (as I'm using a keyboard and this game is totaly made for controllers but it's still playable without any problems)3. Gameplay is fun.Cons:1. Puzzles sometimes offer an inunderstandable situation, like moving a statue that is located in some corner (and looks EXACTLY as a 'checkpoint').2. For people who take Lord of the Rings seriously (as I do) won't understand what's funny in the ""humor"" that's in the game such as the intro: 9 people are holding their rings and one of the rings falls. It looks silly and childish and I did not like it.I'm not a fan of Slashers / Puzzle games so I'd put 5/10 but for fans of this game style it's probably will be 8/10.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)Firm double-thumbs-up for the probably best LEGO computer game there is, so if you don't have any yet, definitely buy this one! As opposed to all other LEGO games (<-- A fact as of 2013. I didn't update my knowledge since, so forgive me.), this one has voice acting: The original voice samples from the film(s) are used.The game has really high entertainment value, and once you're done with the main campaign, there is still plenty to do, so the game is really worth its current price of €20, but it has been discounted already, so ...There's a quest bug (screenshot) that I stumbled upon that might still exist: In that section where you're controlling Gandalf to climb up a mountain or something, you can manually switch to other characters and do their stuff first, which I did. This effected for some buggy reason that there was a fish too few so I could not complete the quest. Playing the quest without switching (to a different character before the Gandalf section is completed) evades the bug - there will be enough fish in the following sequence.			"

												Never saw the LotR movies because I'm a scrub, but this game did a great job of filling in what I need to know. I like how the dialogue is ripped straight from the movies and tells the saga in a compressed and tongue in cheek way. As far as LEGO games go, some of the puzzles here were a little more tedious than usual (not hard to figure out, but just tedious). Also, though I finished the story mode, haven't done all of the free play or side quests to 100% this one due to sort of losing interest quicker than I did on most other LEGO games. But I can still recommend the experience because I felt I got my money's worth out of the part of the game that I did play.			"

												It's not so much like ""playing the story"" so much as it is ""sort of playing the movie maybe half the time"" and watching lego-ized cutscenes from the movies the other half. Maybe worth $5 on sale at most if you're really into it, but I wouldn't pay much more. And don't expect an interactive experience to bring you closer to the series or anything like that. Honestly for that you're better off just watching the movies again (or better yet, read the books!).			"

												Unless you are a hardcore Lego and Lord of the Rings fan, who feels you MUST play this game, don't.It is riddled with bugs, and glitches that will either make it very difficult if not outright impossible to collect everything in the game. One example is a collectable Mithril Block gained by doing a whack-a-mole game, which doesn't get added to your brick count, or ever gets marked as having been collected; attempting to collect it again will yield the same results.Given that this game has been out for almost 2 years now, and these issues haven't been fixed, I can't in good conscience really recommend this game to anyone.Aside from that, the game is pretty solid, though some of the platforming elements are a might touchy.If you still intend to get the game, do some research as to what kinds (and severity) of bugs and glitches you will encounter before purchasing it.

And maintain the dark world of Lord of The Ring is complete.- Amazing battle scenes, especially the end. Board emotions play until I got to go. What's wrong with good characterDisadvantages- A few key scenes deleted. Chon Buri make it look choppy.- The game is more RPG Open World makes finding items to find some secret services. No hint- A graphical debugger to see it. Buck and precludes the game well. (Only really precludes Pacing was off the bug, too!).- For people who know this movie before, only. Because the game spoiler million% movie content.- The end game LEGO unresolved compared to the previous semester.			"

I bought this because its cheap ( 89% off atm). so, why shouldn't I try it?and here I am, give thumb up for this game ( might change later )good voice acting, bg music and sf. feels like playing the movie.update #1most of the lego things are breakable. more thumb up since I could hit sam until he's breaking over and over again.update #2 ( mey 3rd 2015 )the further I play, the control feels more annoying. they could have provide option to remapping the button and change camera view control to mouse. this would be the most annoying thing in this game so far.#update #3 ( mey 5th 2015 )no map key mapping. its another annoying thing when you should hit ENTER , ↓ , ↓ , ENTER just to viewing map.

												Lego Lord of the Rings is pretty cool I guess. After the success of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel: The Hobbit, he began to work on an epic saga about an all powerful ring that would bring the destruction of a place called Middle Earth. He wrote this series between 1937 and 1949 but not having it published until 1954 and 1955. What Tolkien gave us became one of the most renowned and beloved series of books in Fantasy history, pioneering many tropes, themes, and subjects that would cement themselves in literature, video games, movies, and many other art forms. So what better way to celebrate Tolkien's legacy than by remaking the movie versions of his coveted series but in miniature brick form? PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-Lego Lord of the Rings takes place during the Third Age of Middle Earth, two and a half millennial after Sauron, the Second Dark Lord and most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, is defeated in the land of Mordor, at the slopes of Mount Doom, by an alliance of Men and Elves during the war of the last alliance after he loses possession of the one ring, a powerful artifact forged in the fires of Mt. Doom to concentrate his own power as well as exercise his own dominion over the other rings of power, magical rings that were forged by Calebrimbor, Prince of Noldorin and the last of House Feanor.Wow, look at all those made up words. This one ring is picked up by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit and dirty little sneak thief who steals the precious from Gollum, who was also a hobbit at one point but now looks like my sister, a moldy grilled cheese sandwich. But Sauron, being the big♥♥♥♥♥♥OG that he is, is regaining his power and mustering his forces to regain the one ring. Frodo Baggins, another filthy little hobbit, is forced to take this mighty ring to the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place that can destroy it outside of the oven at Papa Johns, ooo that's spicy! So Frodo, Sam, Marry, and the other Marry, team up with Aragorn: Son of Arathorn, Legolas: Prince of Mirkwood, Gimli: Son of Gloin, Gandalf the Grey, and Sean Bean on one of the most epic fetch quests to ever exist. Oh right, this is a lego game,♥♥♥♥♥♥ hold on. I forgot to mention that pretty much everything in this game is made out of Lego, save for a few exceptions. Have you ever played a Lego game before? It's like that. So everyone is made of Lego, they move like Lego would, and they fall apart when they die like Lego. So what you have is a Lego platforming game about the first three LOTR movies instead of the books. Which is cool because all of the dialogue that is actually spoken outside of a few random NPC's is straight up from the movies. There are two parts of the game, the parts where you play through a level that was inspired by the movies, and the part where you move from place to place over a pretty good looking over world of Middle Earth. I have to say the game is pretty impressive for what it is. There are parts with a ludicrous amounts of little Lego orcs in them and it's almost baffling how I didn't have slowdown with so many jokers on screen at once. You can't die in LLOTR, I mean, you can, but there's no game over screen. It's obvious that these games are meant for kids, but this game is neat even for a kids game, like the one Chuck-E-Cheese that still has a Marvel Vs Capcom Machine. It's there, but you have to bring your little brother so you don't look like a total weirdo.  I don't have a little brother so I'll bring your little brother instead. I'm getting that machine one way or another. But should you play Lego Lord of the Rings: The Return of the land lord? Get it for cheap, it's fun and a well made game, but there really isn't enough meat on the bones to warrant a full price, I'm also pretty sure I hear Tolkien going mach speed with the rolling in his grave right about now. Lord of the Smorg gets 3 men who's last names are just their father's first names out of 5. The one Curator to rule them all: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												The story is really condensed, but I like that it uses soundbytes from the movie (even if they're not always in the right places).  The last LEGO game that I had played was the complete Star Wars collection for Wii, so I don't know if they all look this good on PC but hot dang, this game is really something pretty.  Gameplay's pretty fun also.  I had figured it would be just the same gameplay as Star Wars, but it's a bit different (the overworld is nice too).			"

												A masterfully created game and as always, keeping up with the humor of the lego series while for one of the first times, having a nice lip sync with the actual dialogue from the movies. Other than a few camera angle glitches which are easy to get around, the game is fun and entertaining for all ages. The only thing that bugs me about it is how can you have CooP on the PC from the same screen when you are using a keyboard :3			"

												Highlights- The story and atmosphere of the movie Lord of The Ring is exciting and not boring.- Fixed Connecticut's original LEGO games, but not to make the game look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Make reasonable than in the past.- A mixture of RPG game set in the game have to be perfect in my search and repeat.- Respect the original movie It is a parody of a joke that is not much. And maintain the dark world of Lord of The Ring is complete.- Amazing battle scenes, especially the end. Board emotions play until I got to go. What's wrong with good characterDisadvantages- A few key scenes deleted. Chon Buri make it look choppy.- The game is more RPG Open World makes finding items to find some secret services. No hint- A graphical debugger to see it. Buck and precludes the game well. (Only really precludes Pacing was off the bug, too!).- For people who know this movie before, only. Because the game spoiler million% movie content.- The end game LEGO unresolved compared to the previous semester.			"

												LEGO The Lord of the Rings is an enjoyable, family-friendly adventure. The story closely follows the events of the LOTR trilogy and the spliced in movie dialog was a nice touch. The bright and colorful atmosphere is expansive with plenty of areas to explore, collectibles to discover, and puzzles to scratch your head over. Depth perception setbacks and funky camera angles can make more of the heavy platforming elements a challenge but the simple controls and easy navigation system ensures that anybody can pick up, play, and have fun. Most of the LEGO games in the franchise have been lighthearted and entertaining but LEGO LOTR shows that this series can be that and so much more. [8.5/10]			"

												Truly a great experience. If you are itching to watch the Lord of the Rings movie one day, just sit down and play this. It has scenes from the movie reenacted as Lego, the music from the movie, and most importantly, the same voice actors. The world is huge, and the movement system is really nice. LEGO Lord of the Rings has fantastic multiplayer. It just works. You can use the same keyboard and everything and it isn't even awkward! And if it is, try plugging in two keyboard into the same computer and just using one each, it worked perfectly for me. If that isn't enough, game isn't frustrating at all because you can't die. Still, it is b eneficial to stay alive because you will lose out on future rewards if you die too much, but this game really is a tribute to the Lord of the Rings franchise. Personally I'd try to grab this while it's on sale because I'm not sure I'd be paying a full 50 dollars for it, but I'd say it's definitely worth 25. Presentation: 9.0/10 - Everything just feels how a LEGO game should, without ruining any of the experience with disgusting block floor, etc.Graphics: 9.5/10 - Graphics will surprise you in a good way.Sound: 10/10 - Voice actors from the movie, (all of them, some of them are directly from the movie itself,) and the music is fantastic.Gameplay: 8.5/10 - At first you will not like the controls, but you will get used to them. The game feels nice to play when you are used to it.Lasting Appeal: 9/10 - I feel like I will come back to this game every time I feel like watching Lord of the Rings. I mean, instead of watching it, why can't I just live it?Oh, and as a side note, Samwise is a ♥♥♥♥ing beast.			"

												Well, reached my first crash in the 4th or 5th level. I can see many many posts dating back to 2012 (3 years ago as of this writing) that describe multiple issues with crashing.Since it seems that nothing has been done to address a common known problem, and since it's not a small issue, I can't recommend that anyone buy this game.I've played many hours of Lego LOTR however and never had it crash a single time- if you just want to play a lego game, pass this one over for a different one. If you want to play Lego Harry Potter I'd say try to find it on a console or something. If you do buy this, there are lots of posts with quick-fixes that explain how to temporarily get around some of the crashing issues.			"

												I enjoyed this game to some extent. There are a couple of things I'd like to note:- Gameplay is much better when using an Xbox controller, as you can control the perspective better.- Gameplay requires a lot of hours to be put in in order to purchase everything and achieve everything. It reminds me a grinding game.- It offers some satisfaction and hundreds of hours of gameplay. I suggest in stead of grinding it out, to play it once in a while and finish it slowly.Overall, this is a great game to destress and enjoy the Lord of the Rings triology. I did notice that the game is very spot on with the story book (Legolas can walk on snow. This isn't depicted in the movie). I suggest buying this game only if you enjoy legos and the story.			"

												A great game with all the humor and charm that comes with the Lego games. The graphics are superb, especially in cutscenes. The level graphics are done very well, from rivers and trees to level objects and distant landmarks. The combat and fun, simple, and free flowing. The puzzle solving in levels is probably the most fun part of the game because it utilizes the talents of all the characters to solve puzzles to advance. All of the characters from the movies are here so far and represented well with a lot of dialogue actually taken directly from the movies. If you are a big Lotr fan or Lego fan or just have time to spare there is a lot of stuff to do in the game. Busting up things in levels to get lego studs is always satisfying although I was disapointed when I punched my dad in the head and no Lego studs came out.Fantastic game, 8/10			"

The game itself have some annoying graphical glitches that PC gamers will notice, but shouldn't be a problem for kids, which I beliebe is, in the end, the real target audience. Don't get fooled, the comedy here is so rare you can see all of it on the couple of trailers of this game out ... that is, all of it.Basicaly, you ""play"" the movie with very scripted sequences (you can't even die), some of which are harder than they should because of the poor port/controls.Can't recommend this for PC.

Also if you want to 100% it their is so much replayability and gametime.			"

												I thought I was going to get a fun, little action adventure with cute characters in a beloved fantasy world. Little did I know! Yes, it's all those things, but so much more! Well, ok, it's not little. It's huge! There is so much to do, here. Admittedly, it's not as deep as something like Skyrim, but it's a great open world action adventure with tons of collectibles, well-crafted ""dungeons"", and very entertaining cutscenes. There's a lot of variety in gameplay, puzzles, and environments, too.Watch out for the bugs, though. I'm so close to 100%, but I'll never get it, because some of the pickups are bugged out. :(			"

												I found this to be a largely enjoyable outing in the Lego franchise! It captured the spirit of the movies rather well, and the spoken dialogue is a welcome change from the charades the characters in previous games would act out (though don't mistake that to mean that the cutscenes no longer have any wacky elements!). There's so much to see and do and collect, it really is an epic experience. My one criticism: Almost every level has a boss fight. That gets old after a while, especially if you find yourself going through levels repeatedly to gather up stubborn collectibles. If you're not a completionist, though, you don't have to worry about it. :)			"

												LEGO The Lord of the Rings is the classic tale we all know and love set to prop comedy and Louis Armstrong's seminal hit ""Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standing on the Corner)"". All the major beats of the classic teleplay are present: young Frondo Baggins is left to care for his uncle's estate after uncle Bilbo announces his retirement from the LAPD. However, the wise wizard Gonald realizes that a piece of confiscated bling Bilbo passed on to Frondo is in fact The Ring, and sets him off on a quest with his gardener Rudy.However, Frondo is situatied somewhere in the back of the title card for the game, and the story does not truly begin until reaching the elven city of San d'Oria, where Viggo Mortensen and a young Jimmy Connelly (stunningly rendered in LEGO form thanks to advancing mocap technology) join the group. Many trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which the mad Gallum.If you've played one LEGO game, you know what to expect. LEGO The The Lord of the Rings ups the ante by introducing a basic questing and crafting system, as well as an inventory management system that puts the likes of the Resident Evil series to shame. Many medieval stand-ins appear for similar elements in other Legos games: minikit pieces become treasure chests, gold bricks become mithril (used for crafting and the exclusive one million dollar cash prize Traveler's Tales is running), and red bricks become red bricks.The LEGO Lord of the Rings takes the idea of an open world, first attempted in LEGO The Batman 2, and tweaks it in an interesting way. The hub world is in fact a completely explorable LEGO The Middle Earth, complete with side objectives. While the normal level-by-level gameplay occurs in the same static camera layout we've all come to enjoy, these little breaks between levels are a nice median between the tiny hubs of elder lego games and the huge, yet dull, world of LEGO Batman 2.Traveler's Tales has opted to pull dialogue straight from the movies for this game, which makes sense because they ultimately do not have the budget to bring on amazing, well-paid and respected actors like John Rhys-Davies and that guy who looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Paulie Shore. Not only does this make the dialgoue volume slightly inconsistent, but it also creates interesting scenarios, like that part where Boromir dies like a ♥♥♥♥♥ being voiced with all the seriousness it deserves, while portraying a LEGO man dying of a banana to the chest.The game supports local co-operative play, which is also a staple feature of The LEGO games. The games are fairly simple to pick up and play, and provided you don't play with some♥♥♥♥♥♥who keeps wanting to kill you it's sure to be a good time. The game also splits the screen if the two players stray too far from each other, which demonstrates the amazing power of the Cell. Just don't play with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ younger cousin, because at some points in the game the two players control two different aspects of the same scene, and he's not going to get anywhere if you aren't there holding his hand.In conclusion, LEGO the Lord of The Rings does not disappoint, but that's only because it's impossible to set the bar for these types of games too high to behin with, and any attempt the game makes to surpass the bar is worthy of praise. Buy this game for something fun to do with friends over the weekend. Just don't invite the sperglord who loves Lord of the Rings, because I swear to God Kyle nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥if this isn't a 1:1 reproduction of the movie we're just trying to have a ♥♥♥♥ing good time.

												I've already had to pleasure of playing and beating this game on the wii, so when I saw it here on steam I knew I had to try it out. There isn't much I can say about the game that can't be said for console versions, but I gotta say, the controls for this are really well implemented and, despite being on PC, its still runs just as smoothly as it would on any console. I've always felt that the silliness of lego could never match the epic intensity of the movies, but lego was never really known for being epic. It's a fun, casual ride through a fantasy world reimagined within the wacky logic of lego.			"

												Nope. Sorry, but no... I love the Lord of the Rings books and middle-earth-setting to death, I also like the cute LEGO-characters and the LEGO merchandise. Even though the story told by the cut-scenes is a bit different from the books, I would have loved to follow the adventures of the fellowship with a bit of humor added to it like presented in the videos. However this kind of action-game with a limited range of view, centred on fighting and smashing stuff, with jump-and-run-acrobatics (sometimes also sneaking) and always running along set paths sprinkled with coins (studs) like pacman in one small level after another just isn't the game for me... While playing this game I neither feel like a hero, adventurer nor naive hobbit at all, but instead like a haunted money-greedy pig on a destructive frenzy :(			"

												If you like the LEGO games, you will enjoy this.It keeps the classic LEGO humour, action, and story aspects we all like, and combines it with the Tolkein universe. What's not to love? As far as I am concerned, it's the best of the open-world LEGO games and if you're wondering whether you should get this or LEGO Hobbit, this one wins (although it's not as complicated). It is the first LEGO game to use inventories and forging, which adds a nice gameplay element, and also has some pretty humorous side quests.Sure, it only takes 40 or so hours to clock. Sure it has a few bugs. Sure, it added speech instead of pure mannerisms. Thing is, it's a great game if you want FUN and if you enjoy your drop-in/drop-out, sit-on-the-couch-and-play-on-the-same-computer co-operative gameplay.So if you find it for a steal of $14.99, you shouldn't even be hesitating as whether or not to buy it.TOTALLY worth it.

												LEGO The Lord of the Rings is the classic tale we all know and love set to prop comedy and Louis Armstrong's seminal hit ""Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standing on the Corner)"". All the major beats of the classic teleplay are present: young Frondo Baggins is left to care for his uncle's estate after uncle Bilbo announces his retirement from the LAPD. However, the wise wizard Gonald realizes that a piece of confiscated bling Bilbo passed on to Frondo is in fact The Ring, and sets him off on a quest with his gardener Rudy.However, Frondo is situatied somewhere in the back of the title card for the game, and the story does not truly begin until reaching the elven city of San d'Oria, where Viggo Mortensen and a young Jimmy Connelly (stunningly rendered in LEGO form thanks to advancing mocap technology) join the group. Many trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which the mad Gallum.If you've played one LEGO game, you know what to expect. LEGO The The Lord of the Rings ups the ante by introducing a basic questing and crafting system, as well as an inventory management system that puts the likes of the Resident Evil series to shame. Many medieval stand-ins appear for similar elements in other Legos games: minikit pieces become treasure chests, gold bricks become mithril (used for crafting and the exclusive one million dollar cash prize Traveler's Tales is running), and red bricks become red bricks.The LEGO Lord of the Rings takes the idea of an open world, first attempted in LEGO The Batman 2, and tweaks it in an interesting way. The hub world is in fact a completely explorable LEGO The Middle Earth, complete with side objectives. While the normal level-by-level gameplay occurs in the same static camera layout we've all come to enjoy, these little breaks between levels are a nice median between the tiny hubs of elder lego games and the huge, yet dull, world of LEGO Batman 2.Traveler's Tales has opted to pull dialogue straight from the movies for this game, which makes sense because they ultimately do not have the budget to bring on amazing, well-paid and respected actors like John Rhys-Davies and that guy who looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Paulie Shore. Not only does this make the dialgoue volume slightly inconsistent, but it also creates interesting scenarios, like that part where Boromir dies like a ♥♥♥♥♥ being voiced with all the seriousness it deserves, while portraying a LEGO man dying of a banana to the chest.The game supports local co-operative play, which is also a staple feature of The LEGO games. The games are fairly simple to pick up and play, and provided you don't play with some♥♥♥♥♥♥who keeps wanting to kill you it's sure to be a good time. The game also splits the screen if the two players stray too far from each other, which demonstrates the amazing power of the Cell. Just don't play with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ younger cousin, because at some points in the game the two players control two different aspects of the same scene, and he's not going to get anywhere if you aren't there holding his hand.In conclusion, LEGO the Lord of The Rings does not disappoint, but that's only because it's impossible to set the bar for these types of games too high to behin with, and any attempt the game makes to surpass the bar is worthy of praise. Buy this game for something fun to do with friends over the weekend. Just don't invite the sperglord who loves Lord of the Rings, because I swear to God Kyle nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥if this isn't a 1:1 reproduction of the movie we're just trying to have a ♥♥♥♥ing good time.

This is my first lego game and the intro and animation looked really fun and exciting but i just couldnt get my bearings using only the keyboard, from what i read all the lego games are like this. I couldnt even make it through 10 minutes of the game before i had to turn it off.			"

												If you're wondering about buying this: don't. Get the Complete Saga (Star Wars) instead. If you already have that, get Pirates of the Caribean instead. Already have both? Then you don't really need more Lego games.Here's an actual review:My opinion for not recommending this game isn't that strong. It's not a ""YOU MUST NEVER BUY THIS GAME,"" instead, ""You probably shouldn't get this game because there are other Lego games with more polish."" Continue reading if you want to know why I came to that conclusion.I'll start with the controls. I don't know if the developers completely forgot what made the original Lego games great; it felt like there was a button for everything, though in reality, there were only four. Lego LOTR has an open world, which I'll mention why it's not terrible but was done poorly in the next paragraph. But the controls. There's weird clipping, the different walkable paths have a force field around them, swapping between characters might make you switch to your second character which isn't in the place you wanted them to, the story has weird moments where you can choose which level to play, the playable moments in the levels included some moments which really should of been a cutscene but was changed to a really awkward gameplay part which was required to have two players, . . . oh hey, that wasn't all about the controls. . . . Close enough.Lego games were great for their simplicity, yet replayability. This was because the player had a static camera, so they didn't have to constantly reposition it. As you can tell, you need to move the camera a lot when you're in an open world, which this game features. Now, I think running around Middle-Earth when it's an open world is awesome. But why was is done so poorly? That's because you have to constantly reposition the camera. Lego games are great for their simplicity of just four buttons (and four more for movement). Adding a moveable camera requires four more. I really like the idea of moving the camera in a cutscene, but when moving the camera is keyboard only being rotated around the character you're playing as, it starts to get annoying. Especially when there's so much stuff that's required (or optional for 100%) in the overworld. A level hub would've been so much better.And the levels are still a bit too long. Mostly the cutscene halfway through them adds a lot to their length. Not a terrible complaint, since that's pretty much every Lego game.So, do I recommend it? As you clearly saw when you noticed that this was a negative review, no. If you're a diehard Lego fan that has to 100% every Lego game, then go ahead. For those new to Lego, try a different one.			"

												It was decent, up until the Dead Marshes, where you get stuck because only one character can go across while the other is stuck, and you cannot progress any further, despite the walkthrough telling you to do it a certain way, the Game wont allow it at all. To the creators of this game series. Nice to see your Failures as a game company are becoming legendary with every new title you add to the list. Save your money, find something else			"

 Review Time I love Tolkien. Seriously, I've read almost all of his extended works. So, I really want to love this game. I really, really want to love it. However, I just can't. I purchased this game on December 27, 2012, almost exactly three years ago. Despite meeting the sytem requirements, I was one of the people to be caught by a bug in the game that prevented me from making it past the prologe. It really sucked. The next year, with a new pc, I was able to complete the Black Rider, but I could go no further. Fast forward to the summer of 2015. I finally purchased a decked out gaming rig and was ready to give the game a go. It was pretty great. It had all the cheesy lego action that I expected, the wonderful sound track, and an open world approach. In short, it was everything I wanted all those years ago. However, It is hard to feel great about a game that was purchased for full price and wasn't playable for years.  The short and simple is this: Go ahead and buy the game if you well exceed the system requirements. Have a blast, it will be enjoyable. If you meet the system requirements or barely exceed it, then don't even bother. You will essentially be gambling on whether or not you will actually be able to play the game or not. The customer service won't be helpful... like at all.  "

												LOTR was my first contact with the LEGO series. It received so many good reviews I thought it would be at least mostly fun.Alas, it is mostly boring as hell.I admit, technically it is expertly done. It looks good, play smoothly and is overall very polished. But the gameplay mostly consists of two extremely boring features:1) Running around the area, looking for hidden LEGOs. Could be fun if it wasn't so overwhelmingly omnipresent. Looking behind every bush is somewhat fun when it's mixed with other activities, like for example killing stuff, but on its own it is about as fun as vacuuming a very complicated room with plenty of complicated furniture. Without using hands.2) Rewatching long scenes from the movie, rendered in the LEGO world. What was the point of this? If they did an actual parody (with actual jokes), or I don't know, did something different, okay, but this? I've seen the movies, thank you very much, it looked better in the cinema, now give me stuff to do or at least let me skip the scene!There are a lot of good elements too, I really liked the combat mechanics and some ever-changing level design (like the Black Rider motif). But when I finished Bree and I was immediately promised even more running around in search of god damn bricks, I said ""Screw that"" and dropped the game.Seriously, I don't know how this title is so liked. Sure, give it a try, it might be perfect for you, but... don't say I didn't warn you.			"

												 I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?""We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for whites only.""We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims' pride, from ev			"

This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?""We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for whites only.""We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims' pride, from ev			"

												I couldn't much care for this game. I'll stick to a list of pros and cons. PROS:- Lord of the Rings theme.- Official soundtrack of the films.- A sense of humor, good for an occassional chuckle.- LAN multiplayer with up to 2 players, a rarity these days.CONS:- Fixed and unhelpful camera angles.- Quick Time Events as far as the eye can see.- Puzzles are extremely easy and generally only require you to press a button or two with the right character selected.- Poorly fitting dialogue and voices taken directly from the films and used regardless of tone of the scene in the game. Once Gimli even said one of Aragon's lines in Aragon's voice (""Mithril...!"").- Very confusing controls. Some menus require one set of keys while others require other keys. Only the movement keys are used for movement, the other 6 buttons seem to have been picked at random for every menu.- Singleplayer this game is very frustrating, as sometimes you must complete a number of mundanse tasks to continue. With two players this process can be sped up significantly. Fights with bosses (like a troll) are also much easier, since the troll will always be targetting a player.All in all a big disappointment.			"

												The game looks great, it's funny, plays well as long as you use an xbox controller and I'm sure that for many people it's a truly great game. I however am giving up on it after a little over two hours. The problem is that it's just not the game I was expecting, it has the tags action and adventure, but I'd make that a big adventure and a small action. This game frustrated me for the same reason that old school adventures do. I get stuck somewhere and although I eventually get past it, I feel like I just end up cycling through my available characters and run all over the place smashing everything and seeing if a trigger pops up. Also silly things like get stuck for ages knowing what I have to do but it seems like the last piece I need is nowhere to be found... only to find that I accidentally already picked it up with one of my characters and it was in their inventory. I don't think it's necessarily a fault in the game, it's just not my cup of tea.So, while it's a good game, I'm just leaving my negative review to warn other players like me. If you're the type to easily get frustrated because you get stuck and you don't care as much for exploration and collecting every small thing in an area as you would for some proper action, you might want to give this a miss.Oh yeah, one other thing... other reviewers say it's a must for die hard LotR fans? Make that die hard LotR MOVIE fans as the game follows the movie more than the book (even if they are reasonably close together for a movie adaptation).			"

												I mostly play these Lego games as a pallet cleaner between one major gaming experience to the next, but I think maybe I should find something else to do that for me moving forward. While I do understand that Lego LotR like its counterparts is a children's game, I think I might have gone a bit overboard by buying three of these during the last summer sale. Lego LotR left a particularly bad taste in my mouth compared to Lego Marvel Superheroes since it was full of so many graphical and audio bugs, it just didn't feel as clean of a product. Now, while alone I think the games are fine, I would recommend just sticking to the newest Lego game that comes out as they are all just carbon copies of one another with a different skin. Even if you are a big fan of LotR, the ""humor"" adding by a Lego game is quite minimal so I wouldn't really recommend that you get this game unless you have a kid who is really into LotR, this is a definite do not buy due to its age and lack of finishing on a audio and graphical level.You can find the full review here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/09/lego-lord-of-rings.html.

												Yeah, I know everyone's hyping it, but I don't like it.Apparently it's a console port, since there's no mouse support (not even in the menus). The button arrangement is kinda weird and not very intuitive in combatThere's no decent tutorial. You'll have to read the controls screen to see which button to press.Most annoying is that stupid co-op mode. Often you have to play on split-screen, even though you only play one character. On top of that, the game is very unclear on what you have to do, the perspective makes it hard to see where you're jumping, and the buttons seem to work randomly. Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to switch to another char, which for some reason doens't work with the reuglar button anymore.			"

												I generally like the LEGO games, but I'm tiring of using your lego character to follow a very long set of levels that describe a story I already know. This version features an overworld that hinders you rather than empowers you, several very uninteresting ""powers"" for your characters, and several instances where the game engine and game camera work against each other to block you from achieving a goal.Not necessarily bad, but not particularly good.

												Well, first of all, I very much liked how they adapted the source material. You need to know the movies, though, as the story tends to skip over things, and the game is very much based on the movies.Beyond the story play there are lots of things to collect; this is pretty much meant to be done afterwards. And there's a ton of complaints about this part of the game, like bodged char switching, not much of a quest tracking, bugged indicators, annoying ""on rails"" sequences with hidden collectibles  etc, but in the end it's just something to deal with and didn't change the fact that I liked the game. I've rarely looked up things, and all but one of these was for the ""on rails"" sequences since it's pretty hard to search for hidden items if you have no control over things.			"

												This game suffers from so many bugs that it really shows the rushed nature of these Lego video games. While the humor and gameplay is the standard fare for these games that I enjoy the glitches really do hold it back. It's incredible that anyone would release a game with as many problems as I encountered to be marketed to children. Its a very easy game, but far too frustrating due to bugs that somtimes break the game forcing you to close the game and open it again.  While there is an extensive amount of content it is so poorly dispersed that unlocking the more famous characters is far easier than unlocking the one you get for getting 100% completion. And  Its just a costume of character you unlocked previously. [END SPOILERS] "

												Sorry, I just can't recommend this. I love LEGO and I love Lord of the Rings, but not this game.I started out excited at the prospect of travelling across the vast map, and enjoyed it up to about the start of the Two Towers section, by which point the gameplay started to feel really repetitive. By the end, I just didn't care anymore.The game holds your hand all the way, and the difficulty level is pretty much constant. The fear of dying is non-existent because the game brings you back almost as if it never happened. Basically, there is nothing to challenge or stimulate the player besides the sound of LEGO pieces clinking together.I couldn't even get into the atmosphere of the game. It seemed like it couldn't decide when it was being serious, when it was being funny, etc... when to play certain music even - I was outside Edoras and for some reason the Shire music was playing; really broke the mood...Oh yeah, and there are the glitches as well, like an in-game cut-scene where the characters stand around mid-pose, staring into the distance forever... but I think I've gone on long enough.Good things I can say? Well, it's a nice looking game, and it did make me laugh a few times (especially the joke with Peter Jackson throwing his Oscar away in Helm's Deep). I completed the story mode, but I won't be coming back for the extra stuff.			"

												First of all I'm a huge fan of Tolkien so every LotR game is a must-play for me. However, this one simply fails to satisfy. If you want to spend your money on a LotR Lego game go and purchase The Hobbit. Many of the things that make this game look like a beta are fixed in the hobbit and overall I think it has a much better feel to it. This one is just bland and it often made me nervous when I had to repeat the levels for some silly glitches and bugs. And the saving system is really messed up and confusing. Camera sucks as well.

Just make a LOTR game instead, and screw the little plastic foot-killers! Whatever the reason, it turns out I didn't enjoy this game, and my guess is you won't either.			"

												I really, really wish I could like this game. While I might not be the biggest LOTR fan there is, this game doesn't skimp on the story - it makes light of certain elements that kids might find a little distressing, but this isn't exactly a game designed for mature themes. It's lego, after all.The controls are adequate at best, and downright appauling at worst. You would need to bind your own keys from the default arrow keys and number pad (numbers 2 to 5, no idea who thought that was a good idea). I - for the most part - played it with a 360 controller, and bar a little ineptitude from my part, I had little issues with the controls. What makes it downright appauling then? If you have a 360 controller as player 1, and player 2 hops in on the keyboard, it isn't possible for player 2 to hop out, while player 1 can. Admittedly this has nothing to do with the controls, when you attempt to customise the keyboard controls after being forced to get rid of the controller and wanting to continue to play with something usable, player 1 now has no input. Pressing any button on the keyboard (including esc) will try to assign player 1's controller to that, but as player 2 is using it, it won't keep it. Trying to re-introduce the controller wont' help. I've pressed every button on both keyboard and controller, and onyl been able to get away from it by force quitting the game.As for character controls, the game is fine, except during the platforming elements. Or maybe I just happened to find one really, really bad one when looking for mythril blocks near Mt. Doom. It's bad enough to make half-life platforming look good. The graphics are okay, until you turn off depth-of-field and motion-blur, then they're actually quite pretty, and at least you can see stuff in the distance with it off.The comedy is as it is with all other lego games - slapstick and visual. It doesn't deviate from the story at all, so beyond silly disguises, or someone being hit over the head with something else, there aren't going to be too many giggles.To round this off - if you like lego, go play with lego. If you like lego games, you might like this one, but I'd suggest something else; this is easily the worst lego game I've played. If you like LOTR, then you might want to give this a miss. If you love LOTR or have kids who are into it, you might have some enjoyment from it.			"

												Just bought the game, looked fun, and the reviews helped me make my decision to purchase. The game is severely bugged from the onset. I cannot get past the prologue. The fight with Sauron is bugged badly. He wont attack, and I can not move all 3 characters into the circle, which is needed to start the battle. I have re- installed 3 times, and logged out several dozen times. There is no way past this point that I am aware of, without doing the actual fight. I would reccoment anyone who is going to buy the game, do some research other than this forum. Many people have suffered major glitches. This one is an obvious game killer, as I cannot play the game past this point. Just my thoughts. "

												I am unable to review and rate the actual gameplay, having spent over a week trying to launch the game with no success. Not only am I unable to get a refund or contact Steam for assistance, none of the 'solutions' found online actually work. You would think GameStop would realize that it is unwise to sell material that doesn't work, which should equate to theft, but apparently they don't care about driving customers away. This is my first, last, and only experience working with Steam, who also share some of the blame by being incapable of allowing the game to be played or helping. I absolutely do not recommend the pc download version of this game, a pointless waste of time and money, and a disservice to the game. All I wanted was a small, fun diversion from an ongoing family crisis and all GameStop and Steam managed to accomplish was adding insult to injury.			"

												It has alot of good stuff but... It has too many problems that ruin the good things about it :(Good things are it has a large open world to explore in-between missions, but I don't like that you need to beat the campagin to be allowed to use any character in-between the missions, it makes it so you pretty much should jsut bum-rush all the missions so that you can REALLY have true freedom in the open world.The cast of characters is okay, im not a fan off it having say 3 costumes for certian characters like arigon, frodo etc. and it counting as 3 seperate characters, though for actual number of characters that are unqie in their abilites their is not too much (check lego marvel for chracters with a wide variety of abilites) However Lego LOTR has a pretty infuriating chracter select method, after you beat the main campagin the main fellowship members are set as your PERMENANT quick select characters and if you want to switch to ANYONE cool like golum, saroun, ghost king etc. you have to g to choose other character option, then hcoose from large list. If that was not bad enough, if you get to an area that requires you to have a certian characters ability to get by (i.e gimlis boudler smash) when you switch to that character, if you try to go back to your cool character they have been replaced by the default fellowship character!Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you should be able to customize the character wheel to have any 8 characters you want ready whenever.The mithril and treasure item system is really cool! Being able to collect a huge amount of items that augment your abilites of just look cool or grant entirly special abilites is awesome, but same as the character select its a total chore to do. Say you find a rope section but you can't be bothered switching to sam (the rope bearer) to get past it? No problem, if you have a mithril rope and your in free play mode you can just summon it out your trove and use that with any character, HOWEVER, your items are NOT saved to characters AND if you pull out another mithril item that is a tool/weapon it will overide your current item.So even if you have 6 empty slots, bring out the mithril trowl and now have 5 empty slots you will NEVER get to equip another thing in them, your trowl will jsut disappear.So basiclly if you had hoped to ever create a badass custom character with aragons sword, then give him all the tools and special armour peices to have all ablites you get to EAT♥♥♥♥♥♥ Because the best you can do is give him the armour, one tool, but then, if you switch to someone else, yo uwill have to re-summon them AND re equip all the items. Which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing terrible desgin. (oh and yh, in frodos house you can make custom characters)The game incorpirates a side quest system, however they ALL seem to be fetch quests, though they do net you access to more treasures since whatever you fetch you get a copy of or your trove which is good.actual story is a highly watered down version of LOTR, giving you most of the important stuff to know whats going on, though some things are completely missed like that idiot king/mayor in gondar who is included as a buyable character even though you literally NEVER see him in the campagin.So the game is decent, the large open world is overwhelming and the sheer armount of unlockables is like a wet dream for digital hoarders such as myself, however its almost completely ruined by the fact that any awesome stuff you find or characters you unlock take far too long to switch too and equpping them is only temporary. To the point it actually does ruin the game. Also most fights/bosses can be very repetative, requiring you to do the exact same action multipel times OR situations where you should win without hassle, i.e hitting golum taking a heart, but hitting him again does no dmg becaused he is scripted to jump back onto cliff and keep throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at you until you do the exact same repatative task for bringing him down.Also I need to mention the controls are terrible, I mean, a lego game with no controller support? Really? and the default keyboard controls are actual dirt, I rebinded them imedtially.Overall, Its maybe worth it if you are gunning to play all the lego games or are a big fan of the series, but I would highly recommend lego Marvel over this game.Lego Lord of the Rings has a massive good amount of content that is ruined by the way its accessed/handled... Its a shame, I really found myself wanting to like it :(			"

												Based on The Lord of the Rings motion picture trilogy, LEGO® The Lord of the Rings follows the original story-lines of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, taking players through the epic story events re-imagined with the humor and endless variety of LEGO play.Trusted with the dangerous task to destroy an ancient magical ring that threatens all that is good, Frodo is forced to leave his peaceful home. But the ring wants to be found and the road to Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed, will be perilous and riddled with Orcs and fouler things. To help Frodo, a Fellowship is formed —Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Wizard, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Boromir a Man of Gondor, and Frodo’s Hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin. Players relive the legend through the LEGO mini-figures, as they explore wonders, solve timeless riddles, and overcome endless foes in their quest to destroy the Ring.			"

SCREW THIS GAME AND ITS STUPID PLANKS.Seriously if there is one complaint about this game (of which there are many) the one I would liuke to stress the most is that this is partially a platforming game; theres lots of clibing up towers and swinging from ropes and stuff. And wow does this game try its hardest to make you fail. And the thing is, it's not a challenging thing, it's a bug thing.So imagine you're trying to cross a river thats about five feet across, and for whatever reason you tend to drown in water that is 2 feet deep. No matter, there are olf planks floating in the water for you to get across on - a good old fashioned jumping puzzle. But wait! Even though they are so close together you could probably just take a big step and get across, you cannot seem to jump to the next plank, as if there's an invisible wall around them. After the 17th try, you manage to get yourself from one plank to the next, realizing that theres only 3 more to go. Oh, and remember, if you mess up and fall, you go back to the river bank and start all over again.Or how about another jumping puzzle where you have to jump from a cliff to a clearly reachable rope to swing across a gap? Seems easy enough to handle. But wait! To add some challenge, let's take to camera to the worst - and I mean absolute worst angle possible to it's impossible to gauge where you are relative to the rope. That'll leave ya guessing for a while, and everytime you miss and fall to the bottom, we'll let you plan you're next attempt while hiking all the way back up to try again.Or how about we have you climb to the very top of the tower at Isengard for a prize? Well, in classic LEGO fashion, we're going to give you several different obstacles to overcome using many different characters together. It's a great idea, but not when your character swap system is so broken. When you change to another person of the Fellowship, instead of swapping the character you're using, it swaps the other companion for the desired character, switches you to them, and before you can switch back to the player you nearly had to the top, you bet he's already jumped off to get back to you. It renders the character-swapping ""quick bar"" nearly useless, and cripples any kind of puzzles where you need more than one character.... not to mention, theres those damn planks again at the very top of that same tower to smack you down and crush your spirit.This game is beautiful in its world design, the levels are cool, and the humor is as you would expect with a LEGO game, but holy crap is this game buggy. On several occasions I'd have to restart the game because accidntally walking over a certain rock somehow launched me into orbit and wouldn't let me come back down.And every game is going to have a few little glitchy bits here and there, but these are so prevalent and obvious that I am very sure anyone at Tt that played this for more than twenty minutes noticed them. This leads to the suspicion that they saw the bugs and just didn't care enough to fix them before release - or any time in the four years it's been released.Despite all that, I had a very enjoyable time with this. Bu i cannot recommend such a broken game to anyone, and I am shocked to see that so many people have. Only buy if it's on sale for $5 or less.			"

												I love lord of the rings, and I usually love the lego based games. This is the first one I've played on PC and the first I've played in a long while. (There's a TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to read all of this)The game is good, but the controls are just terrible. They resemble something from prior to the mouse existing, with (by default) uses H to attack, and J to jump (the space bar can be reassigned from it's default use as character switch.) and if you could just reassign certain actions to the mouse it would be fine.  THIS GAME HAS NO MOUSE SUPPORT. and by that I mean none in any capacity, the game won't even pick it up (and based off of the community discussion, it's not just my mouse )So if you're okay with playing this using only a keyboard (i.e. not on a laptop or something with a small keyboard) or using a controller, then I would definitely reccommend the game.But since this is a PC port that is usually $30 (and was at one point $40 or $50) there is NO REASON they couldn't have one person on the team porting this just add some damn mouse support. And that's the reason I can't recommend this game, hopefully others will do the same so maybe they'll take notice and put in some mouse support, aside from the obvious lack of effort on the side of the developers in porting this it's good.TL;DR: If you like lord of the rings, and you don't mind terrible controls or using a controller, it's worth your money. If you're like a lot PC gamers such as myself, I can't recommend this because of the bad controls that make the game pretty unplayable, even before counting the fact it shows the lack of effort on the end of the developers.

												Lego LotR is everything you'd expect from the digital Lego franchise. This is an excellent retelling of a story we're all familiar with, laced with kid friendly humor. This is the staple of the series & TT Games delivers. However, this entry into the Lego series is problematic.Platforming is TERRIBLE. Most notibly are spots where you are forced to do the balance beam jumps. There seem to be force fields in the air that stop you from jumping far enough or into the right spot. you will repeatedly fall into the water on these sections & have to repeat the whole set of jumps over again.The stage ""Osgiliath"" is extremely buggy. The Ents will randomly rocket up into the air because of their shoddy clipping with the ground. There is a pit where if you get too close with an ent. He will go into a minute long trance & just walk toward it. The thunderous footsteps of the ents changes to clicks when the ent has both Pippin & Merry in possession. When the ent attempted to rip down the dam wall at the end of the map, the game seized all control & all I was permitted to do was change between the hobbits.On the stage ""Cirith Ungol"" there is a bug that will not allow you to trade items, between characters. If you happen to pick up 2 helmets or 2 armors with 1 character. You will be forced to restart the section.Basically this is an ok game, but it's not up to snuff. Glad I bought it on discount. I recommend you do the same if you're considering this.			"

												These games always seemed like kids games to me, but I've heard so many good things about them.  Between that and my love for Tolkien, I thought I'd give this game a try.  There are far too many little things in this game to collect.  I'm kinda a competitionist, I hate to leave a level partially, or even mostly done.  There are achievements and such for collecting every coin in each level, and all the extra secret little things.  And there's so many things to collect that the game gets bogged down in collecting things, and it slowed the game progress far too much.  This game just feels like a grind, there's not much else there.			"

												I don't think I've ever taken such an instant seething hatred to a game as I did to some of the Lego ones currently on sale. Consistently getting 70+ % scores in reviews, utilizing popular franchises so you know in advance what to expect, and promising co-op, what could possibly go wrong?First off, Lego LotR does not recognize my mouse. And no, I'm not talking about game-play yet, I'm dropped into a game where you cannot even operate the menus with the mouse. My 360 controller doesn't seem to do anything, either. I google it. No, it's not a bug or configuration hiccup, the mouse is not supported. At all. This is a classic example of ""You could've researched this, but because the notion seems so insane, you never thought to.""On the upside, you can use the controller once you've told the game that that's what you want. Using the keyboard.At which point you may notice that there are two columns for control, player 1 and 2. A dark sense of foreboding descends upon you. You shop around the options, and sure enough, there is no online play. In all fairness, this has a degree of user error to it, as the steam description plainly says, ""local co-op"", but since e.g. Lego Star Wars had online play and most reviews you'll read don't specifically mention that this game doesn't, just ""co-op"", ""I played this with my kids,"" etc., there's certainly room for misunderstanding, so I'm warning you now.The opening cinematics have a forced-funny moment or two, but given the presumed audience, I'm not sure you can blame them for trying to make things more child-accessible, except that I had a couple of ""I'm not sure this would make much sense unless you've read the book/watched the movie anyway"" moments, so at that point you already need to have decided the undiluted version isn't ""too dark"" for your spawn. (Either way, you do essentially start off playing Isildur, who is then force-killed by plot requirements ten minutes later, so what are we even talking about here?)Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game immediately drops you into an uninteresting fight against minions and finally Sauron. The game doesn't exactly tell you what to do, but not having spent your life under a rock, you aim to cut off the dark lord's finger to get on with it. Which meant battling not so much Sauron, but the controls — I know this is probably aimed at children, but does it have to feel like that game where you're supposed to eat a candy bar with knife and fork wearing huge oven mitts? The directional controls were the most unprecise it's ever been my misfortune to suffer. Strangely, the dark lord seemed to have the same issue, because we spent 10 minutes bumping into each other and swinging our weapons around without inflicting any noticeable degree of damage on each other.That's all I can say about the directional controls, except that the camera ones aren't much better. In the opening scenes, an angle is forced on you, which you can change by a handful degrees either way. Later on, you fortunately get full rotation, but turning the camera still feels slow and laborious like pushing around a boulder.The challenge of the opening mainly consisted of picking the right character for a task (""it's not like you can't jump up there, it's that you can jump there as Isildur, it looks like Elrond does the same jump, but he'll succeed"", ""it's not like you can't destroy that, you just have to pick the character with the right sword"", etc). And yeah, you may have to read the character names to pick the right bearded and helmeted Lego head.At some point, I got sufficiently frustrated with the controls that I essentially switched to finding new ways of killing myself on Mt Doom (fell off the cliff, fell in the lava, etc.), which at first glance didn't seem to have any ill effects — outside of the minifig exploding into its parts, I mean. It's not so much that you ""lose a life"", it's that you lose gold, cos our guy Isildur is constantly looting stuff as he goes along. This gold is apparently later used to unlock new characters to play or something, which they allude to in an interstitial screen that came and went so fast I wasn't sure (I'd read that you can choose a character or even create one in the Hobbit house, so I was anxious to get there. Of course, that option was not offered, so I don't know whether you first have to complete some quests, or what.).So, yeah, you know why the minifig's hands look like that? Because they've given the lego computer games all their thumbs down.tl;dr Don't impulse-buy this, despite the sale. Research very, very carefully, much more so than with ""normal"" games, just reading a few reviews on metacritic can be vastly misleading. If unsure at all, Do. Not. Buy. "

												Extremely repetitive with poor gameplay and boring controls. It barely needs an effort to be beaten and it gives no challenge to the player. It is mainly a bunch of mediocre and extremely easy platforming puzzles and the fights are boring and short. The story itself is a shortened version of the films with some pretty mediocre sense of humor shoved in there.Also, if you are a loot junkie you will curse your lungs out because of the endless backtracking you will need to do in order to collect everything.

												Mildly amusing and a fairly entertaining romp, but there are many issues that let this game down. Overall, it's a very sloppy port to PC.1) It's a PC game that doesn't support the mouse, despite several game mechanics being ideally built for it - for example aiming ranged attacks brings up a reticule that must be placed over a target. The game does not support the Playstation 3 pad, so if you want to play it, I'd have to recommend picking up a 360 controller.2) It's buggy. Characters will frequently get stuck in walls and other such similar annoyances. Thankfully if you move far enough away, they'll teleport behind you when you're not looking, but this isn't always an option. Mercifully, I've not found myself unable to continue at any point. Rendering errors are frequent - and I've found myself unable to continue past the Nazgul attack in the moors, as some sort of ground overlay is floating around in the z-axis meaning I can't actually see the gameplay area. From what I gather, the console version of the game have been patched, but the PC version has been neglected and abandoned. Reading online also indicates that there are bugs related to white blocks that can potentially make it impossible to finish the game.3) The overall design isn't great and the game has it's problems. Some of the character interplay towards the mid-game is nice and it may get better later (though I may potentially never find out as I'm unable to continue), but the level design is shockingly poor. The majority of the game is entirely linear, including the puzzle sections which have components that illogically have to be completed in a certain order rendering the puzzle section little more than a waste of time as you go through the required motions. Large parts of the game seem to take place on hills and slopes, but the player is tasked with collecting studs which are represented with rigid bodies - as a result you'll spend a lot of time chasing them down hills to collect them, only finding they have rolled into water or off a cliff and are therefore unobtainable. Some levels have too many playable characters - one level has the entire Fellowship of nine characters, which makes selecting the correct character a chore - it doesn't even fit on the character wheel any more. Some of the character icons, particularly those of the hobbits, are difficult to discern from one another, compounding the frustration. In some cases areas of the levels are enclosed and too small (such as structures in Rivendell), meaning that the camera is obscured by outside walls of the structure, meaning you cannot see what you are doing. Lastly, some of the lighting and choice of colour palette can make some things in the environment very difficult to discern, particularly during levels that take place at night.Overall the game is entertaining, but frustrating due to issues, and I cannot recommend it.

Posted: April 19, 2014
												I have been a fan of the Lego games since the initial run of Star Wars titles. As such, I was well aware of the minor problems with controls and camera that have always been prepared to deal with them in each new Traveller's Tale title but the gameplay and glitch issues make this game feel incredibly slapdash. There are other issues beyond these that I take issue with but as they are secondary they shall wait till later in my review. Firstly glitches. You don't notice them early on but as you start to explore the HUB world more they become more redolent. You will fall through the world on an occasional basis but this can be fixed by instant travelling to a location. the more crippling factor is the broken collision detection for both characters and objects. Frequently you will find your character floating uselessly in the air. Floating objects are a more nefarious as they will render push and pull block puzzles unsolvable. These kind of glitches are so frequent as to render it impossible to believe that they would not have been caught by game testers had a proper  quality control been done. This leaves the game feeling, in spite of its graphical quality, extremely unpolished.Now on to gameplay. The controls are terrible. Direction feels imprecise and button response is indecisive. Buttons very often do not respond as desired, such as when holding the Y button is supposed to bring up the character select but instead just swaps you with the second player (extremely annoying when playing co-op). At other times they simply do not respond at all, such as the case of the extremely flaky jump button. This, paired with the vague directional input, leads to much cursing in what is essentially a platformer. Much of the challenge in this game arises not from clever puzzles but from the player fighting the controls.Another problem in gameplay are the design choices. Many quest-givers (is that a word?) are in hard to reach locations making just the act of turning in a quest an annoyance. More annoying are the menus. This is illustrated most by the constructable items. In the game you can build certain items that allow you to mimic one character's powers on another. This is rendered superfluous by the fact that you have to navigate 2 menus to equip the item each time so that it is simply faster to search one menu to find the character with the requisite power. Every time something requires doing you might as well just whip out Samwise The Swiss Army Knife of Middle Earth.Alright, the finale: Story. But this follows the story of the movies, right? That should be a good thing, right?... Actually, no. Here's why. There is no freedom to deviate from the scripts of the movies as they are married to using the film's audio. Part of the enjoyment of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games where their ability to deviate from the source materials in order to better facilitate gameplay or to make jokes that could not be done with the source dialogue in place. Yes, there are added jokes in this game but as they cannot change or add dialogue many of them feel weird and out of place, especially in a movie that maintains a serious tone in almost all of its dialogue. The original audio also prevents them from adding story sequences that weren't in the movie, for example an added Tom Bombadil/ Old Willow Level would have made a welcome addition but, as there was no dialogue for this they couldn't. This issue of the audio was initially what steered me away from the game until the recent sale, mostly because of the serious tone of the story. I was not really interested in seeing these performances being juxtaposed with silly sight gags. My fear was realized and many of the jokes feel out of place or will leave you saying, ""Oh, that's just wrong."" Should have listened to my doubts. At least it was only five bucks.			"

 I do not recommend this game at full price!  LEGO Lord of the Rings has some great casual gameplay and replayability but the major problem lies with poor port for the PC.  One of the problems is knowticable right off the bat with keyboard and mouse support. The game forces you to use an Xbox 360 controller otherwise its unplayable with the horrible keyboard mapping. Plus the mouse is disabled too. This can be a kick in the teeth for some players expecting full keyboard and mouse support. There isnt many options for graphics either. Its still questionable to me since the detail looks nice.  Also there is only Local Co-op which is disappointing. With all of that said, I wouldnt recommend this to players who are expecting something more out of LEGO Lord of the Rings on PC.			"

I was very disapointed because I wasn't used to the controls. It was very different than a normal computer game and I had a hard time playing. Also, I tried to move a boulder on level 1, but for some reason it wouldn't move. I know it was supposed to move because like I said I have played this game before. So, I am sorry, but for me, my final answer is that the game was hard to control. So, I would recommend playing lego games on a console like and Xbox 360 or a Nintendo 3DS.			"

												YET ANOTHER ADVENTURE TYPE GAME WITH ONLY MALE PROTAGONISTS OMG. NOT A SINGLE FEMALE LEAD SMH. WHY CAN'T THERE BE ANY FEMALE HOBBITS OR DWARFS? MEN DON'T EVEN WEAR RINGS IN TODAYS SOCIATY. HONESTLY I'M SO SICK OF PATRIARCHY ON EVERY STEP OF MY OVERSIZED FOOT, FEMALES ARE JUST AS CAPABLE AND PHYSICALLY STRONG AS MEN. I'M SO OFFENDED BY THIS GAME IT TRIGGERS MY PTSD. WAKE UP PEOPLE, I MEAN COME ON IT'S (insert current year here) AND WE'RE STILL BEING MYSOGINISTIC BIGGOTS. NOW I NEED TO GO REWATCH SOME SUPERWHOLOCK EPISODES (Supernatural, Doctor Who and Sherlock for the ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s UGH) TO CALM MYSELF BECAUSE MY VERY LARGE BODY IS STARTING TO SHAKE THE FLOOR.*a few moments later*My girlfriend fed me some veggies (I'm bisexual and vegeterian, deal with it.) and I feel much better now. Also, she told me that actor who plays Gandalf is actually gay irl so that means this game supports homosexuals and I think that's very admirable. Based on those facts I've decided to give this game a positive review. You should definitely buy it because if you don't then you're obviously a close-minded cis homophobe.			"

												i think this game ripped of the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring and the lord of the rings the two towers and the lord of the rings return of the kingwas a long time since i saw those movies but i think this game stole a lot from it for exapmple- a guy named gollum is in this game, he was in main guy in the movie- someone called Soros or something from the first movie is also in this game- Frodo is from the movie (striaht rip off)- umm gandolf was a wizard in the third movie now he is just a hobbit - gondor was the main protanogist in the second movie now he is a city- horse lords are the kings of theodore but now its a countryi could go on but why bother someone should call goerg lukas			"

												Does not work.  Windows 7.  There is help available on forums - nothing official by way of support was available.  I spent hours trying everything recommended, which required a fair amount of technical knowledge of your PC.  Simply nothing worked.  The bottom line must be that if the game is sold, it should just work.			"

												I just want to make it clear that I have NOT played this game for 98 hours. ♥♥♥♥ you Steam. While I'm here I might as well comment on the game. LEGO The Lord of the Rings is a collectathon of the highest order, rivaled only by Assassin's Creed, Donkey Kong, Banjo Kazooie, and Beanie Babies. I highly recommend this game if you have asperger syndrome. If you are playing this to ""experience"" LotR, just re-watch the ♥♥♥♥ing movies, re-read the ♥♥♥♥ing books, or jack off to that one aerosmith video.			"

												If you've played any LEGO game before, you know what to expect: a lighthearted, humorous enactment of the story in the three Lord of the Rings movies in a LEGO world. The gameplay is pretty basic but it can be quite fun at times, mostly due to the destructible LEGO-built nature of the world. The controls are however a bit shoddy, there are some bugs, the map is essentially useless and I didn't find the open-world elements particularly interesting. If you enjoyed previous LEGO titles and/or are a fan of the source material, you will probably like this game.			"

												It's kind of hilarious how exactly some of the scenes in this game follow the movies. I can't tell if they use the original or new voice acting, but it's pretty close if it's new.In any case, it's a pretty fun game. It suffers from the usual Lego games' lack of mouse controls, but it does have splitscreen (unusual in a PC game, but nice to have). Once I get an Xbox controller I'll try hooking that up, it seems like it would be much preferrable.			"

												One of, if not the best LEGO Traveller's Tales game, LEGO Lord of the Rings is the pinnacle of their LEGO engine. With great visuals, huge Middle Earth map to freely roam on, loads of characters to play as, and a bunch of different minigames and activities, it makes for a great co-op experience with a friend (or, as they intended it, with your children :)The lack of online multiplayer is about the only con I can list for this game. Everything else is pretty much perfect for this type of games, especially if you're a fan of both LEGO and Tolkien's works.I must say that I'm a rather big LEGO fan, and Tolkien's works were my favorite literature since forever, so this game is a real treat for me :)Recommended!

												Lego Lord of the Rings must be the most hardcore LotR game out there. It follows the films 1:1, but it also includes areas and characters from the novels. The fanservice and production values are amazing. Though most of the spoken dialogue is lifted straight from the films, it is still used in a creative fashion across the board. Howard Shore's amazing score punctuates every element of this game to make it as epic as its title implies. From a gameplay perspective, it pretty much plays like any other recent Lego game, but the addition of RPG elements such as weapon crafting and other equipment just make it slightly refreshing. With hundreds of items to craft, collect and test the game clocks in at well over 30 hours. It supports local split screen mulitplayer and is kid friendly. Get it now!			"

												The LEGO series of video games is taking established universes  and remaking with bricks.  This is funny by itself, but they also add in visual humar.  I can't fault any game that honestly makes me laugh more then once, as this one has.  Yes, the camera has a mind of it's own and half the time does not point where you want it too.  Yes, goals are not always easy to find and you will wonder aimlessly around a few areas where it's not clear what you need to do. Yes, the game constantly wants you to play co-op and almost punishes those that refuse to use it, like me.  But the attention to detail and care used to bring out the characters is great.  It's not perfect, but it's enjoyable and funny.			"

												The licence has been handled well, with several key scenes from the movies recreated exactly - shot-for-shot.  There is a lot of careful attention to detail, which is why it's a shame that it's so buggy.  This only really becomes a problem if you're striving for 100% completion but it does hinder pgoress or require you to restart levels a couple of times on a normal playthrough as well.  The formula for Lego games has remained virtually unchanged for a while now; the addition of voiced characters here is a welcome one and inevitable given the subject matter.  As with all of the Lego games, it is essentially a console port so it is best played with a controller.			"

However, despite controls and weird camera - the cut scenes, story and voice acting (from the movies(!)) evens things out. Also whacking things to lego pieces has its own charm. (Seen couple of crashes so far, so let's see. Can recommend to LOTR fans, which can forgive above things, and who have read  other reviews so that they know what to expect.)			"

												I bought this becuase I had no idea what all these lego games were like.  I have only played it about 2 hours and I really have to force myself to play it so I am guessing these kinds of games are not for me.Basically it is a scripted story with a collecting mechanic.  The basic game play is:Watch a cinematic, then act out some event from the story, such as sneaking out of the shire while the dark riders are looking for you.   In between these events are semi-open areas (which I think you can eventually get fast travel to and take the story your own pace).  This is where the collecting comes in.  There are NPCs with missions who want certain objects.  So you run around trying to find and collect these objects.I find this kind of game play very dull and so, my interest in the game is fairly weak.  You could watch some lets play of the beginning of the game (it would take several hours to get enough game-play to make a good judgement) on if you would like it.One problem I suppose is that I already know the LOTR story so well that the whole story aspect doesn't offer me any incentive to play the game.  That is probably the big reason this game does not appeal to me.			"

												This might be the best Lego game yet.  It's definitely Lord of the Rings, with the strong story, setting and atmosphere - and yet its all Lego, with the silliness and sandbox gameplay you come to expect.The map is brilliant - much better than hanging around in the Cantina or the Batcave, you can roam around all of Middle Earth while you're not doing missions.  The addition of quests is very nice, as is the additional puzzles outside of the combat playgrounds.Instead of episodic gameplay, this game manages to keep the transitions from being jarring between gameplay modes, which helps keep the illusion in place that its one seamless epic.Great game!

												The gameplay follows all of the previous Lego games, with a few added new features. Overall, I've found that if you like any of the Lego series, and enjoy the story that a particular installment is based on (I.E. Star Wars fans, I highly suggest Lego Star Wars), you will thoroughly enjoy the game. This one, I had my doubts on due to the depth and seriousness of the Lord of the Rings series, but the game does a great job capturing it, while still maintaining the Lego series trademark humor. I highly recommend this game for both casual and serious gamers.			"

												In this game you can really go through whole Tolkien LOTR story in creative Lego way. You are really building parts of the LOTR world. Rather funny at some points with new jokes not included in original trilogy. Awesome! Better controled with gamepad than keyboard. First part - story mode has decent lenght. Completing the whole game would take considerably more time. Which is occasionally rewarded with new cave or sth that wasnt available in story mode. But to my taste way too lenghtly. At certain point I just stopped.			"

												LEGO: The Lord of the Ringsby DaniAngione----------------------------Art - 10 / 10Sound - 9 / 10Gameplay - 8 / 10Emotional - 9 / 10Community - 5 / 10----------------------------Overall - 8.2----------------------------Okay, so this is an easy one: It's LEGO. And it's The Lord of the Rings. TOGETHER. There's no possible way this could go wrong, right?Indeed!Before anything I'd like to admit this is not my first playthrough of this game. I've beaten it on the alternative (AKA Torrent download) version but - hey - I did bought it after all, it actually deserved it.It's basically a LEGO ""action-rpg"" (more action, less rpg) experience around Middle Earth, following the story of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy but also containing some neat candy for those lore-freaks (oops) like the stone trolls and the troll hoard - for example. The gameplay is that expected from a LEGO game: puzzles, basic combat, more puzzles, a lot of stuff to collect. It's not the gameplay that makes this game shine, tho. It's the around an hour and a half (plus mid-mission scenes) of rendered cutscenes full of the purest strain of Lord of The Rings Awesomeness.Seriously, they're worthy every nickel you could spend on this game.Not only they were smart enough to use the original movie dialogue for all the scenes brilliantly but they also managed to recapture the magic of Peter Jackson's trilogy and twist it into their own LEGO style. They're amazing and I can't describe them well enough - just buy it and see it yourself!Full of nice and fun moments, good jokes - some even going into the world of inside jokes and internet memes (They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard!) - and, well, LEGO and LOTR together - I dare say that this is the best single-player Lord of the Rings yet.And I mean it!

Definitely make things easier.Dislikes:During the story, when the whole fellowship are working together, things got confusing really fast because there are so many playable characters at one placeI play co-op and the split screen is not consistent. It's very confusing.Atmosphere is a little bit dark. I lost hundreds and thousands of studs because I keep falling off the cliff/edge.Conclusion:A fairly fun game with a lot of stuff to do and places to explore.

It suffers from the usual Lego games' lack of mouse controls, but it does have splitscreen (unusual in a PC game, but nice to have). Once I get an Xbox controller I'll try hooking that up, it seems like it would be much preferrable.			"

												One of, if not the best LEGO Traveller's Tales game, LEGO Lord of the Rings is the pinnacle of their LEGO engine. With great visuals, huge Middle Earth map to freely roam on, loads of characters to play as, and a bunch of different minigames and activities, it makes for a great co-op experience with a friend (or, as they intended it, with your children :)The lack of online multiplayer is about the only con I can list for this game. Everything else is pretty much perfect for this type of games, especially if you're a fan of both LEGO and Tolkien's works.I must say that I'm a rather big LEGO fan, and Tolkien's works were my favorite literature since forever, so this game is a real treat for me :)Recommended!

												This might be the best Lego game yet.  It's definitely Lord of the Rings, with the strong story, setting and atmosphere - and yet its all Lego, with the silliness and sandbox gameplay you come to expect.The map is brilliant - much better than hanging around in the Cantina or the Batcave, you can roam around all of Middle Earth while you're not doing missions.  The addition of quests is very nice, as is the additional puzzles outside of the combat playgrounds.Instead of episodic gameplay, this game manages to keep the transitions from being jarring between gameplay modes, which helps keep the illusion in place that its one seamless epic.Great game!

												This is the first of the LEGO games I have played and I absolutely loved it. It is a lot of fun and done with a great, silly sense of humour. The gameplay is quite simple and kind of puzzley. You can play though the main story in less time than it takes to watch one of the films. But then it has loads of things to keep you playing on for many many more hours. Each level has extra stuff that you can only access later in free play with other characters so you will want to play each level 2 or 3 times. There is also a free roaming part in between missions where there is even more do and collect. These collecting type games are like crack to me, I will just keep playing till I have found everything.			"

												When I bought this game, I was expecting it to be decent. I've played some of the other Lego games, but after beating the campaign and getting all of the collectibles, I never felt an incentive to go back and explore. This is different. The amount of things to do is staggering. It felt like an actual, serious RPG (cutesy stuff aside). I was amazed at the new mechanics in the game, including a map with quick travel points. The game feels more open world than any of the previous Lego games that I've played, and I'm thoroughly pleased with this purchase. 10/10			"

												My first lego game and I was hooked from the start, If you have any interest in the movies or book then you will love this game, It's cool use of the voices from the movies and it's tongue in cheek and sometimes laugh out loud dialogue will have you salivating at the bit for more. Not just for kids but adults as well, Each character has their own abilities and there are about 50 to play as, which you unlock through the game, The gameplay is very much a fun affair and as soon as you are finished you will want another dose of Lego wonder.

												I have played several LEGO franchise games, yet I love this one the most.  I made a mistake and didn't go for the stud multipliers early on so it got difficult to make larger purchases later on but it was more fun in that aspect.  I have played LEGO Starwars and Pirates and found studs were too easy to get.  Also the lack of a central hub was a nice change.  Having the whole Middle Earth to explore was amazing and as a fan of the book it was nice to have characters that werent in the movies to interact with.  If you are a fan of the movies, the book, or LEGOs in general, pick this one up.  It also has a decent play time to complete everything (about 30 hours).  I would give the game an overall 4/5.BTW, if you have a controller, its recommended since the keyboard controlls are pretty bad.			"

												I've played several Lego games through to 100%, and my favorites were probably the Star Wars Saga and Batman (the first one).The newer games are still great, but definitely different. There are now sidequests and an open world feel to the game.You literallly can walk from the shire to mordor. Tha'ts pretty cool, but that means the extra non-story content is enormous. After completing the storyline, I was only 25% of the way through the game. I like that a lot.I tend to miss the voice-less cutscenes from the earlier lego games. This game looks like it takes most of it's voice acting straight out of clips from the movie. Still funny, still a great game, and you should totally give it a play-through.			"

												This game is a lot like other Lego games. It's a mad romp through your favorite world, and it's a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. But, it's not quite as good as Lego Starwars III, or Lego The Hobbit. The normal Lego game system is pretty easy to grasp. You can play through the story, where you play as the characters who were there in the book or movie, and then, at the end, unlock the ability to play as them in other missions, and use their special abilities to unlock secrets. Lego: The Lord Of The Rings does this very well, with the Mithril Bricks, Minikits, True Adventurer, etc. The missions are loads of fun, with puzzles that are a tad glitchy, to those that are well designed, but hard!So, the reason that this game is not as good as some of the others from Lego, is that it's just not quite as... I'm not sure. But my other two Lego games, which I mentioned above, have a pizzaz that Lego:TLOTR just doesn't have. It's still a great game (although, if you play without a controller, finding your way around middle earth is an absolute nightmare, because the camera angle is never where you want it), and I heartily recommend it. But only if you've played through the other games first, and want some more.			"

												This game isn't challenging and you will have to replay levels. the combat isn't great and most puzzles are solved by breaking and building. however the game is very charming. Actual lines from the movies are used, sometimes out of context to tell the story of all 3 books rather well while keeping it simple and humourous. While the humour might not tickle everyone all the time some parts made even an old sourpuss like me crack a smile and sometimes a chuckle. A great game for people who want to get into lord of the rings or just for fans who want to shut their brains off and relax for a few hours to run around an impressive overwolrd or play some of the very well designed story based levels.

I was curious and for a good price I picked up The Lord of the Rings. I really enjoyed it. I wasnt used tot he camera changes, and this game is much better with a controller than a mouse and keyboard. A mistake I made originally with Star Wars. I plan to pick up some others of this set in the future. Gameplay : I really enjoyed the fun whimsical  aspect and comedy nature they game developers took with the story. The atmosphere and environment were really dead on adn in some times if you squint you'd think you were watching the movies. The world of Legos really does mend well with LOTR's. "

												This game is... incredible. LEGO games have always impressed me, but the depth and breadth of this game is  just awesome. A large quanitity of the dialogue sounds like it was pulled directly from the movies (maintaining audio quality, of course) and the LOTR soundtrack is perfectly laid over the gameplay.The environment is massive, spanning the entire LOTR trilogy. It's said that you could literally walk from the doorstep of Bag End to the core of Mount Doom - It's all entirely open world and full of little treasures to explore.The challenges scattered throughout the map add a fair amount fo replay value.Overall I definitely recommend Lego LOTR to my friends and other members of the Steam community.

												This lives up to a LOTR geeks expectations.I like how closely this follows the story of LOTR. One of the things I was a little apprehensive about was that this was the first Lego game to have dialouge, but it totally added more to the game and made it a lot better! This also has a lot to still do even after you beat the game with collecting mithril blocks to try to unlock all of the special items.			"

												While the actual game is as fun as it gets within LEGO franchises, this one suffers greatly from a distinct lack of humour. Playing Lego Star Wars, you get funny cutscene-parodies of movie scenes, mostly without dialogues, while here, they are scenes word by word from the movie, just with lego characters. It of course suffers of platformer sins, such as unskippable bits (screw you gollum and the swamp i have to look  at every time you pass it)Overall, it's a fun game, just don't expect to laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off.

												Fun, funny, enjoyable.  I've like Lord of the Rings for years now, this is a bit of a light hearted take on it but the basic story's there and many of the cutscenes have amusing bits added.  Gameplay is fairly good, it's my first LEGO game so I'm still learning how to play.  I don't know how it stacks up to other LEGO games but for the $5 I paid it was definitely worth getting.			"

												As a LEGO game, the graphics and comedy are top-notch. There is a bit more viol;ence in this title than others, due to the nature of combat in the LotR universe, but that shouldn't be an issue for all but the youngest of children.However, like other LEGO games, this game has terrible PC controls, and (at least as far a I could see) no way to change up the keybindings. I'll be coming back to this game when I have a gamepad but until then, I'm shelving it, after only about 50 minutes.RECCOMEND: Yes, to LotR or LEGO fans...but I'd highly recommend playing with a gamepad, if possible.

Definitely play it!			"

 Rating:  9.5/10 Short Version:  Must for Lord of the Rings fans LEGO humor Epic music Open-world of Middle Earth-what’s more to add? Use a controller (or you’re gonna have a bad time) No, you’re not too old to enjoy it A few weird camera angles that impede progress A couple buggy achievements (read a guide to get the bugged ones) Mini Novel Version: I bought this out of impulse on sale (75% off) and the moment I started playing, I did not  in the slightest  regret my decision. Actually, I was disappointed I didn’t grab The Hobbit-LEGO while it was on sale too. (I bought it the second the title went on sale again, since LEGO titles seem to go on sale pretty often.) What first sold me was watching the re-created movie cut scenes with the twist of LEGO humor. There’s about an hour and a half worth of cut scenes, which are definitely not a waste of time. The “voice acting” is audio clips from the movies so it’s obviously spot on. And the music consists of the same majestic scores you hear in the movies, making simple tasks like lighting a fire 1000x more epic.If you’re going for 100% completion on the game, it’s going to take time: probably 30-40 hours. I’ve logged 37 hours and I’m at 82% completion, but I do mess around. You get to unlock pretty much every conceivable character mentioned in the movies (and some from the books, like Tom Bombadil) which allows you do things like  ride a sheep around the Shire as Sauron.  Now tell me that didn’t make a “Thank you for your purchase!” email arrive in your inbox. The entire world of Middle Earth is your sandbox.As a side note, I definitely suggest using a controller. The controls are pretty wonky and unnatural if you want to stay true to keyboard/mouse.Really the only drawbacks would be (1) that you don’t have much control over the camera angles, which makes some areas hard to navigate, but those instances are minimal. (2) The fact that since it is a game made for a controller, it’s a “one button does everything” control system so you’ll definitely end up dropping an object instead of using it a few times. And finally (3) if you’re an achievement hunter, there’s a couple buggy achievements, so I suggest you seek out a guide to overcome them.But all and all, it’s a great game if you want to kick back, enjoy Middle Earth, and hit things with a frying pan ‘till money bursts out. Oh, did I mention that there’s a “Mithril Disco Phial” that plays a remix song of famous LOTR quotes that your characters rock out to? Yeah, just buy it.			"

Part of it is my inner completionist crowing in delight with how much I've done and the other part of it is just me laughing at the stupid jokes. It's a cute game for all that certain items (like the crowns and so on) give me nightmares. They remove the character's hair and replace it with whatever hat it is. Sometimes it work. Sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, it sometimes haunts you (like the duck hat). Also, spoilers, Boromir dies from a banana. A BANANA.It's fun, have fun, go play.			"

												It's LEGO, it's LotR.  You really can't go wrong.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the game so far, having completed the main story and finshed about half of the extra stuff.  The open world is fun to explore, the main quest line is filled with the typical LEGO humor while staying true to the movies, and the crafting adds a nice twist compared to previous LEGO games i've played.  All in all, i highly recommend the game; it's a blast at any age.As far as negatives, about the only complaints i have can be summed up in 2 points.  One, i wish the ""open world"" was more open; there are many areas that look like you should be able to get to that you either hit an invisble wall or ""bounced"" back to a safe spot - something that always irks me in games.  Second, there are quite a few random bugs to be found.  Getting your character stuck on a shrub or rock, objects that don't break when they are supposed to, and several reported ""100% denying"" issues where the save doesn't record you completing objectives that you can't complete a second time.  Personally i haven't ran into any of the last, but there are quite a few reports of people who have, so i recomend being cautious when going for a 100% completion.  About the only other negative i can think of is the fact that you can only use 4 save slots, something i find ridiculous for any PC game.  I realize it's a port, but still - there's just no reason to limit the number of saves on essentially any platform nowadays.  Other than that, i've highly enjoyed this faithful-to-the-source game, and recomend it to anyone looking for a casual, fun time!			"

												A fantastic retelling of the film trilogy with plenty of humour and puzzles to solve. There's a good 40+ hours of gameplay and it's the first game that I've actually wanted to complete 100% for about 15 years. The audio and dialog come straight from the film so everything feels spot on. The sandbox portion of the game allows you to explore a reasonably large recreation of middle earth with lots of nooks and crannies to discover along the way. There are also events scattered across the world such as the Battle of Helm's Deep, Climbing the secret stairs, and Wethertop that you'll need to revisit once you've unlocked more characters.If there was a criticism I would make of this game it would be that there are few annoying bugs that get in the way of a perfect experience. During the game certain treasures are hidden in difficult to find spots and the route to collect them requires you to change frequently between characters. In single player you have an AI controlled sidekick, so switching to the same character as your sidekick will give you control of the AI character. Your previously controlled character will then become AI controlled. Normally when holding down the change character button you'll get a menu of available characters, unless it seems you are on the edge of a ledge or hanging from a rope. In this case the control will immediately switch to the other character and your character who is hanging on the ledge will under control of AI decide to jump down to join you on the ground. This can be very annoying when trying to complete some of the game's extensive climbing puzzles ( i.e. Isengard ).There are also a number of HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE jumping puzzles that use fixed cameras. I must have attempted some of these 40 or 50 times before I managed to complete them. There doesn't seem to be any jumping assist code for ropes  unlike legolas' swinging poles, so these may prove difficult for some people to pull off.Overall I would say that Lego Lord of the Rings is a very polished and lovingly crafted experience and the few flaws it has can be ignored when you consider how much fun you are having with the rest of the game.

												When LEGO got ahold of the rights to create building toys after the Lord of the Rings franchise, it was only a matter of time before Travellers Tales would do the game for it and they did a decent job. The game is almost entirely voiced, not something that was expected going in (Up to that point, I had gotten used to the miming Minifigs acing out scenes like it was a silent movie) though the voice acting Isn't anything to write home about, it's all lines from the movies lip-synched to the minifigs mouth-movements, which, because the movies came out as early as 2002, don't sound so great now. The Voices in the LEGO Batman games sound good because they were recorded FOR The games, but please Travellers Tales, don't do this sh*t with LEGO Jurassic World. I gotta give LEGO The Lord of the Rings a 7.8 out of 10			"

												If you've played any LEGO game before, you know what to expect: a lighthearted, humorous enactment of the story in the three Lord of the Rings movies in a LEGO world. The gameplay is pretty basic but it can be quite fun at times, mostly due to the destructible LEGO-built nature of the world. The controls are however a bit shoddy, there are some bugs, the map is essentially useless and I didn't find the open-world elements particularly interesting. If you enjoyed previous LEGO titles and/or are a fan of the source material, you will probably like this game.			"

It's said that you could literally walk from the doorstep of Bag End to the core of Mount Doom - It's all entirely open world and full of little treasures to explore.The challenges scattered throughout the map add a fair amount fo replay value.Overall I definitely recommend Lego LOTR to my friends and other members of the Steam community.

												I may be a bit biased because I grew up with LEGO games (Lego Star Wars was the first game I bought myself,) but this game is ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL. This time around, they managed to take all of the LEGO game mechanics we know and love/hate and implement them in a semi-open world almost-RPG environment. Also, that environment? ♥♥♥♥ING MIDDLE EARTH. Yes, my friends, the greatest book series of all time, which was turned into an amazing movie series, has now been created in a LEGO world. If you aren't a Tolkien fan, this game will still be fun, but not NEARLY as enjoyable than if you are a fan. There are some annoying glitches and quirks here and there as well as a ridiculous amount of work for getting 100%, so only true Tolkien fans would be willing to put up with all of that. Still, I loved it and I think even a non-fan would enjoy as well.			"

												Con: Sometimes buggier than other Lego gamesPros:They put more effort into this game than others.  More diverse, interesting levelsBest character selection of any game yetThe regular group of ""skills"" needed to beat a level fits a ""fellowship"" wellThe voice clips from the movies are great... and often set up great comedyThe hub world is awesome: you can walk from Bilbo's front door all the way to Mount DoomMost refined Lego game yet, in terms of co-op, ease of access, and so onOverall this is a great buy, even if you don't play it today, get it on sale... someday you will be glad you did.

												LEGO: The Lord of the Ringsby DaniAngione----------------------------Art - 10 / 10Sound - 9 / 10Gameplay - 8 / 10Emotional - 9 / 10Community - 5 / 10----------------------------Overall - 8.2----------------------------Okay, so this is an easy one: It's LEGO. And it's The Lord of the Rings. TOGETHER. There's no possible way this could go wrong, right?Indeed!Before anything I'd like to admit this is not my first playthrough of this game. I've beaten it on the alternative (AKA Torrent download) version but - hey - I did bought it after all, it actually deserved it.It's basically a LEGO ""action-rpg"" (more action, less rpg) experience around Middle Earth, following the story of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy but also containing some neat candy for those lore-freaks (oops) like the stone trolls and the troll hoard - for example. The gameplay is that expected from a LEGO game: puzzles, basic combat, more puzzles, a lot of stuff to collect. It's not the gameplay that makes this game shine, tho. It's the around an hour and a half (plus mid-mission scenes) of rendered cutscenes full of the purest strain of Lord of The Rings Awesomeness.Seriously, they're worthy every nickel you could spend on this game.Not only they were smart enough to use the original movie dialogue for all the scenes brilliantly but they also managed to recapture the magic of Peter Jackson's trilogy and twist it into their own LEGO style. They're amazing and I can't describe them well enough - just buy it and see it yourself!Full of nice and fun moments, good jokes - some even going into the world of inside jokes and internet memes (They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard!) - and, well, LEGO and LOTR together - I dare say that this is the best single-player Lord of the Rings yet.And I mean it!

												If you like Lord of the Rings, or other LEGO games, then this game is for you. It doesn't have too much to offer after you get 100%, but you will have fun for the ~50 hours it will take to get there.The game does have its fair share of bugs, but nothing game-breaking or otherwise drastic. Most can be solved by saving and restarting the level.Other than that, this game is mounds of fun. Its occasional attempts at humor are well paid off, and make the game more enjoyable, even if just by a bit. If you are looking for an unexpected journey, I recommend taking a trip to LEGO Middle Earth.			"

												This game isn't challenging and you will have to replay levels. the combat isn't great and most puzzles are solved by breaking and building. however the game is very charming. Actual lines from the movies are used, sometimes out of context to tell the story of all 3 books rather well while keeping it simple and humourous. While the humour might not tickle everyone all the time some parts made even an old sourpuss like me crack a smile and sometimes a chuckle. A great game for people who want to get into lord of the rings or just for fans who want to shut their brains off and relax for a few hours to run around an impressive overwolrd or play some of the very well designed story based levels.

												This is the best looking LEGO game that I've ever seen, with real voice acting (mostly taken from the movie itself)! This is a very interesting LEGO game as it is not like your normal LEGO game where you have a main area in which you choose what levels to play, buy characters, check your progress etc. This LEGO game takes more of an RPG approach with a huge explorable world, doing the main quests (there are many side quests along the way as well) as you go along. I would definitely reccomend this game if you enoy  LEGO games as well as The Lord of the Rings!			"

												Score: 8 / 10Price Recommend: $12.99 or lessAnother installment in the excellent LEGO series. While this isn't my favourite one, it still is a wonderful addition to the LEGO franchise. All three movies from the Lord of the Rings trilogy are present and shown in wonderful Lego detail. As usual there is the standard array of silver bricks, character unlocks, secrets, cheat codes, bonus level and item crafting for use in free play. Giving you hours upon hours of entertainment. My only gripe is that the audio is ripped directly from the films, sometimes poorly, and it shows. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the LEGO titles or looking to get into them!			"

												The licence has been handled well, with several key scenes from the movies recreated exactly - shot-for-shot.  There is a lot of careful attention to detail, which is why it's a shame that it's so buggy.  This only really becomes a problem if you're striving for 100% completion but it does hinder pgoress or require you to restart levels a couple of times on a normal playthrough as well.  The formula for Lego games has remained virtually unchanged for a while now; the addition of voiced characters here is a welcome one and inevitable given the subject matter.  As with all of the Lego games, it is essentially a console port so it is best played with a controller.			"

												Should Legos talk? Yeah, probably. This is a fun, if simple game with a ton to do. The story mode is fun to play through, and then there's a ton of collectables to seek out as you unlock different characters. Unless you're actually playing through for the story, this is basically a good game to toddle about in as you listen to a podcast or something. It's easy (I mean, I'm pretty sure it's mainly targeted as a kid's game), but it's a fun thing to mess around with.It's also worth nothing that this has come a long way since LEGO Star Wars, the last one of these games that I played. I went back to Star Wars recently and they seem primitive by comparison.It's not terribly original, but if you like LEGO games and you like Lord of the Rings, you'll like this. It's also probably a good LEGO game to jump in on, since it does a pretty good job of guiding you through things, with the exception of a few obtuse ""puzzle"" designs.			"

												This is definitley not the most stellar game, but is quite enjoyable none the less, and definitley had me laughing at several points. A few necessary critiques are that the controls are not that well done, in that it has the same flaw as many games designed for console and then added to PC in that they try to make one button do way too many things. Also in the worst decision in video game history, the Siege of Minas Tirith is skipped over in a cut scene and not actually playable. Dumbasses.			"

 Rating:  9.5/10 Short Version:  Must for Lord of the Rings fans LEGO humor Epic music Open-world of Middle Earth-what’s more to add? Use a controller (or you’re gonna have a bad time) No, you’re not too old to enjoy it A few weird camera angles that impede progress A couple buggy achievements (read a guide to get the bugged ones) Mini Novel Version: I bought this out of impulse on sale (75% off) and the moment I started playing, I did not  in the slightest  regret my decision. Actually, I was disappointed I didn’t grab The Hobbit-LEGO while it was on sale too. (I bought it the second the title went on sale again, since LEGO titles seem to go on sale pretty often.) What first sold me was watching the re-created movie cut scenes with the twist of LEGO humor. There’s about an hour and a half worth of cut scenes, which are definitely not a waste of time. The “voice acting” is audio clips from the movies so it’s obviously spot on. And the music consists of the same majestic scores you hear in the movies, making simple tasks like lighting a fire 1000x more epic.If you’re going for 100% completion on the game, it’s going to take time: probably 30-40 hours. I’ve logged 37 hours and I’m at 82% completion, but I do mess around. You get to unlock pretty much every conceivable character mentioned in the movies (and some from the books, like Tom Bombadil) which allows you do things like  ride a sheep around the Shire as Sauron.  Now tell me that didn’t make a “Thank you for your purchase!” email arrive in your inbox. The entire world of Middle Earth is your sandbox.As a side note, I definitely suggest using a controller. The controls are pretty wonky and unnatural if you want to stay true to keyboard/mouse.Really the only drawbacks would be (1) that you don’t have much control over the camera angles, which makes some areas hard to navigate, but those instances are minimal. (2) The fact that since it is a game made for a controller, it’s a “one button does everything” control system so you’ll definitely end up dropping an object instead of using it a few times. And finally (3) if you’re an achievement hunter, there’s a couple buggy achievements, so I suggest you seek out a guide to overcome them.But all and all, it’s a great game if you want to kick back, enjoy Middle Earth, and hit things with a frying pan ‘till money bursts out. Oh, did I mention that there’s a “Mithril Disco Phial” that plays a remix song of famous LOTR quotes that your characters rock out to? Yeah, just buy it.			"

												This game helps me appreciate the movies a bit more through its abridgement and voice clips.  It's also a fun game.  Things to note though:.1. Don't bother exploriing the overworld until you beat the game.  It railroads you through to the end, giving you little chance to explore, buy characters, get mithril blocks, and do Free Play properly.2. This game does have the occasional glitch, including two notable ones that forced me to restart the level.  There are statues that let you save in the middle of levels.  Don't overlook them.3. If you want to blow up the shiny mithril pieces in levels, you need a Beserker.  You can find one at Helm's Deep in the overworld after you beat the game.			"

												I didn't have a ton of prior experience with Lego games but I am a big fan of LOTR. It is a blast to play through and I really enjoyed the light hearted take on the series. The story is told very concisely and almost assumes you have seen the films (it is definitely based on the films not the books). If you have no knowledge of LOTR I would not recommend the game. My one main gripe would be lack of fast travel system. Once I finished the game the map was opened up to me and I saw Tom Bombadil was labeled. I had to go see him and I spent about 10 minutes running in his direction on foot as no horses were nearby. After almost getting there I triggered a separate minigame which sent me all the way back to where I began when I finished. I still never bothered to go back to find jolly Tom.			"

												LEGO Lord of the Rings does not have the typical mute-Lego humor in it, there are actual sound clips from the movies for the voices of the mini figures. That being said, at first it's a downer, the gestures and facial experssions is what made Lego games so fun. But then again, this is ""Lord of the Rings"" we're talking about so there's alot that has to be conveyed storywise. Still they kept some humor in it (with props and such). This is one of the newest Lego games to date and is by far one of the most open-feeling. To top that like all Lego games; it has local co-op wich is great! A gampad/controller is a must-have as always. I recommend this game to any Lego game enthusiast.			"

												Awesome game. Instantly delivers. Real voice actors and soundtracks from the movie. If played with controller and with friends co-op it's even more awesome!I can only praise the game how cool it actually is, but there are few negatives I'd like to point out:1. There are often 3-4 characters you need to switch between. It would be really helpful to have the character names visible at all times. When a puzzle requires Sam for instance I don't have a clue which of the four hobbits is Sam. Also the controls for fast character switch work between two character and you need to use the Y button to choose the other two, strange.2. The coin hunting is somewhat annoying as about every bush and stone is destroyble with fists (ehh) and coins explode everywhere. And many of them even end up going to unreachable areas.3. Every character has it's own inventory so it's kinda annoying to find the right character to complete a certain puzzle or use a certain item.That's about all negatives I can think of. For me there has been no crashes or any bugs whatsoever.On a scale 0-5 I would give this game 4.			"

												If you’re feeling down, isolated and melancholic, there are two cures: returning to your childhood or killing some orcs. This games does both in a simplistic and relaxing style, invigorating your soul with the grandiose sounds of the epic trilogy based on the work of Tolken.	This is a great form of relaxing procrastination, yet one may argue its ease can cause infuriation via simplistic mistakes.			"

												Brilliant lego adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. As a long-time fan of the lego Star Wars saga, I give lego Lord of the Rings a 5/5. Between audio samples from the film and the Lego Universe's own style of story telling and puzzle making, hardcore fans and newcomers alike should be able to find countless fun in this lego title.

												This is another success in the Lego series of game. The only one i had previously played before this one was the Star Wars saga game which i really enjoyed so i was glad to see they had expanded on a winning formula and managed to keep fun as the main feature of this game. This game still has the wacky humour of previous games although has included the voces for characters instead of having mute characters. It still has all the stuff standard to all the Lego games like collecting studs in levels to use as currency, loads of characters with different abilities and collecting minikits as well as some new stuff. You have a nice open world middle earth to explore so you travel from level to level through middle earth. The open world has characters that give you quests to collect items found in the levels or craft them from mithril bricks which you can collect  in the open world or from completing levels. The items you craft also can be useful as well as being weird and funny The game is pretty easy to beat in story mode but the real fun is repeating those levels in free mode where you can use any character and item you've unlocked to play through the level which lets you collect items or explore areas you wouldn't be able to reach in story mode. It's a lot more difficult to try and collect everything in this game as there's just so much.The only complaint i have with this game is i found it to be quite buggy. There was a couple of occassions where i couldn't complete a level because of bugs (for example in one level all Frodo's items dissappeared from his inventory and i couldn't go any further because there was one i had to use). However while annoying it didn't happen often enough to be a major nuisance.So overall i'd recommend this game to everyone especially if you enjoy the Lord Of The Rings films or books. It may be aimed towards a younger audience but even as an adult i really enjoyed it. It's a great game to just pick up and play when you want to relax and just play a fun game. It's a 9/10 for me.

												This game helps me appreciate the movies a bit more through its abridgement and voice clips.  It's also a fun game.  Things to note though:.1. Don't bother exploriing the overworld until you beat the game.  It railroads you through to the end, giving you little chance to explore, buy characters, get mithril blocks, and do Free Play properly.2. This game does have the occasional glitch, including two notable ones that forced me to restart the level.  There are statues that let you save in the middle of levels.  Don't overlook them.3. If you want to blow up the shiny mithril pieces in levels, you need a Beserker.  You can find one at Helm's Deep in the overworld after you beat the game.			"

												I love Lego games: first, you don't die; you just explode and reappear in the same spot (you lose a few points, though). Second, there's nothing to be afraid of. Even the spiders are cute! The environment is colorful, blending well the Lego bricks and the lavish backgrounds. You might very well stick to your PC for hours... Unfortunately, the gameplay is not adapted for keyboards so it's very annoying to have the impression of playing the piano during a crucial battle! But, believe it or not, you get used to it. Of course, I'm not like you youngsters, I don't make a goal of being on the record list and I don't have a console, so I manage. Exept for a few freezes (due to my laptop, I guess) it's really a pure pleasure. The old Lego games are worth the actual 19,99$ but I hesitate to pay 29,99$ for the more recent ones: to many people are complaining about the crashes... ;D			"

												In this game you can really go through whole Tolkien LOTR story in creative Lego way. You are really building parts of the LOTR world. Rather funny at some points with new jokes not included in original trilogy. Awesome! Better controled with gamepad than keyboard. First part - story mode has decent lenght. Completing the whole game would take considerably more time. Which is occasionally rewarded with new cave or sth that wasnt available in story mode. But to my taste way too lenghtly. At certain point I just stopped.			"

												A fantastic retelling of the film trilogy with plenty of humour and puzzles to solve. There's a good 40+ hours of gameplay and it's the first game that I've actually wanted to complete 100% for about 15 years. The audio and dialog come straight from the film so everything feels spot on. The sandbox portion of the game allows you to explore a reasonably large recreation of middle earth with lots of nooks and crannies to discover along the way. There are also events scattered across the world such as the Battle of Helm's Deep, Climbing the secret stairs, and Wethertop that you'll need to revisit once you've unlocked more characters.If there was a criticism I would make of this game it would be that there are few annoying bugs that get in the way of a perfect experience. During the game certain treasures are hidden in difficult to find spots and the route to collect them requires you to change frequently between characters. In single player you have an AI controlled sidekick, so switching to the same character as your sidekick will give you control of the AI character. Your previously controlled character will then become AI controlled. Normally when holding down the change character button you'll get a menu of available characters, unless it seems you are on the edge of a ledge or hanging from a rope. In this case the control will immediately switch to the other character and your character who is hanging on the ledge will under control of AI decide to jump down to join you on the ground. This can be very annoying when trying to complete some of the game's extensive climbing puzzles ( i.e. Isengard ).There are also a number of HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE jumping puzzles that use fixed cameras. I must have attempted some of these 40 or 50 times before I managed to complete them. There doesn't seem to be any jumping assist code for ropes  unlike legolas' swinging poles, so these may prove difficult for some people to pull off.Overall I would say that Lego Lord of the Rings is a very polished and lovingly crafted experience and the few flaws it has can be ignored when you consider how much fun you are having with the rest of the game.

Now none of them were game breaking, well my game crashed once buts that all, and others were funny really.Something that I have not seen so far in the LEGO games i've played are ""fetch"" quests. Really great concept and it adds a lot of content to the game. There are some achievements that I found amusing aswell. It's always fun to beat another character to death with its self, then boom acheivement. OH ALSO if your going to 100% the game like I did just now that you need to create a custom character or you will be stuck at 99.8%. Like I did for a while until I got bored and made one for fun.

Otherwise, this game is definitely not for you. Even if you aren't a big fan, the glitches in the game alone are annoying enough to make you want to quit. I never encountered any that were game breaking, or made it impossible to complete the story.  However, many glitches made tasks that should have been simple almost unbearable. Even so, it's far from difficult, just annoying enough to make you question whether or not it's worth it to continue.TL;DR - Tons of glitches, worth it if you're a fan.			"

--- THE LORD OF THE BUGS ---Traveller's Tales, once again, surprised me with its incredible care in recreating the world and events of a saga into a Lego game. This time, the game is open world, which really surprised me, given that all the others were only levels, and all of the voices are those of the movies. From the beginning to the end, I enjoyed seeing how the adaptation went.HOWEVER, everything came crashing down when I went for the 100%. There are a ridiculous amount of bugs when you replay the levels in free play. Itens that don't appear, invisible walls, disappearing itens and a lot more - and not the kind of that only appear once in a while; it happens all the time. And during the free play you begin to realise the horrible gameplay and controls which are the same since the first LEGO Star Wars - it's outdated and just doesn't work anymore. Several characters that you buy are only copies of ones you already have, and more than half the itens you collect are useless.I looked on foruns, and there are people who COULDN'T ACHIEVE 100% BECAUSE OF BUGS. It was almost my case as well. They informed Traveller's Tales of this and, instead of fixing it, sended cheat codes to unlock the itens - basically, they're not gonna fix then.Only play this if you don't intend to achieve 100%. Otherwise, skip it and go play some other LEGO game less buggy.Not even my love for Tolkien's saga and the LEGO franchise made me tolerate this.			"

 Rating:  9.5/10 Short Version:  Must for Lord of the Rings fans LEGO humor Epic music Open-world of Middle Earth-what’s more to add? Use a controller (or you’re gonna have a bad time) No, you’re not too old to enjoy it A few weird camera angles that impede progress A couple buggy achievements (read a guide to get the bugged ones) Mini Novel Version: I bought this out of impulse on sale (75% off) and the moment I started playing, I did not  in the slightest  regret my decision. Actually, I was disappointed I didn’t grab The Hobbit-LEGO while it was on sale too. (I bought it the second the title went on sale again, since LEGO titles seem to go on sale pretty often.) What first sold me was watching the re-created movie cut scenes with the twist of LEGO humor. There’s about an hour and a half worth of cut scenes, which are definitely not a waste of time. The “voice acting” is audio clips from the movies so it’s obviously spot on. And the music consists of the same majestic scores you hear in the movies, making simple tasks like lighting a fire 1000x more epic.If you’re going for 100% completion on the game, it’s going to take time: probably 30-40 hours. I’ve logged 37 hours and I’m at 82% completion, but I do mess around. You get to unlock pretty much every conceivable character mentioned in the movies (and some from the books, like Tom Bombadil) which allows you do things like  ride a sheep around the Shire as Sauron.  Now tell me that didn’t make a “Thank you for your purchase!” email arrive in your inbox. The entire world of Middle Earth is your sandbox.As a side note, I definitely suggest using a controller. The controls are pretty wonky and unnatural if you want to stay true to keyboard/mouse.Really the only drawbacks would be (1) that you don’t have much control over the camera angles, which makes some areas hard to navigate, but those instances are minimal. (2) The fact that since it is a game made for a controller, it’s a “one button does everything” control system so you’ll definitely end up dropping an object instead of using it a few times. And finally (3) if you’re an achievement hunter, there’s a couple buggy achievements, so I suggest you seek out a guide to overcome them.But all and all, it’s a great game if you want to kick back, enjoy Middle Earth, and hit things with a frying pan ‘till money bursts out. Oh, did I mention that there’s a “Mithril Disco Phial” that plays a remix song of famous LOTR quotes that your characters rock out to? Yeah, just buy it.			"

												The LEGO series of video games are incredibly humorus in every which way. You can always play with your family / young ones without having to explain adult situations. The gameplay is fantastic, though some of the controls are a bit funky, having to go in by manually changing them to the one I choose to play wtih. Like what other reviewers have said, you will have the ability to play in the battles, even the first battle at the beginning of the movie, which is entertaining at the most. All in all, if the controls, and my computer stops making a wierd fps lag every now and then, I rate it 9/10. But if you see it from the gameplay and the story, 10/10. Fantastic game and worth the money.9/10 "

I wasnt used tot he camera changes, and this game is much better with a controller than a mouse and keyboard. A mistake I made originally with Star Wars. I plan to pick up some others of this set in the future. Gameplay : I really enjoyed the fun whimsical  aspect and comedy nature they game developers took with the story. The atmosphere and environment were really dead on adn in some times if you squint you'd think you were watching the movies. The world of Legos really does mend well with LOTR's. "

												As someone who is a huge fan of the movies, I was surprised at how much this stays true to them.The voice acting, and scenes are pulled directly from the movie.  In fact, you get to play many of the scenes in the movie, which is awesome!I waited till it was onsale to purchase, but I shoulda checked this game out sooner, because I believe it's one of the best LOTR games yet!

												Lego: The Lord of the Rings is a game that exceeded my expectations. That said, I was not expecting much when I bought it when it was on sale. However, I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish by the amusing cutscenes, and enjoyed the easy-going nature of the game. As a fan of the books and movies, I have to say that this is a game worthy of them. The art direction is beautiful. I think that the world of Lego and Middle-earth was well melded. Certain drawbacks would be the inability to roam around freely to other parts when the storyline has not been completed. I found myself having to multi-task (as a single player) to get the treasure boxes. But this doesn't draw away the fact that this is a really fun game. I'm going to go back to the game and find friends to play co-op with, and roam about with, too.			"

												I bought this becuase I had no idea what all these lego games were like.  I have only played it about 2 hours and I really have to force myself to play it so I am guessing these kinds of games are not for me.Basically it is a scripted story with a collecting mechanic.  The basic game play is:Watch a cinematic, then act out some event from the story, such as sneaking out of the shire while the dark riders are looking for you.   In between these events are semi-open areas (which I think you can eventually get fast travel to and take the story your own pace).  This is where the collecting comes in.  There are NPCs with missions who want certain objects.  So you run around trying to find and collect these objects.I find this kind of game play very dull and so, my interest in the game is fairly weak.  You could watch some lets play of the beginning of the game (it would take several hours to get enough game-play to make a good judgement) on if you would like it.One problem I suppose is that I already know the LOTR story so well that the whole story aspect doesn't offer me any incentive to play the game.  That is probably the big reason this game does not appeal to me.			"

												This might be the best Lego game yet.  It's definitely Lord of the Rings, with the strong story, setting and atmosphere - and yet its all Lego, with the silliness and sandbox gameplay you come to expect.The map is brilliant - much better than hanging around in the Cantina or the Batcave, you can roam around all of Middle Earth while you're not doing missions.  The addition of quests is very nice, as is the additional puzzles outside of the combat playgrounds.Instead of episodic gameplay, this game manages to keep the transitions from being jarring between gameplay modes, which helps keep the illusion in place that its one seamless epic.Great game!

												In a word: Fantastic.In a long, boring review: This game follows the path of the LOTR movies. The dialogue of the characters is also taken directly from the movie, as well as the actions and movements (although, Lego does put their own spin on some scenes). The exact mimicry of the movie scenes in the Lego LOTR game feels needlessly repetitive and somewhat dull, but Lego throws enough humor into the mix to keep things interesting.Perhaps the best feature of the game is the open-world aspect that is Middle Earth. When you're not following the main path in the game, you can go just about anywhere in Middle earth. You can take up quests in places like the village of Bree and Gondor. You can go to lands like Rohan and Moria. It's not greatly huge like the actual Middle Earth in the movies; in fact, it's kind of small (I could see Minas Tirith from Edoras, for crying out loud!). Nonetheless, it can take a person a while to get around the map, especially if they do all the levels. Also, there are plenty of quests to undergo that will have you go all over the map. In short, this game is a pleasant diversion and worth money and effort.So, please. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!			"

												I didn't have a ton of prior experience with Lego games but I am a big fan of LOTR. It is a blast to play through and I really enjoyed the light hearted take on the series. The story is told very concisely and almost assumes you have seen the films (it is definitely based on the films not the books). If you have no knowledge of LOTR I would not recommend the game. My one main gripe would be lack of fast travel system. Once I finished the game the map was opened up to me and I saw Tom Bombadil was labeled. I had to go see him and I spent about 10 minutes running in his direction on foot as no horses were nearby. After almost getting there I triggered a separate minigame which sent me all the way back to where I began when I finished. I still never bothered to go back to find jolly Tom.			"

												Very creative and love that it has the real dialogue from the movies. This is my favorite game thus far and I'm a big fan of the Lego Series. I wish I was a 12 year old kid so I could play it day and night. It's very entertaining, challenging, but not too hard. The graphics are so beautiful and I love that I can look around and then see this gorgeous waterfall or something. Haven't put in codes in yet, just playing it straight through on the first run and I can see there is lots of areas to explore.  Lots of characters I'll be needing to get and errands to run for certain characters. Haven't quite figured out the map thing yet, but again, more things to explore. I'll be playing this one for a long long time. I play this alone and with my husband and it's amazing all the different things going on when you play two player. We laugh our heads off at some of the expressions and comments, too funny.Very Fun game and lots of extra things to explore and discover			"

Pretty standard Lego format, so don't expect anything terribly challenging! The world map and crafting special items were nice additions to the game, but I did find that the platforming elements were very frustrating. I personally preferred the two Harry Potter games, but still found this a good time and quite enjoyable to 100% complete. If you like Lego games, this is a good one!			"

The puzzles seemed a bit dumbed down compared to some previous efforts as well. Overall a solid game and definitely enjoyable to smash your way through.			"

Climbing Isenguard depends entirely on if the auto-grab wants to work on your 20th try at a top rope or bar.Play for the fun and quit before it gets frustratingly broken on the map world.7/10 for being incomplete fun			"

It lacks some of the unique charm that the series is known for, and the gameplay, while fun at times, is beginning to lose its luster. Fans of the other LEGO games will certainly enjoy it; just don't expect anything you haven't seen before.			"

												If you've played any of the lego games you'll have a fair idea of what this one is all about. It follows the LoTR story relatively well (obviously it takes liberties) and the story mode took me about 10 hours on the first play-through.Essentially, you smash your way across the landscape, picking up lego 'studs' (money) solving puzzles and fighting lego monsters. The story is very linear, and it's not at all difficult. A couple of the puzzles were a bit touch and go... for example, I couldn't figure out how to kill Shelob the giant spider for quite a while... but it generally feeds everything to you on a plate, leaving you with what is essentially a hand-held but enjoyable little play through the LoTR universe... albeit in lego form.You can play all the way from start to finish unlocking areas as you go, without having to go back and repeat anything... but if you want to, you can unlock characters and go back to do parts of the game that you had trouble with earlier.If you're even remotely OCD then this one will really wind you up. There are so many little bits and pieces to complete (optional if you're not a completionist) but getting 100% of everything on every level is going to be quite a long haul.I've unlocked around 25% of the game after 12 hours... and that's just the easy stuff.The strength of this one is in the ability to go back after you've done the story mode and find all the extra little bits and pieces that you missed the first time. For example - there's a secret level where you get to play Sauron and smash up a miniature Middle Earth. I won't say where.There are dozens of characters to unlock. You can buy them with the 'studs' as you find them, and go back and collect the lot later on.There is no character progression to speak of, but there is a very simple crafting system, which allows you to exchange mithril bricks for items that you can discover and unlock on your travels.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did. I bought it for my little girl to play with, and thought I'd give it a try first. Suddenly, I realised I was hooked.Cons... the biggest one is the save system, which seems to be rubbish. A few times I had to repeat sections I thought I'd completed, because I hadn't found a statue which acted as a save-point.  Once you're in ""free-play"" mode after completing the story, however, you can save whenever you want.Other than that, and a few annoying camera angles, the game is extremely good. A light-weight explorer/platformer in the lego LoTR universe. Much fun.			"

												This game is AWESOME. The LEGO games have reached a new level of greatness. LEGO LOTR is not only funny, sweet and full of lovely details, it is an open-world game with the levels perfectly fitted in this world. There are so many things to collect, many sidequests and great backgrounds. The synchronisation has some nice speakers (even if it isn't great) and the characters have a great design. You have to collect a lot of stuff, but it is fine in my opinion. There are many original lines from the movies and there are very awesome achievements to unlock (even if like 70% of them are story-related). Another awesome feature is the great and original soundtrack. You're really getting caught by the whole atmosphere, especially 'Swamp of the dead' (or whatever the original name is).BUY THIS GAME. The collection of the Mithril-Stones and the controls can be a bit dumb and getting on your nerves, but it's still gorgeous.			"

												Let me start off by saying there are parts of this I really liked. The humor implemented around the movie dialog I thought was well done, and many of the gameplay aspects of it were done well. I've been a fan of the Lego movie games since the first Lego Star Wars, and gameplay-wise this game does some really cool things that I haven't seen before in any of their previous installments. The game itself was just as fun as every other Lego game I've ever played.That being said...The bugs are too numerous. The number of times I've had to restart a level or a puzzle because a boss got himself stuck in the ground or an object flies off into space randomly or something along these lines was....well....a pretty big number. Far too big. Not to mention it also caused my computer to completely freeze up multiple times to the point where ctrl-alt-delete doesn't even work and a hard reset is required. I'm running a pretty decent rig that has no problems whatsoever with Far Cry 3 on 1080p in ultra settings, so I don't see it being my computer at fault here. I want to love this game. But reading on some sites and in forums that this company doesn't patch their games at all, I recommend it cautiously. Just know that it might frustrate you way more often than you want a Lego game to.			"

												I've completed the game and while I still found the controls and camera to be your worst enemy, the game has a great open world and so much to discover that it will keep you busy for a lot of hours. You have to play through all 18 story level for the game to 'open up', but then it becomes much more fun to play and the control and camera issues are that important anymore. Also when playing the level in free play mode discovering the hidden areas and finding all the secrets really adds a lot to the game.While the early game play makes you want to hit your head against a wall, the longer you play, the better the game gets. There are still very rough edges in the game, but overall I really enjoyed playing it.The old version: The game is interesting and has a lot of content to unlock, but the controls are some of the worse I ever had to endure. The fixed camera during the 'instances' and the horrible close-up one during the free roam bits totally ruins the game. Combine that with horribly imprecise controls and a hard to guess 3D perspective and you have a game that is difficult for no other reason than messed controls and camera.If you endure the awful controls you might find a game that gives you hours of content, but I would recommend not to waste too much money to find out.

												This is the first Lego game I finished to 100%. I've got it on two platforms because I love playing it so much. You can ride around on the goats and sheep in The Shire and you can make Sauron jam to a silly dance remix with The Witch King. It's the first Lego game to feature actual dialogue and playing it first has kinda spoiled me for older games where characters just hum and grunt at each other. It's fun, lighthearted and easy.			"

												When I bought this game, I was expecting it to be decent. I've played some of the other Lego games, but after beating the campaign and getting all of the collectibles, I never felt an incentive to go back and explore. This is different. The amount of things to do is staggering. It felt like an actual, serious RPG (cutesy stuff aside). I was amazed at the new mechanics in the game, including a map with quick travel points. The game feels more open world than any of the previous Lego games that I've played, and I'm thoroughly pleased with this purchase. 10/10			"

Not just for kids but adults as well, Each character has their own abilities and there are about 50 to play as, which you unlock through the game, The gameplay is very much a fun affair and as soon as you are finished you will want another dose of Lego wonder.

												Like every other LEGO game, not as strong and cohesive as the Star Wars ones.It feels a little too easy for the most part, just a grind through the levels that mirror the movie, and those levels are very long.Also pretty buggy, like getting stuck in objects or interfaces you can't get out of, forcing you to restart the level or shut down the whole game.It's fun, but could use improvement.

												Awesome game. Instantly delivers. Real voice actors and soundtracks from the movie. If played with controller and with friends co-op it's even more awesome!I can only praise the game how cool it actually is, but there are few negatives I'd like to point out:1. There are often 3-4 characters you need to switch between. It would be really helpful to have the character names visible at all times. When a puzzle requires Sam for instance I don't have a clue which of the four hobbits is Sam. Also the controls for fast character switch work between two character and you need to use the Y button to choose the other two, strange.2. The coin hunting is somewhat annoying as about every bush and stone is destroyble with fists (ehh) and coins explode everywhere. And many of them even end up going to unreachable areas.3. Every character has it's own inventory so it's kinda annoying to find the right character to complete a certain puzzle or use a certain item.That's about all negatives I can think of. For me there has been no crashes or any bugs whatsoever.On a scale 0-5 I would give this game 4.			"

It has voices and full dialogue from the movies which I believe is a first for the LEGO video game franchise and is an amazing change from the usual LEGO gibberish dialogue. It is pretty much like watching the movies done in LEGOs with their typical comedic additions. If you love Lord of the Rings and LEGOs this is a no-brainer. 9/10.			"

												I'm not going to review this game as a whole, but compare it with other LEGO videogames. This one manages to stay true to it's formula, while still introducing some news. The best thing is that it recreates the The Lord of the Rings trilogy brilliantly, resuming it's story, adding voice acting and music from the films, and adding a hub composed of a mini Middle-Earth, with lots to explore. All the great scenes are here, and plenty of humor. In the end, it's not a big step forwand, but a very good LEGO videogame. However, there are some issues. Changing characters and items in free play can take some time, and doing so repeatedly can be annoying. And the game has more bugs and glitches than i expected: for example sometimes you can get stuck and have to restart the level, the game can break your 100% progression, and the 3D platforming can be awful at times. But despite that, it's a very enjoyable game, especially if you're a LEGO videogame and LotR fan.			"

												I think there are many iterations of LOTR games out there. Some based on single movies. Some include them all. Many I've seen poorly adapt scenes from the movie into gameplay that doesn't always fit. Or they'll force levels and gameplay that doesn't really go with the movies at all. The Lego LOTR game is great in that it encompasses all three films with stunning attention to detail. Just about every major sequence from the films is included in this game in one form or another, either as a cutscene, or as a cleverly incorporated aspect of gameplay. You name it. It's probably in there. Remember when the hobbits meet Aragorn for the first time and escape to Weathertop? Remember ""second breakfast""? Well, there's a sequence of gameplay where you actually make second breakfast (which subsequently causes the ring wraiths to spot you). It can be that granular. It's amazing. Ultimately, if you're looking for a game that gives the most fulfilling gaming experience of actually playing through all three films in a single package (and you don't mind Lego looks and humor), then this game is for you. There are tons of characters and ""treasures"" to unlock. And what's great is being able to traverse an open-world Middle Earth (albeit it's a bit minaturized in scale).My only negatives are the sometimes repetitive nature of gameplay. If you've played any other modern Lego game you'll know what I'm talking about. Also, horses. There are some moments you ride horses in between levels as a part of the story, but you can't spawn a horse on command which would be GREAT for free roam. Granted, there are quite a few quick-travel locations, but there's nothing really outside of a less-than-adequate nonessential item which helps you get around quicker.Also, the buggyness. I don't know how common it is, but there were a few points where the game graphically glitched out that caused me to have to close out completely....which was hard because the menu became invisible at this point. Also, there was a level in which you control Frodo and Sam and have to collect Orc armor to disguise yourselves to escape. Usually, you can get a character to drop a disposable object from your inventory so that the other can pick it up. Well, in this particular situation, if you grab more of the armor pieces than the character needs, you will need to restart because the game won't let you drop it for the other character to pick it up.There's also quite a few other sporadic blips and glitches that were kind of annoying but would take too long to mention them in a review, however, when the game was running smoothly, it was a blast.

												This is a fun game, especially if you like Lego's but...1. Lego games are clearly made with Co-op in mind and this is no exception, so that means you need two controllers or a keyboard and a controller + a friend if you want the full experience, though you can still play alone alright.2. It is one of the buggier games out there. The bugs are not many but when they do show up they are somewhat game-breaking. For example, the Sauron fight at the very beginning is sometimes bugged to the point that you have to restart the game and you can't skip the long intro to that fight. The Xbox controller suddenly began to cut out every minute or so, killing your character unless you disconnect and reconnect it in time.3. The game is poorly ported from the consoles. You can quickly tell that you were not supposed to play this with the keyboard and there is no guarantee that it will support a non-xbox controller. Unless you already play games with a controller, you have to ask yourself if you are going to buy one just for this game?4. This is not a big problem, but you will quickly notice that the actors sound like someone with a cheap mic just recorded Lord of The Rings when it was on TV and put those recordings in the game.Some of the pro's are:- Co-op is well integrated into the gameplay for multiple players to feel useful.- Graphics and sound are...well they are Lego graphics and sound; they are fun if you are into that sort of thing- There are a lot of secrets, little puzzles and stuff to do. Pleasant level design overall.- Girls seem to like this game so you may get your partner to co-op			"

												This is a fun game, especially if you like Lego's but...1. Lego games are clearly made with Co-op in mind and this is no exception, so that means you need two controllers or a keyboard and a controller + a friend if you want the full experience, though you can still play alone alright.2. It is one of the buggier games out there. The bugs are not many but when they do show up they are somewhat game-breaking. For example, the Sauron fight at the very beginning is sometimes bugged to the point that you have to restart the game and you can't skip the long intro to that fight. The Xbox controller suddenly began to cut out every minute or so, killing your character unless you disconnect and reconnect it in time.3. The game is poorly ported from the consoles. You can quickly tell that you were not supposed to play this with the keyboard and there is no guarantee that it will support a non-xbox controller. Unless you already play games with a controller, you have to ask yourself if you are going to buy one just for this game?4. This is not a big problem, but you will quickly notice that the actors sound like someone with a cheap mic just recorded Lord of The Rings when it was on TV and put those recordings in the game.Some of the pro's are:- Co-op is well integrated into the gameplay for multiple players to feel useful.- Graphics and sound are...well they are Lego graphics and sound; they are fun if you are into that sort of thing- There are a lot of secrets, little puzzles and stuff to do. Pleasant level design overall.- Girls seem to like this game so you may get your partner to co-op			"

												Lego lord of the rings is the best lego game ever! Being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings, this game was the best thing to have come. A huge free roam middle earth and the levels and characters and music OOOOOOOOOOOOHhhhh I love it! I remember back before this and the actual sets came out. Me and my bro were like wouldn't it be cool if they made sets and a Video game. One month later BOOM. Lego posts coming soon on their website. I was pumped to get this game from that minute foward. Didn't disappoint. If you like LOTR or even the lego games Or hell both. GET IT NOW.			"

												Buggy, buggy, buggy.  I spend the first half hour of the game researching how to get past bugs that were impeding my progress.It's also a great example of a badly ported game.This is my first Lego game, and I'm pretty unimpressed with the gameplay.  It consists of running to a spot and pressing the key it tells you to press.  Sometimes you have to press it rapidly.  Sometimes you have to hold it.  Sometimes you have to switch to a specific character to press the key.  But that's it.  The only other gameplay mechanic is smashing bushes to see what falls out.  Takes me back to my NES Zelda days, but it's not fun.The cutscenes and voice acting are the best parts of the game.  They've taken Lego liberties with the story to keep it moving fast.  You will appreciate this more if you're familiar with the source material.  Overall, it delivers what it promises:  A cutesy Lego romp through the LOTR.  I couldn't finish it though.  I know the plot already and the gameplay couldn't hold me.			"

												Lego: The Lord of the Rings is a game that exceeded my expectations. That said, I was not expecting much when I bought it when it was on sale. However, I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish by the amusing cutscenes, and enjoyed the easy-going nature of the game. As a fan of the books and movies, I have to say that this is a game worthy of them. The art direction is beautiful. I think that the world of Lego and Middle-earth was well melded. Certain drawbacks would be the inability to roam around freely to other parts when the storyline has not been completed. I found myself having to multi-task (as a single player) to get the treasure boxes. But this doesn't draw away the fact that this is a really fun game. I'm going to go back to the game and find friends to play co-op with, and roam about with, too.			"

You have almost every character you need to get all the minikits once you have completed it, so you don't have to replay levels just for studs. It's also nice that the landscape has little miniquests too. It's also just cute cuz it's lego!!!			"

After the first play trough all the levels the fun only begins, since you have a giant open middle-earth to explore and many collectibles to find to score that desired 100% completed.The actions can get kinda repetative sometimes, but that is something that has been in every LEGO game TT has made, so if you played one of the previous titles you know what you are getting into.

												For the most part, I liked this game. It's entertaining enough and the open-world, virtual map is amazing! The map is huge, very beautifully designed and you can roam around it whenever you want. There is so much to find and you can collect an astounding number of studs very quickly throughout Middle Earth. On the other hand, I have to say this has not been my favorite LEGO game. The levels can get tedious and a bit repetative in their nature. None of the characters can swim (you'll see why this is a problem later). Finally, there will be some bugs. The asthetics are certaintly more pleasing then the game but if you like open-world and especially ones that take place in your favorite trilogies, then I recommend LEGO LOTR.			"

												If you like Lord of the Rings, or other LEGO games, then this game is for you. It doesn't have too much to offer after you get 100%, but you will have fun for the ~50 hours it will take to get there.The game does have its fair share of bugs, but nothing game-breaking or otherwise drastic. Most can be solved by saving and restarting the level.Other than that, this game is mounds of fun. Its occasional attempts at humor are well paid off, and make the game more enjoyable, even if just by a bit. If you are looking for an unexpected journey, I recommend taking a trip to LEGO Middle Earth.			"

												Let me start off by saying there are parts of this I really liked. The humor implemented around the movie dialog I thought was well done, and many of the gameplay aspects of it were done well. I've been a fan of the Lego movie games since the first Lego Star Wars, and gameplay-wise this game does some really cool things that I haven't seen before in any of their previous installments. The game itself was just as fun as every other Lego game I've ever played.That being said...The bugs are too numerous. The number of times I've had to restart a level or a puzzle because a boss got himself stuck in the ground or an object flies off into space randomly or something along these lines was....well....a pretty big number. Far too big. Not to mention it also caused my computer to completely freeze up multiple times to the point where ctrl-alt-delete doesn't even work and a hard reset is required. I'm running a pretty decent rig that has no problems whatsoever with Far Cry 3 on 1080p in ultra settings, so I don't see it being my computer at fault here. I want to love this game. But reading on some sites and in forums that this company doesn't patch their games at all, I recommend it cautiously. Just know that it might frustrate you way more often than you want a Lego game to.			"

												This game is AWESOME. The LEGO games have reached a new level of greatness. LEGO LOTR is not only funny, sweet and full of lovely details, it is an open-world game with the levels perfectly fitted in this world. There are so many things to collect, many sidequests and great backgrounds. The synchronisation has some nice speakers (even if it isn't great) and the characters have a great design. You have to collect a lot of stuff, but it is fine in my opinion. There are many original lines from the movies and there are very awesome achievements to unlock (even if like 70% of them are story-related). Another awesome feature is the great and original soundtrack. You're really getting caught by the whole atmosphere, especially 'Swamp of the dead' (or whatever the original name is).BUY THIS GAME. The collection of the Mithril-Stones and the controls can be a bit dumb and getting on your nerves, but it's still gorgeous.			"

												If you've played any of the lego games you'll have a fair idea of what this one is all about. It follows the LoTR story relatively well (obviously it takes liberties) and the story mode took me about 10 hours on the first play-through.Essentially, you smash your way across the landscape, picking up lego 'studs' (money) solving puzzles and fighting lego monsters. The story is very linear, and it's not at all difficult. A couple of the puzzles were a bit touch and go... for example, I couldn't figure out how to kill Shelob the giant spider for quite a while... but it generally feeds everything to you on a plate, leaving you with what is essentially a hand-held but enjoyable little play through the LoTR universe... albeit in lego form.You can play all the way from start to finish unlocking areas as you go, without having to go back and repeat anything... but if you want to, you can unlock characters and go back to do parts of the game that you had trouble with earlier.If you're even remotely OCD then this one will really wind you up. There are so many little bits and pieces to complete (optional if you're not a completionist) but getting 100% of everything on every level is going to be quite a long haul.I've unlocked around 25% of the game after 12 hours... and that's just the easy stuff.The strength of this one is in the ability to go back after you've done the story mode and find all the extra little bits and pieces that you missed the first time. For example - there's a secret level where you get to play Sauron and smash up a miniature Middle Earth. I won't say where.There are dozens of characters to unlock. You can buy them with the 'studs' as you find them, and go back and collect the lot later on.There is no character progression to speak of, but there is a very simple crafting system, which allows you to exchange mithril bricks for items that you can discover and unlock on your travels.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did. I bought it for my little girl to play with, and thought I'd give it a try first. Suddenly, I realised I was hooked.Cons... the biggest one is the save system, which seems to be rubbish. A few times I had to repeat sections I thought I'd completed, because I hadn't found a statue which acted as a save-point.  Once you're in ""free-play"" mode after completing the story, however, you can save whenever you want.Other than that, and a few annoying camera angles, the game is extremely good. A light-weight explorer/platformer in the lego LoTR universe. Much fun.			"

												Even for the Lego games, this one stands out a bit.  There's a lot of really nice mechanics in this game.  Standard fare of a lot of different characters with different abilities, but this one lets you get items that can also bestow abilities, including better versions of normal abilities.  Plus a compliment of fun powers to have.  Large overworld map to explore, many things to do, and the game itself is quite fun.  Very worth it, particularly when it's on sale!It does share the same engine bugs that all the Lego games do.  Sometimes things can get stuck.  But I didn't find anything truly game breaking (even though one on Mount Doom came close - I had to save and exit at the end, and when I returned the credit for the stuff I'd collected was wonky.  Running the map another time, and recollecting everything, fixed it.)  There is also a very, VERY annoying glitch on some jumping puzzles where the mechanic designed to prevent your character from falling off of platforms can actually prevent him from being able to jump ONTO platforms.  Some jumping puzzles can be hair-pullingly frustrating due to this.			"

												LEGO Lord of the Rings does not have the typical mute-Lego humor in it, there are actual sound clips from the movies for the voices of the mini figures. That being said, at first it's a downer, the gestures and facial experssions is what made Lego games so fun. But then again, this is ""Lord of the Rings"" we're talking about so there's alot that has to be conveyed storywise. Still they kept some humor in it (with props and such). This is one of the newest Lego games to date and is by far one of the most open-feeling. To top that like all Lego games; it has local co-op wich is great! A gampad/controller is a must-have as always. I recommend this game to any Lego game enthusiast.			"

												LEGO® The Lord of the Rings™ is a complete and definitive Middle-earth adventure (unlike LEGO® The Hobbit™), and one of the better entries in the modern 'post-silent humor' era of original and licensed LEGO® video games. You won't get the feeling of boredom playing this game that you would playing other LEGO® titles after a while. The characters (in all of their skills and minifigure variations) are memorable like their literary and film counterparts, and there is always something to do and locations to explore. A must for any fan of LEGO® and/or Middle-earth.			"

												This game was the first lego game i ever played and I love it. It ties in more humour with the movie in a great way.I lost count of how many times i killed someone in the fellowship by accident. Or how many times they would follow me and then go *pop* so sad... Frodo kept saying the ring is calling and decided it would be great to walk RIGHT TOWARDS THE BLACK GATES! Frodo fell apart a lot that day.I absolutely love the little squeaks that come from Pippin. They're the best.I was a bit sad that there weren't that many of those awesome lines in this...Shall I go on? Well, if you say so...No ""They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!""No ""Leave now, and never come back!""No ""You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey.""No ""Po-tay-toes! Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew!""And iirc, no ""Tree? I AM NO TREE!""But there was the ""YOU SHALL NOT PAAASSSS."" \o/But that one soundtrack shall remain forever burned into my memory. And I am glad. You'll know what I'm talking about.Overall, this game is great! I got through the story mode and there's still way more to do. There are a few glitches that might happen, but restarting the level should help. I totally recommend this game to LotR fans and anyone who likes a good lego game.

												This one is an enjoyable adventure game filled with bricks and humor. If you like Lego and LoTR, you should definitely try it at a discounted price.There are few bugs here and there though and I had like 10 crashes, but still managed to see the end of my journey.Overall runs well, though the fps drops balls in many areas.p.s: Beware lots of collecting!

												I originally bought this game when it came out, back in 2012. I adored it. I 100% completed it on the Wii. It is probably the most fun LEGO game which I've purchased, and in general probably the best LEGO game out of all. I've been playing with LEGO since I was 4, I'm 14 now. I still like the sets, I still like the games. LEGO has a certain charm that keeps you coming back, and wanting to play more and more of it. But this game especially is amazing. It's not too long, and not too short either. It's worth the price, for sure. It has the right amount of LEGO goofiness in it, as with every LEGO game. I would give LEGO The Lord of the Rings an overall 8.5/10, as it's lacking in some areas, and I very much wish there were online multiplayer options.			"

												I wish reviews had a meh button because this one would be the biggest meh out of everythingStory:It’s LOTR (movie version) and sticks to the script pretty well. You play missions in order as defined by the movies and the appropriate characters are there as well. It’s good to remember the movie and play along with it but honestly, it just made me want to watch the movie instead of playing/ It does skip a lot of scenes like anything to do with Boromir’s dad, Rohan needing to be convinced to help Gondor, and anything to do with Arwen. It’s weird to see a lot of character progression and story telling go right out the window because it couldn’t be incorporated into gameplay which is understandable but I feel a better balance could have been met.Lego tries to throw slapstick into the mix which is appreciated to highlight comedy but LOTR is dark as ♥♥♥♥ so that contrast between people dying and comedy bits don’t really mesh “well” together. It’s the same problem LOTR HP-2 had; death and misery doesn’t lend itself to good slapstick.Gameplay:It’s a lego game. You do minor puzzles, break everything, and collect studs. Pretty simple stuff. HOWEVER, they actually added new components to the game. There are open and expansive hub worlds where you can do side quests, collect even more things, and get to the next missions. Unlike HP, it’s not one central hub that goes to each level but many hub worlds combined. You also use the silver bricks (used to be gold) to actually craft items which you might need for more collecting or sidequests. It’s nice to see them actually put effort to actually innovate. However, I never ended up doing any of the side quests because a lot of them required backtracking through the different hub worlds which wouldn’t be a problem because there is fast travel except for the fact that they are huge and mostly empty. Plus, the map is just absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥and doesn’t open with just tab for some reason. Hell, it’s hard to even tell where you are and which direction you need to go to find everything. I never wanted to explore the hub worlds either because they were empty and they usually required me to explore them after the game ended and ♥♥♥♥ that noise. Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game looks fine. It’s high res with all that encompases. The character models are especially good. However, the hub world rocks just look terrible as they’re just textures. All of the dialogue is taken from the movies but has just absolutely terrible audio mixing because they picked up background noise and their levels/emotions don’t match the visuals. It’s super distracting and I wish they had done it better. At Least the game ran fine at 144hz. Plus, the amount of dialogue vs grunts was good (looking at you Lego movie the videogame). Final Thoughts:Do I regret playing it? No. It was fun enough and what I expected out of a Lego game. A lot of care and effort was clearly put into the game which is much appreciated. But overall, they need a lot of work to actually be great. Everything from the basic gameplay, to the lack of story depth and consistency, and audio work needs work. I wish I could just say meh but whatever.			"

												In a word: Fantastic.In a long, boring review: This game follows the path of the LOTR movies. The dialogue of the characters is also taken directly from the movie, as well as the actions and movements (although, Lego does put their own spin on some scenes). The exact mimicry of the movie scenes in the Lego LOTR game feels needlessly repetitive and somewhat dull, but Lego throws enough humor into the mix to keep things interesting.Perhaps the best feature of the game is the open-world aspect that is Middle Earth. When you're not following the main path in the game, you can go just about anywhere in Middle earth. You can take up quests in places like the village of Bree and Gondor. You can go to lands like Rohan and Moria. It's not greatly huge like the actual Middle Earth in the movies; in fact, it's kind of small (I could see Minas Tirith from Edoras, for crying out loud!). Nonetheless, it can take a person a while to get around the map, especially if they do all the levels. Also, there are plenty of quests to undergo that will have you go all over the map. In short, this game is a pleasant diversion and worth money and effort.So, please. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!			"

												Lego: The Lord of the Rings is a game that exceeded my expectations. That said, I was not expecting much when I bought it when it was on sale. However, I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish by the amusing cutscenes, and enjoyed the easy-going nature of the game. As a fan of the books and movies, I have to say that this is a game worthy of them. The art direction is beautiful. I think that the world of Lego and Middle-earth was well melded. Certain drawbacks would be the inability to roam around freely to other parts when the storyline has not been completed. I found myself having to multi-task (as a single player) to get the treasure boxes. But this doesn't draw away the fact that this is a really fun game. I'm going to go back to the game and find friends to play co-op with, and roam about with, too.			"

												Buggy, buggy, buggy.  I spend the first half hour of the game researching how to get past bugs that were impeding my progress.It's also a great example of a badly ported game.This is my first Lego game, and I'm pretty unimpressed with the gameplay.  It consists of running to a spot and pressing the key it tells you to press.  Sometimes you have to press it rapidly.  Sometimes you have to hold it.  Sometimes you have to switch to a specific character to press the key.  But that's it.  The only other gameplay mechanic is smashing bushes to see what falls out.  Takes me back to my NES Zelda days, but it's not fun.The cutscenes and voice acting are the best parts of the game.  They've taken Lego liberties with the story to keep it moving fast.  You will appreciate this more if you're familiar with the source material.  Overall, it delivers what it promises:  A cutesy Lego romp through the LOTR.  I couldn't finish it though.  I know the plot already and the gameplay couldn't hold me.			"

												When LEGO got ahold of the rights to create building toys after the Lord of the Rings franchise, it was only a matter of time before Travellers Tales would do the game for it and they did a decent job. The game is almost entirely voiced, not something that was expected going in (Up to that point, I had gotten used to the miming Minifigs acing out scenes like it was a silent movie) though the voice acting Isn't anything to write home about, it's all lines from the movies lip-synched to the minifigs mouth-movements, which, because the movies came out as early as 2002, don't sound so great now. The Voices in the LEGO Batman games sound good because they were recorded FOR The games, but please Travellers Tales, don't do this sh*t with LEGO Jurassic World.

												Even for the Lego games, this one stands out a bit.  There's a lot of really nice mechanics in this game.  Standard fare of a lot of different characters with different abilities, but this one lets you get items that can also bestow abilities, including better versions of normal abilities.  Plus a compliment of fun powers to have.  Large overworld map to explore, many things to do, and the game itself is quite fun.  Very worth it, particularly when it's on sale!It does share the same engine bugs that all the Lego games do.  Sometimes things can get stuck.  But I didn't find anything truly game breaking (even though one on Mount Doom came close - I had to save and exit at the end, and when I returned the credit for the stuff I'd collected was wonky.  Running the map another time, and recollecting everything, fixed it.)  There is also a very, VERY annoying glitch on some jumping puzzles where the mechanic designed to prevent your character from falling off of platforms can actually prevent him from being able to jump ONTO platforms.  Some jumping puzzles can be hair-pullingly frustrating due to this.			"

												While the new (at least for me) weapon buildig system got me a bit cofused at first, the game is everything I would have expected and more. 90% of the 'story"" is covered by the game, there are MANY secrets to find, and the world is HUGE. And while I would have liked it if they followed the book more than the films, I can understand why they did so. Overall, the game offers many hour of gameplay, and while it took me about 50 to finish other games from this series, in this game I am maybe 2/3 of the way into it. I do recomend it to any LEGO and LOTR fan out there.			"

												Well there was no ""Hell Yes"" recommendation option so this will have to do. But I got this a few days ago and can already tell it's one of the best Lego: video games out there. It's mainly based off of the movies not so much the books and adds some great humor to them as well. 10/10 would step on again			"

												Though there is one or two glitches, this game is worth the slight annoyance for anyone who likes Lego or LOTR. Casual gamers will love but it is fun for even the more serious gamer. There is a ton to do and Lego games always cause a few innocent laughs. Honestly tons of fun and a good variety of level play style. GET IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT 10/10			"

												If you like Lego Games, and the Lord of the Rings, then this is the game for you! It's hilarious the Lego-y twists that it puts on the darker moments from the movies, the puzzles are fun to solve, and the open world is fun and cool to explore. I finished the game's campaigns forever ago, but I'm still entertained by running around Middle-Earth and racing pigs or finding new characters or collecting Mithril Bricks so I can make the Mithril Disco Phial (which is so funny). So yes, I strongly recommend this game. Though you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												In a word: Fantastic.In a long, boring review: This game follows the path of the LOTR movies. The dialogue of the characters is also taken directly from the movie, as well as the actions and movements (although, Lego does put their own spin on some scenes). The exact mimicry of the movie scenes in the Lego LOTR game feels needlessly repetitive and somewhat dull, but Lego throws enough humor into the mix to keep things interesting.Perhaps the best feature of the game is the open-world aspect that is Middle Earth. When you're not following the main path in the game, you can go just about anywhere in Middle earth. You can take up quests in places like the village of Bree and Gondor. You can go to lands like Rohan and Moria. It's not greatly huge like the actual Middle Earth in the movies; in fact, it's kind of small (I could see Minas Tirith from Edoras, for crying out loud!). Nonetheless, it can take a person a while to get around the map, especially if they do all the levels. Also, there are plenty of quests to undergo that will have you go all over the map. In short, this game is a pleasant diversion and worth money and effort.So, please. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!			"

												My favorite Lego game of all time. I get to share one of the greatest stories ever told (LOTR) in a way that is appropriate for a kid as old as my five year old niece.

												Traveller's Tales has done it again, another great LEGO game which will take all your time hostage. After the first play trough all the levels the fun only begins, since you have a giant open middle-earth to explore and many collectibles to find to score that desired 100% completed.The actions can get kinda repetative sometimes, but that is something that has been in every LEGO game TT has made, so if you played one of the previous titles you know what you are getting into.

												So, i do recommend it. Its extremely polished, and its probably the only lego game with voice acting, some people call it boring, i see. But, its kind of a personal thing if its boring or not, since it is incredibly story based as well, im a huge fan of the Middle earth stuff, and i decided to get this, i have not been playing it for long at the time im writing this, but i do recoginze a good game, and its not that usual for a game to go bad when you go further in, if your a fan of the story, definately get this, but if your an completionist and think that this is boring, get Lego Batman, it has tons of stuff to do, now if you will excuse me, i will go destroy the one ring ;)			"

												Let me just tell everyone that I am one of the biggest Middle Earth fans in the world and I like to play all of their video games. But for this one I feel like LEGO could and should have done better with this game. I bought this game when it was on sale for 4.99 so I feel like that is the only price you should pay for it because of these reasons. The Bugs and Glitches, I have found so many bugs and glitches in this game I couldnt keep track of them. One of them was a mithril brick in the Dead Marshes and it was at night and I had to kill the ghosts and their were 3 of them but 1 would not die it finally fixed itself after a very long time. one of the achievements were also glitched the it wont be that easy I have jumpedinto the lava as Isildur in prolouge as other people have done but it wont work. Another is the camera angles all LEGO games have this issue of having the worst camera angles when ever you try to do something you can easily over or undershoota platform and have to restart which is very frustrating. I love Middle Earth and this game needs to be fixed a lot so these bugs and glitches will not happen to anyone else. If you love Middle Earth as much as me get it just at a reduced price like I did. I had a lot of fun with this game just it needs a big patch.Thanks.			"

												Lego LoTR is a bug-ridden mess. I loved the other games (on the 360), like Batman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Harry Potter, but this one is a constant source of frustration.Crashes. Invisible walls in front of platforms in jump puzzles. Getting 'stuck' between objects. And the latest - can't defeat a boss because some sort of glitch (multiple reloads, verify, YouTube vids watched, intenet scoured - can't progress).Since this is an older game, and highly unlikely to be patched again, spend your money on some salt instead and pour it into a wound.

												Good game for a Lego game, with funny and creative scenes in the game.But the bad part of this game is that there are some things that can only be done by unlocking a certain character or a certain tool in the end of the game, that makes you go through the story all over again just to complete these things.Apart from that, the game is a great addition for Tolkein's fans.

												Good game. The story is following all 6 books and 3 movies quite good, but with some humourous cinema cadres faithful to the LEGO games tone. The game is quite demanding, sometimes camera working is little lame, so i wouldnt rate it as ""for child"". It's more for the teens, and adults which are fan of movie and want to have a great time. Game has a lot of collectables, to gain them all you must use powers of both good and bad characters, the logical quests are interesting, so aside the story mode it has a lot of replayablity potetnial.

												Turns out walking into Mordor was very simple after all. What the hell was Boromir talking about?!Anyway, I had so much fun with this game. The Lord of the Rings films are my absolute favourites so being able to play through the epic trilogy was just awesome, especially since Middle-earth has been made into a freely explorable open world which makes it even better. And because it's a LEGO game you of course get some great humour and a ton of laughs throughout your journey.I'll definitely be returning to Middle-earth again. This is the best LEGO game in my opinion. Or should I say... ""One LEGO game to rule them all."" :)			"

INTRODUCTIONAfter going through my regular searches for steam sales I stubbled accross this particular game that was $5, and knowing my history with privious LEGO® games such as; LEGO®: Star Wars and LEGO®: Indiana Jones, I thought I might as well get it to kinder to my child self. I played a GOOD 45 hours of this game, so i feel the need to write a review on it.Pros+ Many unlockable characters + Fun gameplay+ Funny cutscenes+ Great for all ages+ Good for casaul play+ Controller compatible+ NostalgicCons- Voice acting cuts outs, and maybe hard to follow for people who don't watch the LOTR movies- Using a mouse is not an option and you will have to use only the keyboard to play- Minor bugs/crashesCONCLUSIONAside from a few bugs here and there, the game is definitely worth the money.FINAL RATING8/10			"
