AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Jurassic Park: The Game Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Adventure; Story Rich; Atmospheric; Quick-Time-Events My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 7-11 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Strong narrative advocates; Casual gamersREVIEWJurassic Park: The Game is a narrative experience set as a sidequel to the original movie.  The actual gameplay is composed of Quick-Time-Events (QTEs) during action sequences and mild puzzles during the plot development sequences.  You won’t find wild, face-paced, dinosaur-fighting action, but I think any fan of story-driven experiences and/or of the Jurassic Park movie will find this game intriguing.The heart and soul of the game lies in the story and the characters.  I found the story to be absorbing and the characters to be interesting.  I will admit that I am a little biased because the original movie came out when I was a kid and at the time it was one of the best movies around for my generation.  I really liked how Jurassic Park: The Game was set as a sidequel to original movie and expanded on the events that occurred.The QTEs are a frequent topic of discussion when people consider this game.  I personally enjoyed it, because there are plenty of other games out there where I run around in with an assault rifle and a bandoleer full of grenades— so it was refreshing to experience action sequences in an alternate fashion.  I also thought it was pretty cool that there were different cut-scenes depicting the various ways you could die throughout the narrative; this helps make it less annoying and more interesting when you do mess up a QTE.The game is not without faults, of course.  In fact there are many faults.  They ranged from truly game-faltering, (for example: I experienced UI trouble where my mouse cursor disappeared and was forced to restart), to just annoying, (for example: I had to change the resolution one level at a time, each time waiting for the screen to readjust).  Then there were some things that didn’t really matter gameplay-wise, but still were a little ridiculous: for example, I found it jarring that the character of the aboriginal Costa Rican girl who supposedly grew up on an island was voiced with an accent you would find on a second-generation American Latina from Brooklyn.Nevertheless, I didn’t find any of the faults to be so egregious that they soured my experience.  I actually rather enjoyed the experience, despite the minor annoyances, and I legitimately remember feeling a little sad when I beat it because it was over.  In fact, I would say the thing that disappointed me the most about this game was just that it was a little shorter than I would have liked, because I was really enjoying it.I posit that Jurassic Park: The Game is an enjoyable, story-driven experience that will especially appeal to anyone who is a fan of the original movie.  You also should be comfortable with idea of playing a game that relies heavily on QTEs for action scenes.  If you want intense firefights with dinosaurs then you probably will want to look at other games.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												I love most modern Telltale games, so I started to explore their back catalog. Jurassic Park is the farthest back I've gone (excluding the first Poker Night) and wow, things done changed.The concept is the same as any of their other point and click adventures. What changed is the interaction system. And it's much worse. They clearly improved things a lot for the first Walking Dead.The problem comes from the quick time events. The amount of time you have to press them - especially when there are multiple in a row - is a small fraction of a second. This means that to get through some of the harder sequences you have to memorize the order of buttons to press. There's really no other way to move forward. It's super frustrating when there are long sequences with dozens of buttons you have to try to remember. This is just bad game design, as it makes it literally impossible to succeed on your first attempt.Add to this the fact that you can't skip cutscenes and having to repeat sections quickly becomes a chore. Having to stare at the same low-resolution textures for minutes at a time while you re-hear the same conversations you can't affect is not fun.The characters also make some really strange decisions that don't seem to fit with how they're established. It's like the writers didn't plan out the ending when they started. In the end, I didn't really care about any of them or what happened to them. And it was quite clear that my choices didn't matter or affect anything.So Jurassic Park has convinced me to stop going back with Telltale. I won't be trying out Back to the Future. But everything forward of this point is gold.			"

												After the first Episode was over I couldn't understand the terrible rap the game gets - it seemed mildly entertaining, if nothing special. Then Episode 2 started and the writing nose-dived...and then got worse. Stupider and stupider as the game progressed: Childish stereotypes; characters behaving preposterously because the plot demanded it to move things forward; dialogue composed of blithering nonsense; people explaining plot points that were then flatly contradicted by events five minutes later. By the end it was a total farce. The end-of-game credits explained all - they switched writers every Episode, and the guy who wrote Episode 1 wasn't involved in the rest of the game. Crummy, crummy game - 1 Clunestar out of 5.			"

												So I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this game, mostly complaining about the quick-time event controls. But that's not a problem with the game; it's a problem with the player!What I'm saying is, if you HATE QTE's, don't buy this game. If you don't mind them and you're a fan of Jurassic Park... well, this is very worthwhile.In a way this is a four part 'sequal-that-never-was' to the original movie and it captures the feel of JP perfectly.I really don't think the QTE's are that bad either, they aren't very hard and the game lets you get away with a lot of mistakes.Really, this comes down to how fussy you are as a gamer and how much money you're prepared to spend on good fanservice.

												I am a fan of telltale games, and I am a dinosaur. So I might be a bit biased.Jurassic Park: The Game is a game that if you enjoyed the film you would enjoy the story of the game. Telltale did a wonderful job recreating the iconic locations of the first Jurassic Park film. It introduced old and new dinosaurs, old and new characters. It continued the plot in regards to the Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos that was stolen the night of heavy storm that led the the dinosaurs going wild from the first film. The game tries to connect the gap of what happened to Dennis Nedry's attempt to sell the embryos for millions and the new characters introduced in this. This 4 episode story and the characters introduced are what makes this game good.Gameplay is point and click with quick-time responses. This is where I believe the game has the most issue. The quick-time responses are the most annoying, hassle inducing aspect of the game. Especially if you want to 100% achievement the game you will have to repeat a section over and over to time everything. Sometimes though you know what to do a button sometimes did not register or even at time a micro second early or late and you are off for the sequence of events. However, if you can get past this the story and dialogue in regards of the gameplay make up for it.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Telltale Games, enjoyed Jurassic Park or enjoy both. Though I had issue with the quick-time. The story and plot and new characters make up for it and make the game a ""should play""			"

												I must say, I love Telltale games. The Walking Dead 1 & 2, The Wolf Among Us, Back To The Future, and especially the Poker Night at the Inventory series - All excellent games that kept me enthalled, entertained and content for so many hours. Being a gigantic Jurassic Park fan and having watched all the movies and read the book countless times - when I saw that they made a Jurassic park game, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play it. Unfortunately.. this game fails to deliever on so many levels. Yes, they have the music. Yes, they follow the Jurassic Park storyline. And Yes, they manage to do an excellent job at submersing you into the Jurassic Park world. But other than that, it doesn't have much else to offer. The voice acting isn't the greatest, but it isn't the big issue. The big issues are the poorly sequenced context-sensitive timed events, the lack of impact that your decisions make throughout the storyline/game, and the horrendous amount of glitches that severely hinder your progession. Unlike other Telltale games, Jurassic Park makes you tap multiple keys which pop up on the screen for a mere second of time. I believe this is done to show you how many different death sequences they designed for the game (there are oh so many - in fact, they even put in a death counter to show you many times they stuck it to you). Next there is the lack of impact your decisions make. There is only one point in the game where your choice determines whether or not a character will live or die -- this changes the ending of the game, and it happens right at the very end. Lastly, the glitches. I haven't seen a game so mired with glitches after its release since ""Call of Cthulhu"" and ""Alone in the dark"". I had to restart sequences atleast 5 times in all of the 4 episodes of the game in order to progress through the storyline. Having said that, I was determined and managed to contend with all of the glitches, and progress through the abysmal storyline in order to make it to the end of the game, just so I could say that I've beat it, and that I managed to get my money's worth from playing it. -- But I didn't get my moneys worth.. in-fact, I strongly believe Telltale games should pay me for Alpha and Beta testing this atrocious blight upon my steam game library. Buyer beware - this game is not worth your time or your money -- although, if you liked ""Gone Home"", then you should give 'Jurassic Park: The Game' a try, because you obviously like terrible games and Jurassic Park would be an outstanding addition to your steam library of 'videogame classics'. I hope they don't drop the ball on their upcoming Game of Thrones videogame, or I will completely lose my trust in Telltale's ability to make a decent videogame worth playing. Thanks for reading and I hope my review was helpful!			"

												This Telletale game is certainly not on par with their more recent releases but it is still worth the nine hours of play. The QTEs had me struggling at times but the regular save points make it easy to overcome. I am not sure how many of the choices you make in the game effect the outcome, but I found myself wanting to more at the end. The different levels of completing each scenario are a nice touch but I can't see what the result is of getting a gold over a bronze, apart from maybe an achievement. Would recommend, but not at full price, wait for a 75% reduction and you'll have a decent buy.			"

												Before buying/playing this game, ask yourself two things:1) Do you love the Jurassic Park story? (of course you do)2) Do you love the Jurassic Park story enough to deal with a whole game being based around QTE-style (Quick-Time Event) gameplay?If your answer to the second question is yes, then you will undoubtedly love this game for the story quality alone, if nothing else. The story is based at the same time as the first movie, and it revolves around Gerry Harding (from the first movie) and his daughter who find themselves in the midst of the storm (the very same storm from the movie), who must find a way to escape the island. Throughout the game they come across various problems, which you as the player must solve.The game is your standard ""adventure"" genre game, you go from scene to scene, you look for clues or things to use, and you move on to the next scene. Once in a while you will find yourself being chased down by a dinosaur however, and that is where the QTE gameplay sets in - which at times can be dreadful, but it will really only be frustrating if you insist on obtaining all the achievements for the game.I am baffled to see the game being rated so poorly (54/100 metacritic), which is mainly due to the fact that people wanted more than just a QTE-based game, which fair enough would have been nice, but it is not like the game was ever advertised differently - it is just people whining that they did not get what they wanted.Like I said in the beginning, if you are a Jurassic Park fan, this game will be enjoyable. If you want lots of action and interactive gameplay, this might not be for you.			"

												One of the primary reasons why the original Jurassic Park film from 1993 is so great is Spielberg's excellent blend of adventure and suspense. One moment you're gazing at the amazing dinosaurs, that graphically, hold up really well today; and the next moment your clenching your buttcheeks as the Trex and raptors are trapping the intrepid explorers in cars, trees and kitchens. Spielberg sucks you in, chews you and spits you out. It's a very immersive experience. Immersion is where the game then misses the mark.Considering that all of the game's action sequences are entirely played out with quick-time events you're at the game's mercy when it comes to survival. While this would be tense and suspenseful in other game, Jurassic Park: The Game consitently pops a shiny healthbar in your face right before the action begins. Both spoiling the surprise and giving you a reason, other than your survival to play for (namely medals). It draws you out, while a moment before you were still sort of among the creatures of yore. The immersion breaking doesn't end there. The character models often act and move like poorly articulated puppets, and their props tend to float around in their hands. Furthermore, when they move, they often run straight toward the doorpost in one angle, but safely sail through the door opening in the next. When the action subsides you'll be solving puzzles. By my account I played maybe four actual puzzles and everything else was related to sequential dialog options. It's a shame though, because the game really thrives when it plays with its source material; showing you sections of the park that weren't shown in the films. It game is at its best at the end, where it fully embraces it's Spielberg roots by going straight back to Jaws. However, on its downtime, it is rather dissapointing.			"

												Jurassic Park: The Game is one of those games you will really enjoy if you were a fan of the films. Telltale the developer, has done a wonderful job recreating iconic locations from the film, and at the same time introducing new dinosaurs with a whole new story. It takes place during/after the events of the first film with a whole new cast of characters, so there’s plenty of original content for those thinking it’s just a recreation of the film.The story and characters are at the heart of Jurassic Park. Gameplay is point and click and although fun, it’s nothing terribly interesting that most people have probably already experienced in The Walking Dead (a more popular game by Telltale). The characters are well made and each has their own distinguished personality that fits into the story in one way or the other. Generic is not a word I would use to describe any of them. The story is filled with plenty of unexpected moments and has great pacing while being spread over 4 episodes that will probably take you 7-8 hours to finish.The game reminded me of the film so much that I just had to go back and watch it again. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has even the slightest interest in Telltale games or the Jurassic Park series. It’s certainly an adventure to remember!			"

												Great game if you are a Jurassic Park fan. It is very short though, 4 episodes total and i spent 6 hours beating all 4 with some paused time and 17 deaths. So I could see this being a 5 hour game for some. With that said you might want to get this during a sale. full price which i Think is 30 bucks is not worth it at all. but if you can get it on sale it is enjoyable. This is only the second Telltale game ive played with this style of gameplay. The Other being Game Of Thrones. So far through 2 episodes of Game of thrones I would compare the two with Jurassic Park being more difficult but Game of Thrones episodes are longer and It has a better story. Jurrasic park is more in your face action packed just like the movie. Jurassic Park also has a bit more of a puzzle element that so far Game of thrones lacks. To sum it up get this on sale if you like Jurassic park or the other telltale games of this style. If its not on sale or you are not a fan of the interactive movie type games then I would stay away.			"

												The story started out great and very promising. Too bad it didn't last long. 3 weeks now, and I've still not completed the game. Finally decided to call it quits when the only character I like went bonkers. Just, no. + It's Jurassic Park.+ Graphic's alright.+ Voice acting is quite good.- Story is annoyingly slow.- Weird characters development. - QTEs, QTEs, and more QTEs (I don't mind them in games, but not in almost the entire gameplay)- Unskippable cut scenes. - Bad controls; sometimes keys don't register during the QTEs. - And sometimes the mouse cursor disappears too. Had to restart the game every time that happened.- Irrelevant choices for dialogues in certain scenes. - Very weird music choices for some parts of the game.I love Jurassic Park and I wanted this to be good. I can forgive a lot of things if only the story is good. But it's not. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the franchise, skip this. Even if you're a die-hard fan of the franchise, buy this only if it's heavily discounted.My Rating: 4/10			"

												This is weird case where I sort of liked it but can't really recommend it. It's incredibly linear, the gameplay is mostly limited to Quick-Time Events, and the story isn't especially great. That said, I thought the characterisation was quite strong for the most part, and while it's not exactly graphically impressive the visual design compensates for it well enough. I got it on sale for $7.50, and I don't really regret buying it or playing it, but chances are you'll find it a disappointment compared to other games by this developer.			"

												Consider this game about a 6/10.  Add a point if you are a fan of point-and-click games, especially those made by Telltale (as am I), and add another point if you are a fan of the Jurassic Park intellectual property (as am I).The game takes place during and immediately after the events of the first film, and mostly follows Jurassic Park chief veterinarian Gerry Harding as he attempts to make his way off of Isla Nublar with his daughter.  The plot thickens as a corporate espionage scheme to recover Dennis Nedry's stolen dinosaur embryos goes awry, and the few stranded survivors left on the island find themselves hunted by a previously unknown species of dinosaur.As far as plots go, it's one of the better ones you'll see in a movie tie-in.  Dialogue is surprisingly natural, and the game reuses a lot of hallmark music and sound effects from the films.  None of the films' main characters are featured in the game, but fans of the movies and books will appreciate how ""Jurassic Parky"" the game feels as it tells its story.Jurassic Park: The Game by Telltale Games is an enjoyable experience, but it suffers from quite a few technical glitches and just generally isn't as polished or deep as the company's subsequent masterpiece, the Walking Dead series.  Character voices tend to have a strange echo to them, more noticeable during quieter moments than during action scenes.  Occasionally, going to the main menu will cause your in-game mouse pointer to disappear, necessitating a reload from the last checkpoint.  Conversations with other characters are okay, but rarely do your choices of what to say have any real impact.  These problems are minor, but numerous.As this is a highly linear, character-driven game, there are long story segments with little to no real gameplay; if you enjoy point-and-click games you'll know what to expect, but it may be a bit slow-paced for unaccustomed gamers.  Quick-time events are sometimes a bit flat, but the good ones are quite thrilling: you'll be hunted by velociraptors, chased by tyrannosaurus rex, and even stalked by a giant underwater mosasaur.If you are an avid pointer-and-clicker, and especially if you're a fan of Telltale, consider this game.  If you like Jurassic Park, definitely consider this game.  Don't pay full price for it, but give it a chance.			"

												First of all I must say I didn't want to buy this game. It came with the ""Telltale Package"" I bought and I gave it a try. I was expecting a ""Walking Dead"" with dinosaurs but that's not exactly true. The gameplay is pretty similar on the few-puzzles end but with less decision making and more quick time events plus not everything you do has a timer. QTEs are  a big part of the game so I you don't like them you are going to have a bad time. More so because they are harder than any game I played so far (generally speaking) but I guess they were made this way to add a layer of difficulty and replayability considering every episode has a score system. Perfectionists are going to want to have a gold score on every episode and I don't think it's that bad to die every now and then. But I really wonder if there are people who ace all QTEs on the first try. Camera and character controls are another matter. They are lazy to say the best and exploration is non-existent. There are at best 4 angles in an area and once there you use the keyboard to use the camera. The KEYBOARD!!! Story is connected to the first movie which is kinda cool and has many well thought references which is cooler and progression is similar to every mainstream story out there. It also has its share of plot twists. The ones near the end are totally stupid and bad guys are even more stupid but I didn't expect much anyway so yeah...Graphics are exactly like in the screenshots and OK in my opinion. They don't matter much anyway...Soundtracks are pretty good. Some of them I recognize from the movies, some from every horror movie ever and some I don't know. The movies' original score is used frequently and that's a right choice if I ever saw one.For me this was kind of a free game and I don't regret playing it. But I wouldn't pay more than a couple of bucks.+ Soundtracks+ Balanced difficulty+ Story references- Emberassing camera- Lazy controls- Lame♥♥♥♥♥plot twists- ""Bad guys""6/10			"

 Overview  Jurassic Park: The Game is one of the many Telltale episodic games on the marketplace. Taking place simultaneously with the first film, Telltale’s adaptation of Jurassic Park hoped to reclaim some of the magic of the film franchise. As a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise and an eager participant in all things dinosaurs, Jurassic Park: The Game falls flat in all regards, ultimately leaving me frustrated and disappointed.As mentioned, the story takes place in and around the first movie, from the eyes of Mr. Gerry Harding, the generic “Rice Puffs” cereal to the witty and charming snap, crackle and pop “Rice Krispies” Alan Grant we’ve come to know and love. Alongside him is his ambiguously rebellious “let’s run off to smoke in the raptor-infested hallway” of a daughter, a slew of random mercenaries who took firearm practice from Stromtroopers and a scientist whose knowledge seems to come from Devry University’s fast-track courses in situational awareness and dinosaur “know how”. Finally, we have the dinosaurs, a rag-tag group of idiots who can’t tell prey from a broken helicopter [seriously, this happens]. Much like those who’ve come to expect great stories driven by ambiguous twists and turns that leave the player dubious as to whether or not they are making the right decisions at all, Jurassic Park feels much more linear and barebones, taking me from one scenario to the next without letting me decide where or how I wanted to proceed there. With little dialogue and even fewer choices [die or don’t die], you’re left wondering if you’re making any choices at all. In short, you’re not.To compare this game to the later works of Telltale seems unfair to a point. In later games, you’re given a multitude of choices that will change the story depending on how you interact with the various characters and situations. With Jurassic Park, it is nearly impossible to have any of that; the game is centered around a “medal” system, which the player earns based on how many quick time events [QTEs] they complete accurately. Performing perfectly will get you a gold medal, then silver, then bronze and then no medal at all. Achievements are only rewarded for a gold medal, making replaying the game necessary, or reloading from quick saves mid-game to earn them, which is a massive chore. What the medal system does is force the story to play out one way for those who want the achievements, or just want to get the QTEs right, shredding any possibility of player decision. For example, there was a point there I was on a failing helicopter, going hand-to-hand against an adversary. In one instance, I failed a QTE and he was stabbed in heart, surely killing him, but because failing said QTE gave me a silver medal and no achievement, I reloaded it and got a gold medal, which doesn’t end the scenario with my character being gutted like a fish. Did he die in the first playthrough? Maybe, but who cares; I wanted the achievement, forcing me to play it a certain way. Much like the tour in the game, or the rollercoaster scene where you beat raptors with lead pipes [seriously, this happens too], this game is all on rails. Keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times; we here at Jurassic Park are not responsible for any lost or stolen expectations. Enjoy the ride.  Pros   There’s dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs. That’s it…no seriously there are no more pros. Cons    Medals – The game’s achievements center around perfectly timing every button, resulting in you replying certain sections over and over again to get them right. Character Dialogue – It’s bad. The dialogue is stiff and ridged and you often find the characters discussing trivial matters when death is at their doorstep. There’s zero sense of urgency.  Story – It’s dull, uninteresting and often the changes in the character dynamics feel forced. I never cared about any of the characters. Choices – There are few and very rarely do they make a difference in what happens. No Key Binding - The space bar pauses the game and there is no key binding options. I must’ve hit that button 4,193 times while playing this game so far. It is beyond agitating. Overall, Jurassic Park: The Game is a tremendous letdown. Telltale makes some amazing games, ones I’ve had a hard time putting down and often find myself wanting to go back and play it a different way. The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead and Borderlands to name a few, but none of them resemble this debacle. I suggest looking elsewhere to get your dinosaur or Telltale fix; you’ll just end up with a bad taste in your mouth from this one.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game. But apart from it being terribly corny, the movement system is the worst I've seen in a Telltale game. It plays nothing like TWD. The game is essentially a bunch of button-mashing to perform the most menial tasks (e.g. you have to mash like crazy during one scene to simply look in a direction). Disappointed.			"

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- It almost feels like another Jurassic Park movie, the story really is that good.- The puzzles elements to the game are varied and imaginative.- Really good use of licensing and ties in with the original 1993 movie brilliantly.- Lots of tense and memorable scenes involving both old and new dinosaurs.- Awesome character building as usual from Telltale.- More challenging then other Telltale instalments.CONS:- The voice acting is just lame and a real let down.- Graphically the game is below average, the dines look good but the game isn't that old.- The quick time events are often unnecessary at times and would benefit from a normal scene.- Just four episodes, shortest Telltale game I've played.- The structure of interaction took some getting used to as its slow and a little awkward.- Decision making is varied but theres no real indication that your decision have an effect on the game.VERDICT? Being one of the earliest Telltale game you can see where they took direction and done away with lots they tried in this game, for the better. Superficially the games poor but  the story and fact it was Jurassic Park meant I enjoyed it.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Jurassic park the game so much promise. I have to say that for the most part, it delivered quite well. Playing is a thoroughly satisfying experience, and the moments of suspense keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, as you play you begin to really have an appreciation and liking for the characters. The story is a Huge part of this game. The graphics are okay.Gameplay.The style of interaction can be hard to get used to, but is rewarding in the end. The distinct impression that I get while playing is that of an interactive movie. While this was what I was hoping for, it might not appeal to everyone. There is a fair amount of puzzle solvingOverall: a great game, a must-have for any JP fan, Especially coming from a fairly independent developer (Not a big-name like Ubisoft or Bethesda)			"

												An Licensed Jurassic Park Game by Telltale Games which plays around the happenings which you can find in the first Jurassic Park Movie,it answer some questions you got from jurassic park 1 and has some interesting crossovers and backstory.Its a great story and if you get easy into feeling games then you will get easy into this one.WARNING : You find in this game alots of quicktime events,if you dont like those and other telltale games had to much for you then dont buy this game.I recommend an xbox 360 controller because of that.Its hardly seen  on any sales unfortinate.Its for the roughly 5-6hours time to getting through (4 episodes) the game too expensive on steam (at the moment 27,99€).only recommend it if .: you get it on any sale or if you really want to play it ,but be aware of the qucktime event warning.

												Addressing an extremely common complaint: The mouse cursor disappears when overlay is used, alt-tabbed, minimized, or if the game gets bored (randomly). Playing with deactivated overlay and windowed mode to prevent accidents  solves the issue completely!Telltale's Jurassic Park is the fourth Jurassic Park ""movie"" from 2011.  It's the game that made TT experimenting with quick time events - but the lack of care and the lack of experience made the game into something that feels like a fourth iteration of a franchise. Identifiable, familiar, but lacking soul, content and care. Don't buy it for more than 3-5$, as it's plagued by so many defects.The characters are cardboard cutouts who has one personality, that may change instantly if it's required for the plot to move on.  The cool allowing dad turns strict to make the player sadder when he's separated from his daughter, and make the reconnection happier, while the scene is extremely lacking.  The clever, patient scientist who had no problem with the group, suddenly gets fed up when she's told ""then make [the phones] work"" AFTER it's their only way of communicating with the mainland (That's the most logical thing to do!!), only for the mercenary to snap at her, and make it into a moral crisis/dilemma and move the plot.   Or the girl, who wonders at a dinosaur story with genuine enthusiasm, only to be sad and depressed one dialogue later at the same spot. The same girl can only remember Mosasaur's name as ""Mossa-whaat?"". Who the f**k forgets the -saur part when his father is the chief vet on the island with dinoSAURS?   Oh, and the vet apparently doesn't know about the mosasaur in the park while he's the *chief vet*. And there is an aquarium exhibit - and he doesn't even stop to think then why is a huge exhibit if they don't have naval dinosaur(s) ? Oh, and at least 4 times happens that someone picks up something, completely forgetting about the guy who wants to knock him out or the T-REX BEHIND HIM. Yes, it happened. Just a scene after the T-rex sneaked up on him... this is not everyday stupid on the scripwriter's part.The plot is like an action movie. Run run run dodge run dodge run attack dodge run. There is a mash-W QTE for reading footprints! THRICE. And for starting a car with a key,which would be a single turn! Though one good thing regarding gameplay: not too hard, but point-and-clickish puzzles that are totally missing from newer TT games.And mentioning quick time events - they are really, really bad. A single circle can contain 3-4 directions to press, only the first visible at first, but they have incredibly short time to react, less than half a second (often with unintuitive directions). Which would be okay - hard QTE, right? NO, as it's the same every single time you would re-try the scenario to make it flawlessly, so no reflexes are involved, but memory. Or buttonsmashing, as most of the QTEs don't register other buttons, just accept the good one - so you can just smash wasd and get gold in 80% of the game, destroying the point of the whole QTE. The system was worth implementing, really.Voice and music-wise the game is weird, to be honest. There are genuine Jurassic Park music parts, which is good. There are genuine T-rex and raptor sounds, which is awesome. But why does Oscar's and the raptors' step sound the same? Why is the T-rex roaring while busy eating someone? How can it later roar with closed mouth? How can people talk without opening their mouth? Why are their voices echoing on the open, huge beach? (4 person, one whole scenario) Why do the Troodon sound like angry leopards, and why do they have to ""roar"" every 3 second? And a bonus question: if you don't move, why does it make the T-rex deaf? Gerry and Jess were yelling to each other while not moving to not to be noticed. Good job.And some other fun stuff: main menu loads in around 5 seconds every time. If you want to reload your last save, 5 seconds. Then the loading itself (10-20seconds). Before a scene change the game freezes for 2-3 seconds. Actors move and teleport randomly while not on screen - lying one is already up and metres away in 2 seconds, mosasaur is charging from the other side of the pool to unseen people 3 seconds after they just swam past it's tail.  Makes the flawless achievements a real chore, especially when in a certain fighting scenario the game repeatedly has a massive lagspike during a QTE, making it even harder to complete. And not to forget the disappearing mouse cursor that was reported as a bug in topics from 2013, and there is still no official, pinned solution for that.			"

Even though this is not one of Telltale's finest, it's still a good little game. But don't pay full price for it, unless you really want to support Telltale Games; the game is way too short for that.+ Dinos! It's no spoiler when I say that the films' loveliest dinosaurs made it into the game. The T-Rex's roar is done to death, but we Jurassic Park fans need it.+ New characters in a new story, but if you know the films some things should be familiar to you, in a good way: they're not necessarily random references to make you go ""hah! I get this reference!"" (well alright, some are - but they're subtle). + Nima gets more interesting as the story progresses.+ The very last fight made me giggle nervously, it was so tense and exciting. Gerry obviously knows parcours!+/- Your choices don't have any consequences for the characters - except for one at the very end of the game - unlike The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us (which made Telltale Games so great). I know you can't judge a game by another game, but let me just warn you now so you won't be disappointed later.+/- The quick time events have you pressing the WASD buttons in random orders. Sometimes I thought, hey, I get why I have to click left and then right, but that was usually after the fact and oftentimes after I'd already been eaten. But maybe I just suck; and anyway, you can always try again and if you remember the sequence in the right order you'll probably just get a silver medal.+/- Yoder gets more interesting as the story progresses, but then when he loses it all the sympathy I felt for him seemed misplaced. He went from a flat character to a round one back to flat again.+/- Graphics are fine, but mouth movement is often distractingly off.+/- Music is fine, too. Some use of the original soundtrack, but otherwise not very interesting or unique. Does the job.- Very short; only four episodes, so about six hours.- Hardly any replay value, unless you want gold medals for every quick time event.- The relationship between Gerry and Jessi is exactly like the one in the second movie. Get yer own storyline, Telltale!- You don't really know where the story's going, as the characters make it up as they go along. So when the game ends it's kind of unexpected. If they'd told us at the beginning that we could choose between phoning for a helicopter or getting a boat, we could've at least seen the second option coming. It kinda came outta nowhere now. "

												This is probably the worst telltale game I have ever played. The entire game is plagued by annoying qtes which take away any enjoyment for the story. Controls are not good for the pc. Best experience would be with a gamepad. Synchronization is also very weak as the game likes to lag or freeze randomly. As for the good stuff, voice acting is superb and the dinos look pretty cool. Because of the problems I cant recommend buying this game. If you're interested in the story just watch it on youtube.			"

In this game you will find out how crazy people are, even the nicest people.This game was OK. But i still recommend it as the story is good, it's just that the gameplay is made out of you mashing buttons to do various acts every 5 seconds, almost literetly. And the worst thing is that these button mashing elements don't work properly with the mouse and keyboard, so unless you have an Xbox 360 controller, you're screwed.But, if you have an Xbox 360 controller, and are fine with the button mashing, you will most certainly love the game. Anyways i'm going to go watch the Jurassic Park movies because i haven't, but this game made me want to! :)			"

												I’m not sure why this Telltale game is so different from the others. Games like Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us are some of my favorite on steam but this game was borderline garbage. Since it was released before Jurassic World it wants to tie itself in wit the first movie but it doesn’t manage to do that well aside from the references or quotes from the film.The quick time events are very timed and you’ll find yourself missing your window of opportunity often, resulting in unskipable cutscenes of your characters getting killed then having to start over – with autosaves far in between at times.The characters are pretty cliché and feel more like stock cutouts rather than developed ones at least compared to other games. I beat the game once and don’t feel it’s worth the second play through.			"

												Jurassic Park is the start of the new style of Telltale Games where quicktime events become a major part of the game.  There are puzzles and there are dialogue choices to make like all previous Telltale games, but action becomes a major part of this game series compared their previously released games.  This makes it fun though, it is Jurassic Park and action is to be expected.  You'll have to evade the T-Rex, run past the Raptors, and save yourself from a death-defying roller coaster.  The storyline is fun since it occurs simultaneously as the original Jurassic Park movie, expect that here you follow a different group of children and Park workers who are trying to survive the breakdown of the Park.

												Got this game as part of a Telltale bundle. Story is interesting but short and lack depth, voice acting is good, the motion capture is fluid. However, the action sequence is very very very poor, like something that came out in the 90's around the time of the movie itself. You will find yourself so frustrated by the series of keystrokes needed to just advance through some parts of the game, it feels just like something someone threw to an intern to complete. and it feels exactly like that, probably where the least budget or time was spent on. If I was given the choice to buy the game alone, as it is, it will never been on my list, not even for 1 cent.			"

												You know other Telltale games like Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us? Well, this one is a lot like them but has way, way more quicktime events. Storywise it's as solid and as atmospheric as the other ones.In the Jurassic Park cosmos 'The Game' is the settled very close to the first movie and tells a parallel story. Some scenes happen in showplaces of the movie but no characters from the Spielberg picture will appear in the game. Technically is pretty much the same as TWD+TWAU -> same engine, same controls, same level of voice actingIn a comparison between TWD, TWAU and JP I'd still say that this one is the weakest but it's a very good game nonetheless and better than the second season of TWD. Telltale Game players can't do anything wrong buying it... as long as you haven't already reached your limit of quicktime event tolerance with the others games - 'cause there is one for nearly every interaction in JP.7/10			"

												When my daughter asks for a dinosaur game, I know just what to play. This game is really great. Once again, Telltale makes a great game that wants to be a movie. Personally, I feel they should have used this game story for a movie sequel. The story is much more believable than the sequels were, and I really like the characters. The characters grow and change through the game, so be prepared to change loyalties. Most of the game is played through choosing conversation options and the quick time events. You are graded by performance, so make sure you make the right responses and have a quick trigger finger because it can cost you. The game looks good and the soundtrack makes good use of sounding like a Jurassic Park score. You'll hear all your favorite themes from the film, but not so much that it sounds like they ran out of ideas. The only complaint is that the game can lag. The game wants to be a film, and sometimes there is a pause between sequences. It's like when the DVD skips momentarily. It doesn't really hinder gameplay, but it can be a minor annoyance. Also, the mouse pointer may disappear, but that can be fixed by just reloading the segment you were at. These two glitches did not keep me from enjoying the game and I am working on another playthrough just to get the rest of the achievements and play for a slightly different outcome. If you liked the movie Jurassic Park, I am certain that this game will not disappoint.			"

 QTE Nightmare: The GameThis pile of garbage is basicly a poorly written fanfiction, infested with ↑↑↑ ridiculous↓→ amount of ←↓ Quick-Time Events ←←← that makes you want to pull your hair out.Let's start with the plot. The story takes place after the events of the first movie, the Park is overrun and a small group of survivors is trying to escape from the island. The characters are not particularly interesting, in fact the only reason you'll remember them after finishing the game is because their unimaginable stupidity. The events feel forced and most of them happen, because someone is doing some dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥The dialogues are so bad, that each time a character opens his/her mouth, you feel like they are reading lines from a pórn movie. Worst of them is the Costa Rican Señorita who speaks in half English and half Español so you don't comprender what the que demonios she's saying. Yes, you guessed right: Telltale didn't bother to translate Spanish speech for you!Last but not least we have an absurd amount of QTE. Most of them require a less than a second response time and result in instant-death if you fail to mash the correct buttons in rapid succession.Overall this game is not only a waste of time but a waste of the movie license as well, because there is way more potential in this franchise. The only redeeming qualities are the achievements, but the moment the last cheevo pops up I'm almost 100% certain you will Alt-F4 and rush for the uninstall button!PROS- Only 8-9 hours long- Has slightly better animation quality than your average Telltale gameCONS- Incoherent plot and nonsensical events- Bland characters and poorly written dialogues- Bad voice acting- Ridiculous amount of frustrating and non-intuitive QTE (there's a LOT of them!)- Bugs! Cursor tends to disappear after a QTE event, forcing you reload the checkpoint and redo the segment again, because you're unable to progress without knowing where to click. Oh, the joy!			"

												Telltale games, the studio that gave us Sam & Max, Monkey Island, Back to the Future and of course not to forget the Walking Dead. Jurassic Park, like most other Telltale games is a point-and-click adventure that has 5 episodes that guide you through the story. Based on the blockbuster movie franchise: a small group of people and scary nocturnal predators that are hunting the group. The story takes place after the events of the first movie. The game begins with an unknown woman that is running away in a dark jungle, from some scary, unknown creatures with shiny eyes, she is being chased of a cliff. Barely surviving the fall, she ends up on a road, while an oncoming car is heading straight her way. From there the story skips back to earlier that day with a father and a daughter overlooking the peaceful jungles, searching for dinosaurs. In one interesting scene a fight breaks out between a Triceratops and a T-rex, while the main characters have to dodge and run from the crazed fighting giants, not trying to get squashed and trampled. The game is story driven, enjoyable and very thrilling and exciting at times.  The game is 2/3 watching quick time events and 1/3 easy puzzle solving. At times it feels like watching a 5 hour Jurassic Park movie. There is not much exploration or hard puzzle-solving. There is no inventory and a short five hour play through. This game could be more considered as an interactive movie, which some of you might really enjoy (I am one of them). Fans of the film might also enjoy this game, for its familiar locations, and its “real” looking dinosaurs. If you enjoyed the movie Jurassic Park, you will enjoy this “game” for sure. A fun fact: there are a couple of dinosaurs that were not in the original movie.It is possible in this game to make the wrong decisions, or fail a quick time event. During the quick time events, dinosaurs jump from the bushes, after which the player has to press a sequence of buttons to either dodge the attack or miss and end up being torn to bits by his fangs or claws. It is hard when you are so involved in the cut-scene and sitting at the edge of your seat, to keep paying attention to the required button sequence. You have no choice but to finish the whole sequence again before you can move on, which can get in times very frustrating. The game has two different endings.Pros- Beautiful cinematic sequences.- Nicely animated dinosaurs.- Interactive movie experience.- Thrilling action.Cons- Precision button pressing can be frustrating at times.- Linear.Score:7.8			"

												I heard some really bad things about this game, but I enjoyed the original 3 films (well, 3 was okay), so I thought for $4.99, why not see how bad it is? I was surprised. To begin with, this is one of TellTale's (The Walking Dead, Wolf Among us, Tales from the Borderlands) earlier efforts, so if you go in expecting a deep story or emotions, you won't find it here, not that it's shallow, but it's pretty basic...but that said, I had an overall good time. I would say, that I wouldn't buy it at full price, it has some issues. Being Telltale, they of course have quicktime events, and I used the keyboard, and sometimes I KNOW I pushed a button only to have it fail, and others I didn't push it, but it still counted, so it can be frustrating at times, but it didn't happen every time. I will say it seemed less forgiving than later titles.The game picks up sometime during the first film, but none of the characters show up, not really anyway. There are 4 episodes in total, and some achievements that are missable, if you are into that. You do get some dialouge, but it's not quite like later titles where it really affects anything, it's more or less just there for flavor. The characters aren't horrible, but nothing to write home about. The action scenes are overall well done, and the use of quicktime can lead to some tense situations, but as I said, the only issue is sometimes it won't register properly leading to frustration with the system. You get to control a few characters, and you meet the expected dinos and some not from the films. In the end, it's a decent action/adventure game, but not with a deep storyline. I'd say get it on sale, then if you don't care for it you're not TOO much upset over $5. If you liked the movies, you'll have an overall good time, and if you like achievements, there are some you can miss but you can load certain parts of an episode to get them again, and you will mess up because of the quicktime event format.

Contrary to the more recent Telltale titles, your choices don't affect the (satisfying) story and, even though this is a small game (6 hours to beat) there is a little bit of character development present. And this time the achievements actually require some work!  The controls are messy and the QTEs are quite challeging and, unfortunately, can reach to the point of being frustrating.The setting is perfect and a must play for any Jurassic Park fan.➡️️Final Rating: 6/10			"

												After the Back To The Future game Telltale Games decided to throw in an adventure game that is the direct follow-up to the first Jurassic Park film. And what a hell of a job they did!What's a Telltale adventure game?Telltale specialises in adventure games that are easy to complete and usually almost all achievements can be obtained in just one go. There's a great emphasis on immersion hence the many cutscenes and the QTEs incorporated into them. They can usually be completed in 8-10 hours and there are numerous scenes where a choice can be made - this may result in the sacrifice of a character or it can affect the ending in various ways. Inventory is usually limited to a couple of items - there's no abundance of puzzles and those found throughout the game are easy to complete.What's their Jurassic Park game like?As said this is a direct follow-up to the 1993 film Jurassic Park. There are returning locales and references to many things, thus, if you are a fan of the JP films this game is a must for you. The new scenes and characters are also very interesting and we get to learn some new things of InGen along the way.The game is a tad bit more difficult than the rest of the Telltale games. First of all, QTE have to be timed more precisely and more quickly. It is common that you make mistakes and the game has an evaluation system for this - gold, silver and bronze levels can be attained. Gold levels indicate no slipups - you can only obtain a handful of achievements by not making any mistakes. The ""scenario"" menu gives you the ability to return to some of the QTE events to give them another go. This is a must if you want all achievements obtained as no slipups are a must to have 100% completion. In fact, there are some conversation-related or easter egg-like achievements throughout the game. Some episodes must be completed again from beginning to end to really see everything that is intended to be seen in this game.This time inventory is non-existent and walking is not possible with characters. Instead the icon in the lower-left corner of the screen indicates if there are other locations (rooms) to visit in one scene so we click on these instead of making our protagonists walk. Sometimes clicking on objects is not enough but we have to drag the mouse while doing so - a nice way of interacting with the game's world but a bit too tedious. Telltale games released later on shed themselves of this system and became easier to complete. Oh, and no choices exist to affect events later on in any form.All-in-all, Telltale's JP game is pretty exciting and it is a must for the fans of the JP franchise as well as for fans of Telltale's adventure games. You just have to get yourself over the not-too-refined QTE system and here and there the game has some audio issues and a somewhat mediocre engine not always offering nice scenes to look at.Still, with a great discount it is an easy grab especially with the oncoming Christmas sales.

												Jurassic Park, the franchise that gave me my love for science, for history, and for dinosaurs.  The books, the movies, all of it defined my childhood.  My mother once hid the movie, because she got sick of rewatching it over and over again.  Like any other Jurassic Park fan, I picked this game up to give me more of that Jurassic Park Experience, and I was not disappointed.First, the story:  I’ve read nearly all of Michael Crichton’s works, from Andromeda Strain to Micro.  And I must say, this game nearly perfectly captures Crichton’s writing.  The crooked get their comeuppance, not all the heroes live, the question of “should man have this power?”  I do, however, have some gripes.  The pacing was off on occasion, and there were quite a few “ex machina” moments (LOOKING AT YOU TOUR CAR).  There were also a few deaths which could have used more explanation.  However, the story did remain fresh, interesting, and expanded upon the movies very well, tying a lot more into the books.  8/10 for story.Second, the Gameplay:  Really, there’s not much to say here.  It’s a Telltale game.  You QTE, you solve puzzles, you talk to people.  But the game was varied enough to keep me from getting bored.  7/10 for gameplayFinally, the overall feel:  Despite what many people are saying, this game is amazing.  The story is tight paced, the characters are wonderful, the gameplay isn’t too boring, and the sounds/voices are perfect for the game.  I would love to see future games like this.  My total score is 8/10, HIGHLY RECCOMEND "

												Very buggy and badly in need of some serious polishing, Jurassic Park: The Game shows a lot of potential, but feels more like an Alpha release than a finished game. Several times I had to reload a scenario because the mouse cursor or option to switch scenes simply disappeared, even if I was half-way through the scenario.Despite playing it on a good laptop from 2011 (the same year as the game was released), and the fairly mediocre graphics, the frame rate was consistently low and often fairly laggy. The story was well-presented and quite interesting, but the characters (especially Nima) were bland and flat.What really killed the game, however, was the Quick Time Events. I don't have a problem with QTE's, and having them as the main gameplay mechanic works quite well when the game you're playing is essentially an interactive movie, as this one is, but these QTE's are handled so poorly that it just ruins the game. I don't know if it was the result of the bad frame-rate or lag, but I lost count of the amount of QTE's that I matched perfectly only to be told that I had got one wrong, or the times when I had to press three different arrows in the space of less than a second, thereby resulting in multiple deaths and forcing me to replay the same sections over and over again until I had memorised the fairly long sequences of button-presses rather than relying on actual digit dexterity, which is the whole point of QTE's in the first place. As the game is, it is literally impossible to pass a large number of the QTE's on the first or even fourth try.Save your money and get some of Telltales later games instead.			"

												Telltale has developed some great story-driven, decision-based games out of well-loved source material - Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales From The Borderlands - but sadly, Jurassic Park is not one of them. I love all things to do with dinosaurs and have been a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise since the Michael Crichton novel - I remember the magic of watching the film adaptation for the first time, applauding in the theatre when the end credits rolled - and while its sequels were not up to par, I had high expectations for this game, especially as it takes place during both the events of the film and the days proceeding them. However, I'm sad to say that this is a thoroughly mediocre experience. Gameplay is overly simplistic even by Telltale standards - nearly all of it consists of quick-time events with no manual movement involved, the few puzzles it features are absurdly easy, and the choices you make are rendered pointless as they have very little consequences and do not affect the outcome of the story, making this more akin to an interactive cinematic experience than anything. This would all be forgivable if it was well-written, but the dialogue is flat, the characters one-dimensional, and the plot dull (though it admittedly does pick up a bit in the latter portion, it's all too little, too late). As much as I wanted to like this, it is an unremarkable game in all aspects...it's as though Telltale figured they could appeal to the film's classic status and cult following to drive sales and therefore did not make much of an effort to create a memorable, worthwhile experience. The only positive things I can say about it are that it's fairly well-paced and the QTEs manage to keep you on your toes, but that is largely a byproduct of them following a formula the game blatantly recycles throughout its 7-8 hour campaign. While it's not as painful as the atrocity that is Jurassic World, that isn't saying much. Avoid this game unless you're a die-hard Jurassic Park fan with an insatiable curiosity about the story here, but even at that, you're better off watching a playthrough on YouTube for free.			"

												Jurassic Park: the Game, is a wild adventure on the island at around the same timeframe as the original movie. You will experience perspectives from a variety of characters from a variety of backgrounds, all brought together by fate. The game itself is really more of an interactive movie filled with a variety of quicktime events, with breaks of small puzzles. Newer Telltale games have taken some steps to add choice and consequences for your choices, however this game really is just an on-rails story. If you fail a segment, you are given as many chances as you need to continue on, so really, you are playing this game to see where the movie will take you, and exercise your reflexes throughout.As a fan of the genre, it was certainly worth the playthrough, but this title is really barely walking the path of being able to be called a ""game."" Regardless, if you like the source material, and are interested in a story about escaping an island filled with dinosaurs who are trying to eat you, then give this title a shot!6/10 ""Okay""			"

												I definitely enjoy playing this game. The storyline is original and very well done. It also stays true to the Jurassic Park universe and runs parallel to the movie. The gameplay is very different than most games I've played, which is refreshing. It's more like playing a movie than running around shooting at everything.			"

												Jurassic Park: The Game is an engaging, story-driven point-and-click adventure game coupled with several quicktime events (QTE). While the QTEs can be maddening, the game's story and setting is directly derived from the original movie and provides the same level of tension that you see on film. Any fan of the movie or from TellTale's trademark adventure games should invest in Jurassic Park: The Game!			"

												I just finished the first episode on my PC and I can honestly say this is another very well done adventure that TT has given us. I'm just judging it based on the PC version and not the iOS. Other then a couple of audio glitches (repeat dialogue, echoes while outside) that occured during gameplay I see nthing wrong with this game. I know some people are put off with the lack of free roaming you can do, as you simply switch scenes instead of physically pushingthe analog stick (I played with a controller) to reach there. But really, it's not that big a deal as you do much more interesting combos of context actions. The story is set during the day of the first movie where everything goes to hell. You control multiple characters left in the park for reasons very connected with the film (a mercenary waiting to take the DNA sample that Wayne Knight's character never delivered and a dino vet and his young daughter (this may be the only child character in JP I don't want to feed to the T-Rex). The tension is palable, the voice acting is up to par with other titles and the dialogue and story (as well as relationships with other characters) keep you engaged.If you are a fan of TellTale's other more recent games likeThe Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones and you liked any of the JP films (especially the first one) there is no reason not to buy this, especially if it goes on sale. One episode in and I'm having a blast.			"

												I played this after playing through both The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, so I did some research before hand and knew not to expect EXACTLY the same thing before hopping in. This, after all, was before Telltale hit that awesome stride they're currently on with their on-going series of games. So keep that in mind when you pick this one up. It IS NOT the Walking Dead. You won't be making life changing story altering decisions. It seemed more like a ""can you make the right choice and time the buttons well?"" type scenario because the wrong choices end in DEATH....usually immediately. But all that aside. IF you love Jurassic Park, this is great. IF you enjoy seeing familiar stories play out from a different angle, this is great. IF you like T-Rex's biting stuff, this is great. Music was nostalgic, Dinosaurs were cool, Overall story was enjoyable. As a JP fan, I loved it. As a Telltale fan... I understand it was before you were hitting home runs. Truthfully, if Jurassic World takes off, I'd love to see Telltale revisit the park for another fun ride.8/10 Hungry Raptors. "

												So this game gets a lot of flack on metacritic, but I think the real question is..Do you love the Jurassic Park movies?If you do, then this game is worth a try.  Its like a trip back to the island to see a different story that occurred then.  The gameplay is your usual telltale gameplay (Sam and Max, Back to the Future, Monkey Island, etc..) - but that has it's plus side.  It's a nice chill and relax game that's got a great story and replicates some of the movies imagery phenomenally.The downside is the horrendous Quick Time Events, making some parts less than fun.

												Not much of a ""game"" per se, more of a cinematic choose your own adventure. Still, it had me jumping in my chair more than once. I think it's a great follow on to the 1st JP movie. If you are a fan of the JP franchise, or get to feeling a little nostalgic and wonder what may have happened in between the JP1 and JP2 movies (assuming you didn't read the books because it's nothing like that) Go for it. It is not a waste of time, and as you may already know, Telltale does a fantastic job at telling tales. If you are looking for some dino-nostalgia, it is good for one or two playthroughs. I liked it.			"

												The reviews are true!  If you liked the movie, you'll like the game.The storyline for this game is extremely well written.  It takes place during the first Jurassic Park movie and ties in with events and scenes that you will remember.  Tell Tale's point and click interface is not quite as finessed as it is in The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead, but I found that if you just mash the buttons you really can't lose.  You don't buy this game for the gameplay, you buy it because you love Jurassic Park.  It's like watching a whole bunch of left-out footage and storyline that didn't make the cut for the movie.  I'm glad I tried it out and I enjoyed it.  It really does extend the magic of the movie.			"

												I like how this is a parallel storyline to the first movie, and how they succeeded in not interfering or messing the original up. No spoilers here, because this is actually a good game in that respect if you're a fan of the franchise.The biggest problem I had was keystrokes not registering and, and this is a real gamebreaker for me, the inability to stop playing and pick it back up at a later point. This might need some explaining, but basically this is what happened; While in the story, I got stuck in a level solving a problem, so I returned to the main menu and tried to restart that specific part. But it was locked...so I tried replaying the part that came before that, and when I finished that part, it didn't continue the storyline but instead returned me to the main menu...which means I have to replay the entire chapter...There are some other little nuisances, most of which are about the very linear storyline (although certain fight scenes can have different ways of playing out, as long as you don't die) and trouble with the controls, but mostly the fact that at some points I got too focused on the controls that the environment just became a blur, I didn't catch half of what was said and missed just about everything that was not an arrow pointing in a direction with a green circle shrinking to indicate the required timing.This is, however, like I said, a really good story running parallel to the original first movie and it is reasonably executed. As such I believe it does deserve a recommendation.			"

												My impression of this game is pretty mixed, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people, and certainly not to the less hardcore players who may have the patience to work their way through the game.The main reason for this is that a very large part of this game consists of QTEs (Quick Time Events, where you are required to hit a given button in order to perform an action within a given time interal), and these QTE sections are genuinely quite frustrating to play through -the interval for pressing the buttons is incredibly short. I suspect it is often as short as a fifth or a quarter of a second, which is frankly absurd. I often don't even have time for my brain to register which key I am supposed to press before I have failed the task. This is compounded by two other problems - these QTEs are often chained together into sequences of several QTEs where the icons are layered over the top of one another (so you cannot see the next button in the sequence until hitting the current), and they are utterly unforgiving -  a single failure will result in the death of a character, and the sequence will need to be started again. There have been instances where I have had to repeat sequences 15+ times, and learn the keypresses by rote in order to get past.This said, the story and characters are reasonably engaging, at least for the first two episodes - the game is at it's best when delivering narrative on a scene by scene basis, or when it has small logic problems for you to solve. The writing however takes an utter nosedive by the time you reach the third and fourth episodes, which are also QTE ridden nightmares. By this point in the game the source material gets thrown under a bus in order to pad for content (there's now a geothermal powerplant in an underground volcano base that will explode if not dealt with, wtf?).Some other elements are massively over used. The T-Rex as an example seems to conveniently teleport around the island and is present in a significant part of game, appearing in every other scene to allow for lengthy, annoying QTE sections that just waste your time without adding anything to the narrative.Overall, there could have been a decent game, and the first episode was genuinely entertaining if not a bit rough around the edges. It rapidly devolves into frustrating nonsense however - I suspect the developers were running out of time and as a result quality really slipped.			"

												If you liked the Jurassic Park movies, then this is worth checking out! Although I am predisposed to being heavily biased to liking this game, I still think it's essential for any Jurassic Park fan to check out.Unfortunately, this game could have been so much more, and done better in many areas. There are many times, and areas, in the game that scream out ""Hey, I was rushed!""(or maybe perhaps budget cuts). I was expecting more of a point and click adventure game, infact I was highly anticipating that! That is what Telltale games is known for. Instead, Jurassic Park: The Game, turned out to be an interactive movie. There aren't a whole lot of free interactive moments where you solve puzzles, infact most stuations where you have free interaction feel constricting, and linear. Don't get me wrong! Although this game could have been so much more, I still highly enjoyed Jurassic Park: The Game! I do recommend checking it out. It's definately a game you play with an audience.			"

												Reviewing from Chapter 3:Well, if you've skimmed through the reviews, you see there is a good mix of posiitve and negative. While the negatives ring some truths and the positives do speak the light truth, this game WILL get you hooked in within the first 20-30 minutes. Having grown up and seeing all 4 Jurassic films, there is some bias towards this. People that haven't seen at least two out of the four films will not enjoy this adaption. The story is ok, acting and writing satisfactory but the gameplay is solid. Being Telltale, they know how to get you hooked. Chapter 1 is good and bits of chapter two may put you off. People are right saying that the choices won't lead you down a moral path like in The Walking Dead, but you still have some choice variety. Couple dialogues you have to select two-three dialogue choices to progress. The thing with this game is you can see how Telltale learnt from this to make The Walking Dead game a classic. I recommend this game to any Jurassic Park fan or anyone Tell Tale series lover. Buy the game while it is on special - I wouldn't buy this for more than $10. I'm only 3 chapters in and have one chapter to go. Wouldn't be worth big $$.**UPDATE 2/1/17**Wow eeeeeeeee. Certainly picks up in chapter 3 and the final chapter. Review in comments:			"

Characters are ok, got some random names and the game doesn't really achieve to make you like them. hope the plot will reward me in the end. and i can write something positive as long i must give thumbs down and tell you guys not to buy even though you like dinos like i do.

												This is a ""Point & Click"" game, if you are expecting an FPS & to be shooting lots of dinos... then this is NOT the game for you, go play ""Turok dinosaur hunter""BUT if you like ""Point & click"" games & you are a fan of the Jurassic park films/licence... Then this game is 100% for you!There is great fan service done with this game, you get to visit lots of set-pieces from the first Jurassic Park film, like Dennis Nedry's jeep & the Visitor Centre... Just to name afew!ONLY Cons I can think of are:- When I first got the game I had lots of lag, but this is EASILY fixed... go to ""settings"" & turn Graphics from ""Highest"" down to ""High"" & the game runs perfectly & the graphics look no different from what I can tell!- There are a lot of ""Quick time events"" in this game which can be quite hard to do if you're not playing with a game-pad... But you earn medals for each stage of the game, so this does add a certain level of replay value if you try to get all gold medals.OVERALL I SAY GIVE IT A GO... I LOVE IT!!!			"

												If you like the Jurassic Park movies, do not buy this game. They capture none of the energy and wonder, and none of the beloved characters show up.If you like point and click adventure games, do not buy this game. It is instead a series of QTEs with absolutely no choices of consequence to be made or puzzles to solve.If you like the Walking Dead games, do not buy this game. The writing and characters don't even approach the quality of that series.			"

												I recently purchased the Humble Telltale Bundle, after having thoroughly enjoyed The Walkind Dead: Season One as well as both of the Poker Night games. When Jurrasic Park was announced as one of the two bonus games, I was stoked because I loved the movie when I was a kid and at this point have fallen in love with TTG's newer adventure games.That much being said, I was met with dissapointment. The writing does not feel like it captures the same passion Telltale had with other games (the stories in The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands, and The Walking Dead all feel very compelling and can draw you in even if you aren't a fan of the source material already). The voice acting is top notch, but the writing itself just isn't there so far.The quick time events have become incredibly intrusive and distracting, with many of them not making a difference whether or not you fail (an example being when you nearly run into the other main character while driving to the visitor center, which has an identical outcome regardless of if you make the QTE in the very short time it gives you).On the same subject of the over done QTEs is also the fact that this game has possibly the worst controls of any Telltale adventure. You are all over the keyboard, and many of them have very strict timing involved or you will fail. Also, the steam overlay will occasionally make the button prompts dissapear (which has so far only happened to me on keyboard, and not controller).The graphics are not mindblowing, but they do what they need (as is typical with these games), however it is much less stylized than the other TTG titles, when it really could have benefitted from more of a traditional TTG art direction. Also, there is no silent pause like the other TTG games have, and the pause screen that is in the game is incredibly loud and obnoxious (t-rex roaring every couple seconds).Is this game playable? Sure. Would I recommend it? Only to die hard fans of both Jurrasic Park and TTG. I would recommend pretty much any of the other TTG games over it, with Tales from the Borderlands or The Wolf Among Us being my primary recommendations. Jurrasic Park just lacks the polish and soul that simillar titles from the same studio have in extra-large helpings.			"

												Jurassic Park is a really fun story-based game that's held back by less than steller gameplay. It's primarily quicktime events (Garbage) broken up by the occasional puzzle (tedious and with little to no challenge) and character interaction (Fun! Easily the best part!) Despite that it's still a solid title that includes some good action, dramatic moments, solid characters, and a  quite few funny bits (some of the death scenes are hilarious). Overall I'd give Jurassic Park: The Game a solid 8/10

												Hello. Like always care maybe some spoilers on your own. I love Jurassic Park since 1992-3 i was one of my first Video Home System Cassetts i get (good old times) and i love dinos since long time. So i love Telltale games even they could somtimes better (longer, more options, choices) but this time it gets hard. Sure my hope was to high. Normaly i dont talk about graphics but making a new look and then a jungle, there could be more details in this game, but its not a big deal not even the clipping mistakes, but i like it has a german version, what i miss in other games. It dont have a fast forward/ rewind/ skip option or TRADING CARDS and not much change, you cant rescue the most, the good great dangerous tattooed bear that looks like the bad guy and the friendly guy are both not what they look but both die so who cares? All other runs not well too, at the end you can rescue 2-3 people, wow. A nice piece of game, not a epic story but fine, yeah for Jurassic Park Fans its fine who know the movies but for some it will disappointed for others it will be maybe good enough. Choose yourself for me personal its hard to decide but i give after all a 86 %. Try the game yourself, with lets play or other ways. Thank you for your reading this/ time and have a happy day.			"

												This game is going to please Jurassic Park fans far more than it will please Telltale series fans. The story in this game is not even close to competing with other Telltale games like The Wolf Among Us, and The Walking Dead series, but I still find it to be a nice game. Some of the dialogue isn’t great, but I find the beautiful artwork more than makes up for that. Unlike other Telltale games there is a layer of difficulty to this game with timed button sequences and combos. The challenge mixed in with the suspense of running from dinos made for an exciting experience. If you’re a Jurassic Park fan or a fan of Telltales art style and don’t mind some intense button sequences than I’d recommend grabbing this game on sale.			"

												A fantastic game for those looking for a change from action shooters and are intersted in some puzzle solving.Jurassic Park: The Game, has a deep, involving plot and characters with their own personalitties, experiences, drives and behavoiurs.  Most of the time it is difficult to distinguish what is game and what is cinematic (aside from the obvious ""press button X"") The dinosaurs, their sounds, the music track and the setting all match the first movie and the new, added story gives fans and newcomers a much deeper insight as to what was happening and what happened after the original movie's cast escaped the island.Definitely one for the fans, and I highly recommend getting this if you love action games with some not too tricky, but challenging puzzles all the same.  That and the dino killing sequences are some of the most awesome cinematics I'll ever see.			"

												Jurassic Park: The Game is a linear interactive QTE game where your decisions don't count a thing except for the very end. Did you like the family drama and the boring dialogue in the movie JP: the lost world? Then get ready because this game contains a lot more of it.+ Nice game premise with the shaving cream can+ Some, but not enough JP moments.+ Velociraptors were creepy+ It's sometimes funny.+ It has some character development- Too linear- Gameplay is basically a huge QTE fest- QTE are sometimes too fast and unfair, forcing you to replay them a times. Would be too easy otherwise, I guess.- Boring family drama while dinos are trying to eat them. Riiight..- The writing goes downhill pretty fast- Do you remember the movie JP: the lost world? Where you are supposed to feel with the earth first dino loving expedition, but their actions lead indirectly to the death of the mercenaries and some innocent civilians? This game contains a lot more of this BS. Sadly, this game is so linear that you can't even kill the annoying characters off.- I encountered a disappearing cursor bug. Loading the last checkpoint fixed it.I would not recommend buying this mess. The gameplay is inferior, the writing takes a nosedive  and they implemented some bad ideas from the second movie of the franchise.Replay value: NoneRating: 4/10Recommendation: No			"

												Hey, screw you, man!  I like Jurassic Park, and I liked this game!  You wanna fight about it?  So what if it's a sloppy, choppy game of QTE after QTE after hard-to-see-because-it's-at-the-other-side-of-the-screen-and-blends-into-the-background QTE, gnoamsayin'?  It's fun, it's thrilling, it's even pretty dumb and 70% of the Cavalry episode is pointless filler.  Confusing segue.  Spotting the often clever movie references is oddly satisfying, too.If you're a fan of JP, and QTEs don't make you want to murder the entire gaming industry in heartless rage, you might care to check this game out--and then hope they make more, b/c 6 hours is not long enough, tbqh.  Hopefully with a bigger budget.  And gosh dang, I'd prefer if the game wasn't riddled with Telltale's goofy characters and writing, but, you know, it's kind of endearing at some points.  The kid was a surprisingly good addition, reminding me of Goosebumps & wotnot, which made me feel even more nostalgic and fancy.			"

												When the reviews stated that the game was filled with quick time events, I imagined something along the lines of Resident Evil 4. But no, this game is only quick time events there is no actual gameplay. It is like watching a boring long winded B movie version of Jurassic Park made up of cutscenes, just waiting for the opportunity to hit Up, or maybe Down or sometimes Left at the right moment. Fail to get it right and the cutscenes repeat again until you do and believe me that gets really repetitive and boring very quickly. You miss a lot of the QTEs too because sometimes you forget that you're actually playing a game as there can be such a long time between interactions. All in all the graphics are OK, the story is boring, and the gameplay is non-existant. Indeed if you really want to get a feel of the gamplay. Just put any of the Jurassic Park movies on, grab an Xbox or other controller (it doesn't have to be on) and when a dinosaur appears on screen and a character is in peril,  just hit B or X on the controller to dodge. If you feel you weren't quick enough, just rewind and try again. That is this game in a nutshell.			"

												AVOID. The gameplay is barebones to put focus on the story and the story is insane. The game completely misses the spirit of Jurassic Park. The characters are unlikeable and large portions of the story only exist due to stupidity. Realistically it would be one episode long if it weren't for contrived obstacles keeping everyone on the island. It's also bizarre how dark and gritty story elements get. The puzzles definitely aren't up there with other Telltale products either. The graphics are fine if not outstanding. Due to the nature of the interactive story genre there's really not much to talk about except the story and it is stunning that someone would pay money to use the JP license on this plot.			"

												If you're a Jurassic Park fan who enjoys getting as much backstory as you can, you'll enjoy this game. And for those unaware, this is Canon to the movies and even explains things not addressed in the films (like biological/paleo inaccuracies). I give it an 8/10 (maybe 7.5). It's a very cinematic feel, but the graphics are choppy at times. Such examples are items being held are slightly off (like a knife attached to the outside of the hand instead of it being in his grasp) or audio repeating itself at a key point (locating objects with the binoculars). If you can get past the glitches, it's an enjoyable game. Some of the characters are a tad bland, but Dino-fodder is probably the reason for it. All in all I enjoyed it and would reccommend it to anyone that is a fan of the series. Now if only we could get Jurassic Park:Operation Genisis on Steam! That would be something!			"

												The least successful of the Telltale episodic games is merely an average adventure that suffers from serious design flaws.The worst is the control scheme. The game suffers from a poor implementation of quick time events. There are too many of them (TOO MANY), and they are quite random. The mouse-and-keyboard control during the exploration scenes is rather clumsy as well. None of it is bad enough to make the game unplayable. If the player misses the QTE button presses, the ""punishment"" is having to see usually some quite entertaining death scene. And if the player keeps on missing, the button presses are simplified so that the story can go on. I'm not here to excuse how lame the whole thing is, though.But you're not here for the QTE's. You're here to see some dinosaurs. And at least there are lots of them. Across the four episodes, we get the herbivores and a plethora of carnivores, starting with the mighty T-Rex. That's the best part.The story is rather standard. Passable for a Jurassic Park spin-off. Some of the characters are quite interesting, although cliched. There is a surprising amount of optional dialogue and back-story that, thankfully, is also skippable.I enjoyed the game with its action sequences. You need a big screen TV for this. It's popcorn cinema in game form. For fans of adventures games and Telltale's other, better games, this is a sore disappointment, but if you forget about the pedigree, there is an average action movie... I mean action GAME (sort of)... hidden beneath the clumsy controls. Protip: Try turning 3D on with Tridef 3D or the equivalent Direct X-to-3D conversion. Adds greatly to immersion. Who hasn't wanted to see a Velociraptor pop out of the screen (even in a lame game like this)?Verdict: 6/10			"

												It's Jurassic Park, it tells the aftermath  of the park once everyone should have left and gives you some decent excitement. The only issue I have had so far is the fact the controls are picky. Other then that, it's a Telltale game with a great story. I'm enjoying it so far. Now just to survive the park!			"

												The art design is terrible and most of the game plays out through quick-time events. There are some good ideas and the story is at least compelling enough to get you to the end. If you really love Jurassic Park and the game is on sale, then I give it a cautious recommendation.			"

												If you’re really into the Jurassic Park-universe, then I highly recommend this game. It’s funny, filled with puzzles and explorations.You’ll get the chance to see the locations of Jurassic Park and see it from angles you haven’t seen before. You even get to see parts of Jurassic Park that are mentioned in the book, but for the first time you get to actually see them! I won’t spoil that you get to see though!What is Jurassic Park: The Game with no dinosaurs? You’ll run into T-rex, raptors and other dinosaurs mentioned, but never seen before.The plot of the game really revolves around the Barbasol can and all the ramifications created by Dennis Nedry. So this game is for Jurassic Park fans since it respects the original Jurassic Park story and adds more to the Jurassic Park-universe.You also get to meet Sarah Harding’s little half-sister; Jessica Harding and her father; Gerry Harding – he was present in Jurassic Park at the Triceratops scene!Peace.

												Jurassic park. I am a huge fan. I have the films, I have the games and I have loved them from the age of five. The gamplay is fun and scary at points which makes it a great game to play. HOWEVER the game kinda just throws you into it with no real tutorial apart from it saying at points 'PRESS W NOW'. Also say you finished the game and you missed a few achievments you are not allowed to go back and get them - you actually have to start the whole chapter again from the start to get it! In total before I got to the end where I wanted more achievments I would have given it a 9 out of 10 but now its a 7 out of ten but don't get the wrong idea about this game - just read the achievments before playing.

												Jurassic Park The Game would probably win a record for less actual gameplay in any game ever since all it is is hours of quick-time events split up from time to time with small dialogue choices & incredibly simple puzzles. Even for a big Jurassic Park fan & dino-lover like myself this is NOT worth the full price; but if you are a huge Jurassic Park fan & happen to see this on sale for about 75% off then download it. Why? Well even though the game is crappy it has become a guilty pleasure for me, at least during my first playthrough. The game borrows heavily from the Jurassic Park movies, albeit mostly the first; & you will recognise many camera angles & scenes that’ll give you a little bit of fan-glee. These scenes make or some pretty cool screenshots if like me you’re a bit obsessed with that Steam feature.			"

												JurASSic park : The game. Why is is♥♥♥♥♥ Because of all the button mashing you have to do. I had blisters on my blisters when I was done with this game.The good things about this game is, it looks nice, and it has a pretty fun story, the story would get a 8/10 from me. And its just kick♥♥♥♥♥to see all those dino's running around.However.. the gameplay is SO ASSSSSS. Its just not fun at all, for everything from loading a gun, to scratching your butt. you have to mash certain sequence of buttons. And sometimes you need to press 3 buttons in less then a second, and you only know the button you have to start with. So you need ridiculous fast reflexes, or else be prepared to try again... and again... and again... and again... It gets tedious fast.Hope it helps for you to decide whether you want to spend 30 bucks on this.			"

												I'd say this is a good game for super fans of the franchise.  It adds some fun new lore concurrent and immediately following the first movie.  As a game, however, it probably leaves some to be desired.  The gameplay is primarily quick-time-events, so your participation is basically hitting buttons at the right time after on screen prompts.  You also get some dialog choices, but as far as I can tell it barely affects the story.  That said, I really enjoyed it, and had fun watching the story unfold, running and fighting dinosaurs, and trying to get a gold medal on each level.  The story being only about 7 hrs long, I'd save this game for when it's on sale.			"

												If you're bummed that the PlayStation 3 exclusive Heavy Rain never received a PC port, then Jurassic Park will have to do to satiate your hunger for a quick-time-event (QTE) driven game.For those unfamiliar, QTE gameplay places a heavy emphasis on reflex. Players are prompted to press a series of buttons on screen and failing to do so swiftly and correctly will lead to disastrous consequences. Jurassic Park: The Game is built solely upon this foundation and nothing more.Despite this, Telltale still brings to life the world of Jurassic Park. Every dinosaur encounter is suspenseful and both the plot and characters are the very least, interesting. Unfortunately, the game is marred by several bugs. Audio tends to fade in and out sporadically and frames drop at specific sequences.I applaud Telltale's attempt at venturing into more mature territory. With the nerves to show a teenage girl being eaten by a T-Rex, this studio has proven that they can push the boundaries.Grade: B-			"

												Oh, come on. Why am I seeing so much flak for this game? This is better than half the games you'll get out of an indie-bundle, and those get praised and noticed more than a 'mediocre' game like this. Yes, it's a low-budget game, but Telltale did a mostly great job with their resources. The only thing really wrong with this is the unforgiving QTEs and slow scene transitions when investigating.The thing is, for a Jurassic Park GAME, this is the best we've gotten besides maybe that GBA park-sim. This captures the feel and experience of the first movie with a group of well-rounded characters and a fairly enjoyable plot twist. When people inevitably die, you aren't just watching a dino eat, you're watching someone you cared for disappear. It's a small element the movies lacked, which along with the strong plot puts this above the second and third ones. The first movie still holds strong in being the main attraction, but this tie-in fits right alongside it as a desert to any fan. Just don't go in expecting a proper video-game, and be ready to practice a few sequences two or even three times before the game will let you continue to watch itself unfold.If you're a Jurassic Park nut, buy it. If you're a casual fan, pick it up when it's on sale. If you are neither, this game might not have much for you. Still, it's a fact that there's tasty meat hiding inside this flawed package, and it's probably scared of the nasty T-Rex riding the bandwagon.			"

												If you're a Jurassic Park fan, eh, for a budget price of $7.50, why not? Telltale fan? Not sure, really. For a Telltale game, the mechanics are very clunky, and oh, did I mention that this game is riddled with quick time events? Not to mention some of them being nigh impossible to get through - some QTEs require you to press directional buttons in a sequence, but only the current button required is shown to you, which makes it rather difficult to go though the sequence. But fear not! Spamming buttons also works as well since pressing a wrong button doesn't penalize you in any way.Honestly, this is one of the worst games Telltale has ever made in a while. The only reason I recommend this game is for its story, while not amazing, is pretty good, and can entertain you for about... let's say, 10 hours?			"

												I was really very impressed by this game. The usual point and click approach of collecting an inventory full of junk and rubbing the items together till you solve the puzzle would have just killed any kind of tension and not fitted with the atmosphere of the film. It is instead a mix of simple puzzles, conversation sections and reflex sections that are kind of like a simplified version of Heavy Rain. These work really well and it avoids getting frustrating as you can make some mistakes without being killed, it just affects your medal. Also if you are repeatedly getting killed it will reduce the difficulty for that section. The story line is good, it fits in a lot better than most of the film sequels. The graphics are pretty good compared to other Telltale stuff but still have room for improvement; there are a fair few bizarrely contorted facial expressions. The inclusion of medals, achievement and two alternate endings give this more replayability than standard point and click games.			"

It also continues to push the bad name of Quick Time Events with half-second failures in quite a few scenes (and also the pulse arrows that are only meant to be pressed once the green circle is completely inside the white. What the ♥♥♥♥.) However, the story is full of more twists and turns than a labyrinth and the pacing will definitely keep you on your toes.

												This is my favorite of the pre-Walking Dead Telltale games I have played, but it is still flawed. It's basically a ~4 hour QTE fest with some more traditional adventure game puzzles thrown in. One rather obnoxious feature is that some of the QTEs were not consistent. For example, if multiple buttons came up at the same time, sometimes it was a choice, but sometimes they were all required. This cost me multiple achievements, which often require perfection. I'm not sure I'll go back and replay sections just to clean that up. I enjoyed the story, but the lowest common denominator graphics really hurt when there's a Wii version. I like that Telltale can actually be serious, which gives me hope for the Law & Order game. Sam & Max does nothing for me, and even Back to the Future seemed more corny than any of the films. And dinosaurs make everything better.			"

												Its shorter than previous Telltale games, but they changed up the game play dynamic, steping away from the random clicking of objects to move the story on.  Now theres timed events and skill button hitting.  If you fail you die.  I loved this improvement in the Telltale way of gaming.But this is about all I liked.  The story was mediocre, rather confusing, repetative, and a bit far-fetched in parts.  The graphics were ok, a bit glitchy and I ran into a few lag/repeat events.  For this game to be delayed as long as it was (6 months I think), I feel they could have improved in that area.  I dunno if Spielburg or Universal put their foot down on somethings but something doesn't add up.Overall, its an ok game.  Get it on sale cheap.			"

												If you are a fan of the JP series this is definitely an enjoyable experience and fun QTE game (read: interactive movie) to play. While it is glitchy at times (cursor disappears, have to replay scenarios before you can progress, audio echo, etc.) it is still pretty fun and entertaining. If you take it slow and listen to the majority of the conversations it should take an hour or two per chapter.My only major pet peeve is that some of the QTE really do require quick fingers, to the point that you might actually be dying/failing more than actually progressing and forced to memorize the pattern before continuing.Overall it is a fun and enjoyable experience for a JP fan.

												Just finished the game. I honestly loved every minute of it! I was really immersed in the character interaction, the tense moments, and the general awesomeness of Jurassic Park itself. I wasn't expecting much going into it considering all the bad rep surrounding the game, and to be honest, I think that's propablly the best way to approach this game, by not expecting much from it. The gameplay (Quicktime events) honestly isn't great at times but the story is really fun to watch unravel. I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun the game actually was! Now that I've finished the game I've come to the conclusion that I'm really glad to have finally had the chance to play it. If you are a fan of Jurassic Park, you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game. However, just be prepared for crazy annoying quicktime events. I spent a lot of time re-loading scenes trying to get the best possible score due to the game not responding to my inputs during the QTE's. But in the end it was worth it, because the story was just so damn fun. The game throughout just had this charm that kept me playing.  Oh, and it works perfectly fine on Windows 8.			"

												My personal favourite game of the year 2010 =).Don't expect a lot of gameplay, its a 5 hour long cutscene with time events. A lot of the timings for the buttons can be a bit odd and aren't always natural, and unlike heavy rain if you die the story doesn't continue, so there are probably not multiple story paths just a main one where you can die.However where it falls short as a game, it fills in with a good story with a focus to detail. In my opinion a must play for the fans of the JP franchise (and if you can use IZ3D DDD or 3dvision to play the game in 3d then do so its like its made for it).			"

												Not a point and click adventure game by any means. Most of the exploration is replaced by Heavy Rain-esque quick time events. These can get somewhat frustrating quickly as they become pseudo games of memorization and Simon Says. The exploration and quick-time event gameplay isn't terrible, per se, but it could be much improved on and leaves a lot to be desired from the standard point and click adventure game fan. Otherwise, the plot and voice acting, as well as some particularly exciting cinematic sequences within the game, more than make up for the less-than-stellar gameplay. Took about 5 hours for a full playthrough of the game. Try to grab it for $15 or less if possible. 7/10.			"

While this game is no 'Hard Rain', Part 4 (the final) was totally engrossing and exciting. It has a few puzzle segments too, which I felt were interesting and helped to break up the many quicktime events into manageable amounts.Finally, thankfully this game, although episodic, seems to have been released all in one go,  which is very unlike TTG. I think it definitely works in their favour as a result, knowing their previous history with game releases.I would... actually recommend playing this game.Check it out.			"

												Whats with all the bad press? Story is better than the 2 sequal films. If you like Jurassic park you will like this game. You just need good reflexes if you never want to die or get all the achievements. And there is puzzle solving and reflex choices that affect the overall story.			"

Once I realised that I was always going to suck at the QTEs I started to enjoy the game much more as I didn't give a crap about the medals for each level.The story itself gives a different view of what happened in the film and as a big fan of the films I loved it.Definitely not worth the normal price but if it's on sale I'd say give it a try.

												This game is unbelievably amazing, the story was amazing true to the spirit of Jurassic Park. It had some funny parts, and it did have a few parts that made you freak out, involving being almost eaten by a T. rex. The game does have glitches, and there is lag during cutscenes. But I think the story outweighs the bad parts.			"

												English version (wersja polska jak zawsze niżej) Have you heard the stories about these guys who, during the Jackson’s LotR shows took out the books and loudly complained (from the first rows of the cinema) that Tolkien had it different? Well, back in the day when Jurassic Park entered the cinemas I was that kid who quite loudly argued that „these are not velociraptors but utahraptors!” or that „dilophosaurus didn't do that!”. Consequently I had a rather biased approach towards this game. Even more so that by the time of JP's release Telltale had managed to completely destroy (at least in my opinion) another brand that was very precious to me: Back to the Future. Truth be told, while I didn't have that much expectations, this game has still managed to make me give up playing a time or two. And then I have returned because, well, dinosaurs. Speaking of which, not all of the dinosaurs present in the movies (or, particularly, the first one) made it into the game. While there obviously are raptors, triceratopses and T-rex (still glorious!) there is no single diplodocus or brachiosaurus, which I can not forgive since the brilliant scenes in the first movie featuring these dinos. Furthermore, I get the impression that raptors do not get enough screen time. Telltale also introduces a few species not present in the movie. No spoilers, but they could have chosen better.Another point that I want to make is that oftentimes the scenes featuring dinosaurs are plain stupid. Let me give you an example from early in the game when one of the protagonists tries to push a triceratops out of the car's way. With his own hands. You sure know the triceratops? The huge, heavy, thick skinned, three horned Cretaceous rhino? As a layman I know not to♥♥♥♥♥♥of rhinos (not like there are that many where I live, but still), and the said person trying to push away the dinosaur is an employee of the park, consequently I'd expect some basic expertise. It doesn't much help that most of the protagonists of JP can be easily placed on the sliding scale of plain boring to idiot. The dialogues are also not as polished as in the studio's newer titles. Admittedly, around the fourth episode things liven up a bit and some of the characters get more interesting (usually for one or two lines of dialogue). According to the credits, different episedes have been written by different people, which sometimes results in characters acting completely differently and incongruently throughout the game.Bugs and glitches also deserve a paragraph of their own. First of all, Telltale games have never been particularly well optimized and this might be the worst of them all. I have tested JP on two different machines, both well above the suggested requirements, and on both the game often stops for a second or two while, for instance, changing the camera position or in the MIDDLE of a quick time event. This is particularly irritating due to the fact that QTEs are not very well timed. Usually the game does not give enough time to react which results in learning the key sequences by the heart. To sum up: there is a big list of issues I have with this game. It clearly lacks some polish and gameplay testing, characters are bland, dialogues boring, story both silly and predictable. Truth be told, I'd love to see JP the Game released now, by the experienced Telltale that have developed and perfected their style.  As for now, I may recommend this game only because of, well, dinosaurs. Wersja polskaSłyszeliście kiedyś o tych kolesiach którzy na premierowych pokazach Władcy Pierścieni Jacksona siadali w pierwszych rzędach, wyjmowali Tolkiena zanim jeszcze pierwsze napisy zdążyły przelecieć, szeleścili kartkami i głośno stwierdzali że „W książce to inaczej było!” ? Czego wspominam? Bo w czasach szkoły podstawowej byłem, eufemistycznie ujmując, lekko chory na dinozaury. W kinie szarpałem ciocię, która to miała pecha zabrać mnie na Park Jurajski, i głośno komentowałem że „ to nie velociraptory tylko utahraptory!” albo że „dilofozaur wcale tak nie pluł!”. Rozumiecie więc chyba że mam dość osobiste podejście do tej konkretnej gry? Tym bardziej że w momencie wydania Jurajskiego Parku Telltale zdążyło już absolutnie sponiewierać (przynajmniej w mojej opinii) inną szczególnie bliską mi markę: Powrót do Przyszłości. Po przeczytaniu kilku recenzji nie oczekiwałem po JP wiele, a mimo to gra dała raz czy dwa radę zniechęcić mnie do jej ukończenia. Mimo to wracałem bo, wiecie, dinozaury. Skoro mowa o dinozaurach. Pamiętacie diplodoki i brachiozaury? Te wielkie, czworonożne, roślinożerne, z genialnej sceny na początku pierwszego filmu? No to właśnie ich w grze nie ma. Są za to triceratopsy, velociraptory i oczywiście (wciąż totalnie za*ebisty) t-rex. Choć odnoszę wrażenie że raptory pojawiają się w grze zdecydowanie za mało. Telltale dodało kilka gatunków od siebie, nie będę nic zdradzał, ale mogli się bardziej postarać. Co do samych scen z dinozaurami, pozwólcie że podam przykład: w pewnym momencie jeden z bohaterów próbuje przepchnąć (rękami, żeby nie było wątpliwości) młodego triceratopsa z drogi samochodu. Czego się czepiam? Triceratopsy były roślinożerne, nie? Otóż, wspomniany bohater jest pracownikiem Jurajskiego Parku więc oczekiwał bym od niego przynajmniej pewnej wiedzy z zakresu ' nie wk*wiania kilkutonowego, gruboskórnego, rogatego gada którego matka może być gdzieś w okolicy'. Idąc dalej tym tropem: triceratops to w sumie taki kredowy nosorożec. Jeżeli dalej nie rozumiecie moich wątpliwości wpiszcie sobie 'zdenerwowany nosorożec' w wyszukiwarce.Właściwie nie czepiał bym się gdyby tego typu sceny pojawiały się raz czy dwa, ale jest ich więcej. Do tego prawie każdego bohatera da się umieścić na ruchomej skali charakterów gdzieś pomiędzy 'totalnie nudny' a 'debil'. Dialogi też nie są jakieś szczególnie interesujące, podobnie jak fabuła. Aż dziwi że za grę odpowiada studio które później wydawało „Walking Dead”. Choć przyznaję że w ostatnim, czwartym odcinku akcja nieco przyśpiesza a niektórzy z bohaterów robią się odrobinę bardziej interesujący ( na jakąś linijkę dialogu lub dwie). A właśnie, według informacji w końcowych „creditsach” za fabuły odcinków odpowiadają różne osoby. Niby nic takiego, ale widać to w zachowaniu bohaterów którzy niejednokrotnie zmieniają swoje motywacje i postępowanie w sposób zupełnie nie pasujący do nich „z poprzedniego odcinka”.To teraz bugi i glitche, bo zasługują na oddzielny paragraf. Po pierwsze, gry Telltale nigdy nie były jakoś szczególnie dobrze zoptymalizowane, a możliwe że ta jest najgorsza z nich wszystkich. Testowałem ją na dwóch różnych komputerach, obu znacznie przebijających rekomendowane wymagania, i w obu przypadkach często zdarzało jej się zwalniać lub doczytywać przy zmianie kamery albo W ŚRODKU quick time eventa. A trzeba dodać że QTE nie dają jakoś szczególnie dużo czasu na reakcję, właściwie często trzeba się zwyczajnie dać zabić kilka razy żeby zapamiętać sekwencje klawiszy do wciśnięcia. Nie pomaga jeżeli gdzieś w połowie gra zaczyna tracić klatki dokładnie w momencie kiedy musisz akurat wcisnąć (w około sekundę) lewo- lewo-góra-q. Podsumowując: mam z tą grą mocno na pieńku: brakuje jej grywalności, postacię są w większości nijakie, dialogi nudne a fabuła przewidywalna i zwyczajnie głupia. Prawdę powiedziawszy, zobaczył bym Park wydany ponownie przez doświadczone Telltale mające już na koncie „Walking Dead'y” i Wilka Bigby'ego. Wtedy ta gra wyglądała by zupełnie inaczej, bo teraz to takie JP na 57%. Mimo to polecam bo, wiecie, dinozaury.			"

												Jurassic Park is a legendary Franchise and I was so excited to play this, but while I will recommend this game, It was in the most part a dissapointment, When you say Jurassic Park I wanted a game Like Orion or Evolve or ETC, where you can go around and shoot dinosaurs lol, Given thats never really what Jurrasic park was, But even in former games such as Jurassic Park games on the SNES, Sega, to the Lego Game and more ETC have had way more hands on action.The Graphics in this game definitely are the best in any Jurrasic Park Game i've seen, and the Story line too is very well written and closes the loophole that Dennis Nedry Left open from the first game, these are the strong points of the game tho, as the gameplay / controls is pretty much nothing but Quick Time Events. And while I don't mind a Quick time event, here and there.....Doing a whole game on them especially one so action packed, just kind of feels like a gyp.The game is fun, and the storyline is great, but the QTE controls are horrible. If your a fan of Jurrasic Park I'd pick it up on the name alone, and the fact you finally get the satisfaction of that loose end, I know it ALWAYS bugged the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, they never mentioned it in any of the sequels. I Really wish they would take these graphics tho and rehash this as a fps shooter or something, its what we really want while we keep settling for stuff like Orion instead, Save Us!Pros:+ Excellent Graphics+ Brand new storyline where they close the loose end from Dennis Nedry In Jurassic Park 1.+ Cool Jurrasic Park Feel.+ Looks Amazing.+ Music is good+ Steam Achievements Cons:- The whole game is basically nothing but Quick Time Events (QTE for short)- You never really control your person to walk.- Quick Time Events All the time.- No Trading Cards- Did I mention its nothing But QTE?This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												In the beginning, I was not very interested n this game, I received it on a gift and day 1 I would not be able to get it to work right. I chucked it aside and never looked at it again, yesterday after reinstalling I gave it another go and I guess they patched it because it worked fine. I thought the beginning of the game was somewhat weak but soon enough I began to enjoy what I saw. I personally like the story and the characters though I do not care for the 15 year old girl and I believe I have let her die one too many times but ill break down the good and the bad in my opinion.The Good:Decent story that goes more in-depth as time goes onSome scenes really keep you on the edge of your seatDinosaurs feel natural and have some nice animations and head movements some of which is funny and humorous as well.The Death scenes are hilarious.The Bad:QTE's, this game is filled with them so expect to have to deal with them a lot.The voice acting is the worse I have heard in a telltale game with frequent cut offsSometimes Scenes transition before they are done being played out.Very annoying bugs in episode 1 which lasted for one scene after which I never saw said bug re occur. The bug itself was having to re listen to dialogue play out after it had already done so.Stupid new dinosaur hybrid added in to add more depth but felt like an exaggeration and stupid idea. The look of it makes me want to laugh than be afraid, you will see what I mean.In conclusion, there was a lot about this game I enjoyed. I have sunk almost 8 hours into this game and am nearing the end of episode 4 and I can say the time was not wasted. Bought at a discount price, this game is very much worth it in my opinion. I would recommend this Title without a doubt. Sit back, cook some popcorn, mix a drink and enjoy the antics of Jurassic Park! "

However if you are a fan of the Jurassic Park movies and have patience to work past the bad parts this is a pretty fun story. I don't recommend paying full price for this game, but if you can pick it up during a sale (like I did) I say get it. It's a fun 5-6 hour time killer.			"

												I bought Telltale's Jurassic Park for 2 reasons:1.  I love Jurassic Park!2.  I love all of Telltale's other games I've played (Back to the Future, The Walking Dead Seasons 1 & 2, The Wolf Among Us).And I can tell you, I am not disappointed!  I've only just finished Episode 1, but I'm loving every minute of it so far.  Yes, there can be a smidge too many QTEs...  But the story telling more than makes up for it.  If you loved Jurassic Park and would like to know what happened during and after Hammond et al left the island, then get this game.  I promise you won't be disappointed.			"

												I really wanted to like this game because I love the newer Telltalle Games but after episode 1, it just disappointed and became a huge yawn. It's very buggy and laggy, scenes don't playout smoothly where character models jump around in a glitchy manner and every once in a while the cursor disappears completely. What I really hated most about this game is that I hated all of the characters, and you're suppose to play and choose dialogue for almost if not all of them. Which is confusing because I both hate them and want them to get eaten ASAP but the game expects me to choose good choices. It's very confusing and contridating. Many people complain about the quicktime events but honestly, I look forward to them because it was both really action packed and super exciting to play through, as well as it prevents me from falling to sleep to the sounds of their boring♥♥♥♥♥conversations. I think the most interesting conversation in the whole game is the one between the dad and the little girl... and that's not even part of the main game, it's background dialogue. The voice acting is awesome but damn was it a chore to get through.Excusing my rant, don't get this game. Only get Telltale's games from The Walking Dead and up.4/10			"

												Delayed, but reviewing it anyway. Using the famous 'point and click' adventure from BACK TO THE FUTURE and THE WALKING DEAD, JURASSIC PARK: THE GAME is a satisfying experience, provided you can sit through the serveral issuses that plagues the game. Despite it's limitations, it's pretty entertaining, despite people wanting a 'dino shoot-em'. Think of it as an interactive film, as it allows you to control the fate of the characters you play. Even with the occasional bug here and lag there, JURASSIC PARK: THE GAME is an all right game, sure it's not perfect, and if you really wanted to know what happened to Nedry's shaving cream from the first film after the Dilophosaur attack, this game is for you, especially if you're a hardcore fan of the franchise like myself. If not, please resume playing Turok/Dino D-Day/Carnivores or anything else.			"

												Guys, ... short game - fast review.If you are gamer in a good old way, this is definitelly one of best Telltale games I played when I mention game experience. There is also Puzzle Agent, but really that is not a good story stuff.Now story... There was nothing exciting, surprising, breathtaking, emotional, touching. It is film based game and we all knows what movie based games are. There are little nice new things I do not remember from movies about the island and the park.Beware, on my W10 computer in all directions intermediate system I was occuring sound bugs(when changing camera views sometimes too loud) and interactive interface bugs(mouse disappeared and had to restart). Both was quite annoing hand in hand with in game resolution settings only HD!, which is terrible low for today upcoming 4K standarts. And as usuall, poor console port interface/gameplay sh*ts.On the other hand, graphics wasn't worse than Walking Dead or Game of Thrones, only the animations were worse.When we say gameplay is 6 hours... wellI got this from some bundle so game cost me 1 maybe 2 dollars and I am happy.If you guys are fans of Jurassic park and TT games, invest up to 8$.If you just like playing some telltale with sorta challenge(in oppose to their today's games) and OK is good enough for you... Go for it for 4$ or less. Definitelly not trash, at same time definitelly can not give it more than 2 stars of 5.If bugs and sometimes glitches are what you really dislike, get it in some 95% discount :-).HF, VashCZ			"

												No, I do not recommend this.  Not as a game.  See, Telltale adventure games are generally fun and they actually sound like the perfect way to make a game about Jurassic Park that encompasses the messages and themes of the franchise, which the shooting games have never even tried to convey.Also, the story is actually pretty good.  Far better than that piece of junk Jurassic World was, at least.  This game is a direct sequel to the original film (as in, it's set literally on the next day), and it pays good homage to the series while actually solving a few plot holes existent in the films.The problems, though, start with the gameplay.  There's practically none of it.  Its divided in two sections, adventuring and QTEs.  Adventuring is pointless.  All it does is pad the playtime, since the ""puzzles"" range from simple to insultingly simple.  QTEs are self explanatory.  Love them or hate them.  But even if you do love them, they're still terribly handed here.  The prompts on the screen don't correspond with the actions, and sometimes they don't even show up when they should due to bugs.  Or sometimes they do show up but the controls will still not respond.Furthermore, the problems with Telltale's engine are at their most obvious here.  The framerate will suffer major drops (which will also give you trouble with QTEs), and there's a jarring design difference between the realistic dinosaurs and the cartoonish people that makes the visuals unappealing.  It's like if the characters in Jim Carrey's The Grinch were to make a crossover with James Bond.  It looks wrong.Speaking of dinosaurs, be prepared to lose all respect for them, with how easy this game makes it to escape or fool them.Now, if you're only interested in story, then by all means ""play"" this game.  As an interactive movie, it's not bad.  If you're looking for a challenge or another way to stimulate your brain, find something else.  Pretty much any other Telltale game will do better in that respect.			"

												I started the game from the 1st episode screening through a projector on my wall lying on my bed playing with a gamepad & ended it. As at this time we are hearing of an upcoming film being made: Jurassic Park 4, this was an appetising opening act.Sure, it is like they say with fumbling controls; but the story made it worth the excitement almost like watching a Jurassic Park film that I had never watched before (having watched 1,2 & 3). Indeed, apart from basic similarities, it was different (introducing Dennis Nedry) and refreshing, preparing me in awe for the upcoming film! If it was more like the films than it already is (minimally) I may have been upset as the handling was really quite fickle, I endured the acrobatic controls to enjoy a NEW story now rather. I enjoyed the game on the wall instead the big picture took so much of the frustration caused by the controls away! Game on.			"

												The game is fantastic, i have put in at least two hours into the game and most likely will be playing after i put this revriew in. The game has a okay story line, i mean you can immerse yourself into it, but with a good game comes cons as everyone knows.Pros: Amazing story line.Epic DinosaursFunny moments (it's perfect for a game that is this intense sometimes.)Cons: There is a bug where the mouse cursor disappears if you play the game and go to menu.Some audio moments is off.Sometimes the game has a break moment or a lag moment. Most of the time it could be the computer or the game so no problems.I wouldn't get it at full price as it is, but i would get it if the game was half price off or 75% off. But it is worth the game play at a cheaper price			"

												Ever since I saw the trailer for this game when it first came out, I was like, ""Oh my god! I want it!"" And with a lot of money in my steam account for the holiday sale, I thought it'd be a good idea to pick it up and give it a whirl. I do not regret it. This game is made by TellTale Games, the makers of Sam and Max, the Back to the Future Games, and the Bone Games. Here is where their craftsmanship AND their knowledge of the film comes in. I can remember the film like the back of my hand, and there were so many references that I was like, ""oh! I remember that!"" I especially laughed at the ""hold onto your butts"" reference. You see, this game starts with the embryo theives. The embryo theives are heading into the park as the storm on the island was about to ensue. Then, you come across the fat guy from the film that nobody remembers the name of's car. You open the car and find the dilophosaurus feeding on him. Then, you go to the point of view of a worker and his daughter. I like how in this game, the focus is not on Hammond, Dr. Allan Grant, and their crew, but the people in the background that you really don't think about when watching the film.Then, the lady gets attacked by a dilophosaur, coems across the guy and his family, you hit her with a car, and you sleep through the night events of the first film. You go to the visitor's center just as Hammond and his crew is leaving. So, you know you will never see the film characters. The rest cannot be spoiled because it is very exciting with like: five twists that are worth while. The one thing that bothers me is that this game is an entire game built on quicktime reaction. The game isn't really a challenge (there being no lives or anything and constant checkpoints are everywhere), but the quicktime events are just so annoying. It's a point and click as well, but you don't move with the mouse. The game basically looks and acts like a movie, so I guess the only way to express it was the quicktime events. They aren't that bad, but they can be annoying if you have slower reflexes. I give this game an 8.5 out of 10 because of the quicktime events that make it more frustrating.			"

												I was going to write a review earlier, but I decided to wait till' I beat it. Here we go, review of Jurassic Park: The Game!*que jurassic park theme*Graphics 10/10: For a telltale game, since this was made in 2011 im saying this from that years graphic standards, and it looks pretty good, with only occasional lag spikes, but when they happen they simply just pause the game, although not the music.Music 7/10: Now I know what your thinking, OMFG WHY YOU RATE JURASSIC PARK THEME SO LOW OMFG IM REPORTING YOU TO STEVEN SPIELBERG, no im not rating the Jurassic Park theme that low, its the music made by the developers im talking about. It is still great, and it catches the overall atmosphere of the game JUST under perfect.Gameplay: 8/10: I have to say, sometimes I enjoyed watching the characters talk more than playing the game, because of one reason in 3 words; QUICK-TIME-EVENTS! Seriously, it makes you press 2 different buttons in the same sequence AND you dont even know what the next button you need to press IS until it pops up onto the screen, and by that time you have about a quarter second to do that! The quick time events I enjoyed is where you need to keep pressing the same button over and over again until the meter is full, and also the parts where you have to concentrate by moving your mouse into a moving circle for a couple seconds.Overall 8/10: Its a great game for Jurassic Park fans, especially BIG fans like me, (srsly I own almost every dino game on steam), it would be ok for telltale fans, but if you don't take part in either of those communitys, DO NOT BUY IT! Only do that if your bored and looking for a short adventure. Great overall! Have fun blasting through Isla Nublar!			"

												Probably the worst of the of the license-based Telltale's adventures, just barely worth playing, and definetly not for all. Indeed, the Jurassic Park environment and story are excellently integrated and this is the main strenght of the title. Gameplay is limited to quick time events and some choices that have not a huge impact on the story development. I like this kind of games besides the limited interaction, since they are pleasant to follow such as long movies with engaging and immersive narratives. This is what I look for in Telltale games, and I was never disappointed playing the Walking Dead series, the Wolf Among Us and Tales From The Borderlands (...just one episode of the last one is available at the time I'm writing). If confronted with these more recent products, Jurassic Park: The Game is still unripe and has several limitations. On the one hand, the dialogues are very well written, the characters are interesting and some scenes and plot ideas are simply brilliant. On the other hand, the narration itself has some weaknesses, the most serious being some characters' attitudes and morality instantly changing without properly explained reasons, and a non existing finale, the game leaving you with no clue about what happened to the characters after they jumped on a boat. Since the authors have spent so much time creating the story and the dialogues, it is really absurd they had not provided the player with (at least!) a written text or something about a meaningful end; the game menu appearing out of nowhere really made me think the game crashed, and then i felt very disappointed for a work abandoned halfway through. My vote is 6.5 out of 10, and consider it only if you really like Telltale games, or (maybe the only strong reason to play it until the end) you are a Jurassic Park fanatic.  "

												I wrote a longer review, but it didn't save for some reason q_q.  So super shortened version:6-8hrs of Gameplay to completeGame is awesome so long as you don't mind controller input error being a thing (if you don't press it 100% DIRECTLY Right when it says ""R analog >"" it will count it wrong 90% of the time.. there's no sensativity setting to fix this) then you'll be happy with this game.  That being said, with the occasional input error, you get to see a lot of the awesome death sequences you wouldn't otherwise see, a lot of them are really well done and intense ^_^ #silverliningboys)Make sure you talk to the people with the R-Trigger when available otherwise the story/characters might feel bland.  Remember, in Telltale games, YOU control the story being told.  Dialog is important; explore it.I got emotionally attached to the characters.  Experienced joy, frustration, worry, edge of my seat intense moments.Soundtrack, scenery, voice acting = immersive and fine as butts ^_^Caters to the fans of the original movie, but isn't JUST for fans of the original movie, because it can easily stand alone as it's own story.I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price (because of the controller input issues being potentially very frustrating to some people), but definitely pick it up during a sale.*Should be noted, it doesn't recap your stats or story at the end like some of the other Telltale games does, which is disappointing, I wanted to know how many times I died to the button boss.*			"

												What a truly great game, I sat and finished it all in one sitting as I wanted to see how the story would progress.  I love the intense quick time events and action sequences, they had me at the edge of my seat.  As well, the characters are interesting and well written(there was one switch that I didn't find believable, but we'll omit that).   This is a suspenseful horror/action game, it even had a few good jump scares that really startled me, but at the same time it finds room for character development which is mostly well put together, with a few flaws, and you'll even get a few good laughs along the way.  If the plot and characters in Jurassic World were half as good as they are in this game, the movie wouldn't have sucked so much.  This is a title that well deserves to bear the name of Jurassic Park and I don't say that lightly as I am a tremendous fan of the original film, having also read the book.			"

												The game just does not feel very fun to play. I didn't really care about the characters and the use of Quick Time Events only works if it is doen well. I ran intpo several cases where I failed a QTE because the game stuttered. The voice acting is moderate at best with some real painful deliveries. The button presses are counter-intuitive and instead of using buttons that you woul naturally hit to simulate crawling or climbing, you will find yourself taken out of the moment to focus instead on whatever random button they choose to use. It constantly felt like I was clashing between controlling the game and taking it in. There was never a time where I was doing both.			"

												I do really like this game. Some may call it linear, some may call it a Quick time event compilation, but i think its a stellar point and click game. Its never too hard to a point that you need to look up a Guide but (most of the time) also not to easy. There were really difficult Puzzles though. Doable, but hard. Aside from the point and click parts you have the other Elements that this Game offers. First, the Story. Here is where the Quick time events come in. There are gonna be people that wont like these parts but heres the deal:Bad Quick time event: Come right the hell out of nowhere and can cause cheap deaths.Good Quick time event: Gives you enough time to react, you expect it and it overall is placed better.I think this Game has the GOOD Kind of Quick time events. When there is a point in the game that uses this it shows you because there then is an icon at the upper right corner of the screen. At first its a Gold Rank (T-Rex). If you miss one little move that isn`t fatal, it turns silver (Triceratops). If you then miss 2 more times, it becomes Bronze (Dilophosaur). As you can guess, this is kind of a rating system of how well you did during these events.Verdict: I think that this game is overall very good. Flawed, but good. If you like Jurassic Park, then buy this now. What are you waiting for? ITS JURASSIC PARK! The story is especially great for fans of the movie because it basically takes place during the events of the first film, but here the focus is on other characters created for this game.If you havent seen the movies, you can still play this game but you probably wont understand a lot of the references (theres quite a few!). Overall, Good Game. "

												Being a fan of almost any game that involves dinosaurs and a fan of the Jurassic Park films I loved this game, the storyline links well to the series of events that occur during the first Jurassic park film with accurate references showing that once again TellTale games definately do their research!Being a game that relies almost entirely on quick time events they are not for everyone as some parts prove challenging to maintain a steady flow without messing up, and messing up just once often leads to your death. The short reaction time that is expected in some parts can be daunting but it is humanly possible, you just gotta be in the mind set for fast reactions.You are given a rank at the end of each section, depending on how many mistakes you made during it. The ranks are Gold, Silver, Bronze and nothing. Gold requires no mistakes throughout the section, silver allows for 1 mistakes to remain in the silver rank, bronze allows 2 mistakes to keep within the rank but at 6 mistakes overall you don't get a medal for that section. Some sections you automatically get gold for simply playing through it, for example during a section based around the speech choices you can get gold as there is no mistakes to be made.The achievements in this game are creative and unique, some involve exploreing the surroundings, some require taking the shortest path through characters discussions whilst other require making no mistakes/not dying during an entire playthrough! Overall I would recommend this game, it is exciting, interesting and extremely enjoyable.			"

												Perhaps Telltale's weakest game. The story and characters fall flat and are not nearly as engaging as they are in other games. The gameplay, while similar, also feels unrefined. It's okay to play through, but I certainly wouldn't recommend playing through this more than once.			"

												This game was a lot of fun to play as the references were great and it felt like watching the movie all over again, the story was well executed and it fit the continuity correctly. The only question I have to ask is ""Where is the main character's moustache?"". If anyone remembers, the guy who's looking after the sick triceratops in the movie has a moustache but this guy doesn't. Overall I would recommend this game.			"

												As far as adventure games go Jurassic Park is very shallow but as an interactive movie it is awesome! The writing and voice acting are solid. The story is adventurous and suspenseful, and it supplements the first movie perfectly. Great music and sound; Good looking stylized graphics and MASTERFUL cinematography! The quicktime events which drive the ""gameplay"" are nothing impressive but the countless death animations that accompany their failing are thoroughly entertaining. The few puzzles are simple, but effectively so in my opinion. Unfortunately short, only 4 episodes...I wouldn't pay full price for this ""game"" but I completely recommend it for the price of a movie ticket; It is EASILY better than the last 3 Jurassic movies, cinematically and story-wise!

												This game walks the line of being awesome and terrible. The story is cheesy, animations are sometimes broken, very elaborate  quick time events that can be quite hard leading you to die quite often. The fortunate side effect is that the (sometimes elaborate) PG13 death scenes are hilarious. The game will make the quicktime events easier if you fail them enough times.This is a cheesy B-movie type experience that can be quite broken but I enjoyed the ride nonetheless.			"

												Came to this after playing Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us. Definitely a good Telltale game! Not quite as refined as the newer series, but it really gains its stride after the first episodes. Negative reviews say this is more like a movie than a game, and that's completely true but that's alos what I liked about it! It rarely goes on sale because of the license, but it's definitely worth your time if you like Jurassic Park and Tell Tale.			"

												I'd had this one in my collection for a while; but never really got around to playing it due to a lack of time/interest. That was, until I recently watched the original movie in 3D and got hooked on the series again!The Jurassic Park Game IS the icing on the cake for the trilogy, It ties up some loose ends and answers some questions (whilst creating new mysteries while it's at it). My Favorite part being when we meet the Velociraptor from Movie 3 and learn how it gets the Gash in it's eye.The gameplay is quite repetative and gets stale quickly, I mean there's only so many quick time events I can do in one sitting (and I played through the whole game in a single 7 hour block), but you often find yourself overlooking this gripe because of the brilliant story telling methods and sometimes jaw dropping/startling encounters.I would highly recommend trying for 100% achievement completion on this title, even if it means using a guide; as you get a lot more details out of the narrative and find some pretty cool easter eggs that sometimes blow your mind.While I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, Fans on the series will love this title and even new comers to the series will get a kick out of it occationally, and hopefully inspire them to go watch the fantastic filmsBias Score: 4.5/5Actual Score: 2.5/5			"

												This is a very story-driven game.  The story is solid and the dialogue is good.  I found most of the characters somewhat unlikeable, though.  The gameplay consists of a mix of pressing the right button at the right time and some logical, but pretty easy puzzles.  I wasnt very fond of the timed button pressing, but it did fit with the actions of the scenes, and if you miss the buttons multiple times, the game makes it easier to do (eg, you might only have to press one button instead of two or three at that same time).  Rounding out the interaction is the dialogue options and exploring the environements.  The graphics are decent but nothing special.  Both the voice acting and music are excellent.  Overall, it took me about 6 or 7 hours to complete.  If you like Jurassic Park, or like games with a solid story, it's worth it, but I would wait for the price to drop to $5-10.			"

												I will only recommend this to hardcore fans of the Jurassic Park series. Casual wise, this may or may not satisfy you. While I deeply love Telltale and the game itself, I also have a few minor complaints when it comes to that being the animation glitches and loading times between new scenes. My biggest gripe is that the story is a ""been there, done that"" kind of thing where the last 3 movies already did so. i.e. Stuck on a island, dionsaurs running rampant, chaos ensures. So, it just constantly drags on. Granted the new characters are ok, but not in the sense of nostalgia. John Hammond (including the aftermath of Dennis Nedry) is howerver referenced here and there considering this story (reminder that this is non-canon story) takes place in between the original and Lost World. The only thing that sets this Jurassic Park different from the rest is the inclusion of new dinos such as the Troodon and the Tylosaurus.  Gameplay wise, its the stuff you should expect from a TellTale game, given that this game is a point and click adventure much like the beloved Walking Dead game also released from TellTale. There was some annoying segments such as the action command either not showing up or it goes to fast making timing a chore. Is it worth the $30 price tag? I will just say wait for it to be on sale if it's to expensive for you, but with a side warning as stated above.			"

												Rewriting my review as I've now 100%'d the game (with 0 deaths).I had been super psyched for this game. I'm a massive Jurassic Park fan, and having enjoyed Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, Jurassic Park: Trespasser, Jurassic Park III: Danger Zone! and LEGO Jurassic World, I was ready to take on a more cinematic experience that would hopefully go deeper into the Island and its problems.I was so terribly wrong to be excited.This was a painful, brutal experience. From retconing the official canon and the classic messages of the books/movies, to poorly constructed gameplay and bad design choices, this abysmal experience is not for the faint of heart.Jurassic Park: The Game is an example of game that does QTE-gameplay poorly. The reaction times are wildly inconsistent, and often you'll find that the game wildly changes between requiring light-speed reflexes and dinosaur-slow presses. The UI Prompts which tell you what to press do not line up with whatever is going on behind them, and often you'll be pressing directional keys that have no relevance to the action the character is performing, which means that it's almost impossible to guess what to press next and makes the game feel random and not skill-based. As well as this, the QTE-chains have no visual hints for the next button press in the queue, so in order to obtain the Gold rankings needed for 100% completion (or to just keep your character alive) you'll either need to keep practising by reloading your previous checking (simply press ""Load Game"" in the Pause Menu) or just get damn lucky with your guesses to get it flawless.In one of the final QTE sequences of the game, you're required to mash a button beyond the limits of human strength and stamina; as it turns out (EVEN RUNNING ON A GTX 980!!!) the game lags so bad at this point that it isn't able to grab your input as often as is required, so it assumes you're mashing the button slower than you really are. You'll need to lower all your graphics settings to pass this stage for flawless achievement and the Gold ranking.The problems in this game's technical execution are compounded by its inane ranking system which I've been making mentions to above; each stage of every episode is ranked between Bronze, Silver and Gold based on how well you do during a QTE sequence (if applicable, as some parts are dialogue/investigation only and should automatically grant gold). In some stages, you can get away with a few slip-ups, while others require every single QTE press to be perfect. Inconsistency is this game's major pitfall, and it makes playing the game frustrating as you have no way to know if what you're doing is going to absolutely work or not. The game makes sure to put the ranking directly in your face for the entirety of the sequence, and in some cases it will auto-save a checkpoint right as you fail a QTE, essentially screwing you over if you wish to obtain Gold on your first try.With that in mind, it's recommended that you get Gold rank on every stage on your first go, as attempting to replay a specific stage from the main menu will not save checkpoints, meaning you'll need to restart the entire stage if you continually mess-up.I've focused on the gameplay, but it's not the only place that has major issues. For a game relying on the strength of its storytelling and characterisation; many of the characters are 2D and unlikable, and will often do stupid things that go completely against their character, the dialogue was written by a three year old having a tantrum, the voice acting is often stiff and lifeless and the animations can end up looking like bad animatronics.To spare myself further pain and misery from recalling my experiences, let me finish with this; Telltale Games have made fantastic games, such as the Sam & Max franchise, The Wolf Among Us and Tales from the Borderlands. Those games do everything this game tried to do MUCH better, and you'll enjoy them far more.Only buy this game if you're a serious achievement-♥♥♥♥♥ who is also a glutton for punishment.			"

												So just to clear up the game has the same style of looks as The Walking Dead series of games by the same company Telltale games. I have no idea whether is plays the exact same i.e. same set of ontrols and gameplay as The Walking Dead as I've not played that yet so can't really ompare it.Jurassic Park the game is loosely all QTEs so its a bit terrible in that department but all in all it has a brilliant storyline and does its best to fill in the plotlies left in the first movie like what happened with the shaving cream can that Dennis Nedry drops dring his attack from the Dilophasaurus? It also shows more people who are also stuck on the Island whom of which are one of the vets and his daughter.So despite its gameplay mechanics which normally appear to quickly and making your stoach be on the recieving end of  Triceratops horn I would recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of the movies and is looking more to storyline than gra[hics or gameplay.

												K I recommend this game to anyone who loves dinosaurs, and liked the previous movies. Overall the story is pretty interesting, and there are tense points in the game. HOWEVER I'm sure all of you guys realize at this point that this game is a point and click. It does not seem like that was their intention from the beginning or something because this is a very poorly executed game of this sort. I can accept point and click adventures if I like the story but sometimes this really gets ridiculous. It switches perspectives WAY too much. You're listening to a really heated coversation between a veterinarian and geneticist about how the woman is a madman, and you've been choosing dialogue options for the veternarian. OK, not that bad, although I just wanted to sit back and watch this. But then you make me choose the dialogue options for the madman? IN EVERY SINGLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CONVERSATION YOU HAVE TO PICK THE DIALOGUE OPTIONS FOR EVERYONE EVEN IF ONE OF THEM IS CLEARLY ♥♥♥♥ING INSANE AND YOU MOST OF THESE DIALOGUE OPTIONS YOU WILL NOT LIKE! What the ♥♥♥♥? Really poor design. I can't side with the madman at all so you're literally forcing me to pick nothing. I'm glad this game flopped because they deserved it for designing this game so poorly. ♥♥♥♥ing dumbasses.OH YPIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I GET TO GO THROUGH A SCENE WHERE I HAVE TO PRESS TIMED LEFT AND RIGHT FOR THIS CHARACTER WHO APPARENTLY IS TOO ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID TO WALK ON HIS OWN, AND GOES THROUGH A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 15 SECOND LONG CUTSCENE BERATING YOU FOR HIS INABILITY TO WALK.

												Rating: 5/10Overview: Interactive Movie with quick time eventsThe Bad:- One quick time event after another - You can dodge a T-rex ready to bite you simply by rolling out of the way.  - You can outrun a velociraptor and T-rex on foot- You can stop a dinosaur from biting you simply by grabbing its head- Dinosaurs are not very threatening  - Terrible characters and awful dialogue - Music and Sound glitchesConclusionOne of Telltales first games and it shows. Luckily if you want a Jurassic Park fix simply watch the first movie, you will have a much better time. How anybody on the development team thought the scenarios with these dinosaurs were good is beyond me. "

												Pretty solid game, can be played both of keyboard+mouse or gamepad, personally I think the gamepad's gameplay is a lot harder. The story is pretty linear, not enough branches but playing through it once is enough experience. Re-live the Jurassic Park movie in good graphics, it fills that emptiness of lacking dinosaur games in the recent years. I thoroughly enjoyed the hours I've spent playing this game.Character development is alright, the player gets to make decision for pretty much everyone.The game's fairly difficult in terms of reactive gameplay, it will definitely improve your reaction time and allows you to make clutch plays better in other games. I'd be surprised if anyone consistently scoring Gold throughout the game.The game has interesting puzzles that you have to actually put into effort to solve (or trial and error if you prefer to not do the brain work at all)A fair bit of jumpscares from time to time.The only improvement I can think of is the continuity of dialogue/speech/action getting cut off/skipped and the accidental ESC press will bring you to the main menu with delay.Overall it's another damn good game from Telltale. Worth it.			"

												This game is absolutely underrated. If you're a Jurassic Park franchise fan, you'll definitely love it. Why? There are so many references to the original JP movie and the second The Lost World movie. You can hear about John Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow, you can read a special journal which creates supreme logical explanations about the movement-based and binocular vision difference of Tyrannosaurus Rex and extreme big sizes of Velaciraptors because they were actually smaller according to paleontologist, besides Utahraptors and the venom spitting demeanor of Dilophosaurus and what happens to Isla Nublar after the first movie. Meeting with Sarah Harding (Ian Malcolm's girlfriend in The Lost World) was also a nice detail.Using John Williams' score for the game? Telltale nailed it here. Awesome job.I went to see Jurassic World a week ago and the I watched the first 3 movies like 50 times in my life and I started playing this one and now I'm completely overwhelmed by the magnificent aura of Crichton's creation. Jurassic Park is my childhood, period. 8/10 for my final score, the only frustrating part of this game is the action sequences with annoying controls. I was obsessed with taking Gold Rank on every chapter, so my playtime went to like 9 hours.			"

												WHAT A RIDE! I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Sure, it has its share of issues but with this game it's about the experience! Which is action packed and exciting! Sure, the story isn't too complex and their could of been more puzzles and more point and click elements but the game was still fun! This is the part that matters.  I definitely think the game was judged way too harshly and I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone who has a fan of Jurassic Park.			"

												If you are a fan of Jurassic Park you will love this game. 10/10.Compared to other Telltale games this game is basically a story since you don't choose anything, with lots of quick time events during the action sequences (that can be really difficult sometimes!). The story is good and very fast paced, and again if you are a fan of Jurassic Park or dinosaurs you will probably enjoy it a lot more.			"

												I basically only finished the game to see how the story unfolds. Turns out it was as bad as the game itself...It's hard to believe this is a Telltale game because everything about it is low budget, graphics, character design, story etc. The acting is bad, but I think it's mostly due to the really poor manuscript, half of the dialogue makes little or no sense. At one dialogue choice the characters could be making jokes and laughing, the next choice they are devastated and can't hold their tears back. You also choose dialogue for both the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys sometimes, making it really awkward, like you're having a discussion with yourself...In every other Telltale game you get to make several decisions that decides how the story is told. In this game you basically just choose dialogue until you get bored and choose the option ""Enough talking"" to make the story continue. You make one ""important"" decision just before the game ends *SPOILER*, but it only decides if one person dies or not, the end itself is almost 100% identical.The only positive part of this game is it depends on you making fast enough inputs to avoid getting eaten by dinosaurs :) making it a bit more interactive than the typical Telltale game. Sometimes even this gets annoying though, but I still think it was a nice addition.This game isn't even worth playing at a huge discount, it's still a waste of 6 hours. So trust me, I've played every single Telltale game and liked them all, but please pass on this one.			"

												A Telltale cinematic adventure game that is not as engaging as The Walking Dead. The gameplay is mostly choosing dialogue and doing really hard quicktime events (which reward some good dinosaur deaths if failed). The story gets bogged down near the middle but is good at the start and end. I suggest watching a Let's Play of this game instead of actually buying it, as your choices don't change the story except for one at the end.			"

												To all Jurassic Park & Dinosaurs fans, this game is right for you... The best thing about this game is it has a complete set of new story line which is really awesome and thrilling from where the movie left with the canister of dinosaur embryos. The game consists of 4 chapters with hours and hours of fun game play. The graphics are good (Dinosaurs are made well matched to the movie with extra Dinosaurs) and different genre knows as Point-and-click adventure, role-playing which is not bad. You will get killed too with different awesome dinosaur kills =P Epic dinosaur battles Triceraptors vs T-Rex which is available only in this game. Perfect environment and weather conditions feels drizzling and feels went back to Dino times. Characters are appreciable & well made. Variety of dinosaurs including water Dino Tylosaurus (Which I always wanted to see) , Classic T-Rex , Dilos & Raptor. This game has 2 Climax! Lots of dialogues and variety of scenes according to what we dialogue or decision choose. Personally I love this game a lot. You earn medals gold, bronze or silver according to your game play (Death Trolls) and achievements. Sounds effects are impressive. Overall a decent game for blockbuster movie” Jurassic Park”.

												Being a huge Jurassic Park fan since the 90's, owning this game was a must. The story to this game isnt bad at all, it has some fun tense moments that I wish the films included. However the only huge downside I had to this game was that Telltale changed up the mechanics of this game with those ♥♥♥♥ing annoying arrows. So it had some really frustrating moments when you had to hit (sometimes predict) what keys to hit, if you messed it it would lower your overall situational score from gold to silver to bronze to nothing. If you died so many times, they made it easier after so many messups. Story wasnt too bad but it wasnt exactly the BEST. If you can handle watching Jurassic Park III, then you can handle the story in this game. Wait to buy this game while its on sale for at least $7 or under. Overall, the worst Telltale game I've ever played. I'd expect more coming from the developers of The Wolf Among us, The Walking Dead, and even Game of thrones. However, it wasn't a bad game for any true hardcore Jurassic Park fan must own, just gotta have a high tolerance for annoying characters, slow story, and annoying ♥♥♥♥ing controls.

												As a note, do NOT purchase this game with the hopes that it lives up to the quality of The Walking Dead series. Jurassic Park is one of Telltale's older titles, and as such, it shows it's age. The story itself was very interesting, especially if you are a fan of the Jurassic Park world. There are iconic scenes from the films, and the whole story focuses around the can of shaving cream Nedry stole. The game is good if you enjoy story, however, if you're not exceptionally fast with your keys, expect alot of deaths. I encountered no bugs, however, the game requires you to use multiple keys in quick time sequences. Many of these dont make sense, and include triple tapping and then finishing with another directional. The quicktime scenes are unforgiving, and sometimes the keystrokes fail to registered. The game also suffers from some lag. It's not very optimized and many of the textures look like garbage even at the highest resolution. Expect lag, regardless of your setup.			"

												It pains me to give a Telltale game a bad review since I've loved all the ones I've played so far but this doesn't even feel like an adventure game. It feels like one very long and very broken QTE.The control scheme on this game is horrible especially in action sequences. Mouse + keyboard just feels awkward in this one as opposed to other Telltale games like BTTF, Sam + Max, Puzzle Agent, etc, etc and the 360 control scheme is severely out of whack. The game will post on screen instructions with button presses supposedly in north/sout/east/west fashion, but I've seen multiple insances in just the first couple of minutes where what's displayed for what you would think the west (X button) is actually the north (Y button). The prompts aren't displayed long enough before the time runs out to decipher the wonky on screen display and hit the correct button and you end up like a bull in a china shop crashing through the scenery instead of getting it to do what you want. Then it becomes a memory game where you restart and try to time everything with the correct buttons while completely ignoring the OSD promptsI've been playing a lot of Telltale games lately since I never got around to them and am really enjoying them for the most part, but the controls in this one are very off putting. Very disappointed with this one. I don't like having to muddle through a game over simple timing and OSD issuesI wanted to like this game. I really did but it's just an exercise in frustration and is unplayable from a basic control standpoint			"

												Many other people have already reviewed this game, much better than I could ever hope to. I just want to add a very simple ""thumbs DOWN"" and recommendation to AVOID here as well. The problems with this game are endless. I found it unplayable, hugely disappointing, and completely embarrassing for TELLTALE. My rating for JURASSIC PARK: THE GAME: 1 out of 10.			"

												6/10 - Pretty good. Not TellTales BestMaybe due to the game being dated or that it's just too arcade for my liking. Don't get me wrong I still had fun playing this but it didn't blow my mind. Worth $10, not more otherwise buy another Telltale game.

Welcome To Jurassic ParkWho doesn't love the Jurassic Park movies, They're great, well the first one was great!and luckily, Tell Tales Jurassic Park Game picks up where the events of that first and finest movie left off.And keeping in mind that Tell Tale make great adventure games, expectations are high as we enter Jurassic Park.You plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?When you fire up the game you're thrown straight into the action.You'll find yourself running through the vegetation of Isla Nublar with a dinosaur snapping at your heels. A few button presses and tumble off the edge of a cliff later and the screen fades.Ahhh, now we've switched characters and the opening credits roll as we listen to the familiar and excellent Jurassic Park theme music, which does a tremendous job of recreating the  atmosphere of movie. It's now ""earlier that day"". Your cursor has turned into a magnifying glass  and your scanning the plant-life through a pair of binoculars looking for some elusive triceratops.Clever GirlOk, so far so good,the quick time event sequence opening the game got your heart pumping, the more sedate scanning the screen through the binoculars was a nice change of pace.Looks like Tell Tale are on to another winner here, bring on the moral game changing decisions and mind bending puzzles.Here we Go!They're Flocking This WayOh, OK, another quick time event, fair enough, oh and another one and now we're scanning the screen with the magnifying glass again.Surely I can't have seen everything the game has to offer, by way of game play,  in the first few minutes can I?I think things are a little bit different then you and I had feared... Pretty much, yes. The interaction to be found here alternates between frantic quick time events (hit X to jump over a log, hit Y to doge a branch etc.) and the down time with the magnifying glass (playing"" I Spy a Clue"" across various scenes). Not that either of these mechanics are bad in their own right, it's just that together they aren't really enough to carry a ""game"" over four chapters.Our lives are in your hands and you have butterfingersThe quick time events themselves become repetitive very quickly.You'll play through a scene, miss a button press, and die in some horrible way. You'll play throughout same scene again, miss a different button press, and die again.Rinse and repeat until your muscle memory kicks in and you clear that particular scene.At least then you might be rewarded with some cinematics, a little more story to push to plot forward to the next inevitable series of timed button mashing.You were meant to come down here and defend me against these characters!Maybe we're being a little too harsh, The story here is actually very enjoyable, and game can be quite immersive when the frequent quick time events aren't spoiling the atmosphere by pulling your full attention back to the game mechanics.The characterisaton, whilst not a strong as other Tell Tale games, is still very good. You'll get to play as several different characters through out the course of the game, and whilst all stereo types to varying degrees, this does help you relate to them somewhat, you know where you stand with the wise cracking teenage girl, or the tough mercenary without the need for hours of back story.I can't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis NedrySo strong story, decent characters and repetitive game mechanics, that about sums it up, right?Pretty much, but there's another factor at play here too. The optimisation of this game is terrible.You'll experience stuttering sounds, huge frame-rate drops and some lines of dialogue which will repeat themselves a couple of times before giving up and letting the game move forwards.None of this is game breaking on it's own, but with the constant barrage of QTE's, it all works to destroy the immersion of a game which should (and does on occasion) ooze atmosphere.Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that theydidn't stop to think whether they should.Jurassic Park sounds like an excellent franchise for Tell Tale to get its hands on and I'm not sure why they didn't pull it off here.It's such a shame because the Jurassic Park movies provide such a rich tapestry to hang a game on and the story here is actually very good.You just need to push through the glitches and annoying game mechanics to get to enjoy it.After careful consideration I've decided not to endorse your parkWhilst not an totaly un-enjoyable experience, I find it hard to recommend a game which relies so heavily on quick time events and struggles with optimisation issues.If you're a fan of the movies and you're looking for a good story and strong characters then this is the game for you IF you don't mind A LOT of quick time events.However, if playing the same sequence several time over to learn which keys to hit and when doesn't appeal to you, then fan of Jurassic park or not, this game is going to annoy and frustrate.Tell Tale has an excellent track record which, unfortunatley, Jurassic Park doesn't quite live up to.

												Well this was a fun game to play by Telltale. It was a bit different than the other games from them that I played (Walking Dead 1 and 2, and Back to the Future). As the story goes, you play different characters and there are points in the story where you have to change characters so you can get move to the next phase. Kind of like Lost Vikings, if you remember that game. Then there are action parts where you have to press your arrow keys at precise moments to make the correct move. Again, like the game Dragon's Lair, if anyone is old enogh to remember that in the arcades. It took me a short time to get used to it. You can make mistakes as well, but it will cost you points in a sense there is a gold, silver, and bronze rank for each scenario. You can go back later and redo the scenario and get a better grade. And some achievements need to have certain desicions as well. Again, you'd have to go back and play the scenario and make the second desicion to get the other achievement. The downside of this game is that it's really short. 4 chapters and I finished it in 9 hours. So it would be wise for this game to get it on sale, because it may be fun, but I don't believe it's worth the full price. Aside from that the only other thing is it COULD be buggey. It lags a bit so I don't know if it's on my end or the game. Let's just say, I don't have any other problems with any of my other games.But aside from the minor downside, it is entertaining and fun to play. So enjoy.			"

												Buggy. After I pause the game, my cursor disappears.I'm a fan of quick time events, but most of the events in this game are unnecessary and difficult to engage quick enough. These controls are so awkward that they quickly take you out of the story and remind you that you're playing a poorly developed game.I will admit that I got a little more used to the controls after playing a chapter, but then the writing took a nose dive. The characters seem to constantly forget that they are being hunted by huge man-eating monsters even right after an encounter with them. The plot is also pretty shallow in general.Otherwise, the graphics are great and the story is good. Just not worth $20.			"

												Recommend purchasing only if it has a super high sale percentage. It is not as good as the other TTG titles like TWAU, WD or TFTBL. The vignette style is cool but feels a whole lot less immersive than their later works. The QTEs absolutely blow. They make the multiple command chains impossibly quick in order to justify the score system in the game that seems more a way to pad out content or make you watch the dinosaur kills that they put effort into. Overall a fairly poor experience with some fun bits. 2/5			"

												I really, really want to be able to recommend this game, but I can't. I'm sorry, I just can't. I love Telltale games and I have absolutely no problem with well made episodic games; to me, they're like really good books that can be read (or played through) every so often just for an enjoyable story line and interesting characters. Not so with Jurassic Park, unfortunately. I'll start with the premise and the positives though...This game is beautifully conceived and rendered; the premise was too tantalising to ignore. It is set immediately after the first Jurassic Park movie; Hammond, Dr. Grant and the others have just escaped the island in their helicopter. You play as a rag-tag group of characters consisting of other people trapped on the island by the storm, the group intent on stealing the dinosaur embryos and the mercenaries/rescue teams sent in to extract the survivors. It answers all sorts of questions and follows up several interesting threads from the film, like what happened to the dinosaur embryos Nebry stole - okay, in the film they were apparently buried in the mud by the storm, but this covers what happens when the can is found again. One of the characters you play as is Dr Harding, the vet who was treating the sick triceratops in the film, so there is some really nice crossover and continuity. The graphics are stunning and there are some fabulous extra touches, like unlocking journal pages from one of the scientists which muse upon issues such as why the velociraptors are three times bigger than they should be; why the therodpods don't have feathers as they should, why the dilophosaurs spit venom when they shouldn't, and why the T'Rex's vision is based on movement (okay, it's all mainly to do with Dr. Wu screwing things up with frog DNA, but it's still interesting!). So far, so good, but then the game runs smack into a solid brick wall of mediocrity that it cannot overcome no matter how much you want it to, despite being a die-hard Jurassic Park fan and the “OMG WOW!” factor that it's got DINOSAURS in it and how can DINOSAURS not be COOL?!So what's the problem? Unfortunately, there are many. First off; the characters. Not one of them is particularly likable or even consistent in their personalities. You end up really not caring what happens to them, which ruins your investment in the game completely. You kind of wish that they would get eaten by the dinosaurs - in fact, I spent much of the game thinking I'd rather be playing as the T-Rex, because I'd have really enjoyed ripping the heads off the irritating mainstays. And they’d have deserved it. Secondly, the controls - I nearly put this as number one just because the controls are awkward, irritating, badly executed, inconsistent and downright frustrating. The lack of a decent control interface makes the game slow, clunky and repetitive as you find yourself playing through the same short section over and over because one little mis-click has you dead in the jaws of a T-Rex and when you've watched that same cut scene three times over you find your frustrations mounting - it's one of those games where you find yourself shouting at the screen, such pearls as ""stop dying and start running, you idiot!"" and many, many expletives. I tried playing with both keyboard and mouse and a control pad and neither worked properly. Thirdly, the story line. It's... it's okay. Well, it starts off okay and then it just rambles off on a tangent that makes little sense. Seriously, the characters make some really bizarre decisions that end up keeping them on the island and in mortal peril for just that bit longer, apparently completely lacking in common sense and basic survival instincts. Being unable to skip the end credits was irritating but it clearly shows that each chapter of the game was written and directed by different people, so that lack of a coherent, consistent story might be the result of too many cooks spoiling the broth. You honestly get the impression that one team sat down, played with the dinosaurs for a while, got bored, and then handed it on to the next guys to have a go. You are offered tantalising glimpses that some of the goings on about the island were a lot darker and more illicit than the film indicated, but none of this is properly explored.Fourthly, the pacing is awful. You either get loads of character development, which is for the most part boring conversations that you simply have to click-wade through; ploddingly slow investigative scenes which are just looking around and clicking on things until something is revealed,  or rapid action scenes that you simply cannot keep up with. I'm not kidding, racing driver reactions couldn't keep up with the speed of some of the keystrokes you have to make, and if you get one wrong, you've had it. You therefore die two or three times, but then you think 'Ah ha! I've memorised the sequence now' - ready to go for your final attempt, you find the game has realised you're struggling with this bit and has simplified the controls, which sounds helpful but actually just leads to you mis-clicking even more as you're anticipating steps that are no longer there. Frustration reigns supreme once more – finishing each chapter is a chore and the only sense of accomplishment comes from the relief that you’ve finally finished that part and can move on to the next dog’s dinner of a chapter. As a result of all this, the achievements don’t really mean anything – it’s basically a way of marking that you’ve finished each chapter. Some of the achievements can only really be achieved on a replay, which is unlikely to happen given how irritating the whole experience was the first time around. Some of the achievements require a perfect, faultless play through – not impossible, I guess, but very unlikely and no doubt irritating to try to achieve. I certainly won’t be bothering to try for a ‘perfect game’ on this one; I’ve made it through the storyline and that’s enough for me. I imagine that in a year’s time, I’ll see this game in my library, re-read this review, and think; “oh, it can’t have been that bad, I must have been in a really bad mood when I wrote that, I’ll give it another go, after all, it’s got to be some fun, as there’s DINOSAURS in it and DINOSAURS ARE COOL.”Yes, dinosaurs are cool.This game is not. It is an irritating pile of dino-droppings, and I honestly don’t recommend it to anyone.  "

												Despite this being Telltale's biggest Intellectual Property to work with, it feels as though they treated it like their smallest.It looks and feels incredibly low budget. The graphics are bad, the audio and music cuts off and starts abruptly, animations glitch during scene transitions, the gameplay is mostly tapping buttons (so no gameplay at all basically), and the story isn't very good either. Don't accidentally hit space, or esc, or any other key because you'll have to restart from a checkpoint probably several button clicks ago (1-2 minutes).Telltale in an interview, said they were going to deliver a true Jurassic Park game, that fans wanted. Saying FPS games was not what we wanted, but rather a pure story-driven experience. Well I can tell you, FPS is actually what alot of people want, and if you're going for a non-FPS that is all about story, you have to do better than this. This game is something you buy when its like $5, and if not for the annoying button tapping that you have to get just right not to die, id recommend a beer too.			"

I don't know what i'm talking about... But for me it was still a waste of money as i expected more of a third person shooter as i was more used to shooters back in 2013 - 2014.

												I can say that Jurassic Park: The Game is TellTale’s lowest point in their game development – however, that is still a testament to the acceptable quality of their adventure games. Jurassic Park plays more like an interactive movie than an adventure game – more like Heavy Rain than Monkey Island. Everything is broken into quick time events, with relatively long gaps in between action segments. Failing an action sequence oftentimes results in death, which then requires you to backtrack to the previous checkpoint in that sequence and try again. The load times are very fast and you can jump into the action once more quickly if you happen to miss an important button press, but the repetition of these moments gets stale after the first episode. Still, I’d get on the edge of my seat every once in a while as I raced to fill up button press meters to run from a T-Rex. Jurassic Park is not a very long game – only four episodes, making it one of TellTale’s shorter adventures. The dialogue and voice acting is solid enough, though they attempt to give fans a wink and nudge by implementing lines from the movie (“Hold on to your butts…), though they just didn’t mesh right and were executed similarly to corny catchphrases. I found a surprising layer of depth to the mercenary characters, however, the more I started to think about their motivations for being on (and eventually leaving) Isla Nublar. I’m also hoping that the character of Nima wasn’t meant to be sympathetic, as I found her to be annoying and her presence jeopardized or killed many people around her. The game is buggy, in a few surprising ways. Dialogue lines would repeat on me in my playthrough, and during some action sequences some of the button prompts would not appear on the screen at all when I replayed events. It also isn’t a very pretty game – the overall look is stylized similarly to The Walking Dead or Back to the Future, although it is utilized far better in each of those games. It certainly isn’t the best adventure game to be released in the past few years, nor is it a must-buy for Jurassic Park fans. Overall, the game is worth playing through on a Saturday afternoon just to experience another TellTale game, but the current Steam price is entirely too high. This game is only worth about $10 or less, ideally. Anything more than that just isn’t worth the price of admission. Recommended if you’re looking for a quick adventure game, and this game just-so-happens to be on sale. Otherwise, it’s entirely skippable.			"

												Jurassic Park: The Game isn't all bad, IF you like Jurassic Park. Once, finally getting over the slow pace and repetative action sequences, I found myself soaking in the familier settings of the iconic films that I grew up watching. Whilst it is a different story being told to you, it's familiar enough to keep you interested and intrigued in playing through the games some 7-8 hours of game time. This is not game that will be to everybodies liking, but if you enjoyed the films and you've fell in love with the universe that surrounds 'Jurassic Park'. Then this is worth having a look at!			"

												Althought not the best telltale game out there, its still decent, especially to its source material, even though there are no characters from the original jurassic park. While the levels design and the characters are alright, its the gameplay that struggles to be fun, though there are a few epic momments now and then.Its not great, but not bad either, just mediocre. there are better games out there, and this deserves a pass.

												Pros:Alright storyCons:Poor game play. Everything revolves around fast paced reactionary/quick time events (press a button when the button signal pops up on the screen, click this arrow when the indicator pops up on the screen, etc.)  Options/character choices don't really exist (and when they do, they don't matter), so there is no variation to game play.Story gets very boring after a while, but does pick up a bit halfway through the last chapter. Compared to The Walking Dead, another one of TellTale's games, Jurassic Park is terrible. However, if you manage to get this game at a 75% off sale, I guess give it a buy if you're really eager to buy it.			"

												It's a pretty fun point and click adveture game. The storyline is different from the actually movies but that's not a bad thing, considering a lot of people died in the movie (but, you could also say quite a few people died in this game too).  Telltale does a great job on their games, Poker Night at the Inventory was well made and fun game. The Walking Dead, although I only watched PewDiePie play it, had a great storyline, lovable characters, and made me feel sad when some of them died. This game was amazing, although at some points my mouse dissapeared which made Geff and Jess die by the T-rex with the tour car alot. Also, it made me not able to exit out of the speech thing when you asked Oscar about Sorkin.   Besides those two minor,""glitches"" I would reccomend this game.			"

												A great story from Telltale, as you might expect from the developer. The characters were rich and the story was enticing. The only big let down from this experience was that very few (or maybe not any) opporunities arose to make meaningful decisions or game changing determinations. I have grown to expect these from Telltale and was therefore slightly dissapointed.However, the game is still well worth its price on sale. This game has the appeal of a book you cant put down and the action of a movie that makes you stuff your face with popcorn while wearing a wide-eyed expression on your mesmerized face.Dont expect it to be a long game. Quality is king here.			"

												Like some of the other reviewers, I can't say that I didn't like parts of the game, but overall there's no way I can genuinely recommend it. The story is probably it's biggest selling point because it really is kind of cool to nerd out and learn about some of the other dinosaurs that weren't heavily featured in the films, and it helps that the voice acting is, for the most part, pretty great. I think I learned a lot about myself as a person when I discovered that my favorite character in this endeavor is actually trash. What kills this game for me are the clunky controls with the QTEs. I've played other TellTale games, so I had a general idea of what I was getting into when I bought it, but I honestly wasn't expecting it to be *quite* that bad. Playing with a mouse and keyboard, there were times when no matter how quickly I mashed the keys I still managed to screw something up, and this game is generally not forgiving of that at all; sometimes a single slip-up is all that's standing between you and a dinosaur eating your face. If you're looking for a fun and diverse game you're out of luck. Unless you're looking to experience all the diverse ways you can be murdered in a dinosaur theme park, in which case this is an A+ simulator. If you're going to buy it because you're a die-hard fan of JP or TT, I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale again. I picked it up for $5 around the holidays, so I can't be too upset that I don't love it.			"

												Jurassic Park: The Game isn't all bad, IF you like Jurassic Park. Once, finally getting over the slow pace and repetative action sequences, I found myself soaking in the familier settings of the iconic films that I grew up watching. Whilst it is a different story being told to you, it's familiar enough to keep you interested and intrigued in playing through the games some 7-8 hours of game time. This is not game that will be to everybodies liking, but if you enjoyed the films and you've fell in love with the universe that surrounds 'Jurassic Park'. Then this is worth having a look at!			"

I don't know what i'm talking about... But for me it was still a waste of money as i expected more of a third person shooter as i was more used to shooters back in 2013 - 2014.

Good voice acting, although it was bad at times3. Jurassic Park nostalgia4. Nice continuation from the first movie5. Some interesting scenarios...Cons:1. and some bad, bland, and uninteresting scenarios2. Mentioned above... the voice acting had rough patches3. Storyline, although decent, felt loose and less fleshed out than I thought it could have been4. Characters and personalities were kind of annoying, never really shined5. The quick time events felt unresponsive at times and even unfairWhile I love most things Jurassic Park, I can't add this to my list of recommendations. This one can easily be skipped. You wouldn't miss much. Sorry Telltale games, you've made much better!			"

												Well just finished this game and i think it was overall a good experience, however the game has it's flaws.The gameplay is pretty minimal, all you do is solve minor puzzles and press keys under time pressure. But what telltale games lack in gameplay, they make up for the storytelling and cinematics. You play as different characters and get a chance to explore their past and personalyties. Unfortunately the game is pretty linear and there are only 1 choice in the game that truly matters, although it kinda feels like all of them do. I also played this on a macbook pro retina and experienced some technical difficulties with the full screen mode where the screen was completly black and i could not do anything. After some research i figured out that there is no fix on this issue, but it was still possible to play the game in windowed mode. So if you have a Mac and wants to play this game, be awere that you might have to play in window mode, but it is not such a big deal and I still managed to enjoy the game.Overall i think this was a great game mith a good story and it is also cheap, I had a good time playing and defidently recommend this game.. especially if you are a fan of the other telltale games.

												Not worth the time or money. I will say, I have been spoiled a little by telltale games. I have played some of their greatest and maybe that is why I am not a fan of their worst at all. No matter what you do in the game, you get the same ending. The chemistry between the characters seems very fake and the characters perform actions no reasonable person would ever do. Save your money, get TWAU or another, far better telltale game.			"

												Its hit and miss. One of these reviews were its hard to say positive or negative, its right between.Pros:+ an original story+ interesting characters+ to a degree interactive+ cool action scenes+ alternative ending+ controller support+ Nvidia 3D is fantastic!+ a lenghty story with 7,5 hours. Compare this to a 2 hour movie with the same price tagg, you definitely get your moneys worth (for a sale price at least)Cons:- 28€? I think thats too expensive, but on the other hand a blueray costs the same amount for less content. At sale its perfect- QTEs timeframes are sometimes extremely short and impossible to get on the first try- the rating system (bronze, silver, gold) is kinda pointless. I just wanna enjoy the story and its very distracting and only worsen the experience of enjoying the adventure and story- some plotholes, but most movies have some- ....its more a movie than a game, even though it has ""Game"" in the title its totally another movie.- almost no choice throughout the whole movie. Its just QTEs and pressing the right buttons to progress, not to make choices. They trick you with dialouge choices, but they dont matter at all. Sometimes you can even fail a QTE and the movie will still go on, just downgrading your rank (bronze, silver, gold) kinda disappointing- buggs.....not too bad but you will also notice some stutters and hang ups, but never game breaking- puzzles are a nice idea, but executed badly. Its more rewarding to just guess around than to actually think about the situationOverall I still recommend this ""game"" in a sale. If you see it as just another action oriented Jurassic Park movie, I think its really cool. Nice cliffhangers between episodes will want you to keep on watching. They also throw in some stuff that only hardcore JP fans will notice, I really appreciated that. Sit back relax and enjoy the ride.			"

												This is nothing like other Telltale games. It consists almost entirely of using quicktime events to escape from being eaten by dinosaurs. Very fun if you're aware of what the gameplay is before purchasing. If you are looking for a game similar to Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us look elswhere.			"

												When I started to play Jurassic Park: The Game - Telltale Games, I remember when I was a teenager and went to the cinema to watch this magnificent movie. A world of myth come true with dinosaurs. I remembered the dino fever that this film created in every corner of the planet. Playing this game was a good thing, good memories came back and I really enjoyed. despite the negative reviews this game has, I could enjoy the idea of the game. Here you play while everything started to go to the disaster. Also, I could read Jurassic Park book by Michael Crichton, wich I highly recommend.IntroductionHere you have the chance of playing several characters, something very common at Telltale game series. First, you play the introduction with Nima, a mercenary paid by  Dodgson. You remember  Dodgson, that guy talking at the beginning of the film with Gendry, the IT guy. Of course, we all watched the movie and knew what happened with Gendry. Nima has to get the Dino embryos, and that not gonna happen so easily. In the meantime, she finds other members of the Nublar island.Also, you play with the Harding family, Gerry, and his daughter Jess. remember Hading, the veterinarian at the movie? Well,  the same. He invited the girl that last day for an educational experience, with will be a little complicated. The idea of the game is not just exploring the island when the electricity goes down and other interesting things happen wich you have to investigate. In the meantime, running away from all perils of a  full dino island.Like all Telltale games, more than a graphic adventure is more like a visual adventure movie, you can have the chance of changing some things but not always. Maybe some ends but if something is meant to happen, that gonna happen. Of course, you'll have the chance of interaction between characters, each one with a  very well made personality, so that's a good one for the scripters. The game explores other things the movie doesn't. Of course, I'm not comparing the great Jurassic Park with this game, but I think the game has their good things. I think the people of Telltale read Michael Crichton book to take some ideas from it.Here you have scenes to complete, and the game saves automatically after each one. Depend if you make mistakes or not, you can reach gold, silver or bronze status. remember Steam achievements if you like to complete them.I highly recommend saving every time you can just in case. There are very hard scenes and saving will be a useful tool.Art and MusicFor a game made at 2011 maybe the cinematics would be better but I think the game, in general, is quite good. The landscapes well make and the dinos are good. Could the game be better in this aspect? Yes, of course. But I have to mention about the music. Is never disturbing, just great for the action scenes and with that reminiscence of the great John Williams creation for the original movie.Final thoughtsA good game with a good story. I read other comments about the game and I don't understand why they say about phrases out of context or something like that. I think the game has the Jurassic Park spirit. I watched the movie at the cinema, I watched the movie again several times and I read the book. I think it has the spirit. That island had a lot of things to explore, and having the chance of creating over the created is just awesome. telltale did it so I give an 8/10 for this game. I enjoyed playing it! "

												This game gets a lot of undeserving flak. While its gameplay solely consists of mashing QTEs, I actually liked this movie-game. Think of it as of worse The Walking Dead with 5 times the QTEs. I strongly suggest using the x360 gamepad with this game, mouse controls are wonky and all over the place.			"

												OK, I read through the negative reviews and I don't quite understand what the fuss is all about. Granted, I played through only Episode 1 so far (at the time of writing) but I must say, to my surprise, that I thoroughly enjoyed the game! Of course, the controls can get a bit difficult at times but this should not take away how good the gameplay story is. I played through the Walking Dead and Back to the Future games by Tell Tale and this game is on par with them.Moreover, this is one of the few games where I enjoyed losing because in most cases (as far as Episode 1 is concerned) when you lose, you can see your player being eaten by the dinosaurs! I found this very funny but I don't recommend small children watching this! It could give them nightmares!I heartily recommend this game to Jurassic Park fans and players who love point and click games.			"

												A low point in games from Telltale Games.After Sam & Max and Tales of Monkey Island games another approach was taken, adventure and puzzles were replaced with quicktime events and timed button presses. In this game the sequences and timing are often flaky, sometimes more sensitive and sometimes less but equally annoying.The story is not that special either.For a fan of adventure games I wish they had retained classic adventure and story telling that have worked so well.I understand the need to try something else but this should have got more design and gameplay development before releasing. Not recommended unless you are a fan of this kind of games or just want to collect games. "

												First off, I'm a HUGE fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, and when I heard that Telltale is making a game based in that world I figured it was the best of two worlds finally meeting.  Sure, others were saying negative things about the game, but I've played ""bad"" games before.  Well, not like this one.For the first time in awhile, Jurassic Park actually presented me with a game that frustrates on gameplay ALONE, and that's saying a lot seeing there are basically only four buttons you need to press the entire game.  The QTE given in the game are so fast (and sometimes complex, ranging to a sequence of 3-4 buttons that need to be pressed within a second) that many times I found myself dying numerous times just to memorize the pattern.  In addition (although this might just be my computer) the buttons were sometimes non-responsive, leaving myself even more frustrated from dying over a SINGLE ""misbutton"".  Unlike with Telltale's Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us, Jurassic Park is simply a movie (and a poor one at that) where it will prompt you occasionally to push the left or right arrows.  Not so much ""gameplay"" in that idea.As far as the story goes, it left a lot to be desired.  Sure, it was nice to visit the park again in a new light, and I secretly enjoyed it when they dropped some big names from the franchise in conversation (Sarah Harding, Peter Ludlow...), but many of the things that Telltale teased to us over 3/4 of the game would eventually just wander off never to be seen again.  In fact, in the majority of the fourth episode the main character says that it's impossible to clone any aquatic dinosaurs and then . . . there's an aquatic dinosaur (with no explanation).  At one point, a character makes a big threat to release a dinosaur into the wild, does it . . . and then nobody does anything about it.  They talk about dinosaurs escaping the pens, but, well you guessed it, they never go beyond that.  The story has so many plot holes and missing points at the end, that I felt very let down to call this an addition to the franchise that amazed me as a kid.My advise on playing it?  If you're a fan of Jurassic Park like I am, sure.  Grab it.  But don't go for it until it's on sale.  For alot.			"

												I really liked Telltale's previous big franchise adventure games, Back to The Future and, especially, The Walking Dead - and since I've always liked Jurassic Park, I figured that this game would be right up my alley. Sure, I'd read the warnings in form of poor (I mean, *really* poor) reviews for this game... but I figured that, given my previous happy encounters with Telltale added my interest for Jurassic Park (who doesn't love dinosaurs?), it would still be fun. I figured that even though it might not be great, it could still be a good enough game. I mean, how bad could it be, right? Well, as it turns out: really, REALLY bad.Let's start with the actual gameplay: there isn't much of it. The story pretty much unfolds by itself, merely prompting you to hit the right buttons at the right time (which, at times, is an absurdly frustrating and pointless task). You can't explore as in other Telltale games, there are no choices to be made and you're generally just viewing an interactive movie. Which, even though it's a letdown compared to other Telltale games, could perhaps work... if the story was better.And that brings us to the story: while not bad per say, it's not something special, either. The story in itself is decent, no more, no less -  but it's ""supported"" by crummy dialogue and unlikeable and unlikely characters that are, at best, pretty forgetable. And you constantly switch between them in a fashion that makes you not really know who you're controlling at times, going from fighting a character at one moment to controlling the former enemy at the next. And there's no way to skip dialogue or any of the counbtless cut scenes... so when you die (and you *will* die) due to missing one of the gazillion reflex button hits, you're often forced to sit through the same scene again and again.And the bugs... oh dear. The bugs in this game forces you to constantly exit the game and, even worse, re-play some of the long and horrible sections again and again. And this game, mind you, have had 3 years to get patched up! Yet none of these absurd bugs, like the mouse pointer often dissapearing, has been fixed! Shame on you, Telltale.In short: I'd only recommend this game to hardcore fans of Jurassic Park or Telltale. Preferably both. And even then, I'd only recommend it if the game is *at least* 75 % off. Come to think of it, you probably shouldn't even buy it if all those 3 criterias are fullfilled. Just stay away from this game. Resist the lure. You'll be happier without it.			"

												This is a very frustrating game.  The writing is actually pretty good, but the ""gameplay"" is virtually nonexistent, unintuitive, and buggy as hell.  It's mostly just twitch ""puzzles"" where you have to tap a direction when an arrow appears on screen, but it frequently gives you nowhere near enough time (I failed many times by hitting the correct direction within a quarter of a second of the icon appearing).  That wouldn't be so bad, but the direction you have to push is often arbitrary, so you have no way of knowing what it's going to be before it happens.  There are a few where it warns you ahead of time, and you're only supposed to push the direction when it pulses, which is very difficult since the game conditions you to immediately tap the button when you see the icon.  I think the designers intended players to play through a section over and over until you memorize the pattern, but they have a lot of unskippable dialogue and cut scenes that make that an even more tedious prospect than it would be anyway.It only lets you specify once whether you want to use mouse and keyboard or gamepad (I strongly suggest mouse and keyboard), and if you change your mind you have to edit registry files to fix it.  I tried both, and the control is even worse with a gamepad.  The mouse pointer occasionally disappears, but you can work around that by going to the main menu, pointing where the icon you need to click on is, then going back to the game. I'm also having a recurring issue where the game will kick me back to the main menu, and forget my prorgress so far on the currrent scenario.  It's happened intermittently before, but now it happens every time, so I'm unable to progress beyond the part of Episode 2, Scenario 7 right after you take off in the chopper.I suggest just watching the game on YouTube instead.  You'd get to see the story without being hampered by the terrible gameplay.			"

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.I am in the middle for this game. I like it and I don't like it. For those curious about the overall game, it's more like an interactive movie. You watch events unfolding and you can change the course of events or better events through prompts on the screen indicating keys that should be pressed and will have to be pressed at the exact time or quickly enough. There are lots of dialogue prompts giving you options upon interactions with others. This game is not for me but may be for other people. I am a big fan of jurassic park, but not this game. The major problem I find with it is watching and waiting, then when the prompt comes up I either missed it or mess up because I am too busy watching the ""movie"" or get tired waiting. The other problems are the numorous glitches, which I encounter and is unknown whether others ecounter them as well, which include the cursor not appearing during gameplay, the fact that scenarios in an episode already played through cannot be accessed, and that certain dialogue prompts lead to a brick wall. I had the dialogue issue and I had to replay the game from a previous secenio which I now cannot access. And about that, I was halfway through the second episode when I went to resume playing and I was forced to begin from the first episode again and nothing I played in the second scenario could be accessed even though I played through the last couple of scenarious again. Instead of relaxing I kind of got a headache and just went to play something else.			"

												The main reason I'm writing this review is that there are A LOT of negative reviews here and I feel they're not justified. This is a really good game. And if you're a fan of Jurassic Park, it's even a GREAT game.However, it has an extremely QTE-oriented gameplay, even by Telltale Games standards. Which is probably why there are so many negative reviews: if you don't like this type of gameplay and you really didn't expect it then of course, the game is going to come off bad.The story is wonderful, very close in style (and reflection) to the book, although I'll admit there are some pretty cheasy plot twists. The graphics now look a bit outdated but not bad enough to affect gameplay. Most of the characters are very enjoyable, the voice acting is pretty decent (which, along with the QTE gameplay sometimes gives you the impression you're playing a movie... if that makes any sense to you). And, of course, the soundtrack is awesome (gotta love that intro).The steam achievments are easy enough to get 100% as well, if you're that kind of player :)			"

												As a huge fan of the Jurassic Park series I am looking for an actual good Jurassic Park game... I have played Lego Jurassic World and I loved it! Then I saw this game, and I saw that it was on sale for like 2 dollars or something like that. I purchased it and played it for about 45 minutes(despite the negative reviews), after those 45 minutes I realized something... This is actually the worst game I have ever played! The Character development is disgusting and the story is so unbelievably bad. Unlike other telltale games like the walking dead,  this game is pretty much a point and click.

												This is not a good game. The gameplay elements themselves are just quicktime events, conversation trees that all lead to the same result, and simple puzzles. Even as a story it doesn't hold up well. The characters are one dimensional and completely unrelatable and the plot itself is pretty dull.I'm a big fan of the Jurassic Park films and of dinosaurs in general but I can't recommend this. It feels like someone wrote the script and then added in a token amount of interaction so it could be called a game, but it doesn't hold up well as a story or a game.			"

												Interesting pre-cursor to Telltale's later (better) work like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Though this one seems to be mostly QTE and much less story.It also is way too buggy. Apparently they never bothered to fix all the bugs, and it remains mostly unplayable.Definitely cannot recommend unless they decide to fix player input. "

												You know what's funny? The ""people"" downvoting this review. Before you read any further google ""TELLTALE REVIEW BOOST"". This shady company made this horrible game and faked reviews praising the game. That should tell you enough.Don't buy this game. The entire playthrough is a fixed amusement park ride. No, not like one of those major theme parks you go to with your family...I'm talking about the shady ones that open up near your house in the summer by people that want to take your money in exchange for cheap prizes. There is no freedom in this game. You do what the developers say. Go through the scene too slow? DEAD. Smash your buttons too fast? DEAD. If they tell you to take your pants off and sit on a banana...you better do it. Or else dead. Got a bad case of dino fever? Don't give these crooks a dollar and go watch the actual movie instead.

												Jurassic Park: The Game could of been so much better. For those of you looking for the writing and edge of your seat moments of The Walking Dead series, you'll be dissapointed. You won't find them in this game. The first major issue would obviously be the gameplay, which is entirely driven by QTEs. They're not that hard but they are constant and become boring very quickly. There is some very minor exploration but that is really just panning across a single screen until you find all the clues, which are highlighted anyway.  You can't control your character but simply jump between scenes at the press of a button. That pretty much sums up the gameplay for you. For everything else. the writing, characters and graphics are fairly average. Nothing stood out to me. Music is taken straight from the movie, I can't remember hearing any original music at all. Some people might prefer that but I didn't. At times I would get an annoying glitch with the sound which added a echo effect to all the voices and some sound effects. Overall this game doesn't offer anything interesting to a Jurassic Park fan or even an adventure game fan. For hardcore Jurassic Park fans who are going to play this no matter what, like me, I would definitely say wait for a sale.			"

												I gave up on this. Trespasser was a bad Jurassic Park game but at least it was....interesting. This game isn't interesting. This game is actually barely a game, it's more of a mildly interactive visual novel which would be ok if it was a decent visual novel. It's not. Instead it's got a dull story with dull characters in a surprisingly dull locale. One of these days we'll get a great JP game. Even just an average one would be a start.			"

There are a lot of inconcistencies in the story, in the consequances of your actions etc. There is no skill involved, no strategy applied.. You just push buttons randomly to the left right up or down without any logic at all. Just your reflexes... this is soooooooo stupid.... If this was just a movie it would be worth of watching but this way.. hate this game.. The creators must have been totaly stupid. This cannot satisfy any gamer..			"

												This game is laughably bad. I still liked it, but it's a terrible example of a good game. Though it is no Trespasser, this game does terrible things with the Jurassic Park franchise the least of which being having a blatant Vasquez from Aliens ripoff. As far as story goes, the characters actions and events surrounded them seem to jump dramatically between being painfully predictable (The annoying shmutt with the flashlight's demise.) and utterly devoid of logic. (Raptor knife fight, sitting on a Rexy's face, you get the idea.)It's really bizarre how downright bad the storytelling is though, considering Telltales recent endeavors with the Walking Dead and Wolfman series which have been excellent! They seemed to work out all the kinks in their story telling style here. This game is like seeing all the crappy 3rd grade crayon level drawings Leonardo da Vinci must of done before painting the Mona Lisa. On one hand, I'm glad they worked it out so that Walking Dead and Wolfman could be so good, but on the other I wish they didn't butcher Jurassic Park to do it.			"

												This isn't a recommendation. It's a sad, sad, day. I wanted so much to love this game. But it wasn't an adventure game. It ... wasn't a game. It was a movie where I had to click a mouse a few times to move the story along.     Get ""Back to the Future"" instead.     On the other hand, this is a fairly decent movie. It just isn't a game. Nope. Not at all.			"

												It's an ok ""game"". It's more lika an interactive story than a game, think Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain but not as good. Was a bit lacking in the story/character department for me and that being one of the main points in this type of games is not good.Though it's somewhat fun to revisit locations you see in the first film.

												I had really high hopes for this game after seeing the trailer.  Had I known what kind of game it actually turned out to be, I would've passed on it.Unfortunately, this game is nothing more than one extremely long cutscene with badly programmed quicktime events and lame point and clicks interspersed.While the story is somewhat interesting, it is not enough to redeem the horribly long dialogues and terrible quicktime events.

												This game is fundamentally flawed in writing, bugs, and gameplay mechanics. There is so much here that I want to love because I adore the Jurassic Park universe, but I simply can't bring myself to get past the first two episodes. It starts out fairly strong and you may even find yourself having fun, but prepare to lose that feeling at a rapid pace. Hold onto your butts.			"

												The Egregious:As far as QTE laden games go Jurassic Park The Game has to rank among the absolute worst.  The QTEs are the game play and are poorly designed, poorly implemented, poorly placed, sometimes make no sense and are poorly explained.  Gaming wise JPTG is an epic catastrophe that  deserves it's own pillar in the gaming hall of shame.  This is a work that could of been something much greater.  The Redeeming:If you're a fan of a decent dinosaur tale and don't mind watching the death scene after death scene as you fail QTE after QTE you might want to give it a spin.  Some of the death representations are laughably side splitting and ludicrously enjoyable, so much so that I looked forward to and did not care to fail the QTE sequences.  The dinosaurs are the one awesome and redeeming aspect of JPTG.  They are awesome in every respect.  They look realistic, behave realisticly thanks to their great modelling and animation.  The dinosaurs save Jurassic Park The Game and it is on this one merit that I can recommend what I would otherwise classify as a classic gaming disaster.			"

												Holy crap, stay away from this game.I finished the whole game and by the end of it I was so mad (and I had a killer headache).Notes: QTE stands for ""Quick Time Events""Jurassic Park: The Game is an adventure story which has one game play element, QTE's. But not just QTE's, poorly done QTE's.In general, I hate filling a cut scene with some interactive ""Press X to not die"" but having a whole game hinging on this pathetic excuse for interactivity is down right dreadful.My biggest problem with this is that it takes you out of the game. Unlike seeing that you need to move or duck or jump the game shouts at you ""You're holding a controller! Press the blue button on the controller to do some special thing!""Also, the game's sound is REALLY buggy. In the first scene in the game the audio was bugging out and the characters kept repeating their lines over and over again. Also, there were times when you would hear a strange echo even though there was no reason for one (specially at the end or episode 4).Now, when I say poorly done I'm not saying that it's just that they are frequent. Nope, they are actually technically poor. When the ""Press the X button"" icon jumps up on the screen if you mis-press the button it actually immediately fails. This would be a pain enough, but when you're told to move your thumb stick in a direction it's possible to accidentally hit the detection for the wrong direction failing you out.Also, for some reason it was decided that the standard fair of QTE's wasn't enough. This game has complex button pressing. Sure, you'll find the average button mashing (press a button a bazillion times until a meter is full) and the button holding (press and hold a button until the meter is full) but this game had the HORRIBLE idea of combining those two so you actually have to hold both bumpers WHILE pumping a button until a meter is full.There are also FOUR button combos which if you mis-press any of them in the split second you get to react you die.My only happiness came at the end of the credits. Tell Tale is the king of adventure games (second only to double fine) but Jurassic Park the game is something that should have stayed extinct.			"

												Jurassic Park The Game is a cinematic adventure divided into four-episodes. It is full of Quick-Time-Events with a story that smartly expands on that of the movie.The events of Jurassic Park The Game run parallel to those of the first film, starting soon after Dennis Nedry’s unfortunate run-in with the dilophosaurus. While he is out of the picture before the game begins, his can of Barbasol, loaded with dinosaur embryos, plays a major role in the game. Jurassic Park The Game follows a group of survivors left on the island after having missed the evacuation boat during the storm that knocked out the power in the park. These include the park's veterinarian and his visiting daughter, a jilted geneticist who cares more about dinosaurs than people, the mysterious woman sent to steal dinosaur embryos and a few mercenaries to rescue the stragglers.Each of the characters has a backstory that the player learns more about as the game progresses, but most of the characters are so unlikable that it is difficult to care.Jurassic Park The Game consits of two types of sections: action sequences and puzzle sequences. The action sequences consist entirely of quick time events. The worst offenders are the double or triple arrow quick time events. It is unfairly difficult the first time, but then stupidly easy the second time, and it gives the player no satisfaction.Following the lead of the boring action sequences, the puzzle sequences require virtually no thinking. Most are solved by clicking all the investigate icons until something happens.There are a few graphical glitches, but overall, the environments and the dinosaurs look fine.Locations, sound effects and music from the movie are good used.I can not recommend it to anybody, except hardcore fans of Jurassic Park. There are a lot of better point and click adventure games. Jurassic Park the game is not worth the full price.Sound 8/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 2/10Atmosphere 5/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Telltale is known only for their exceptional storytelling in games, dating back from the days of Wallace and Gromit (so no, JP is not one of their early games), and those games are really more visual novel than anything else. Most people probably never heard of them until Walking Dead, and having said that, Jurassic Park is a slightly more....prehistoric beast in comparison. Ahh....ah?You have absolutely no control over characters in this game, compared to Walking Dead (I've not played Game of Thrones or Tales from Borderlands, so I can't comment on those) - you only get to select different scenes or subsets or characters within each ""scenario"", and then you often have to figure out puzzles. Most of them are pretty easy, and really there is only one puzzle at the almost end of the game where you'll basically have to spend some time, Google it, or just do it through trial and error. Maybe I'm an idiot.Compared to Walking Dead, the QTEs are much more difficult as well. The game is composed entirely of them, and the key prompts are challenging to say the least. I haven't tried it with controller but I'm hoping that it becomes easier. In addition to the QTEs being often fast paced and frustrating, they are somehow hard to see, and, nearly half of the achivements in the game are tied to doing them perfectly. There's even one for never dying - considering failing almost any of the QTEs means instadeath, it's a challenge, but obviously not impossible.The story focuses mostly on the cryogenic Barbasol can storing the stolen embryos, and the quest of a mercenary to retrieve it. Thrown into this mix is a fair amount of loose inspiration from the actual book. Ingen dispatches some mercenaries to extract the survivors who missed the boat before the US military blows the island up. However, the story is based on the continuity of the movie, rather than the actual novel, in which Hammond escapes the island -but, Dr. Harding is a very different person who doesn't make it off of the island. Who is also apparently Sarah Hardings dad (not impossible but not how the actual novel goes) which is plausible if you read The Lost World, but contrived. Faithful to the movie, the game is full of suspense and action, with some science and ethical undertones. You will constantly run for your life and try to escape death at the hands of four species of carnivores, and even the trikes will try to kill you. There is no safety in this game and if you don't excel at QTEs, you are going to die over and over.I found it to be pretty entertaining and worth the money. I waited for years to buy this game and finally decided $8 was as cheap as it was going to get while I still cared. It contains a LOT of throwbacks and references to the books, and the movie and Telltale did a great job with authenticity. Mr. DNA, geothermal power plant, Henry Wu, the lysine contingency, the silly 3D Unix interface, Muldoon, the tour cars, all of that is in the game and again it very much explores a lot of the content that was in the book but not in the movie, like the rides, the aquarium, the underground tunnels, etc. If you like Jurassic Park and you like Telltale Games, then you will definitely like this one. Go ahead and pick it up.			"

It looks much worse than newer TT games, yet it plays slower and weaker than them.Not playable without controler - mouse cursor dissapearing each time you go to pause screen. Try to do cursor-oriented QTEs without seeing a cursor...By far the weakest game I've played from TellTale. Avoid.			"

												The story was ok but the graphics suck and the gameplay is nothing but QTE's. The worst thing about the QTE's are the fact they are the worse QTE's i have ever had to deal with. Sometimes they are really slow, others are about right, some are so fast that you don't even see what they were before they are gone. They also don't stay in one place so you can easily miss one looking in the wrong area. Then to top if off the controlls sucked on the controller and while the mouse and keyboard was an improvement i had issues where the mouse pointer dissapearing at times i really needed it. I also want to point out if you want a gold rating you will be reloading a lot and the load screen takes forever to work because of their menu screen animations.       I heard a lot of people liked telltale games so i bought it but I can't enjoy this game. It's sad because I loved the show.			"

												As a huge fan of Jurassic Park, I was utterly disappointed in this game, although not at first. At first it was nice just to see Isla Nublar again. But JW delivers that in a much better way than this game does.The gameplay is entirely QTE-based, and 100% completion requires reflexes that I'm pretty sure aren't humanly possible. There's a lot of unforgiving trial and error moments where the game won't reveal what button you're supposed to press until the nanosecond you're supposed to press it. The keyboard/mouse controls are super clunky. The story is lackluster and reads like a poorly written fanfic, with people outrunning raptors and rexes in footraces across open ground for no reason. Repeatedly. One of the main characters is supposedly a character who made a brief appearance in the first movie, Dr. Harding. However, the game strips him of his hat, sunglasses, and moustache for no apparent reason even though his first appearance in the game is implied to be before his movie appearance.Some plot points don't make sense and the characters do more stupid things than the entire cast of Jurassic Park III. The death of the final human antagonist in particular is disappointing because it's due to that character's own stupidity rather than any cleverness on the part of the player.Admittedly, there is the occasional nugget here and there that shows the people who made this game are huge fans of the JP films, which only serves to make the game's overall execution all the more baffling.Bottom line: if you ever played Jedi Academy and want to see Rosh Penin get eaten by a T-Rex, then this might be the game for you. Otherwise just play Dino D-Day or ARK or something.			"

The death of the final human antagonist in particular is disappointing because it's due to that character's own stupidity rather than any cleverness on the part of the player.Admittedly, there is the occasional nugget here and there that shows the people who made this game are huge fans of the JP films, which only serves to make the game's overall execution all the more baffling.Bottom line: if you ever played Jedi Academy and want to see Rosh Penin get eaten by a T-Rex, then this might be the game for you. Otherwise just play Dino D-Day or ARK or something.			"

												Only slightly better than the worst movies.  The quicktime events are fairly bad often requiring a death to know the split second event is coming. Its not too bad though. The story is mediocre but passable. The Latina character's spanish is stereotyped and I'm shocked they didn't have her screaming Speedy Gonzalez lines. But its not so bad that people are overtly offended, just raised eyebrows. This game fails for one reason. That annoying teenage girl wont stop screaming, being a brat, and she doesn't get eaten.

												The story was ok but the graphics suck and the gameplay is nothing but QTE's. The worst thing about the QTE's are the fact they are the worse QTE's i have ever had to deal with. Sometimes they are really slow, others are about right, some are so fast that you don't even see what they were before they are gone. They also don't stay in one place so you can easily miss one looking in the wrong area. Then to top if off the controlls sucked on the controller and while the mouse and keyboard was an improvement i had issues where the mouse pointer dissapearing at times i really needed it. I also want to point out if you want a gold rating you will be reloading a lot and the load screen takes forever to work because of their menu screen animations.       I heard a lot of people liked telltale games so i bought it but I can't enjoy this game. It's sad because I loved the show.			"

												The game is broken. After you exit the game, sometimes it won't let you open it. Then Steam verifies that it is open and task manager can't find it, so you'll need to restart your computer or you can uninstall the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then reinstall it, but you end up losing everything(I have a feeling either way you'll uninstall it for good, though). Also, quick time events react SPECIFICALLY on whether or not you can hit on time, which is a VERY short window of time. When playing, the mouse likes to vanish too, especially when you need it most. It's fixed when you enter the menu, but when you go back to the game, it's gone again. It's 2015, you would've thought Telltale would've at least fixed this by now. I'm glad the Wolf Among Us is better than this crap. Bottom line, don't waste even a damn penny on this game. The game developers aren't going to waste theirs fixing this, so why should you?			"

												interesting view what happened when the movie ends. this should have been the second movie. at least the concept was way more interesting than ""the lost world"". the book is also much better. at least in this game they explain about other survivors and what really happened to the shaving can that was lost. a very QTE heavy game that mostly leads to some frustrating moments due lack of time to recognize the key you have to press because it requires you to press 3 different buttons in a row. the checkpoints are OK placed but if you fail one and die, you have to replay the enire checkpoint again and the worst part of it is; that you cant skip any of the cutscenes. none of the scenes are skipable which makes replay rather obnoxious. failing certain QTEs are ok since they have no impact to the situation. unless if you are an achievement hunter. fail 1 you get a silver ranking. fail 2 and you get a bronze ranking. fail more and its still a bronze rank. the voice acting is rather mixed. some sound ok wile others are rather poor. but the characters at least are interesting enough that you will not forget them that quickly. the puzzles are very decent with the limited spectrum available and we do see more dinos which we never saw in the first movie. and of course the trex has its glorious moments that can get pretty tense. the game also offers you some choices that have some effect like what you say and what you do. i want to like this game but if i cant skip cutscenes and doesnt really give you enouh time to recognize the buttons you have to press in a very tense moment, i see no reason to play it again. even when you want to see and/or find out what outcome your actions will have. worth at least one playthrough but not at full price. get it on 75% off as i did. at least there you dont feel like you have made a loss.

												Jurassic park: The game is one of the earlier releases by 'Telltale' games. This game follows the events of the original 'Jurassic Park' film where you play as a group of survivors attempting to evacuate the island.Telltale does a great job telling a story, the quick-time events are very interest and the most enjoyable part of the game was dying horrifically in a variety of ways. Here are the pros and cons;Pros- Good story telling- Interesting characters- Quick-time events are fun at times- Fantastic moments backed by the classic theme music of Jurassic park. This game has great heroic and sad scenes which make it above the mediocre experience of story-telling. Telltale at moments manage to capture the magic of the original film.Cons- The story for this overall felt to short for a telltale game.- Quicktime events were incredibly difficult and frustrating, the keyboard inputs for PC were incredibly difficult because of the confusing icon. While quick-time events happen, you barely see the events taking place as a massive flashing input key is splashed largely infront of the scene.-While quicktime events are fun, the constant button mashing was tedious after the first hour or so. - Despite having a good story, there was a variety of plotholes and moments (Despite developed characters) that ruined the experience. - Graphics felt out of date. - Jurassic park: The game does not allow players multiple choices that impact the story-telling like 'Walking dead or Wolf amongst us'. This is a con because while you can tackle obstacles in a manner of ways, I felt you had no control of the overall plot which felt linear.Overall while I can recommend this game to dinosaur and Jurassic park fans. I can not recommend the game while it is still at the 20+ they charge for it. But, if the game is on discount it is certainly great for burning 4-8 hours on (depending on your capability to button mash). This game goes as a narrow recommended because of the above average story telling and at times capturing the 'magic' of Jurassic park.7/10			"

												Beat the game, had fun, hate the puzzles, but love the story.I'm pretty new to Telltale's story based games and due to the Summer sales (And my love for dinos and Jurassic Park) I decided to check it out.It's fun seeing the story unfold, almost relaxing even before it's time to get into the Quick-Time-Events. The story isn't bad if you have an open mind, but a hardcore Jurassic Park fan will likely dislike it. (Mind you this is more of a sidequel after all)As for gameplay and controls, I really like the system. It's more of a ""Point-n-click"" kind of style and although I had more fun using the Xbox Contorller, it is keyboard and mouse friendly so you don't need to worry if you perfer the gamepad or keyboard and mouse, you'll still have a good time.The only thing that was a turn off is some of the puzzles. The most annoying ones tend to get me out of the story. I'm not going to be a spoiler, but during the beginning (or middle?) of the last episode really bug the heck out of me. I had more fun doing ""TIMED"" Quick-Time-Events then puzzles that I had to force to remember doing it if that made any sense.All in all I really like this game, and if Telltale made a Jurassic World game, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.

Jurassic Park The Game: 7/10 BUYER BEWARE - This is almost pure QTEJurassic Park The Game Impressions:For a game shamed to be the worst Telltale game, this one is still pretty enjoyable. The story is rather cliche, the characters are mostly stereotypes, but it works for this franchise (but sometimes one has to disband disbelieve too much). Telltales writing has gotten much better since this, but the action scenes (QTE's) are still tense and forgiving enough as to not get frustrating. If you miss the first time, normally you get a second and third chance, before the teeth get you.Some puzzles are not too fun, but still manageable.My biggest gripe was not the fading graphics, which show their age, but rather the music, which mostly just doodled in the background, only seldom to use the bombastic Williams music.For one of the early big license games by Telltale, this is a perfectly competent and fun QTE game that is worth getting on massive discount during Summer or Winter Steam Sales.If you are a Jurassic Park movie nut, then be also warned, there are some freedoms taken with the canon, but nothing really bad.

												I love this game. I am a big fan of the series and have always loved it. After Nedry dropped the embryos, I have always wondered what happened to it afterward. Then I found this game. This game is rediculously fun the first time around and is always fun to go back and try to get Gold Medals on QTE's. Many people have complained about the QTE's and that they are a stupid fun draining idea but when you are playing you actually feel like you are in the game. As all Telltale games do, this game provides an excellent story. Enjoy. If you survive.			"

												Full price NO hence the thumbs down. On sale, if you like Telltales games and Jurassic Park, then YES, you’ll probably enjoy it! Read on for full review to be prepared for this game’s shortfalls.First the bad points, its SHORT, its only 4 episodes and I complete the story in 8 hours and that was with retrying a few sections over and over again, to try and get a perfect gold award for the quick time events.Which also leads into another bad point, certain quick time events are the standard, press the button the minute it appears on screen, some are, wait until a ring shrinks and goes down and then flashes before pressing the button....now you can imagine and in a game emphasizing speed, quick button pressing, while getting chased by dinos on the screen, instantly just mashes the buttons as they appear only registering that it was a stupid ring version after it its already saying that you missed that quick time event! Another issues, is some you need to pressed one after the other, so for example it might pop up on screen for you to press 'down' and once you press that, it turns instantly into a 'left'. Now 9 times out of 10, this is find you have time to then press the 'left' button but every now and then it only gives you a heartbeat to actually press that second button...so even as your brain is registering 'left' and your finger is pressing 'left' its already said you failed, the only way is to reload and memorising that section and instantly press 'left' after pressing 'down' not even waiting to watch for it to pop up on screen.Thankfully, it auto saves quite regularly but it still brings us to another issue, now I know this game is basically one long cut-scene but with all this reloading to try and get gold awards you can't skip dialogue! So get ready to hear the same thing over and over again.Still if your a fan of the films (which is properly the only reason your looking at this game), then your going to enjoy playing not just another story set in the universe of Jurassic Park but with new characters another perspective from the first film. It gives you references at certain points as to where you are in the timeline of the first film.Sadly this is all happens in the first episode, as your playing, your characters sleep for the night, when they awake, its implied that the film has now ended, leaving just you guys on the island, now I can understand while this was done, to avoid the issue of why didn’t these two groups ever interact in the film but I'm sure I remember a scene in the film, where a certain group spent the night sleeping in a tree!To me, this feels like a missed opportunity, they could of have more references, maybe stuff that happens in the film interferes in this game characters chances for escape, for example turning the power back on for the fences, could of prevented the characters in the game from linking up with the film characters.*Slight spoiler alert!*It also could have made the first episode be stretched out to last 2 or 3 episodes, as sadly the 2nd episode of this is properly the weakest! It introduces more new characters but you’re sat there thinking what are they doing?! Why are they fighting amongst themselves?! And then your like, why aren’t they leaving when they've got the chance?!Thankfully episode 3 and 4 are better, again its them struggling to either be rescued or get off the island, it almost feels like two different stories if it wasn’t for the episode 2 linking episode 1 and 3/4 together.Still I enjoyed and to repeat my opening statement, if you like Telltales games and Jurassic Park then you’ll probably enjoy too but only get if and when it’s on Sale.

												I bought this game because I'm a big fan of the movies.Now that I played it through I'm completely disappointed. It's a pretty underdeveloped game.The only positive things I can mention are the dinosaurs and the music. Every other thing in the game is just terrible.And if that's not enough it's buggy as hell. It's a QTE based game but some parts of the game it doesn't matter how hard you try it simply won't recognize the push of a button. Because of this some parts of the game are almost impossible to made (for example the fighting scene at the end). Another annoying bug is that some parts in the game the cursor just disappears. You either restart the game or figure out where the cursor is by frequently bringing up the main menu with the escape button. Also if you pause the game for a longer period of time the sounds are completely gone and only echoes can be heard. This will go away at the next chapter but still... it's unacceptable.The motion capture is terrible, the graphics are terrible...Only buy this game if it's on a discount because it doesn't worth the full price!Luckily I bought it for 4,99 USD... but I feel that it was still too much for it.

												A really mediocre game unfortunately, i dont recommend buying it UNLESS it is on a sale discount and you are a big fan of Telltale or Jurassic Park franchise. Here are the pros and cons:PROS: -Very nice music-Nice graphics especially the dinos, they are exactly like you see them in the movie.-Nice levelsCONS:- Bad character body movement- EXTREMELY BAD  QTEs!!!- Mediocre (at best) voice acting- Shallow characters (except from Nima maybe)- Many lags during the game and i dont know what was the reason for it.Overally it wasnt bad, at least for me, but its not worth it at full price. As i said at the start buy it only at a discount. "

Very fun game, I kinda wish telltale stuck closer to this game when it comes to action sequences. It's closer to Heavy Rain. All around, it's fun if you like Jurassic Park, and Telltale/Quantic Dream (creators of Heavy Rain) style games.			"

												At first i have to state im a fanboy of both, dinosaurs and also the jurassic park franchise. so as i saw the game was for sale i bought it without reading any review and so i went head on into the game, without knowing what waited for me. i played the walking dead and i liked it a lot, so i thought im gonna like jp the game also...lets start with the cons:im german and i played the game in german, so i only make statements to the german dub and its flaws. and there are plently. sometimes the char answer something what doesnt make any sense given their facial expression, sometimes its like the char are ignoring given questions and answer something completely different. the camera is sometimes a bit crappy, the viewangle is not always perfect. but thats not a major problem.there is a major problem with the quick time events (qtes): sometimes, when a quick time event happens, you are able to go  to the supermarket buying groceries, help your grandma cleaning the house, go for a walk with the dog, come back to your pc and still got plently of time to finish the qte, BUT there are qtes where u have to act so fast you could apply as the flash, given if you want to finish the chapters with gold medals. I failed a few times due to the unpredictable nature of the qtes and im not motivated enough to play through all the chapters again. where i missed getting the goldmedals. i must admit: its hard to get action (in this case fast action scenes, like running a away from a dino) into a point and click adventure but it has to be fair and not exhausting and frustrating.the pros:i liked the story, for roughly 8 hours of gameplay (completed the game, not including getting all chapters in gold) and it was ok. sometimes the character ark makes no sense (for example nima, shes at first hostile and takes hostages and promptly friendly af) but all in all i liked it. its jurassic park and it has not to be realistic, i mean cmon giant dinosaurs running around the earth.... in comprehension: with all its flaws, i enjoyed the game and had fun but you have to be aware of the quick time events, if you hate quick time events leave the game instantly cause there are a lot in it.its more like a playable movie then a game in the classical way. i paid about eight to nine euro for the game which was ok for eight hours of gaming. if you like the jp franchise and if you want to know what happend to the shaving cream can from the original jurassic park, you can buy this game.

												Oh man, I love you Telltale, I really do, but this is a mess.Let's start with the objective faults. There are game problems. These include minor issues, such as choosing the resolution sets the resolution at the same time, so if you're at say 640x480, and you want to get to 1920x1080, your monitor is going to pass through about 15 resolutions before you get there. This is annoying and there is no need for it, and should really be patched out.Space, for some crazy reason, functions like the escape key in most games. The game is poorly optimised so if you happen to press it, expect a good 5 seconds until you're back in the game.Many a time for whatever reason the mouse icon was lost off the screen. Sometimes the only way to fix it was to quit the game entirely.The plot and storyline is, passable, but not as brilliant as say, the remarkable Wolf Among Us or Walking Dead series.But the quick time events. Oh man. The QTEs are where the fault in this game is 100%. Even with all the other problems, they pale into insignificance to the problem of the QTEs.The QTEs have compound buttons on many occasions, such as Left then Down. However, the timing is instant, so if you don't hit it straight away, you fail. The game does not give you enough time to actually see the QTE before failing the QTE, and a single fail means you lose ""Gold"" rating. Further, these all occour in the high action story points of the game.So what should be the action highlights of the game, the fun sequences, just leave you frustrated and angered as you see fail after fail and reload trying for that Gold and perfect QTE sequence. You'll start to repeat the mantra. Right down right right up up down right as you memorise a level's QTEs for the gold. Finish it and then move onto the next level to start again. Left up left down right up right......Poorly executed game with some of the worst QTEs that I've ever seen in gaming. Only for dedicated Jurassic Park fans. Skip this, and go get The Wolf Among Us if you haven't.			"

												Story picks up Jurassic Park first movie somewhere after Nedry gets killed in the car, and Hammond evacutes with the others off the island. No knowabel characters from the movie, but still new ones which you will connect with.Now comes a long section, just jump to the next if u wish the short summary of it...The story of the game is well written, with just the right amount and timing with thrill and excitement. However, I found myself going from thrill to frustration and back again. This kept rolling back and forth like a wheel downhill. The gameplay is mostly point-and-click, which is fine. There are usually 3 types, pulsating clicks, spam clicks and just tap click. They also run a medal system throughout the episodes, and this is where the frustration come in. When clicking you will have short time to think and react, when you fail you will often get killed by a dinosaur. Developers, I adore your commitment to find new and exciting ways to get killed, and for being one of few games where the child character actually can get killed on camera (which many wouldn't dare do), but did you need such a pet on the back and ""good job"" that the click is impossibly fast? And again, it would be okey, but don't dump medal for good player down for your wish to show off good job... Being one that can easilly average a 6-12 hour playtime most days, i find myself feeling i die not because it is skills that fail, but it is meant to fail. Long story short, just show off the good job, but don't punish  us for seeing it. Drop the medal system, or actually make a game requiring skills to earn them. This just require playing the episode over until u know the combos by heart...Bottom line:I find myself playing it through, because the story is great. I also find myself thinking I only ever play it again, when i begin to forget the story... For me, this is a one time per 5 year game, that is how often i think i play this... Please, drop the medals or make a game for skills. This is a movie with ""click to die"" opportunities. It would have been more entertaining as a animation movie than a game...Can't give this more than 5/10, and most of that, is because of storytelling, not as a game...			"

												Ah. Another of the classic Telltale games. Like all the others, Jurassic Park is based in the same universe, or in this case the island, but feature a new set of characters. The story is great, however the unforgiving quick response mechanics might leave many frustrated. This is not the kind of game to sit back and relax with. Overall though, a great game!			"

												If you are a Jurrasic Park fan, then this is the game for you. I enjoyed the storyline and the ability to choose different dialogues. The storyline is an interesting twist to the people looking for the shaving cream. It has a lot of intense moments fighting and getting away from dinosaurs along with some problem solving. The dialogue is at time funny or goofy.I don't play games often, but this is one that I was hooked on because I Love the Jurrasic Park movies. The way you play this game reminds me of DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) because you are following the arrows (clicking when you seee the arrows). There are a few times when you use the mouse for gameplay besides choosing dialogue. It was for the most part entertaining and exciting. Something interesting is when you get to the end there are two different endings. I thought that was cool, but for the other scenes I believe it is going in one direction to get to that point. The only thing I can think of that I dislike about this game are when I need my mouse but I cannot see it on the screen, but if I am lucky I can hit the right key (which isn't often). I do not have a very fast reaction time, so there are some moments where the only way I can get a sequence of movements right is if I memorize it. This is for when I am trying to achieve the gold for the scenes within the episodes.Personally I would give this game an 8 out of 10 with 10 being the highest because it is fun to play and I am going back for the various acheivments. I took two points away because as I go back and finish it I keep getting the glitch where I cannot see my mouse, and have to restart the game. It is very irritating. I do love the way they made the environment and dinosaurs. It looks awesome!Also make sure to take a look into getting those achievements for the ""right dialogue"" to choose. I prefered just going through it myself and I am currently going back for the achievements.			"

												The characters lip synch doesnt match up with their voices. It's not smooth, just a rushed voice synch job. HOWEVER, I still rate this game 10/10, because the story is really well written (It's fun!) and it really brings the dinosaurs to life. Your choices affect how the game plays out, theres puzzles, action sequences, you have to use your head a lot for the puzzles. It's not an easy game, but parts of it are hard to perfectly complete. The upside is you can go back through cutscenes and attempt to achieve a higher completion score in essence, for the achievements. The game is absolutely solid, I just finished it! Replay value...I wouldn't say it has a TON of replay value, but there is some replay value if you enjoy getting every achievement. You can't beat getting to experience Jurrasic Park and see the dinosaurs up close and personal. The story did not end how I expected either! Characters who I hated, I came to respect and like, and characters who I wanted to like, I ended up hating. It's pretty ingenious! You will not regret buying this game. I have an integrated graphics card/cpu, I don't have an actual separate graphics card. What this means for you is that you should be able to run it on the weakest pc (Mine is windows 8.1 5.8GB Ram and 2.8 ghz dual core cpu) I highly recommend this game right now I'm a little flustered still from the ending. I can't say this enough! Buy this game it's amazing! (Achievements are easy to get and come at you left and right!)			"

												Given that this game is narrative based, I feel that a cinematic style is one of the most important aspects of the game.  However, depending on how the game is played, and how much skill one has in the realm of quick time decision making, the game can get a little jumbled. I will start off by saying that I really do enjoy the game, and it has been a fairly entertaining experience, the parallel story presented in this game along side the events of Jurassic Park (1993) works fairly well. The game has a nice atmosphere and it looks good most of the time. I also find that the characters are pretty likeable, and the dialogue is fairly fluent and natural sounding as well. Though there are some continuity and contradiction issues in regard to the dialogue, nothing too distracting, however.     The game isn't exactly perfect. Instant respawns on death with little to no penalty give minimal consequence to actions, something that another more recent title, Until Dawn, exceeds at, leaving me feeling a little disappointed. Since I pretty much suck at all quick-time-event games, dying really distrupts the flow of the game at certain points as well.  The actual gameplay during action sequences can get a little sketchy too, I found that I died at least ten times in roughly two minutes, this may be attributed to the fact that I am really not that great at qte.       Overall, I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives (some of which are purely situational) in Jurassic Park: The Game, and the gameplay isn't really that bad, I enjoyed some of the light mystery solving, and of course, the dinosaurs. I don't think that this game is worth its full price however, I got it 75% off.  I think anyone who likes a decent story and is a fan of the film will enjoy this title. 7/10			"

												I came to this game (lured by a Steam sale) after years of warnings that it was garbage. A misstep, an unfortunate footnote in Telltale's path to greatness. While undeniably not as polished as, say, The Walking Dead, it is absolutely worth playing if you're a serious fan of either Telltale or the Jurassic Park franchise.THE STORYThe Game takes the ending of the first Jurassic Park movie to some interesting places with the story of those left behind after Hammond & Co. were evacuated. Some of the philosophical questions of genetic engineering that get brushed past in the movie are given a lot more consideration here. The characters are mostly well-drawn and develop in interesting and unexpected ways as the game goes on. There's even a kid in it who isn't completely annoying! More than can be said for most of the movies. The affection and respect the dev team had for the franchise is apparent all the details they get right, from the Isla Nublar-shaped road signs and InGen-logoed steam pipes to the dinosaur sounds and music cues lifted straight from the movie. There are a few ideas in The Game borrowed from other parts of the JP universe, including Michael Crichton's books, which is fun to see. There's even a journal with unlockable content that charmingly retcons some of the paleontological inaccuracies of the first movie.THE GAMEPLAYThere are a lot more quicktime events than in later Telltale games. It arguably suits the action-oriented JP franchise but yes, it can be a little frustrating, especially if you're an achievement completionist trying to perfect every ""scenario"". The action scenes feel genuinely thrilling, though. The puzzle sections aren't as hard as the QTEs and are fairly intuitive to figure out.PRESENTATIONThere are a few quirks that mark this as a learning experience for Telltale. There are some odd volume glitches. The graphics aren't cutting-edge, even for a 2011 point-and-click adventure. The graphics settings menu, bizarrely, requires you to change the screen resolution as you cycle through the options. The most irritating thing may be that when retrying the QTE scenarios to get better medals some of them dump you in way before any action starts. You have to sit through minutes of cutscene before you get to try again. Grrr. None of this is game-breaking, though. The voice acting, crucially, is top-notch, supporting a well-written script. The animation of the dinosaurs and motion-captured humans is pretty good (for a game of its type - we're not talking CryEngine stuff here) and the cinematography is engaging and cinematic, if not quite Spielbergian.In summary, Jurassic Park: The Game is better than you've heard. I can't recommend it to the casual gamer who gets easily frustrated with QTE/narrative-based games but If you've played Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones it's worth going back to see this step in the evolution of Telltale Games. And if you're a big Jurassic Park fan it comes highly recommended, expanding on the lore in much more interesting and mature ways than the Jurassic World movie did. Now THAT was one big pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

This game is rediculously fun the first time around and is always fun to go back and try to get Gold Medals on QTE's. Many people have complained about the QTE's and that they are a stupid fun draining idea but when you are playing you actually feel like you are in the game. As all Telltale games do, this game provides an excellent story. Enjoy. If you survive.			"

												This game takes place during the final events of the first movie and after our original beloved characters escaped the island. If you like some decent fan service you will enjoy this. I have a couple issues with the game however, while it used the controller in such a way that it made the game more immersive it was not as responsive to the controller as it should have been and at times I would have to quickly switch between keyboard and controller.The characters seem to have skin made of adamantium because they can suvive serious wrecks and not have a scratch on them. However they subsequently die over the stupidest things (by their adamantium skin logic) this lack of believeable injury definitly breaks story immersion. The story was enjoyable and afte I give my thumbs a long rest I will likely play it again.30/30 would have 30 casualties again			"

As it is now, it's a game that kinda plays like David Cage's Sadness Trilogy, but with a kinda okay story and a lack of the magic that made Jurassic Park (and Jurassic World, but to a lesser extent) so wonderful.

There's a few minor bugs throughout - very rarely the voice audio would spike in volume for a second, and a couple of times the camera jumped around in an unexpected way - but nothing that prevented me from becoming engrossed in the story and gameplay. I recommend it if you like interactive movies, Telltale Games or you want to be told another story in the Jurassic Park world.			"

I'd prefer it if they'd actually used the original cast as voice actors and retconned some scenarios into a retelling of the film. I might have glossed over the sins of this game if I was riding high on adrenaline after seeing the movie back in 1993. As it stands, this is one of the worst Telltale titles to date.			"

												Ah. Another of the classic Telltale games. Like all the others, Jurassic Park is based in the same universe, or in this case the island, but feature a new set of characters. The story is great, however the unforgiving quick response mechanics might leave many frustrated. This is not the kind of game to sit back and relax with. Overall though, a great game!			"

												The story line was great, the controls were a crime against humanity. This game has so much potential and I was so excited about it. If it enabled you to control yourself instead of spamming buttons in order to move and attack it would be a great game. But not being freely move makes this game a dissapointment. I much prefer operation genesis for a jurassic park game, that's a game people want to see a sequel to. IMO this game needs to take some control pointers from survival horror such as silent hill or resident evil. This game relies on your ability to memorize where keys and buttons are, not so much fun when you don't have a photographic memory of your keyboard or controller.Therefor,sadly I cannot recommend this game. Storyline good for fans of the movies, poor performance as a game.			"

 Frustration Park: The GameBeing a fan of Jurassic Park (the original movie + book), and having played The Walking Dead games, I decided to give this one a go too, despite reading negative reviews here and there.As it turns out, this was a  BIG  mistake on my part.I was hoping to get a good story, some decent action and perhaps some crucial decision making, but what I got was:- Poor cliched story, which doesn't combine well with the movie's plot (since the game is supposed to be set in the same timeline, I think that's relevant). They used plenty of references, but for me it fell flat.- Extremely annoying and unlikeable characters. (the teenager was perhaps the sole exception) If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to finish the game, I'd root for the dinosaurs instead (also Gerry Harding was a character in the movie, but he doesn't resemble the movie character in appearance/age. Same as above.)- Frustrating control system that quickly turns into a quick-time-event-fest; for example a simple task such as walking up a set of stairs or doing some swimming strokes, will require you to tap/smash buttons.Gets  really  tedious very early in the game.- In relation to previous point, the achievements, if one cares about those (I'm no fanatic, but in general it can be motivating), timing a quick time event wrong, will cause you too lose out on quite a few achievements(requirement of ""flawless/without slip ups"" in certain segments of the game.)Thankfully, the game has a checkpoint system of sorts, so you can reload the last checkpoint and try again, but sometimes you will have to replay quite a lot of game time, IF you want the achievement.Personally, after a while I stopped caring and just wanted the  pain  game to end, abandoning potential achievements for what they are, pixels.- Very little decision making of consequence, usually there is only one path to go, and if you do something wrong, you'll mostly end up dead (at the very least lose out on an achievement). If I'm not mistaken, there are rougly  two  choices that has any bearing on the the story, one of them being a potential alternate ending (I prefer the ""bad"" ending. Greed is a b*tch).I could go on, but to sum it up, its safe to say that this is a game with  ZERO  replay value (if you want alternate ending, reload one of the last checkpoints only), mostly due to frustrating controls/mechanics, annoying/boring characters, and the fact that this a VERY linear interactive story, where your only job is to keep the characters alive (even if you'd rather see some/all of them to end up as dino fodder...)Do yourself a favor, save your money and avoid this game, no matter how cheap the prize, its not worth the frustration.Watch ""Jurassic Park"" the movie instead.

												Want to get explore Jurassic Park and get chased by dinosaurs? This is a Telltale adventure that drops you right into the middle of the first Jurassic adventure. The story is told in episodes and the regular detective mystery mechanics. You are graded and awarded a medal for completing every episode depending on how well you followed instructions. The game has the most QTE heavy events I’ve seen in a Telltale game. It feels more like Indigo Prophecy or Heavy Rain. If you want to feel like you are part of the Jurassic Park universe and think you are a clever girl, then check this out.			"

												I Think The Story Line Was Ok And That The Extra Dinosaurs In It Was A Amazing Add To The Game For Instance The Mosasaurus And Troodon But I Think They Could Of Added In Maybe A Item Where U Can Read A Small Fact File About The Dinosaur And What It Has A Part In, In The Jurassic Park Franchise. What I Would Of Loved To See Tho Was A Little Bit More Of The Park That You See In The Movie Like The Velociraptor Enclosure Or The T-Rex Enclosure Or The Gates! Just I Feel Like They Could Of Added More To The Game That Has To Do With The MovieThat Was Just Some Of The Negatives And Things I Loved About The Game, But This Is A Review So Im Gonna Now Say About The Graphics And Preformance Of The Game. So The Game Runs Smoothy For Me I Dont Think I Ever Went Below 60 fps And I Only Have A Basic Gaming PC Wouldnt Recomend If You Only Have A Normal Laptop Or PC Since I Know You Wouldnt Be Able To Run This Smoothly So Yeah. Now The Graphics Are Good Overall But For The Date This Game Came Out The Graphics Are Amazing. There Are A Few Programing Problems Or Movement Problems For Instance Theres A Scene Where A Dilophosaurus Ran Into A Tunnel And It Looked Like It Was Running But Moving At The Same Speed As It Walking So Yeah Bit Of Movement Problems. Now If There Was Major Problems Like A T-rex Falling Out Of The Sky Which There Isnt Or A Mosasaur Showing Up In The Visitors Centre I Would Inclued This In The Reveiw But There Isnt So I Think This Game Has Room For Improvement Or Expantion Packs Like Jurassic Park The Lost World Or Jurassic Park 3 Possibly Jurassic World I Would Buy Them 100% As Of I Think Most Jurassic Park Franchise Lovers Would But There Isnt Any Reason For Me Atleast To Give This A Bad Reveiw So I Would Rate This A 8.5 Out Of 10 So Well Done TellTale			"

												I loved other telltale games from a story point of view, so I decided to give one of their older titles a go.Jurassic Park: The Game starts with interesting characters and a thrilling plot in the first two episodes. They are rather short so it's recommended to play them each in one sitting.Unfortunately from episode three on, the plot starts to collapse and the protagonists start to make very weird nonsensical decisions. What's even worse is that I got some really bad framerate issues in the fourth episode.It's not a terrible game and I do recommend it. It does capture the nostalgia of the first jurassic park movie, but don't expect it to be on par with more recent Telltale titles.			"

												Fair game if a bit short with 4 ""episodes"" to complete in about 7 hours depending on how you play.Mostly the tale of people trapped on the island with hostile living fossils running after them. The story, while not really surprising, is doing the job.The Quick Time Events are difficult at times because you're surprised by what you must do and they are sometimes a exercice of reflexes you repeat until you pass the challenge. You get a handful of simple puzzles to give a change of pace.Many achievements are asking you to pass QTEs flawlessly. So if you are after them, prepare to reload and retry.At the end, it's good entertainment, even if you're not into Jurassic Park stories (I'm not). Only, expect a rather short, railroaded game. ¨Play it to have an interactive story told.			"

												I love dinosaurs. I love Jurassic Park. More specifically, I love the first Jurassic Park movie. This game is like being given the gift of diving into another story that could have been during the timeline of the first movie. Some of the death sequences are a little gratuitous, but I guess if you're going out by means of dinosaur, them's the breaks, eh? If you're a fan of the series, this game makes for a good time. If you're not a fan of the series and find the inaccurate depictions of dinosaurs too much to handle, this might just make your blood boil in a less-than-sexy way. Also, really, playing this on a computer is way less frustrating than attempting in on an iPad. Controls make all the difference.			"

												As much as I adore the Jurassic Park franchise, my view of this game is paticularly negative.The gameplay is rather bland. You're limited to mainly quicktime events and point-and-click adventure/puzzle-solving scenarios. It's essentially like Telltale's The Walking Dead, where you're mainly watching an interactive movie, but unlike Telltale's amazing zombie game, many of your choices do not affect how the story will play out.The story isn't that great either. Being that its gameplay is rather mediocre, one would expect for the story to make up for it, but it doesn't. Despite expanding on Jurassic Park, the game has an average to low quality of story.Overall, Telltale's Jurassic Park feels more like a B-movie than an actual game, with the only difference being that every once in a while you need to complete a quicktime event, otherwise you'll be forced to rewind back a couple of seconds and start over.

												I rather enjoyed this game, but I'm a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise so I am most likely rather biased.The story itself was pretty good, though some of the characters were insanely predictable in regards to their actions. Aside from that, the story moves along rather smoothly and has some rather interesting ways of puzzle solving as may of Telltales' games do. The animation style is lovely, and I'm rather pleased that there are many different animations depending on the way you make your choices and how you end up dying. Also, this game has an excellent soundtrack, though it uses a lot of the original music from the films.I would say that the time you're given to make decisions/press action buttons is a bit too short. It's rather difficult to end up with a gold ranking with a lot of the more action packed bits of the game. I can see from my previous playthrough of The Walking Dead series that Telltale has adjusted and made it a bit easier, but it was still extremely frustrating to die so many times.8/10 from me!Here's to hoping that Telltale will get the rights to make another game once Jurassic World is out!

												This TellTale game brings us to the infamous island full of dinosaurs where a guy with her daughter meet a tragic latina commando trying to get money by stealing some shaving cream from the scientists.

This is back when TellTale tried to make their game system a little harder, so if you expect to clear this game 100% be prepared to repeat scenes of it over and over untill you do it all first time. Overall it's a good game that makes you feel nostalgic for Jurassic Park. Wait, what's the price? Oh. Oh my.

												Take everything that is Jurassic Park out of this train wreck, and what it boils down to is just a terrible game. The quicktime events are buggy and appear faster than is humanly possible to mentally process the first time you see them. The audio mixing is horrible. It dips and spikes randomly, and the music sometimes carries over to totally destroy the feeling of the following scene. The writting is pretty bad and jarring at times which ruins the flow of the story.The story also lacks a great deal of logic and realistic human behavior in the given situation.  Generally, I love Telltale games. If the story is captivating, I don't mind it if there really isn't much to the gameplay. If the gameplay is solid, I can forgive a plot hole here and there. However, if the story is lacking, and the gameplay sucks what's left to like?A plus? At times it's so bad that it's funny. We are enjoying many laughs at the sheer nonsense that is this game.			"

												I recommend this game, but only under three conditions:- You must not hate quick time events.  If you do, this game will make you hateful and miserable.  All of the action is done with said quick time events.  If that bothers you, don't buy this.- You buy it on sale.  I cannot remember what I paid for it when I bought it, but it wasn't over ten bucks.- You don't mind a short game.  The time Steam shows in this game for me is the time it took me to boot up the game and play all the way through it.  Unlike many other Telltale Games, there's really no reason to replay this one, so keep in mind that you can easily beat this in a long afternoon.Now to debunk some of the terrible reviews this game gets:- The writing really isn't that bad.  True, more recent Telltale Games have had better, but the writing is still better than that of many AAA titles.- The voice acting is actually pretty good, in my opinion.  Each character definitely has their own personality and it's is conveyed rather well by each of the voice actors.- The plot is actually pretty good.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say it's better than the plot of at least half the movies they've made.In short, I'm glad I bought this on sale, I'm glad I finally played it, but I'm never going to play it again because it's replay value is precisely zero.

												The story line was great, the controls were a crime against humanity. This game has so much potential and I was so excited about it. If it enabled you to control yourself instead of spamming buttons in order to move and attack it would be a great game. But not being freely move makes this game a dissapointment. I much prefer operation genesis for a jurassic park game, that's a game people want to see a sequel to. IMO this game needs to take some control pointers from survival horror such as silent hill or resident evil. This game relies on your ability to memorize where keys and buttons are, not so much fun when you don't have a photographic memory of your keyboard or controller.Therefor,sadly I cannot recommend this game. Storyline good for fans of the movies, poor performance as a game.			"

												I reviewed this game once when I was younger and... less intelligent. That's a fair way of putting it. I must have gone through this game at least 4 times, and only now do I realize what was wrong with it. This game is divided into 4 chapters, divided amunst at least 3 different writers.The first chapter of the game has the most movie line references out of all 4 of the chapters. But it's harmless and fun. It even gives us an eery set up to the troodons, who are the main threat built up through the first 3 parts of the game.Then we have the second and third chapters written by someone else. I'd say these are the best written sections of the game. The second chapter you'll probably find to be the slowest in terms of pacing. The third chapter, however, is great. And if you get this game, it'll be for this quarter of the game, no doubt.Character development through this point is great. It's probably the only Jurassic Park thing where you'll care about mercenary characters. The plot of the game involves several people getting trapped on the island in tune with the first Jurassic Park, and some iNGen mercs are sent into rescue them. The two we follow on this task, starting with chapter 2, is the wise-cracking Billy Yoder (whose name never gets old to say), and the tatooed muscle, Oscar. The two of them are a great duo, and serve to bring the most fun to the game without making things goofy or tensionless.The other characters are fine too. You have one of the zookeepers, Dr. Harding, who serves as the game's protagonist. And he has to look after his trouble-making teenage daughter throughout the game. This serves as our family tie in for the movie, like all of the other movies. Then you have a latino chick whose name slips my memory. She's suppose to be tied to Denis Nedry's steal the dino embryos plot; and as such flips between being a good guy and bad guy. And then there's Dr. Sorkin, one of the head researchers with an animal rights activist side. This doesn't become too annoying until the last chapter.The last chapter is where everything falls apart. It was written by someone entirely different from the other 3 sections of the game, and I think he was either the worst pick possible, or he really hated his collegues. Characters take jaring and cartoonishly dumb twists. It ruins the troodons that were built up as creepy, venomous, noctornal and unseen foes into the same dumb mob lizards as everything else. I shouldn't have felt more tension in the triceratops scene, yet I did. Character deaths are unsatisfying. Plans make no sense. If you're wondering who gave Jurassic World the idea for a mosasaurus, it's this game. Only the one in the movie got more screen time. AND NONE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THAT MOVIE HAD TO SWIM IN A TANK WITH IT. Yet chapter 4 of this game made it boring. My favorite character died. Then someone else makes a complete 180 that makes no sense, and they just turn into a Saturday morning villain. The side plot about the dino embryos became more plot centric than it should have been. And we retcon the movies in a way that makes me want to do the same thing to the writer.I can't speak for everyone. But I'm willing to bet that most of the negative reviews for this game are largly due to the forth and final chapter of this game. Reguardless of it, I'd still recommend this game for the first 3/4's. 75% may be a C, but I'm willing to say its enough. Wait until this game's for around 50% off or more. If you consider Jurassic Park the greatest movie of all time, this one will give you some joy.			"

												Full price NO hence the thumbs down. On sale, if you like Telltales games and Jurassic Park, then YES, you’ll probably enjoy it! Read on for full review to be prepared for this game’s shortfalls.First the bad points, its SHORT, its only 4 episodes and I complete the story in 8 hours and that was with retrying a few sections over and over again, to try and get a perfect gold award for the quick time events.Which also leads into another bad point, certain quick time events are the standard, press the button the minute it appears on screen, some are, wait until a ring shrinks and goes down and then flashes before pressing the button....now you can imagine and in a game emphasizing speed, quick button pressing, while getting chased by dinos on the screen, instantly just mashes the buttons as they appear only registering that it was a stupid ring version after it its already saying that you missed that quick time event! Another issues, is some you need to pressed one after the other, so for example it might pop up on screen for you to press 'down' and once you press that, it turns instantly into a 'left'. Now 9 times out of 10, this is find you have time to then press the 'left' button but every now and then it only gives you a heartbeat to actually press that second button...so even as your brain is registering 'left' and your finger is pressing 'left' its already said you failed, the only way is to reload and memorising that section and instantly press 'left' after pressing 'down' not even waiting to watch for it to pop up on screen.Thankfully, it auto saves quite regularly but it still brings us to another issue, now I know this game is basically one long cut-scene but with all this reloading to try and get gold awards you can't skip dialogue! So get ready to hear the same thing over and over again.Still if your a fan of the films (which is properly the only reason your looking at this game), then your going to enjoy playing not just another story set in the universe of Jurassic Park but with new characters another perspective from the first film. It gives you references at certain points as to where you are in the timeline of the first film.Sadly this is all happens in the first episode, as your playing, your characters sleep for the night, when they awake, its implied that the film has now ended, leaving just you guys on the island, now I can understand while this was done, to avoid the issue of why didn’t these two groups ever interact in the film but I'm sure I remember a scene in the film, where a certain group spent the night sleeping in a tree!To me, this feels like a missed opportunity, they could of have more references, maybe stuff that happens in the film interferes in this game characters chances for escape, for example turning the power back on for the fences, could of prevented the characters in the game from linking up with the film characters.*Slight spoiler alert!*It also could have made the first episode be stretched out to last 2 or 3 episodes, as sadly the 2nd episode of this is properly the weakest! It introduces more new characters but you’re sat there thinking what are they doing?! Why are they fighting amongst themselves?! And then your like, why aren’t they leaving when they've got the chance?!Thankfully episode 3 and 4 are better, again its them struggling to either be rescued or get off the island, it almost feels like two different stories if it wasn’t for the episode 2 linking episode 1 and 3/4 together.Still I enjoyed and to repeat my opening statement, if you like Telltales games and Jurassic Park then you’ll probably enjoy too but only get if and when it’s on Sale.

												I didn't think it was so bad.The story was enjoyable enough, especially for someone who loved the movies and the book. The story, being one of Telltale's early efforts, was enough to keep me interested. Characters weren't terrible but certainly not memorable like they are in The Walking Dead.The actual playthrough was awful for me though, cutscenes kept starting and stopping, the audio was off a lot of the time, the quicktime events were buggy as hell and sometimes my cursor was missing - all leading to frustration when I was in the middle of trying to avoid getting eaten by dinos. I died more than I should have because of this and it was only because I like seeing things through to the end that I pressed on.It showed promise, I guess for the games that came after it. I am glad I played it as it showed me a lot of how Telltale developed, both from their early gameplay and character development.Honestly, unless you are a really big fan of Telltale or Jurassic Park though, I can't recommend it.

												Want to get explore Jurassic Park and get chased by dinosaurs? This is a Telltale adventure that drops you right into the middle of the first Jurassic adventure. The story is told in episodes and the regular detective mystery mechanics. You are graded and awarded a medal for completing every episode depending on how well you followed instructions. The game has the most QTE heavy events I’ve seen in a Telltale game. It feels more like Indigo Prophecy or Heavy Rain.

												Oh man, I love you Telltale, I really do, but this is a mess.Let's start with the objective faults. There are game problems. These include minor issues, such as choosing the resolution sets the resolution at the same time, so if you're at say 640x480, and you want to get to 1920x1080, your monitor is going to pass through about 15 resolutions before you get there. This is annoying and there is no need for it, and should really be patched out.Space, for some crazy reason, functions like the escape key in most games. The game is poorly optimised so if you happen to press it, expect a good 5 seconds until you're back in the game.Many a time for whatever reason the mouse icon was lost off the screen. Sometimes the only way to fix it was to quit the game entirely.The plot and storyline is, passable, but not as brilliant as say, the remarkable Wolf Among Us or Walking Dead series.But the quick time events. Oh man. The QTEs are where the fault in this game is 100%. Even with all the other problems, they pale into insignificance to the problem of the QTEs.The QTEs have compound buttons on many occasions, such as Left then Down. However, the timing is instant, so if you don't hit it straight away, you fail. The game does not give you enough time to actually see the QTE before failing the QTE, and a single fail means you lose ""Gold"" rating. Further, these all occour in the high action story points of the game.So what should be the action highlights of the game, the fun sequences, just leave you frustrated and angered as you see fail after fail and reload trying for that Gold and perfect QTE sequence. You'll start to repeat the mantra. Right down right right up up down right as you memorise a level's QTEs for the gold. Finish it and then move onto the next level to start again. Left up left down right up right......Poorly executed game with some of the worst QTEs that I've ever seen in gaming. Only for dedicated Jurassic Park fans. Skip this, and go get The Wolf Among Us if you haven't.			"

												Story picks up Jurassic Park first movie somewhere after Nedry gets killed in the car, and Hammond evacutes with the others off the island. No knowabel characters from the movie, but still new ones which you will connect with.Now comes a long section, just jump to the next if u wish the short summary of it...The story of the game is well written, with just the right amount and timing with thrill and excitement. However, I found myself going from thrill to frustration and back again. This kept rolling back and forth like a wheel downhill. The gameplay is mostly point-and-click, which is fine. There are usually 3 types, pulsating clicks, spam clicks and just tap click. They also run a medal system throughout the episodes, and this is where the frustration come in. When clicking you will have short time to think and react, when you fail you will often get killed by a dinosaur. Developers, I adore your commitment to find new and exciting ways to get killed, and for being one of few games where the child character actually can get killed on camera (which many wouldn't dare do), but did you need such a pet on the back and ""good job"" that the click is impossibly fast? And again, it would be okey, but don't dump medal for good player down for your wish to show off good job... Being one that can easilly average a 6-12 hour playtime most days, i find myself feeling i die not because it is skills that fail, but it is meant to fail. Long story short, just show off the good job, but don't punish  us for seeing it. Drop the medal system, or actually make a game requiring skills to earn them. This just require playing the episode over until u know the combos by heart...Bottom line:I find myself playing it through, because the story is great. I also find myself thinking I only ever play it again, when i begin to forget the story... For me, this is a one time per 5 year game, that is how often i think i play this... Please, drop the medals or make a game for skills. This is a movie with ""click to die"" opportunities. It would have been more entertaining as a animation movie than a game...Can't give this more than 5/10, and most of that, is because of storytelling, not as a game...			"

												As to be expected from a Telltale Games product the storyline is passable at the least and damn good at best. Relatively short chapters making the game a quick play (Depending on how often you die) along with moments of great tension and suspense.Pros, good story (Not the best I've seen, but far far from the worst). Pretty good voice cast and moments that actually made me pause out of concern about what's going to happen next and short chapters making it a good sit down game.Cons, game is prone to minor freezes nothing game breaking, but very annoying (Especially after button/key mashing for your life) QTEs are unforgiving most of which must be done is a single second or even 3-5 in the same amount of time making the game frustrating at times and provides no room for error (Literally one slip up and its over), but the more you fail the game slows down its death timer to allow you more chance of success (Only after you die 6 or more times)Final conclusion, worth playing, but I do not see the game being worth its price a $5 game sure, but not at its marked price. This is a 1 time game after beating it I doubt I will ever play it again. If you have a friend who has it play it from their account or something.			"

												Loved the movies (especially 1 and 2), and I love this game. It picks up moments before the ending of the first movie. The game itself is focused on the story and gameplay elemtents mainly consists of puzzels, looking around and picking dialogue options. The story itself seems to be abit more lineair then the more recent telltale titles like The Walking Dead, but it still has various dialogue options. The more frantic moments are accompanied by quick time events. Those QTE's are sometimes a bit too abrupt, and not very clear to me untill after my character got mulched to bits (but rarely). Abit short but all in all a good game. Would be awesome if Telltale would make a similair game around The Lost World. I can recommend this to telltale and jurassic park fans alike.			"

Jurassic Park The Game: 7/10 BUYER BEWARE - This is almost pure QTEJurassic Park The Game Impressions:For a game shamed to be the worst Telltale game, this one is still pretty enjoyable. The story is rather cliche, the characters are mostly stereotypes, but it works for this franchise (but sometimes one has to disband disbelieve too much). Telltales writing has gotten much better since this, but the action scenes (QTE's) are still tense and forgiving enough as to not get frustrating. If you miss the first time, normally you get a second and third chance, before the teeth get you.Some puzzles are not too fun, but still manageable.My biggest gripe was not the fading graphics, which show their age, but rather the music, which mostly just doodled in the background, only seldom to use the bombastic Williams music.For one of the early big license games by Telltale, this is a perfectly competent and fun QTE game that is worth getting on massive discount during Summer or Winter Steam Sales.If you are a Jurassic Park movie nut, then be also warned, there are some freedoms taken with the canon, but nothing really bad.

												Beat the game, had fun, hate the puzzles, but love the story.I'm pretty new to Telltale's story based games and due to the Summer sales (And my love for dinos and Jurassic Park) I decided to check it out.It's fun seeing the story unfold, almost relaxing even before it's time to get into the Quick-Time-Events. The story isn't bad if you have an open mind, but a hardcore Jurassic Park fan will likely dislike it. (Mind you this is more of a sidequel after all)As for gameplay and controls, I really like the system. It's more of a ""Point-n-click"" kind of style and although I had more fun using the Xbox Contorller, it is keyboard and mouse friendly so you don't need to worry if you perfer the gamepad or keyboard and mouse, you'll still have a good time.The only thing that was a turn off is some of the puzzles. The most annoying ones tend to get me out of the story. I'm not going to be a spoiler, but during the beginning (or middle?) of the last episode really bug the heck out of me. I had more fun doing ""TIMED"" Quick-Time-Events then puzzles that I had to force to remember doing it if that made any sense.All in all I really like this game, and if Telltale made a Jurassic World game, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.

												interesting view what happened when the movie ends. this should have been the second movie. at least the concept was way more interesting than ""the lost world"". the book is also much better. at least in this game they explain about other survivors and what really happened to the shaving can that was lost. a very QTE heavy game that mostly leads to some frustrating moments due lack of time to recognize the key you have to press because it requires you to press 3 different buttons in a row. the checkpoints are OK placed but if you fail one and die, you have to replay the enire checkpoint again and the worst part of it is; that you cant skip any of the cutscenes. none of the scenes are skipable which makes replay rather obnoxious. failing certain QTEs are ok since they have no impact to the situation. unless if you are an achievement hunter. fail 1 you get a silver ranking. fail 2 and you get a bronze ranking. fail more and its still a bronze rank. the voice acting is rather mixed. some sound ok wile others are rather poor. but the characters at least are interesting enough that you will not forget them that quickly. the puzzles are very decent with the limited spectrum available and we do see more dinos which we never saw in the first movie. and of course the trex has its glorious moments that can get pretty tense. the game also offers you some choices that have some effect like what you say and what you do. i want to like this game but if i cant skip cutscenes and doesnt really give you enouh time to recognize the buttons you have to press in a very tense moment, i see no reason to play it again. even when you want to see and/or find out what outcome your actions will have. worth at least one playthrough but not at full price. get it on 75% off as i did. at least there you dont feel like you have made a loss.

												The story was ok but the graphics suck and the gameplay is nothing but QTE's. The worst thing about the QTE's are the fact they are the worse QTE's i have ever had to deal with. Sometimes they are really slow, others are about right, some are so fast that you don't even see what they were before they are gone. They also don't stay in one place so you can easily miss one looking in the wrong area. Then to top if off the controlls sucked on the controller and while the mouse and keyboard was an improvement i had issues where the mouse pointer dissapearing at times i really needed it. I also want to point out if you want a gold rating you will be reloading a lot and the load screen takes forever to work because of their menu screen animations.       I heard a lot of people liked telltale games so i bought it but I can't enjoy this game. It's sad because I loved the show.			"

												This is one of the early tell tale games featuring  the incrdible tell tale story telling. This game, started of terrible. With game resolutions that changed imidatly after scrolling through them. 1900x1080 was one of the last, and yes it took some time to get there.Following up are all the early design game flaws, such as :-no moving individually, but clicking on different monitors to get to the places-terrible audio that stutters at some point, and in the german version the audio quality changes from okay to terrible in no time-hard to get quicktime events ( running trough to fast, not a chance to get them.)-When timing buttonmash events to late, you will have to redo the same ♥♥♥♥ing scene again, from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beginningIf tell tale decides to remake this one, I would gladly be the first one to play it, but at this state charging 28€ for this, I consider to be a ♥♥♥♥ up. I love your games! I played both Walking dead games, the Wolf among us, GOT and Borderlands, but this is just not my game ..IN ADDITION: If you don't like beeing rated with medals, this game is terrible for you. Why would I want to see my medal rank sink more and more just because I am a baddie at QTE's - this hurts my self esteem :(-Lev			"

												The characters lip synch doesnt match up with their voices. It's not smooth, just a rushed voice synch job. HOWEVER, I still rate this game 10/10, because the story is really well written (It's fun!) and it really brings the dinosaurs to life. Your choices affect how the game plays out, theres puzzles, action sequences, you have to use your head a lot for the puzzles. It's not an easy game, but parts of it are hard to perfectly complete. The upside is you can go back through cutscenes and attempt to achieve a higher completion score in essence, for the achievements. The game is absolutely solid, I just finished it! Replay value...I wouldn't say it has a TON of replay value, but there is some replay value if you enjoy getting every achievement. You can't beat getting to experience Jurrasic Park and see the dinosaurs up close and personal. The story did not end how I expected either! Characters who I hated, I came to respect and like, and characters who I wanted to like, I ended up hating. It's pretty ingenious! You will not regret buying this game. I have an integrated graphics card/cpu, I don't have an actual separate graphics card. What this means for you is that you should be able to run it on the weakest pc (Mine is windows 8.1 5.8GB Ram and 2.8 ghz dual core cpu) I highly recommend this game right now I'm a little flustered still from the ending. I can't say this enough! Buy this game it's amazing! (Achievements are easy to get and come at you left and right!)			"

												This TellTale game brings us to the infamous island full of dinosaurs where a guy with her daughter meet a tragic latina commando trying to get money by stealing some shaving cream from the scientists. After everything goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥you meet some mercs who try to rescue survivors and fail miserably over time. You run away from super intelligent raptors, you pray for the T-Rex not noticing you and QUICKTIME EVENTS FOR EVERYONE. This is back when TellTale tried to make their game system a little harder, so if you expect to clear this game 100% be prepared to repeat scenes of it over and over untill you do it all first time. Overall it's a good game that makes you feel nostalgic for Jurassic Park. Wait, what's the price? Oh. Oh my. Yeah maybe a little expensive for 2016, but if you get it on sale or in a Humble Bundle as I did, It's a pretty good deal.			"

												The story line was great, the controls were a crime against humanity. This game has so much potential and I was so excited about it. If it enabled you to control yourself instead of spamming buttons in order to move and attack it would be a great game. But not being freely move makes this game a dissapointment. I much prefer operation genesis for a jurassic park game, that's a game people want to see a sequel to. IMO this game needs to take some control pointers from survival horror such as silent hill or resident evil. This game relies on your ability to memorize where keys and buttons are, not so much fun when you don't have a photographic memory of your keyboard or controller.Therefor,sadly I cannot recommend this game. Storyline good for fans of the movies, poor performance as a game.			"

												I recommend this game, but only under three conditions:- You must not hate quick time events.  If you do, this game will make you hateful and miserable.  All of the action is done with said quick time events.  If that bothers you, don't buy this.- You buy it on sale.  I cannot remember what I paid for it when I bought it, but it wasn't over ten bucks.- You don't mind a short game.  The time Steam shows in this game for me is the time it took me to boot up the game and play all the way through it.  Unlike many other Telltale Games, there's really no reason to replay this one, so keep in mind that you can easily beat this in a long afternoon.Now to debunk some of the terrible reviews this game gets:- The writing really isn't that bad.  True, more recent Telltale Games have had better, but the writing is still better than that of many AAA titles.- The voice acting is actually pretty good, in my opinion.  Each character definitely has their own personality and it's is conveyed rather well by each of the voice actors.- The plot is actually pretty good.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say it's better than the plot of at least half the movies they've made.In short, I'm glad I bought this on sale, I'm glad I finally played it, but I'm never going to play it again because it's replay value is precisely zero.

 Frustration Park: The GameBeing a fan of Jurassic Park (the original movie + book), and having played The Walking Dead games, I decided to give this one a go too, despite reading negative reviews here and there.As it turns out, this was a  BIG  mistake on my part.I was hoping to get a good story, some decent action and perhaps some crucial decision making, but what I got was:- Poor cliched story, which doesn't combine well with the movie's plot (since the game is supposed to be set in the same timeline, I think that's relevant). They used plenty of references, but for me it fell flat.- Extremely annoying and unlikeable characters. (the teenager was perhaps the sole exception) If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to finish the game, I'd root for the dinosaurs instead (also Gerry Harding was a character in the movie, but he doesn't resemble the movie character in appearance/age. Same as above.)- Frustrating control system that quickly turns into a quick-time-event-fest; for example a simple task such as walking up a set of stairs or doing some swimming strokes, will require you to tap/smash buttons.Gets  really  tedious very early in the game.- In relation to previous point, the achievements, if one cares about those (I'm no fanatic, but in general it can be motivating), timing a quick time event wrong, will cause you too lose out on quite a few achievements(requirement of ""flawless/without slip ups"" in certain segments of the game.)Thankfully, the game has a checkpoint system of sorts, so you can reload the last checkpoint and try again, but sometimes you will have to replay quite a lot of game time, IF you want the achievement.Personally, after a while I stopped caring and just wanted the  pain  game to end, abandoning potential achievements for what they are, pixels.- Very little decision making of consequence, usually there is only one path to go, and if you do something wrong, you'll mostly end up dead (at the very least lose out on an achievement). If I'm not mistaken, there are rougly  two  choices that has any bearing on the the story, one of them being a potential alternate ending (I prefer the ""bad"" ending. Greed is a b*tch).I could go on, but to sum it up, its safe to say that this is a game with  ZERO  replay value (if you want alternate ending, reload one of the last checkpoints only), mostly due to frustrating controls/mechanics, annoying/boring characters, and the fact that this a VERY linear interactive story, where your only job is to keep the characters alive (even if you'd rather see some/all of them to end up as dino fodder...)Do yourself a favor, save your money and avoid this game, no matter how cheap the prize, its not worth the frustration.Watch ""Jurassic Park"" the movie instead.

												Take everything that is Jurassic Park out of this train wreck, and what it boils down to is just a terrible game. The quicktime events are buggy and appear faster than is humanly possible to mentally process the first time you see them. The audio mixing is horrible. It dips and spikes randomly, and the music sometimes carries over to totally destroy the feeling of the following scene. The writting is pretty bad and jarring at times which ruins the flow of the story.The story also lacks a great deal of logic and realistic human behavior in the given situation.  Generally, I love Telltale games. If the story is captivating, I don't mind it if there really isn't much to the gameplay. If the gameplay is solid, I can forgive a plot hole here and there. However, if the story is lacking, and the gameplay sucks what's left to like?A plus? At times it's so bad that it's funny. We are enjoying many laughs at the sheer nonsense that is this game.			"

												This is actually the first Telltale game I ever play so I guess my opinion is unbiased at this point. The story could be better but it's enough to keep you hooked, the characters are a bit on the generic side and the ones that seem the most interesting don't get enough spotlight.One thing that I truly disliked is how they act under some stressful situations, one moment they're being chased by prehistoric predators and the next they're arguing about tattoos or some other teenage drama, sometimes before they even reach a safe place to hide.The one thing I disliked the most is that whatever your decisions, the outcome is always the same. I was hoping to get different events if I failed an action scene and ended up with a wounded or dead character, instead you just repeat the event until you get it right.It's an ok game, the biggest drawback is that the franchise offers much more and this game fails to deliver it.

												By many measures, an enjoyable game experience that rises above its faults and limitations.  Jurassic Park: The Game by Telltale Games lacks many of the qualities that have made their more recent games so successful, but when viewed by itself; stands as a solid dinosaur-themed adventure. Expect something akin to a visual novel with button rhythm elements and plenty of tension.  You could likely play through the story in approximately 6 hours, but you'll get a lot more out of your purchase if you're an achievement junky.  There are some bugs that aren't going to go away and some of them inadvertently make achievement hunting more frustrating than it should be, but it's far from game-breaking.  The going rate of $19.99 is probably asking too much at this point, but for $8.00 or so this is a worthwhile pick-up for anyone who likes to be chased by dinos and/or prefers their games heavy on story-telling.

What I Would Of Loved To See Tho Was A Little Bit More Of The Park That You See In The Movie Like The Velociraptor Enclosure Or The T-Rex Enclosure Or The Gates! Just I Feel Like They Could Of Added More To The Game That Has To Do With The MovieThat Was Just Some Of The Negatives And Things I Loved About The Game, But This Is A Review So Im Gonna Now Say About The Graphics And Preformance Of The Game. So The Game Runs Smoothy For Me I Dont Think I Ever Went Below 60 fps And I Only Have A Basic Gaming PC Wouldnt Recomend If You Only Have A Normal Laptop Or PC Since I Know You Wouldnt Be Able To Run This Smoothly So Yeah. Now The Graphics Are Good Overall But For The Date This Game Came Out The Graphics Are Amazing. There Are A Few Programing Problems Or Movement Problems For Instance Theres A Scene Where A Dilophosaurus Ran Into A Tunnel And It Looked Like It Was Running But Moving At The Same Speed As It Walking So Yeah Bit Of Movement Problems. Now If There Was Major Problems Like A T-rex Falling Out Of The Sky Which There Isnt Or A Mosasaur Showing Up In The Visitors Centre I Would Inclued This In The Reveiw But There Isnt So I Think This Game Has Room For Improvement Or Expantion Packs Like Jurassic Park The Lost World Or Jurassic Park 3 Possibly Jurassic World I Would Buy Them 100% As Of I Think Most Jurassic Park Franchise Lovers Would But There Isnt Any Reason For Me Atleast To Give This A Bad Reveiw So I Would Rate This A 8.5 Out Of 10 So Well Done TellTale			"

												I loved other telltale games from a story point of view, so I decided to give one of their older titles a go.Jurassic Park: The Game starts with interesting characters and a thrilling plot in the first two episodes. They are rather short so it's recommended to play them each in one sitting.Unfortunately from episode three on, the plot starts to collapse and the protagonists start to make very weird nonsensical decisions. What's even worse is that I got some really bad framerate issues in the fourth episode.It's not a terrible game and I do recommend it. It does capture the nostalgia of the first jurassic park movie, but don't expect it to be on par with more recent Telltale titles.			"

												I love dinosaurs. I love Jurassic Park. More specifically, I love the first Jurassic Park movie. This game is like being given the gift of diving into another story that could have been during the timeline of the first movie. Some of the death sequences are a little gratuitous, but I guess if you're going out by means of dinosaur, them's the breaks, eh? If you're a fan of the series, this game makes for a good time. If you're not a fan of the series and find the inaccurate depictions of dinosaurs too much to handle, this might just make your blood boil in a less-than-sexy way. Also, really, playing this on a computer is way less frustrating than attempting in on an iPad. Controls make all the difference.			"

												Fair game if a bit short with 4 ""episodes"" to complete in about 7 hours depending on how you play.Mostly the tale of people trapped on the island with hostile living fossils running after them. The story, while not really surprising, is doing the job.The Quick Time Events are difficult at times because you're surprised by what you must do and they are sometimes a exercice of reflexes you repeat until you pass the challenge. You get a handful of simple puzzles to give a change of pace.Many achievements are asking you to pass QTEs flawlessly. So if you are after them, prepare to reload and retry.At the end, it's good entertainment, even if you're not into Jurassic Park stories (I'm not). Only, expect a rather short, railroaded game. ¨Play it to have an interactive story told.			"

												I'm giving this a positive review, but really only because it's a good story, with interesting (if somewhat stereotypical) characters with reasonable voice actors. If you grew with the original Jurassic Park as I did, this game certainly brings back the nostalgia as the game is set during the events of the first film, albeit in it's own independant story arc with standalone characters. The most important character is in no uncertain terms, the can of Barbasol shaving cream!BUT. The game is a simple QTE driven interactive story, so if that's not your thing then maybe it's not for you. It doesn't have anywhere near the level of character control or decision making that for instance, The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us has and there's no direct affect your actions have on the story such as in Until Dawn except your death, which is followed by a simply retry. Unless you're a 100% achievement perfectionist there's little replay value.I would recommend it ONLY for those who don't mind these game mechanics, story driven narrative games, nostalgia junkies, or simply to those interested in a much better dinosaur romp set in the JP Universe than JP2 or 3.Pick it up on sale if you think it's something you will enjoy, but it's certainly not for everyone.

												This game is not only a mockery of Jurassic Park, but quick time events in general. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that this is a Telltale game...The game butchers the movie timelines until they are unrecognizable. The tie-ins are way too forced. Especially when generic characters are directly quoting other characters from the movie totally out of the original context. ""DODGSON, WE GOT DODGSON HERE."" The villain characters so far have been beyond unlikeable... but its not even a realistic kind of unlikeable. Snivelling, stubborn, and largely useless. I hate going through all 4 dialogue options because the jerk I'm yelling at refuses to listen to the first 3 choices. This game feels like it essentially plays itself if not for constant unnecessary QTE's. I've never played such a linear action/adventure game.Sometimes you are required to do a button mashing QTE to lean in closer to a footprint. Or to look at a tree, or to look at anything. I used to complain when playing Heavy Rain that it was too hard to do basic actions like drink a bottle of orange juice, but this game takes the cake and then bakes another cake so it can take that one too.

Most dialog options are pretty pointless. Even so, it's pretty enjoyable from a fan stand point. The places, the story, the characters mentioned, all of this stuff are delightful for fans of the franchise. If you are a teltale fan though , be aware, it's far from their latest masterpieces.  "

												You play as a dino vet, his daughter, some Cuban chick, a scientist, a badass soldier, and his ♥♥♥♥boy partner. Very fun game, I kinda wish telltale stuck closer to this game when it comes to action sequences. It's closer to Heavy Rain. All around, it's fun if you like Jurassic Park, and Telltale/Quantic Dream (creators of Heavy Rain) style games.			"

												Jurassic park: The game is one of the earlier releases by 'Telltale' games. This game follows the events of the original 'Jurassic Park' film where you play as a group of survivors attempting to evacuate the island.Telltale does a great job telling a story, the quick-time events are very interest and the most enjoyable part of the game was dying horrifically in a variety of ways. Here are the pros and cons;Pros- Good story telling- Interesting characters- Quick-time events are fun at times- Fantastic moments backed by the classic theme music of Jurassic park. This game has great heroic and sad scenes which make it above the mediocre experience of story-telling. Telltale at moments manage to capture the magic of the original film.Cons- The story for this overall felt to short for a telltale game.- Quicktime events were incredibly difficult and frustrating, the keyboard inputs for PC were incredibly difficult because of the confusing icon. While quick-time events happen, you barely see the events taking place as a massive flashing input key is splashed largely infront of the scene.-While quicktime events are fun, the constant button mashing was tedious after the first hour or so. - Despite having a good story, there was a variety of plotholes and moments (Despite developed characters) that ruined the experience. - Graphics felt out of date. - Jurassic park: The game does not allow players multiple choices that impact the story-telling like 'Walking dead or Wolf amongst us'. This is a con because while you can tackle obstacles in a manner of ways, I felt you had no control of the overall plot which felt linear.Overall while I can recommend this game to dinosaur and Jurassic park fans. I can not recommend the game while it is still at the 20+ they charge for it. But, if the game is on discount it is certainly great for burning 4-8 hours on (depending on your capability to button mash). This game goes as a narrow recommended because of the above average story telling and at times capturing the 'magic' of Jurassic park.7/10			"

												As a huge fan of Jurassic Park, I was utterly disappointed in this game, although not at first. At first it was nice just to see Isla Nublar again. But JW delivers that in a much better way than this game does.The gameplay is entirely QTE-based, and 100% completion requires reflexes that I'm pretty sure aren't humanly possible. There's a lot of unforgiving trial and error moments where the game won't reveal what button you're supposed to press until the nanosecond you're supposed to press it. The keyboard/mouse controls are super clunky. The story is lackluster and reads like a poorly written fanfic, with people outrunning raptors and rexes in footraces across open ground for no reason. Repeatedly. One of the main characters is supposedly a character who made a brief appearance in the first movie, Dr. Harding. However, the game strips him of his hat, sunglasses, and moustache for no apparent reason even though his first appearance in the game is implied to be before his movie appearance.Some plot points don't make sense and the characters do more stupid things than the entire cast of Jurassic Park III. The death of the final human antagonist in particular is disappointing because it's due to that character's own stupidity rather than any cleverness on the part of the player.Admittedly, there is the occasional nugget here and there that shows the people who made this game are huge fans of the JP films, which only serves to make the game's overall execution all the more baffling.Bottom line: if you ever played Jedi Academy and want to see Rosh Penin get eaten by a T-Rex, then this might be the game for you. Otherwise just play Dino D-Day or ARK or something.			"

												This was the first attemp with this engine and that is pretty clear. It is a good game and there are far more failure states then the walking dead or fables games. The controls seem like they were made more for console then PC this is also apparent in the settings you have to change the Res one click at a time I wanted to use my xbox controler. I found that after you start the game with mouse and keyboard, that option is kinda closed, and I am not sure how to change it. it is a little more clunky then the walking dead games and the timing can be tricky but this is not where this game shines. Tell tale is very good at their name. Jurassic park is my favorite movie I have seen it about 100 times I am 25 and I still watch the movies from time to time I have also read the books. This game takes a story I always wondered when I was a kid. and that is, with a park that size there had to be more people on the island then what was in the movie. So what happened to them and how did they get off the island? This game so far is telling that story. It's a story I have wondered for a very long time.  If you want a game just like the walking dead games this is not it, But if you are a jurassic park fan this is a must. It isn't really a game so much as a interactive movie.			"

												The game was pretty much what I was expecting - a mostly QTE-based interactive movie with a few puzzles and an interesting and entertaining story. There's a few minor bugs throughout - very rarely the voice audio would spike in volume for a second, and a couple of times the camera jumped around in an unexpected way - but nothing that prevented me from becoming engrossed in the story and gameplay. I recommend it if you like interactive movies, Telltale Games or you want to be told another story in the Jurassic Park world.			"

												This is actually the first Telltale game I ever play so I guess my opinion is unbiased at this point. The story could be better but it's enough to keep you hooked, the characters are a bit on the generic side and the ones that seem the most interesting don't get enough spotlight.One thing that I truly disliked is how they act under some stressful situations, one moment they're being chased by prehistoric predators and the next they're arguing about tattoos or some other teenage drama, sometimes before they even reach a safe place to hide.The one thing I disliked the most is that whatever your decisions, the outcome is always the same. I was hoping to get different events if I failed an action scene and ended up with a wounded or dead character, instead you just repeat the event until you get it right.It's an ok game, the biggest drawback is that the franchise offers much more and this game fails to deliver it.

The visuals are straight up pathetic and the sound is a bit glitchy. The Quick time events in this game is the worst ive ever seen, you have half a second or you die.

												I love most everything by Telltale Games, and Jurassic Park seems like a perfect playground. Unfortunately, everything reminds me a bit too much of watching the movie, with added button mashing and bad writing. I'd prefer it if they'd actually used the original cast as voice actors and retconned some scenarios into a retelling of the film. I might have glossed over the sins of this game if I was riding high on adrenaline after seeing the movie back in 1993. As it stands, this is one of the worst Telltale titles to date.			"

												Let me put it this way...The Lego Jurassic World game version is much, much better than this corny piece of crap. As a hardcore fan of the novels and movies, I feel Telltale have horribly ruined the concept of Jurassic Park. I cringed the entire way through this very long cartoon. So disappointed in this game.--> The graphics is like I said, a cartoon.--> The animation is really bad. I mean REALLY bad. It's still VERY glitchy.--> The dinosaurs are portrayed as unrealistically stupid and slow. This goes especially for the raptors and T-rex.--> The writing behind this game is a joke.--> Quick Time Events are the devil. This type of gameplay forces you to become disengaged from the story since you are constantly on edge in case you miss a button press. (If they show, still buggy)The game is basically a cartoon to watch. There's no control. It's entirely QTE. You might as well watch this on YouTube.To save youself some money, watch the game here. It's pretty much the same thing:

												Pretty OK game. Still my opinion is that some TellTale games are SO much better than this one.But, If you are intrested of an optional story what happened to the shaving cream container which had the embryos in it from the first film, then I can recommend this game. Sadly there are fiew things which got me totally frustated conserning the story. For one exampel: you can't scary of raptors, NO! That is so unlikely! Technically it was also sometimes very frustating to do the ""click thousand buttons at the same time and also run""-tasks. Especially when the game intrepreters your pushing diffrently than in reality, as it feels so.If there would have been more pussels and dialogs which would have had more inpact in the story, it could have gave more value to the game. Now it is like very simpel ""format"" and the story is a bit ""clichéish"".			"

												Pretty entertaining game. Finished in about 6.5 hours. I've been a fan of Jurassic Park since the first movies and this brought back some good memories. Story was pretty good. Optional dialogue to get to know the characters was a nice touch. Graphics is not amazing but serviceable. I would probably rank this average on my games list, but it does have great entertainment value. The major drawback as other people have stated are the controls being frustrating at times; sometimes it's too easy to click early and sometimes the clicks aren't shown very clearly are easy to mess up. However, only once did I have to go over 5 tries. I think 3 tries is typical. And since it does checkpoint style saves during many of the click squences, you can mess up and still continue. Honestly if you like dinasaurs and if you are okay at DDR type games, this would be a pretty enjoyable experience.			"

												I like Telltale games, and I can see people liking this one, but it just isn't doing it for me. The conversation options often don't have any difference in their meaning, so there doesn't seem to be any difference in the outcomes they generate. I guess you could call the move sequences ""unique,"" but they're more along the line of ""annoying as hell."" The concept of the story occurring during the original movie, but with unseen characters, is enough to get you to play through the first chapter, but not enough to get you to see it through to the end.

												Pretty OK game. Still my opinion is that some TellTale games are SO much better than this one.But, If you are intrested of an optional story what happened to the shaving cream container which had the embryos in it from the first film, then I can recommend this game. Sadly there are fiew things which got me totally frustated conserning the story. For one exampel: you can't scary of raptors, NO! That is so unlikely! Technically it was also sometimes very frustating to do the ""click thousand buttons at the same time and also run""-tasks. Especially when the game intrepreters your pushing diffrently than in reality, as it feels so.If there would have been more pussels and dialogs which would have had more inpact in the story, it could have gave more value to the game. Now it is like very simpel ""format"" and the story is a bit ""clichéish"".			"

												Pretty entertaining game. Finished in about 6.5 hours. I've been a fan of Jurassic Park since the first movies and this brought back some good memories. Story was pretty good. Optional dialogue to get to know the characters was a nice touch. Graphics is not amazing but serviceable. I would probably rank this average on my games list, but it does have great entertainment value. The major drawback as other people have stated are the controls being frustrating at times; sometimes it's too easy to click early and sometimes the clicks aren't shown very clearly are easy to mess up. However, only once did I have to go over 5 tries. I think 3 tries is typical. And since it does checkpoint style saves during many of the click squences, you can mess up and still continue. Honestly if you like dinasaurs and if you are okay at DDR type games, this would be a pretty enjoyable experience.			"

												(2013 Review)Great plot, fare graphics, and loaded with fun. Also stays true to the movie. I highly recommend this for fans of the movie and thrill-seekers.(2017 Edit)After years of not playing this game and thinking it over, this game is more sub-par to the film franchise and a game by itself. Telltale barely knew what they were doing with the story while they developed this game. The visuals are from 2006, some dialogue and reactions is cheesy, and the dinosaurs are the only things trying to save this game from being bad.This may be worth looking into if you're into the JP franchise, If you're just a normie gamer, stay VERY clear of this game.

												Nice side story of the original Jurassic Park movie with the well known telltale adventure mechanics. Short but fun.			"
