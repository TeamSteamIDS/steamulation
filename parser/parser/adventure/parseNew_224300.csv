												Legacy of Kain: Defiance is the fifth game in a series of highly story-focused games that technically fall under the category of action.In Defiance, control alternates between the series' two protagonists, Kain and Raziel in the world of Nosgoth.The story to Defiance is extremely well done. It picks up shortly after the events of LoK: Soul Reaver 2. Raziel has managed to pospone his fate, and Kain still lurks around in the shadows, trying to discover ways to restore balance to the world of Nosgoth. In a departure for the series, the game takes a more action-based approach to combat and gameplay. You no longer have to toss enemies into lakes or fire to kill them (though that’s still an option in many places), but instead what you get is more enemy variety and much tougher battles. Kain and Raziel’s skills are largely interchangeable, with both playing the same. Except Kain is stronger and Raziel is faster. Both, once fully experienced, can pull off insane combos.As the other games of the series, Defiance has puzzles as well, some more grueling than others. But all rather cleverly designed. The Legacy of Kain series has some of the highest quality voice acting around. The entire cast brings all of the characters to life, from the protagonists to the ever-embittered Vorador, melencholy Janos, devious Moebius, even the vampire hunters and undead. The graphics in this game are the best in the series so far. The characters are all well designed and the use of Gothic backgrounds suits the game well. Legacy of Kain: Defiance delivers what it promised, the continuation of the series that answers more questions then it proposes, a refined combat system and replay value. This game will be sure to twist and make that brain think through it's depth-full storyline.Sounds 10/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Suffice to say, I don't think I've ever laughed, clapped, and cried at any resolution in a game before in one single sitting.Defiance is the exception.Return to Nosgoth as the legendary vampire Kain and the fallen wraith Raziel as they struggle to defy the machinations of fate itself.Pros:-Resolution to one of the most shakespearean tales told in gaming.-Alternate between Kain and Raziel throughout missions, each armed with different tools to progress in one area where another may not.-Combat provides engaging mechanics to keep one interested-Puzzles, albeit somewhat less intensive than that of the Soul Reaver series.-Good gamepad adaptation compared to previous installments.-Vae Victis!Cons:-Camera angle is more remniscent of Devil May Cry games and not that of the previous installments, leading to some frustration especially if one is using a keyboard.-Combat encounters can be rather repetitive at times, despite the intriguing mechanics provided.-Graphical glitches can be somewhat apparent on more recent Nvidia cards, such as Raziel's wing membranes and Kain's cape physics breaking at certain points in the game.-If running multiple cores, one may need to manually lower the priority to 1, as some cutscenes have the capacity to freeze and have the script misfire to play them.Do I recommend this? Hell. Yes. I recommend the entire series if you haven't played it yet.			"

												Short and simple review.Great game. Truly a masterpiece. Must-have classic. Story-driven and atmospheric.P.S: For those who are having issues/crashes, here's a fix:1)Run the game.2)Open Task Manager.For Windows 7 or older:3)Go to the Processes tab. (Second tab from left to right)4)Find and right click the defiance.exe process.For Windows 8/10:3)Go to the Details tab. (Second tab from right to left)4)Find and right click the defiance.exe process.5)From the menu, click Set Affinity.6)A window will pop up, showing a list. In the list you'll have the following: <All Processors>, CPU 0, CPU 1, CPU 2, etc. (depending on the amount of cores your CPU has, you'll see that many in the list. Note that the first core is counted as CPU 0, so if you see, for example, from CPU 0 to CPU 7, those are your 8 cores.)7)From this list, uncheck everything but CPU 0. This will set the process to use only 1 core from your CPU.8)Now you can tab back into the game and play. Enjoy!NOTE: You will have to repeat this every time you relaunch the game, as it's not a permanent change. This should however fix crashes/graphical issues/cutscene stuttering. I did notice a micro-stutter after the intro going into the first cinematic, but aside from that every other cinematic will run fine.Another fix you can apply to the game (fixes some graphical issues for Windows 10):1)Go to the game's installation folder. (Should be in your Steam\steamapps\common\legacy_kain_defiance, or in whichever folder you installed the game in)2)Right click the defiance.exe.3)Go to Properties, then to the Compatibility tab.4)Check the ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" box, and then select Windows XP Service Pack 2.NOTE: This is a permanent change, as in no need to redo it, unlike the previous fix.

												Sadly the last game in the series. Once again I recommend getting Xpadder so you can properly bind a modern gamepad to play this. The game itself is a step down exploration wise from Blood Omen, Soul Reaver, and Soul Reaver 2, and has a lot more in common with Blood Omen 2's linear traversal (removing any sort of exploration beyond secrets). Story wise it's just as good as Soul Reaver 2 and the first Blood Omen. Sadly this is the last game in the series, as Eidos never got around to making another one. Its lead writer went to NaughtyDogg to make Uncharted and The Last of Us, and most of the creative team disappeare.d Few failed attempts at making sequels later we are left with nothin but a multiplayer game lacking any sort of story. This is a sad end for one of my favorite game series. And I still suggest anyone check them out. If you're not interested in playing a series that hasn't had an update in 12 years, at least check out the story here:

												This game has gotten a lot of negative press over its life; because of that I'll start with the bad things.  The camera will be the bane of your life.  Anyone who has played the past installments to this fantastic series will know that the camera worked fine, no need to change it.  However, some bright spark decided otherwise.  Also, having played this game on console in the past, I found the keyboard controls quite frustrating.However, bad stuff aside, I would still recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of the FANTASTIC story to this game series.  Once again the writers have excelled themselves, and managed to tie up many of the loose ends.Vampires/10			"

												Here we are. The last part of the Legacy Of Kain Series. The almost perfect conclusion! It's a shame they stopped developping it.The storyline is perfect and game mechanics have improved even further! The puzzle part is a tiny bit easier than the previous games but it's still hard enough to keep you immersed. Giving us the ability to play and see the story through both characters with their own strenghts and powers is exhilarating. Just see how badass Kain looks in that one! I loved this game as a teenager and now I can remember why heh!Go for it. These vampires don't sparkle in the sunlight. Vae Victis!			"

Playing on a keyboard is less fun than playing on a gamepad.Still, the story is amazing.			"

												Legacy of Kain: Defiance. to summarize it all in one word? epic.This is considered the ""final"" chapter of the series and they went out with a bang regardless whether or not answers remained unanswered.   You both control Kain AND Raziel (when their story parts come around). Both characters (obviously) controls differently. The game has so much lore content and past references to previous games. The places aren't as re-memorable since most of these places take place in a ""very"" dying Nosgoth. And it's either forest areas, ruins, etc.The controls are much bettter than the past two games. However, i still recommend getting a controller and using a Xpadder or whatever program suits you best. The only tiny frustration with this game is it's controlled camera. You can obviously spot this when playing as Kain. Everything however is pretty straight forward.I highly recommend playing the past games to fully understand what is going on in Defiance. Yes, you can say the game kinda gives you an idea of the Who's, what's, when's, where's and why's but if you want to fully understand their position in this game in particular play the previous games.

												This is a longlonglong time fav game of mine, and I was honestly afraid to grab it because it might have been outdated. Thankfully, I was absolutely wrong at that: the game aged quite amazingly, and even after 12 years, it does look appealing. It works flawlessly on a x64 Win 10, with a screen res of 1920 x 1200, which was the biggest shock for me. Go ahead and grab it, it has a story like no other, the combat system is very refreshing after the lame, visual-heavy versions you see nowadays, and the sound and atmosphere is still unmatched. I might be a little biased as well, since it's been a love of mine eversince it came out, but I wouldn't have posted this review if the game had any sort of problems. Buy it now, and thank me later.			"

												Great storyline, and as always, top notch voice acting (we pretend the vampire chick from Blood Omen 2 never happened...). And once you get your controller set up the way you like it, the characters are responsive and it feels good to wreak havoc on whatever decided to cross your path. It's not all sunshine and daisies though. If you've played previous games in the series, you know the camera was decent. It wasn't great in previous installments, but good enough to get by with. In Defiance on the other hand, they seemed to think that cinematic camera angles would make for a more enjoyable experience. Anybody remember the cinematic camera angles of the early Resident Evil games? Well, they were alright compared to this. Your ability to navigate the world is destroyed by the fact that it is impossible to get your bearings when you're unable to actually look around. All in all, it's worth a playthrough if you can ignore the camera issues (you won't be able to, I assure you). At the very least, go to youtube and watch the story there.			"

												The sublimation of the saga, the climax of the series, and the climactic venture for both Raziel and Kain. Embark on a final trek through the realm of Nosgoth, as the Demigods you control, fight the invisible hand of fate, bend time and space to your whims, and when the blood and souls of the fallen have carried you to the end... face the chilling conclusion, the final turn of the wheel, and set your eyes upon which face the coin will land.This game is fantastic, the puzzles are easier here than in the prior games, but I'm sure not too many will complain about this. The game was rated R for Blood and Gore alone, and I'm sure the gameplay can suffice for a few lousy camera angles, and some thrilling action.UPDATE!!!: You should get an xbox controller, or a programmable mouse / controller to play this game. The default controls are shakey on PC, as this was definitely intended for the Playstation. I would most likely extend this comment to all other Legacy of Kain games.			"

												My personal favourite of the Legacy of Kain series, Defiance is overall an awesome game. It ties up loose end from the previous games, improves the combat system, Kain and Raziel are both playable which is awesome. I hated the camera though, it made a few platforming sections unnecessarily difficult and annoying but i still love this game.			"

												As much as I love this game, I have to say that it's not for everyone. First of all, you should understand that this is the last part of Legacy of Kain pentalogy. Yes, pentalogy. Unfortunately, the very first part, Blood Omen, is not sold by Steam. Shame, because it's one of the best classical RPGs. But back to Defiance. Gameplay-wise, this game isn't really special. It's a specific hack-and-slash game with several action adventure elements. There are some very frustrating moments with cameras and it's best played on gamepad (though I had some problems with remapping the buttons). If you are a keyboard player, then no problem, but you'll need to change the controls to your liking. You can't really change the graphics and even though the characters or environment don't look very bad, it's evident that the game was released in 2003. And, since this is the pentalogy's conclusion, if you don't know the story, you'll miss the best part of this game.Now for the good parts. First of all, for the first time in the series, the game is not only about Kain (Blood Omen) or Raziel (Soul Reaver), but about both. In odd levels you play as Kain, in the even ones as Raziel. Though both are similar in their range of movements and controls, there are some significant differences (Reavers, realm-shifting). This changing of characters allows the game to run two separate, yet connected story lines. To continue, Legacy of Kain series have always been known for atmospherical, original music (by Kurt Harland). The soudtrack is flawless. The characters are memorable, they've come a long journey and I can honestly say that Legacy of Kain has the most developed and believable characters I've seen in the gaming world. The voice acters did an amazing job - my personal favorite is Michael Bell as Raziel, but there isn't a single poorly dubbed character. And the story. If you like complicated, dramatic and epic stories, Legacy of Kain is the best you can get. The story combines both personal tragedies and events that affect the whole world of Nosgoth. It's very strong, some scenes will just leave you breathless. To conclude - even though it's somewhat linear and the gameplay shifted from action adventure to more hack-and-slash type, the game is fun and I recommend it. I'd say that even a person who never played a Legacy of Kain game before can play it and enjoy it, but if you want a truly memorable experience, play the previous games and save this for the last. It's a great finale of an escalating story that no fan of epic stories should miss.			"

Great story, I mean excellent story, perfect level designes(makes you wonder how the hell this place connects to other main hall), great puzzles and advanced fighting mechanism comparing to other games of the series. I would say playing this game in 2014 will not make you feel like playing an old game. You will feel like you are driving a 67 chevelle in 2014. One bad thing about the game is the camera though, but after a while you learn how to deal with it.

												Not one of the strongest entries in the LoK franchise, although not the worst either. It's a fairly good game. The story is brilliant, as always, as is the voice acting. The gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag.To start with: the camera. The camera is no longer a chase-cam, like the last 3 games. Instead, it's a kind of Devil May Cry camera that shifts, rotates and generally gets on your nerves. It frequently changes when you are in the middle of performing a precise action, like jumping - which screws up what you were doing.Secondly: too much repetitive combat. Okay, to be fair, the other games have also suffered from this, but LoK seems to simply have more of it. It gets tiresome and I found myself avoiding combat wherever possible. Certain levels have you running backwards and forth with wave after wave of enemy re-spawning after every battle. It gets annoying very quickly.Those things aside, the rest of the game is pretty solid. It looks lovely, sounds great and the puzzles are a little more diverse than titles such as BO2. Story is great and it is good fun to be able to play both Kain and Raziel (although bar some animation differences, they play very similar to each other). The main difference between the two is that Raziel is blessed with more engrossing puzzles, while Kain is simply given more enemies to mash. Raziel also has the spectral realm to play around in, which of course, Kain does not have.LoK fans will like it (as I have), but it leaves you wondering just what they could have accomplished with the format - and such a shame that certain elements were not improved upon.Jimbo Rating: 6/10			"

PROS:+ awesome story and the conclusion of the LoK series+ cool game soundtrack+ great voice acting+ concept of switching between Raziel & Kain+ boss fights+ puzzles+ atmosphere of NosgothCONS:- no switching between physical & spectral realm in gameplay- occassional audio glitches- really bad optimization for PC- can have compatibility problems on some PCsComment:The game is old so graphics and compatibility are not that great. Unlike SR1 & SR2, I have encountered a bug that needed to be fixed before being able to play. Iconic combat and puzzles remained also in this part of LoK series although both have been altered a bit to fit the story line. The game remains challenging but I dislike that they removed the mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm, thus making death permanent for Raziel and it creates a need to reload. Story wise it does make sense however and they replaced it with swtiching between Raziel and Kain (not when you want though). Boss fights are great again and they learned their lesson from SR2. Story and narrative is REALLY why I love this series of games! The writers had to tackle the usual time-travel issues but I think they managed to pull it off in the end with the whole alternate timeline. Voice acting remained excellent and Defiance has a really cool soundtrack too. Finally, the game builds up for the finale and gives us awesome boss battles, including the final one. The story of Raziel the Soul Reaver ends in an epic way and is a must for fans of the series. Overall a good game that finishes off the LoK series and I recommend it if you can get past the bugs and older graphics.P.S.: in my case the issue was that the game DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTIPLE MONITORS. After unplugging my external monitor the game worked just fine...			"

												As a long time fan of LoK series, this story got me in since the first Soul Reaver! The story is one of the most amazing out there in the industry and I must add probably the best Vampire/Wraith Related video games out there combine into one. for a first you can play as both protogonist, The long time hated vampire Kain or The casted away vampire turned into a wraith Raziel! Both protagonist got pros and cons even tough they are pretty similar.First for those who dont know this series, Legacy of Kain is not the Free-to-Play Game resolving around nosgoth in a multiplayer style game, whose only goal is to ripped you from money!I am talking about one of the greatest story writen by Amy Henning! Sadly its probably also the reason why they turned the game into what it should have never been! How can you continue a story like she did, without loosing the credibility!This is one of those story, those rare one, thath make me want to know everything there is to know about a universe!So I do recommended this game, espacialy if your into the Zelda type games, this should not be a missed, plus the arts , the realms and the gameplay is pretty strong put toguether.I give this game a 8/10			"

												The game is great and fun. I think it could have been better though. The puzzles have been made easier by a little, fighting is sorta complicated (until you get the controls down), and you're stuck with one weapon the entire game. Its fun with the different power ups you get but it gets really stale after only using 4 of them and only having very few ways to finish your enemy. The story is good and will throw in a bunch of loops that tie in with all the other Legacy of Kain games.			"

												I sincerely hope that whoever was responsible for creating the camera controls for this game is cursed to spend the rest of their professional life stuck with a mouse with a 2 second delay. Exploring a new area? Let's not show where you're running to, let's focus on a close-up of the character running! In the middle of a precision jump? Let's change the camera angle so that you're suddenly flying off in the wrong direction!Despite my numerous tantrums due to the idiotic camera work, I really like this game. Not sure how playable it is with the keyboard but works really well with a controller and x-padder.			"

												The entire Legacy of Kain series is definitely worth purchasing. The story is very interesting and the structure of the video game is pretty good for an old Playstation video game. Although one thing I should mention is the camera angle, it's pretty difficult to keep under control at all times. Especially during combat, and jumping from ledge to ledge. If you are interested in an interesting story line, this is your game. Guaranteed you will enjoy the series if you do purchase any of the games whatsoever. On the other hand, throughout the older game, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver does freeze on you if you have more than one driver operating the game at once. I do not know why exactly, but it chooses to freeze for that reason. Anyway, I highly recommend that all the other people out there get this video game, I rate it 9/10.			"

												This game along with it's entire collection have been a cherished treasure of mine. Too bad itll be one short since Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen can't make it a complete set.-A wonderful story, exposition, and ending that makes you feel like you're reading a fantasy novel. The characters are well thought out as well as most of the environments. I really want to take a field trip in the Sarafan Stronghold, The Pillars, and the Vampire Citadel. It feels like spots to just take a break with a book and some tea.- Playing as both Kain and Raziel were truly an experience as each character's story always seem to intertwine as you journey in the same spots that are spaced out between 500 years.-The combat mechanics are a little more dynamic than in the previous games, but still pretty meh as there weren't many moves to work with. You can gain EXP to gain a total of 5 combos. So yeah. Dodging a messload of enemies at once becomes a fight for life! You can't go in a beat em up like God of War, they'll ignore that♥♥♥♥♥♥and give you a hard time.-The puzzles this time around are a bit more watered down than Soul Reaver 1 and 2, but the game makes it up by using different elemental reavers to solve them. It was fun.- The Camera. OH MY GOD THE CAMERA. Back during the old days of fixed camera positions in games, this hurt me the most. Every room has it's own fixed point of view and you can only pan the camera's view away. When this happens, I spend 5- 10 seconds trying to find where the hell I am. It's even a pain because it makes the platforming a total illusion. You can't tell how far you are from gliding to another platform until you fall off and start over.  This goes especially wrong with Raziel as with his movement. When you stop, he kind of has some ice physics going on for a brief second.- Overall: Pretty damn good game. But it's terrible to play with a keyboard and mouse. Get a compatible gamepad.			"

												The Legacy of Kain series in one of the best and most detailed and intriguing series you could ever play in your life. It has a great gameplay and the music is iconic. The story is so intricate it will take you at least 2-3 playthroughs and being very attentive to dialogues and of course having played the 3 previous games Blood Omen, LOK: Soul Reaver, BO2 (not so relevant, worth playing tho), LOK: SR2. After that you can understand the story and what's going on. This way you will have a better understanding of what the characters are talking about the entire time.At first I played the games as a kid. Defiance was played in 2004 by me, shortly after it came out. As a teenager I found vampires very cool and everything, but honestly I could not get half of what they were saying, although I had played SR and SR2 previously. I replayed the game at 28 and I must say, I really enjoy this even after 12 years. The graphics have aged a bit, but they will never make the game,If anyone's reading my review I give you two alternatives:- Don't play the game. Save yourselves the trouble of getting all the stuff done. If you play the entire series, without including the Blood Omens, it will take you at minimum a good 50-60 hours at first. They are long and the first two SR dialogues are unskippable. You will live your life without having played one of the gems in gaming but you will be calm and carefree.- Play the game and you will enjoy one of the best written and performed games in the history of gaming. With one of the richest stories ever told. My personal favorite OST in gaming, Fully detailed environments and characters and what not. But the game ends... At a critical point. They have stopped all further developing of the series with like 10 cancelled games. You will not be calm. You will want to see the ending to the story, but there is no ending... THERE IS NO ENDING!Choose carefully! I chose to play the series and I am still tormented. I have replayed every game in the series a lot of times but unfortunately the answer lie not in the past anymore. I have to move on, but I can't. This review is baing written in 2016 after having successfully completed the series one more time. And the ending is as hurtful as always. A black hole, that sucks inside all the rest of the series.Defiance ReviewPROs:- Decent Graphics- Amazing Storyline- Detailed Characters- Intriguing Dialogues- Very nice controls- Epic OSTCONs:- Camera hurts my brain- Although epic, most of the OST is recycled from previous gamesAlthough I have this series, I love this series.History abhors a paradox...

												A fantastic conclusion to a well run series. The narrative of free will versus fate is delved pretty well here and the paths of Kain and Raziel conclusion comes to an end that feels complete and only leaving the questions of what's next to happen to this world known as Nosgoth. It's recommended to play through the other games which Soul Reaver 1 and 2 are avaliable currently on steam as well. If story, writting, or voice acting are a huge favored thing in games for you, get this series now. The gameplay is solid as well, having mix of advtenture elements such as platforming with puzzle solving and combat that becomes progressivly better throughout. It's nice to see a series that doesn't strip away powers for the sake of gameplay progression as well. Raziel through out his time actually become more powerful as the story goes on, never being compromised with Metroid-like elements of losing his skills.Truely these games were far ahead of their time and sadly overlooked by many.

												Ah Legacy of Kain Defiance. The final game in the Lok Series. Did they end it on a high note? Well, Yes and No. The Story and Characters have a very satisfying conclusion which makes you think how long they have thought about it. It feels like they had everything planed since the first game. “Witch most game trilogys don’t” You find out everyone’s fate, everyone’s purpose, everything the wheel of fate wanted them to do. The voice acting is “and this goes for Soul Reaver 1 & 2 also” some of the best in any video game. Michael Bell as Raziel, Simon Templeman as Kain, Richard Doyle as Moebius And by far the best, Tony Jay as the Elder God. But what about the gameplay? Well I thought the gameplay in Soul Reaver 1 & 2 was just fine but defiance tries something a bit different. It’s now a lot more linier and the combat has been overhauled. The new combat system is fun with some unique moves. It feels very “Devil May Cry” like, but not as good. There is still puzzles but they’re so obviously brain dead, it’s like why did they bother? With the other 2 games there is a lot more freedom. Sure both games were linier “Well the first game doesn’t tell you where to go or what to do” But it felt natural how everything came together. Also in the other 2 games you can use multiple weapons. “although the soul reaver is still pretty ♥♥♥♥ing badass” Like Spears, Swords, Axes, Tortches,Etc. I’m not saying the new combat system is bad, it isn’t, it’s great. I guess I just like the older one better. Of course I highly recommend playing the first 2 before this, storywise if you just jump in to this you will have no clue what is going on. Legacy of Kain Defiance is a satisfying ending to the LoK series but personally, I would’ve wanted a perfected Soul Reaver 2. I only recommend it to fans of the LoK series. 7/10			"

												Defiance is the last game in the Legacy of Kain series and the only one in which both Kain and Raziel are playable. With both of them being very strong characters, I really enjoyed seeing the story unfold from both sides.Combat for both characters feels very similar, so repeatedly switching between them does not cause any issues. Out of all Legacy of Kain games, the combat in Defiance has always felt the smoothest and most fun to me. However, it can't be denied that with the game being over 10 years old, it's not as entertaining as it used to be.As with the previous games, the dialogue in Defiance is amazing to the point that I often find myself rewatching the cutscenes on YouTube. There's nothing quite like it out there even to this day. A shame this was the final game in the series, although with Amy Hennig's departure I doubt the same quality could have been achieved.Worth playing, if only for the final chapter of the rivalry (or is it?) between Kain and Raziel.

												Defiance is the unfortunate result of the mix of some of the worst aspects of the first two Soul Reaver games, namely the scarce story exposition from SR and SR2's linearity, with the latter being taken to the extreme. Gone is the excellent world design of SR, replaced by evident linearity. You'll spend most of the game finding elemental reavers, navigating the same environments and solving boring puzzles. If at first you may find the battle system improved, you'll soon come to the realization of how basic it really is, thanks to the game's over-reliance on it. The way the game is segmented feels unnatural and pace-breaking. The fixed camera angles rarely work in the game's favor. Character interactions and plot progress feel rare, when compared to SR2's expertly distributed story exposition. The graphics feel, at times, worse than SR2's. I can only assume Crystal Dynamics had significant budget limitations when making this game.So, what good is there here? Well, things get really interesting in the the final hours with a lot of exposition, confrontations and character interaction. The conclusion was satisfying to me, but I can see others not being completely content with it. But all the good the game has to offer is meaningless if you have to endure a considerable number of hours of boring gameplay to get to it.If you play the first two SR games, odds are you'll want to see how it ends, and so you will play Defiance regardless of others' opinions, but unlike those two, this is a game you'll probably only play once. Disappointing.			"

												The most recent - and perhaps final - entry in the LoK saga; in Defiance you play as both Raziel and Kain, battling directly against the dark and ancient conspirators that seek to bring them both to ruin in order to conquer and enslave Nosgoth. The mystery is finally unraveled and the true enemy confronted.			"

												As a huge fan of the original Legacy of Kain series, I was very excited to finally play a port of this game. Unfortunately, between the unbearable key+mouse controls, the obnoxious camera that often makes it impossible to see where you're doing or even changes which direction you are moving, the platforming elements were impossible. I'm sure the story makes it worth it to some people, which is why this game still had enough positive rating for me to think it would be worth my time, but if you can't get past the horrible gameplay, it's not worth the effort.

The sequel to Legend of Kain: Soul Reaver 2.You continue on as Kain to eliminate those who betrayed you and helped your enemies.The gameplay, graphics and cinematics are much better, very good quality!The camera is really sh*tty though, it's set on a stable screen and you can only move/tilt the view left-right-up-down while it moves with your character. Sometimes objects get in the way so using the ""Stop-and-Look 1st Person"" option is needed.The checkpoints are even worse then Blood Omen 2 (the previous released game). No matter at what point you save, if you do not reach a legit checkpoint, and die, you start from the beginning regardless of where you saved.Overall a decent game, pretty fun to play.7/10 "

												So this is the conclusion to all of the Blood Omen and Soul Reaver games. Unlike Soul reaver 2 you will be happy that this game does have a conclusion. The story telling is excellent, combat is fun and satisfying and the game is told from both Kain and Raziel's perspectives. The only down side this game has is the camera angles which are very reminiscent of the PS2 era which can frustrate you at times. Don't let that bother you however as this is a story most people really need to experiance.And do not let my lack of play time concern you either as I have originally beat this game when it was first released. Definitly play and beat this game.			"

												Even though on itself this game is rather mediocre, the series it concludes is without a doubt one of the greatest video game franchises of all time and with that it warrants a recommendation.Those who know the Legacy of Kain games know that every one of them has had some misstep in terms of gameplay and Defiance is no exception. The combat is very flat and samey and the mechanically bland design of enemy types doesn't justify the hordes you have to wade through on every screen. Also if there isn't a law yet against fixed camera angles in 3D games, there needs to be one. But However troubled the gameplay may be, it's never a deal-breaker.Where this game shines is where all games of the series shine: storytelling, world-building and voice acting. Once you're invested in the story and you reach the second half of the game, you'll get to experience all the major plotpoints of the final Legacy of Kain entry as well as the conclusion of the whole story. It's worth playing for that alone. So I strongly suggest to find a way to play to play Blood Omen 1, Soul Reaver 1, Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 in that order and then come back to Defiance. "

												The fifth in the Legacy of Kain series, Legacy of Kain: Defiance follows the epic drama of three major races -- vampire, human and Hylden -- all in a passionate fight for control the world, each one pursuing their idea of the ""true"" prophecy.For the first time in the series, both Kain and Raziel are playable, offering more action-oriented gameplay with Kain, and more puzzle solving elements with Raziel. Defiance's deep new combat system utilizes trigger aiming, and a slew of new Telekenesis moves, adding the ability to move enemies around in the air, throwing them off ledges, against spikes, into fires and more.

												I've played every Legacy of Kain game out there. The only one I don't like is NOSGOTH. This series was never meant to be an MMO. I love the LoK series. The original five games were some of the best I've ever played on Sony Playstation consoles. It has an overly impressive storyline, good gameplay, and some of the best musical scores out there.I highly recommend this and the series as a whole if you like vampire games. Though I still stand firm on my belief that NOSGOTH sucks.			"

												great game with good storyline the whole thing with the spectral and material realm it is pretty good and refreshing also the abilities of kain and raziel are a little bit different kain feeds with blood but azrael feeds with souls also the have different combos and special moves .   the main problem is the camera system which makes you really fracturated from time too times also another problem is backtracking in  most of the missions while respawing enemies that you already killed making it really boring and waste of time . most of the missions objectives is nearly the same as azrael you have to find different powers for the soul reaver so you can unlock doors . and all of these powers are in ancient vampire tombs that all of them are nearly identical so dont expect a lot of new exciting environments . as for kain the approach is little bit different and more simple not a lot of puzzles and more combat and at least for me more interesting story . i dont recomend the game mainly for the controls and the camera if they were ok i would give it at least 8/10 but now it will get 6/10			"

												Trust me when I say this: This game has not held up as well as I had hoped.On one end of the spectrum, the combat is simplistic yet surprisingly satsifying, even the new combos you learn don't appear to add much more but make a world of difference when you realize you can infinite combo everything with a little practice, it almost seems as if infinite comboing as many enemies as you can at the same time is it's own separate game inside of this one; which is fine because you'll need to do something when you're not suffering from ""WHERE THE **** DO I GO?!?!??!"" syndrome. For those who don't know what I mean, this is when a game puts you in an open stage where half the doors are locked by stuff you have to retrieve from later on in the game and the other half of the doors are either hidden off screen by the camera or look like the last door you came through confusing you as to whether you're actually backtracking or moving forward in the game.The story is laughable, the graphics are not as bad as I remember and the combat is fun at least; but this level design... OH GOD! I would like you to note that I may have three hours on steam but I have beaten the game when I was younger and remember everything quite well; that is, everything but how the stages were laid out. You will get stuck, you will get confused and you will want to rip the developers neck apart with your teeth and feed on their blood. But the joke's on you, with level design this heartless all you would get is a mouthfull of sand, and that's the last this you want to get stuck in your teeth.			"

												One of the better Steam ports of the Legacy of Kain games. This and Blood Omen 2 were the only games compatible with a xbox controller. The steam verison of Soul Reaver 1 was unplayable and not optimized at all for modern hardware. Soul Reaver 2 worked great, but was not compatible with my xbox controller. Regardless, I enjoyed this series and can see why it's labeled as one of the greatest gaming series. Players really need to play Blood Omen 1, Soul Reaver 1 , and Soul Reaver 2 before diving into Defiance, which concludes the series. Blood Omen 2 is really more of an afterthought and side story that doesn't really effect the overall series. LOK: Defiance feels more balanced compared to the previous entries with the best of Kain and Razial merged together in one. Once again, the presentation is really well done here. The combat system is a bit more developed than the Soul Reaver series, but still feels a little unpolished. The only complaint I had with this game is that the camera angles are truely terrible, which will cause frustration and headaches due to dizziness! They should have used the camera system from the Soul Reaver games. Anyway the puzzles and abilities are more than less pretty good. As linear as this game is compared to previous entries in the series I still managed to get stumped on puzzles. I got lost in the game mainly due to the annoying camera angles. Other than that the game serves as a good conclusion to a epic series.PROS:+ Superb presentation. Concludes the epic LOK storyline with amazing voice acting and music. + Visuals still hold up well+ Boss Fights!+ Play as both Kain & Razial! Each with their own unique abilities + Combat is deeper and more complex than Soul Reaver games/ Blood Omen games. CONS:- Terrible fixed camera angles will effect the experience, but will not hamper it overall. - Combat is not as polished as it should be and can get a little repetitive  "

												I'm going to be honest: the most import thing required to play this game is a controller. Ten years ago I've played it without one, and trust me, it's extremely frustrating, where as playing it with a game pad is a totally different feeling.I have two complaints about the whole game: requiring a controller to play it fluently was a very, very big mistake. It is by far the best game in the series, but it's ruined by this simple fact, and the camera makes matters worse. It becomes confusing when it's facing opposite angles all of a sudden, and at times it seems made especially to drive you insane, even if you are playing it with a controller.I'm a PC gamer and I don't own any consoles, so I don't see why I would have to own a joystick or a game pad to play a video game from a series that never really required one. Maybe I'm exaggerating...Well, if you are not bothered by the weird camera and (I emphasize this again) you do have a game controller to play this game with, then you'll be pleased with the story and atmosphere of the final and best game in the series.Unfortunately, I can only give it a 8 out of 10, because of the frustration brought to me by the camera and controls. It's still a game I recommend if you're a fan of The Legacy of Kain series, though.			"

												Chances are you've already played the game. I know I have! In many ways it still holds up: whacking people with the reavers is satisfying, the combat system is simple and effective for stringing combos, the voice acting is legendary at this point, the story and mythology is also good. And this time you can skip cutscenes if you wish.The things that hold this game back are: the slightly old sound design, the awful camera (infact platforming is the most dangerous part of the game as is it's hard to tell where you'll land), and obviously this game never got a sequel and never really ended. The camera is especially unfortunate since there are a couple of good environment puzzles.If you can deal with the bad you'll find this time-traveling hack & slash adventure a worthy sequel to Soul Reaver 2.Word of advice: If you have two monitors use only one (windows icon + P shortcut = computer only) to avoid problems with launching, and don't bother with the trainer that gives you the SR2 camera, it's not much better and sometimes creates bugs.

Ten years ago I've played it without one, and trust me, it's extremely frustrating, where as playing it with a game pad is a totally different feeling.I have two complaints about the whole game: requiring a controller to play it fluently was a very, very big mistake. It is by far the best game in the series, but it's ruined by this simple fact, and the camera makes matters worse. It becomes confusing when it's facing opposite angles all of a sudden, and at times it seems made especially to drive you insane, even if you are playing it with a controller.I'm a PC gamer and I don't own any consoles, so I don't see why I would have to own a joystick or a game pad to play a video game from a series that never really required one. Maybe I'm exaggerating...Well, if you are not bothered by the weird camera and (I emphasize this again) you do have a game controller to play this game with, then you'll be pleased with the story and atmosphere of the final and best game in the series.Unfortunately, I can only give it a 8 out of 10, because of the frustration brought to me by the camera and controls. It's still a game I recommend if you're a fan of The Legacy of Kain series, though.			"

												This game is perfection to me, while pervious titles were okay, they still suffered from lack of engagement in combat the enemies were either too strong or not strong enough, but this game found its way to make me interested in playing through every fighting part, without feeling bored or inraged. Soul reaver's puzzels are still the same from pervious titles, and have similar taste to Zelda's puzzels, but with its own style,  i love the characters, i love the voice acting, its just there is so much in this game, that let me beg for more, everyday. and its well worth it at the end, I dont think this game can Exclude anyone, as in everyone enjoys awesome combat and puzzels, if you love games that can blow your mind, in story wise and still classic and artistic enough, this game is for you Pal.

												One of the better Steam ports of the Legacy of Kain games. This and Blood Omen 2 were the only games compatible with a xbox controller. The steam verison of Soul Reaver 1 was unplayable and not optimized at all for modern hardware. Soul Reaver 2 worked great, but was not compatible with my xbox controller. Regardless, I enjoyed this series and can see why it's labeled as one of the greatest gaming series. Players really need to play Blood Omen 1, Soul Reaver 1 , and Soul Reaver 2 before diving into Defiance, which concludes the series. Blood Omen 2 is really more of an afterthought and side story that doesn't really effect the overall series. LOK: Defiance feels more balanced compared to the previous entries with the best of Kain and Razial merged together in one. Once again, the presentation is really well done here. The combat system is a bit more developed than the Soul Reaver series, but still feels a little unpolished. The only complaint I had with this game is that the camera angles are truely terrible, which will cause frustration and headaches due to dizziness! They should have used the camera system from the Soul Reaver games. Anyway the puzzles and abilities are more than less pretty good. As linear as this game is compared to previous entries in the series I still managed to get stumped on puzzles. I got lost in the game mainly due to the annoying camera angles. Other than that the game serves as a good conclusion to a epic series.PROS:+ Superb presentation. Concludes the epic LOK storyline with amazing voice acting and music. + Visuals still hold up well+ Boss Fights!+ Play as both Kain & Razial! Each with their own unique abilities + Combat is deeper and more complex than Soul Reaver games/ Blood Omen games. CONS:- Terrible fixed camera angles will effect the experience, but will not hamper it overall. - Combat is not as polished as it should be and can get a little repetitive  "

												The Legacy of Kain games have one of the best storylines to date; if you've played the earlier titles, you NEED to play this for the perfect conclusion to the epic battle between Kain and Raziel. It was beautiful in it's time but hasn't aged so well, but still has a lot of features that action games are lacking, especially with vampire themes.			"

												This was the game that tied it all together.Gameplay-wise, I won't say it's the best of the series, but on a technical level it was somewhat groundbreaking in bringing us into the world of multiple-opponent combat in its genre.  One of the big things they advertised about this game when it first came out was the ability to fight a crowd as a crowd, not let each one politely come up and get beat up when it's his or her turn.Story-wise, this tied up so many loose ends in the series, and really made the story into what it should have been all along.  Follow with me: The first Blood Omen felt like a one-off, a Playstation game that was kindof fun but wasn't really going anywhere.  It was an overhead RPG-ish thing where you played as a vampire avenging his murder, and it made that into a bigger picture story where he was the victim of a greater plot.  Then Soul Reaver came out, with its awkward camera angles hat nearly made the game unplayable, block puzzles that nearly finished what the camera failed to do, and where someone in their infinite wisdom decided that the Soul Reaver story needed to be cut in half to sell two games instead of one.  I remember people dug into the disk and found content that was designed for continuing the story, but was unavailable in the game because they wanted you to play a second Soul Reaver.  Then Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 were released, with massively improved gameplay mechanics and graphics.  The PS2 days.  Blood Omen 2 was a little hokey for backfill, but backfill it did, and it added more substance to the Vorador and Janos characters.  Soul Reaver 2 became more about tying the series together, and Raziel was less consumed with simply killing his maker as he learned more about the plot that entangled them all.  And for all the mind♥♥♥♥ that the time streamer's games had played on the antiheros and the player, Defiance really brought us back in full 3D amazingness to the intro video and the events from that first Blood Omen.  This is the game that tied it all together, and it did so in such a way that it made me love the entire series all over again.  Questions I didn't know I should ask, like why did the guardian fail to protect the circle, and from whom, were replayed and answered at the same time.  Just...  brilliant.Also, the voice acting pretty much made this series, as much as the game itself did.  Simon Templeman is a total badass.Last note; I played this through several times on PS2, and its predecessors once-to-four-times through on their respective Sony systems.  Steam made me load it up for five minutes to review, but I've played it though more than once.  My review is on the game itself, and I didn't include any technical details (OS, system hardware/performance).			"

												I remember this as one of my most favorite games to play. back when the ps2 was out, i was addicted to the lore from the very beggining. Starting from blood omen to the end of the series that sadly ended on a cliff hanger, i was pretty happy that they stopped here. To be honest, the game of nosgoth was shut down on may 31 and i was pretty upset to the fact that it did not fullfill the storyline. It did however got me to buy this game again (after loosing my disc), but nosgoth was my most favorite 3rd person shooter. The fact that you did not have guns were a very unique concept.			"

												Loved this game when it was available on the playstation platform so downloaded for nostalgic purposes , contols can be configured to work with an X box controller but not complete support. some of the controls still need to be assigned to the keyboard. It is still a good game although camera angles are sometimes an issue and can lead to some frustration when trying to manouvere using a controller but on the whole still a good purchase. my verdict 3 out of 5			"

												Amazing storyline that at times gives you the chills. Ruthlessly slaughtering your enemies with your powers whether Kane or Raziel gives you a sense of arrogance and power. The puzzles and the fact that the game developers actually make you figure things out is one thing that makes this game and previous chronicles that much better. I do admit that the camera absolultely sucks!! If I honestly had not looked around I would not have known things were there. That aside I can honestly give this game a great recommendation. Put it in your library to complete the legacy and enjoy sucking souls and blood!!!!			"

												The fifth game of the Legacy of Kain series. If you are a fan of story-driven games,then these 5 games a re just for you! I highly recommend them! The story in Defiance continues from where Soul Reaver 2 left of and gives us more insight on the world of Nosgoth. The cliffhanger in the end is so sad and bitter. I still hope to see some day the final sixth game of series and learn what will happen with Kain and Nosgoth as a whole.  ""The dark prophecy"" could have been this game,but sadly it was stopped after 6 months of development :((.The gameplay is awesome and you can play with Kain and Raziel. The music and the voice acting is on the usual high level as well :)).The only issue is the camera,but after a few hours of playing you get used to it ^^.10/10 :) Right now I'm replaying it for the fourth time :D			"

Excellent characters, deep and intricate story, good gameplay, decent controls (you may want to rebind them if using a controller) and beautiful visuals. You may want to play Soul Reaver & Soul Reaver 2 first to get the whole story and a better understanding of what drives our main characters before playing this however. Definitely recommend.			"

												A very nice game to play with it's pros and cons. I recommend playing it with a controller, it will make the gameplay a lot more enjoyable considering it's a port. The environment could've used a little more polishing up, you might find yourself running into invisible walls or standing on air, but never to the point where it because a problem. The story becomes more interesting the further you progress into the game and the puzzles/combat also increase with it. All-in-all, I'd say that it's a worhtwhile game to playthrough if you like a story that takes times to unfold and puzzles that'll sometimes keep you running around aimlessly for a while. "

												If you want advice on language you can use when writing essays and reports look no further, this series got me through high school english.Masterful voice acting, fun combat and a story so epic it makes you contemplate just how pointless your small existance really is. A good example to show children what a vampire is actually like, instead of all the other junk thats thrown around these days;Rule 1: Vampires kill people, a lot of people, thousands.... over 100's to thousands of years. Plus they get creative when doing it, meaining they are not very nice people.Rule 2: Vampires are not sex toys for sad lonly girls who are lacking a good male role model in their life.Doesn't shy away from telling it like it is either.

												Oh boy, this is indeed a classic!Right of the bat, yes, the camera is horrible. There is no defending it it's just bad and you will have to get used to it, if not you willr egret this purchase. I also highly recommand a gamepad (xbox360 controller works great, just plug and play).Other than that, this is one of the best action games/platformer ever produced and it has a great storyline (conclusion) to boost! The devs did a colossal job tying up the plot points from Soul Reaver and Boold Omen, witch is saying a lot for those of you wove completed Blood Omen 2. For fans of the series, playing as Kain AND Raziel in the same game is quite pleasing, even if they do control identical. The Reaver puzzles were better done then in the Soul Reaver series, where quite frankly, all you did was push boxes around. Its a lot more action based then its predecessors and using your environment to secure kills is as pleasing as ever.For the asking price, its a great buy, an awesome stroll down memory lane and at the end of the day, if you want to know how to Nosgoth saga ends, you have to give this game a go.PS: Other then the world itself, there is no link between this and the new Nosgoth arena MP game. I do hope this series continues someday. I feel the world of Nosgoth deserves more then a simple storyless arena game. Plus **SPOILER**SPOILER**SPOILER** although Raziel sacrifices himself to the blade at the end, Kain is still well and alive. I could see him rebuilding the vampire empire whilst exchanging quirks with Raziel's soul in the reaver!			"
