												Let me get this out of the way: I wouldn't define BlackSoul: Extended Edition as a good game. It's got too many problems with it for me to say that. And honestly, the only people who are going to enjoy it are those that liked B-Tier horror games in the late 90s and early 2000s, games like Deep Fear or Blue Stinger or Kuon. However, despite all of its problems, I did end up enjoying the game, and it does get better as it goes along.BlackSoul: Extended Edition is an old-school styled survival-horror game, where you utilize limited supplies, puzzles, and clunky tank controls to make your way through several locations. The story is that you're a brother going to a nearby forest to rescue your sister... You play as both through the course of the game. However, honestly speaking, the story hardly has any presence, and the ending is disappointing. But I did enjoy the notes that you occasionally pick up in the game. They were interesting enough, and honestly most of the game's story is told through them.Audio-wise, it's mostly good. The music deserves particular mention, as it's all quite good and very horror-sounding, and adds a lot to the game experience. Audio isn't bad, and some of the ambiance is legitimately creepy, but some sounds, like the sounds the zombies make, get way too familiar and aren't particularly fantastic. And the voicing is god awful, but thankfully there's only like four spoken lines of dialogue in the whole game.Graphics actually aren't too shabby for a small budget indie effort. Some good lighting effects, interesting designed rooms, and good art direction. A few places managed to visually strike with me. However, some areas look far better than others, the animations in the game are wonky, and some textures (especially outside) are notably very low quality.The gameplay is rather simple. Your character moves like a tank, find key items, solve puzzles, and make progress to the next location. Enemies blockade your way, and should either be taken out or avoided. You have limited ammo and healing items, so making decisions about your inventory is crucial. One feature here to note is that if an enemy manages to grab and gnaw on you, you get poisoned, which slowly drains your health. You have to find and use antidotes to heal poison, but they're limited, so sometimes its better to stick with being poisoned as you may very well quickly run into and get poisoned again by another enemy.On that note, there's only three types of enemies in this game; Slow-stumbling zombies, speed-walking Zombies, and sprinting zombies. So basically, there's only zombies in this game. The speed of the zombie is random from zombie to zombie, but notably different zombie models take a different number of hits, which is always the same with that particular zombie model no matter what speed they move at. This limited enemy variety leaves definitely things to be desired, but also ultimately doesn't take too much from the game, as there's a larger focus on puzzles and exploration, which thankfully there is some good variety on.The game is not short actually, it should take someone 10-16 hours to complete it the first time. The game has eight main locations, and it should be noted that they get better as the game progresses (the later areas I found a lot more enjoyable and interesting than the first few). The ultimate trial in the game comes from the second main location, The Graveyard. This location drags on, has a lot of backtracking, and honestly is probably the worst location in the game. But it's after this point the game also starts to get a lot better after the fact.The puzzles are varied and fun, ranging from astronomical puzzles, riddle puzzles, slide tile puzzles, visual puzzles, memory puzzles, and more. The harder puzzles also have a 'solve it' option if you get stuck on them. However, a few puzzles were lifted directly out of old horror games and just altered around a bit, the most notable one being a clone of the Piano Puzzle from Silent Hill 1.There's a few clone elements here actually. The game has a few scares and a few of them are effective, but a few were carbon-copied from Resident Evil and Silent Hill.And this is all ignoring the game's biggest problem; it's performance. The developers chose a very old engine to make the game, and it has a lot of problems. You have to manually resize the window. The game crashes every so often. While I had no issues running it, some people have to overcome hurdles just to make it work. A lot of this is on the engine the developers chose, which pre-dates even the Source Engine, but why the developers chose this engine and rolled with it when it has so many problems especially on modern machines is beyond me.And generally speaking I wouldn't call this a good game, or a game for everyone to experience. Honestly, if you do not have severe love for the genre, you should probably pass. There are far better horror games, and this game's problems can wear thin if you're not patient. The game gets better as it goes along, but it's nowhere near the quality of, say, Resident Evil or Silent Hill.But as a genre enthusiast I actually did enjoy my time with it. I'm a gamer that has played a lot of horror games from all different eras of the genre. The good atmosphere and scares in places, music, puzzles, and interesting environments later in was enough for me. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't really love the genre or lack patience, but there are some interesting ideas and moments here for fans of the genre, and while it lacks elements it really shouldn't (this game would of honestly been so much better with a better story and enemy selection), it did keep enough going for me to want to keep going.Difficult, flawed, and only really for genre enthusiasts with patience and acceptance for flaws, the game isn't a hidden gem, but rather a mixed bag of good and bad which managed to keep me interested during its 10-16 hour campaign. It's really not for everyone, and it's not what I would call a good game, but it was interesting to see a raw low-budget modern indie take on the genre with clearly bigger ambitions and heart from people who loved the genre, but missed a few notes of what makes it what it is, but tackle other areas fairly well.

												Edit: After downgrading my drivers, the game actually runs. It should still be patched so that it works with the beta drivers. The game will only open in 640x480 window mode, so I had to maximize the windowed game which results in the text being COMPLETELY illegible.This game is abyssmal. I've played 50 minutes now, and it is inexcusibly awful. Everything is inconsistent. Unacceptable and terrible sound design, loading times for EACH TINY LITTLE AREA in the game. The inventory is a complete joke and looks like it's designed in paint with textures and pictures slapped together from Google. I've recorded my 50 minutes of gameplay which contains my first impressions. Will link to them here shortly.Technical disaster.

												My first post > (Will not load at all, literally unplayable in its present condition. ""Blacksoul.exe has stopped working"" everytime I attempt to load the game, suggested fixes found so far have failed to work.)EDIT: To test to see if downgrading my drivers would resolve the issue, I have rolled back my drivers and the game has finally loaded without error, the driver issue is currently being looked in to by the developer and I would like to extend a thank you to the developer for the feedback towards my initial response.In saying that, I have mixed opinions on my first impressions, the overall atmosphere of the game so far is at least on the right track to what I came to expect and I do like the soundtrack to accompany this, however the immersion is soon broken by the frequent mass of loading screens between each small segment (by that I mean room by room). I currently found the best way to play the game is in cinematic view in the traditional fixed camera Resident Evil style and am more than pleased to see this in another horror game rather than the over the shoulder action cam. so that's a gold star there ! well done !On a further sidenote, the scenery and settings for the game have been rendered beautifully and really lend to the atmosphere !However the cons still out weigh the pros but not by the largest stretch I originally thought when the game wouldn't work. With some performance tweaks to reduce the frequency of loading screens, re-designing of the Inventory UI to a better standard, control scheme to possibly allow controller support and finally some extended hardware supprt to prevent further problems that I originally faced, the game has alot of potential, but at present I would say it feels more like an early access game with its issues rather than a finished product (no offense intended by saying that) and would benefit from further developement.As stated before, it does have potential and I hope the developer will have continued support and updates for this title, I am more than hopeful for further updates and will look forward to changing my opinion to ""recommended"" in the near future.Graphics: 6/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 6/10Control: 7/10Overall 67%			"

												One of the most enjoyable games I've played in recent memory.  It is absolutely riddled with flaws but it manages to be a great game regardless of them.  If you can get used to them and treat them as 'rules' the flaws don't overcome all the love with which this game was designed, and the more work they do on the game, the more easily recommended it becomes.  The awful load times are *gone* now.  I imagine they contributed hugely to the low score on this one, but they've been fixed.No official controller support.  That's mandatory in a game like this.  I played with Xpadder but there should be integrated support already.  Xpadder needs to be run as administrator and it can still be a bit wonky.Now, who's the game meant for is people that are fans of the original Resident Evil games.  I see some Silent Hill in here as well but mainly Resident Evil.  If you're familiar with them you can tell by my Steam avatar that I'm fond of Resident Evil.  My favourites in fact.  What that means for thi game is something similar to fixed cameras, and it operates with tank controls.  Many people have criticised the controls of Resident Evil for being poor, but they're very finely tuned (besides the very first game in 1996) and carefully designed; they just take a whole lot of getting used to.  Unfortunately, Black Soul's are not a good.  The truth is it's the camera.  People are mainly thrown by the camera in Resident Evil and that's the case here.  The trouble is Resident Evil's cameras are perfectly designed (from Resident Evil 2 on; the 1996 game had abysmal cameras), so it's really a matter of getting used to them.  Black Soul's camera is not well designed.  But I got used to it.  There's an over-the-shoulder camera as well but don't play it that way, please.  Makes it boring.  Live a little and get acclimated to the regular camera.The mystery is compelling, both in gameplay and story.  Unfortunately, though the story is generally well done (despite being done nigh entirely in documents) the finale doesn't quite deliver.  Worth playing to the end, though.A huge difference between this and Resident Evil is the lack of auto-aim.  *Usually* it's not a problem, per se, but I'd have preferred a different sort of combat.  This takes far more getting used to for people not accustomed to fixed cameras, although I wish there were a lot more properly fixed camera angles, supplemented by the auto-aim of Resident Evil.  The way it's done now is a 'cinematographic' camera that follows you from a sort of weird (but workable) angle for nearly all areas where there's combat, and the fixed angles are largely reserved for non-combat areas.Combat system is lacking but combat is clearly not the focus of the game.  It works well enough, but I prefer classic Resident Evil.  A chief problem I do have with it is that if you run past a bunch of enemies, so long as they're aware of you you can't interact with any thing but doors (actually, I think you can pick up health and ammo).  This makes combat essentially necessary in many cases where I'd have just called the lift and left.My other main problem is I wish saving were a bit less exploitable.  Game's a bit too easy this way.And last is the map.  I appreciate what they were trying to do, and if you follow the map from the beginning of an area it's grand, but if you try to pick up in the middle of one of these maze-like sections you'll have some trouble.  I'm conflicted on this.If you like classic Resident Evil, get this game.  Really.			"

												An incomplete game that was probably still going to be bad once it was ""finished."" I can forgive the weak controls and budget graphics, but the camera work is a travesty. There is no way to get any sense of where you are. Apparently, the developers said 8 months ago fixes were coming. I think we can assume that's not happening. Don't buy this game, I'm relieved I got it in a bundle.			"

												(!!!DO NOT BUY!!!)The game tries to recreate the original resident evil games, but fails in almost every way.Poor texture, model and animation quality while also being very dark and almost all black and white.Controls are limiting only back, forward, aim, action, inventory and reload make's it painful walking around without being able to look around while you move. A very poor U.I the first document's you can't read the bottom line because it go's off screen and map's that were scribbled with the black pen in paint. It's poorly designed I could walk into a area with a enemies before the game gave me a weapon. And it fails to create atmosphere without any build up to the first encounter it played horror music way to loud when the first zombie appears and a minute to long after he was dead.This game is bad by mod standard's.The original resident evil game's from over 10 year's ago are way better technicly and for gameplay.

												Ever since Resident Evil changed there's been a gap in the market for an old fashioned survival horror game. Blacksoul brings back fixed camera angles and real zombies. It's easy to mistake it for an actual Resident Evil game, it looks so similar.It was only after I started playing that I learned that probably less than 1% of people who started this game actually finished it. Between the puzzles within puzzles within puzzles, labyrinthine levels, repeating textures and zombie models, backtracking, bleakness and punishing difficulty, it creates one of the most hostile environments I've ever played.There are also no achievements, no multiplayer, no bosses and no trading cards. The only goal in this barebones game is to get through it. There are times when I didn't enjoy it but I was proud to finish it (in around twenty five hours, with a guide).			"

												A solid old-school survival horror game. It is not a ripoff of Resident Evil, but more of a tribute to the PS1 versions. It takes many elements from classics like Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Alone in the Dark, but is still unique enough to stand alone. It has challenging puzzles, some that will make you think for a bit, but all are logical. The combat is rough around the edges, but once you get use to it, it functions well enough. The Devs have been posting updates recently, and most of the previous complaints have been, or will be soon fixed. A very impressive effort went into this game, considering it was made by two people. Their are minor grammatical, and spelling errors, but the Devs are Italian, so it is to be expected from a non-English speaker. Nothing that affects the game in any way. The flaws are all minor, but the charm and atmosphere easily make up for it. If you are a big fan of 90s survival horror, this is a true spiritual successor to those classics. I wish the Devs the best of luck, and thank them for an amazing and enjoyable experience.			"

												I really wanted to like BlackSoul: Extended Edition because it's an old-school survival horror that pays homage to the classics, such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Alone in the Dark, but I just can't due to the large amount of bugs, glitches, loading screens and camera issues.The first problem I noticed with the game was the horrendous ""Cinematographic"" camera which sometimes aims at the ground for some reason, but thankfully, you can choose the far better tracking camera which helps a lot when you're navigating through dark areas. Loading screens are a pain the backside too because they're everywhere, even you're about to enter a small room. However, the developers will be removing most of them in a future update (if that will ever happen).One of the main problems that I had with BlackSoul: Extended Edition is that I was defenseless. The first weapon that I picked up instantly vanished from my inventory, so I had no choice but to run from one room to another while avoiding zombies who just so happen to be standing on paths that I need to take. As soon as I died, I quit the game and uninstalled it.Right now, I can't recommend this game to anyone, not even those who enjoy the classic survivial horror games of the 90s. If the main issues that I mentioned in this review are solved in a future patch, then I will consider playing this game again and hopefully give it a positive review.			"

												BlackSoul tries to recapture the magic of those classic survival horror games from the 1990s, such as Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Unfortunately, Blacksoul resurrects many of the flaws from that era, while leaving most of the enjoyable elements of those classics dead and buried.The negatives? Loading screens between each... and... every... single... room... transition. Any amount of horror atmosphere BlackSoul might have otherwise had is completely ruined by the immersion-breaking load screens. The only dread I experienced while playing this game resulted from the knowledge that I'd have to stare at that loading screen again when I moved to the next room.Then we have the clunky character/camera control. The ridiculously simplistic and boring combat. The inability to 'Esc' out of various menus. The terrible sound effects, animations, lighting, and textures. The awful character models.Now, I'm generally of the opinion that good art design is more important than the latest whiz-bang graphical effects - but even in that sense, BlackSoul looks dull, flat, cheap, and uninspired. As for positives, BlackSoul does have a decently suspenseful soundtrack; music is very important in maintaining proper atmosphere in these sorts of games, and they did manage to get that right. Puzzle design, while not brilliant or innovative, is at least logical (mostly), and the game generally provides all the clues necessary to solves its puzzles without resorting to pure guesswork.Sadly, it takes much more than 'decent' music and 'okay' puzzles to make a good survival horror game. I wouldn't recommend BlackSoul to even the most die-hard fan of classic survival horror.******** EDIT: 5/12/2016 ********Okay, I gave it another shot.At some point during the past year the devs patched out most of those infuriating loading screens. After giving Blacksoul another try, however, I still cannot recommend this game. While the super annoying load screens are mostly gone, Blacksoul's actual gameplay simply is not fun. At all.Now, of course, many games revolve around key collecting as a way to advance from one area to the next. But Blacksoul doesn't even try to put your key collecting activities into any sort of context. You are collecting keys and opening doors for no reason other than to find more keys and open more doors. No attempt is made to give the player any sense of urgency or purpose in any of this, and the few diaries you find here and there do very little to help in that regard. Aside from all the pointless key collecting, you'll also spend a great amount of time backtracking...and backtracking...and backtracking. Did I mention backtracking?Honestly, I kinda wish the devs had left the loading screens in. It would have kept me from delving deeper into the game and discovering just how terrible and tedious it really is.			"

Re fans have wanted capcom to do this for years!!! This is developed by 2 guys ""2 GUYS"" and they can do what capcom can't????Keep the good work up XeniosVision this game is a masterpiece in the survival horror genre.			"

												Black Soul is by no means a 'bad' game.Just depends on how pampered your tastes have become over the past few years. The game is really reminiscent of how survival-horror games were back in the late 1990's and early 2000's I am talking about titles like: Martian Gothic Unification, Countdown Vampires, Carrier, Deep Fear, Galerians, Blue Stinger, and Alone in the Dark.. just to name a few.Not just the big polished Resident Evil and Silent Hill blockbuster killer app and remakes we've all grown accustomed to.I can totally understand why some people might be put off by a game like Black Soul. It isn't without its minor flaws and frustrations you'd expect from such a game. I personally enjoyed the 10+ hours I spent playing through it. You can tell the game developers are huge fans of genre, as a result the game plays out as a sort of love-letter to the games of that era. Black Soul had a few genuine thrills, a couple of cheap scares, an interesting epistolary story, a stellar cinematographic camera mode, and a killer soundtrack. I wish more companies, 'indie' or otherwise, would be as ambitious to create such a game. Plus, one of the final levels in the game is a recreation of an actual abandoned psychiatric hospital. I mean, How cool is that!			"

												I'm about 2 hours into this game and I'm really enjoying it. The music is beautiful and the gameplay, while not as polished as some games, gets the job done. I find it annoying that getting a headshot on an enemy does nothing, but I assume that's a holdover from when the game only had the RE1 style camera system.

												very similar to old-skool resident evil.my favorite thing is you can change the camera from old skool resident evil style like in code veronica where the camera follows you but switches at certain points, or you can make it just like resident evil 4, over the shoulder.the atmosphere is even similar to older resident evil. it has the creepy eerie feeling to it that you got when playing resident evil 1-3.the zombies look awesome and so far are traditional walkers.the graphics are to my liking, not the best graphics in the world but they work beautifully for this game.there are puzzles that are just like what you'd see in resident evil. find the knob to this door, find the key for that, what's missing here? etc.finding ammo, weapons, keys, etc are just like resident evil.if you liked the older resident evil games at all, then you will love this. or if you never played them but like survival horror games then get this.--------------------------------------------CONS:controls are easy to use, but it takes a minute to get used to. perhaps they need to add side stepping. you can turn with the mouse, and the keys WASD are to move around but A and D turn you, unlike most games, but i can already turn with the mouse, i keep using A and D to move around corners as i would in other games but keep forgetting it doesn't do what i want lol. not game breaking at all though.---------------------------------------------despite the few cons this game has it is still very fun and a great game.don't listen to any other reviewers that give this game a bad rating, they don't know what they are talking about.the game does not load in every room. the loading times are not very long.the camera isn't bad at all. etc. the game is fine as is. the game seems to run completely fine, i have not ran into any bugs or glitches yet, and the devs say they are still working on it. so buy this game and help them....and yourself.never listen to a critic and find out for yourself!!!

												This game looked good to me but got mainly negative responds, so I figured out I'd buy and see for myself, specially considering the cost. Here is what I have found.Gameplay/playability: After the last update most of the annoying loading screens have been fixed, which is a good thing since it appeared to be the most annoying topic. Launcher acts weirdly at startup but then the game runs smooth. Also I had minor troubles capturing the screen when I tried streaming this game. Remapping keys is tricky, since I have found options to remap forward\backward movement, but not left\right, but as long as you don't hate WSAD you'll feel comfortable. Cinematic screen has been said to be a pain, but tracking mode makes it close to RE 4\5\6 games. Fights don't seem difficult on the highest available on first walkthrough level to me, but I think I'm just playing fine-ish. Puzzles are very appealing, require imagination but not designed to keep you at one place for ages. Visuals\style gets very high grade from me. If you price high-res textures and modern visual effects, this definitely won't work for you since technically the graphics is somewhere at resident evil 2 level. On the other hand, if you can bear that, I think overall level design is catchy and stylish, pretty well made (you don't expect to see things like lens flares in a game like this, but they are there).Sound\atmosphere is overall haunting and much better than were my expectations for it. Probably the hardest thing to compare to other games, but I think it is done pretty good.Story: I'm sorry, I haven't gone too far to make a judgment on that.Summary: This game is what it claims to be--an old-style survival horror. Those always had few issues so unless you're really willing to trash this game down for some reason I don't see any point in bringing it up, 'cause it is still more playable than most of games coming out lately. Closest game on all aspects that comes to mind is Alone in the dark 3, from recent games--Resident Evil Remastered (which loses to BlackSoul on almost every aspect in my opinion). Complete steal for it's price and one of the nicest games I've played recently.			"

												As much as I want to write a negative review for the Devs not sticking to their word and fixing a lot of the problems (last update was literally a year ago tomorrow), the game isn't as bad as people are making it out to be. I almost beat it, the only reason I gave up was because I got sick of going in circles and just lost momentum. It's not Resident Evil or Silent Hill, but if you're into the genre, like worser B-Game genre, it's actually quite entertaining.Note, I did not spend 35 hours on this game as it says.

												I feel like if you wanna make a fair review you should finish the game first and give your opinion later.I can say that this game have some features and influences from other old games and I am glad that even the game didn't become a sucess, at least the devs tried to give a shot and made me feel some nostalgia from the past.This game is not recommended for people who never played (or don't appreciate) a horror games like Silent Hill 1, Resident Evil 1,2 and 3, Alone in the dark 1, and so on, basically, old games.Ok let's start then...Positive:- Background Music- Amazing details inside mansions- Lightning - Interesting puzzles- Long gameplay (Aprox. 8-10 hours 1st time playing)Negative:- Amount of enemies (to much in my opinion)- Combat system (every bite means you need antidote. It doesn't matter if you point to the head or to the foot because damage will be the same. Hard to avoid bites sometimes no matter what)- Not enough supplies (antidote)- Lack of story- The maps don't mean nothing to me, hard to understand- To much back and forward (Like you are in the hospital and you have to go all the way back to the farm house.. )- The game crash a lot, to finish my walkthrough guide I was always praying that the game won't crash when loading- Ending is very disappointing Points to improve:I really appreciate the fact that the devs removed the big loadings inside the game but there is something more that I would like to add...- Removing the amount of enemies,- Nicer maps for cemetery and hospital, like in Silent Hill- Improve battle system- Put as default the option tracking mode (easier for beginners)- Extend the ending or make a different one, please			"

												For the price it's a snip and controls are a bit weird but I managed to configure with xpadder to my wireless 360 controller and it works okay now.The game has potential to be great but its obviously unfinished but I love the old school resident evil  clone thing going on and the exellant suspensefull music in the background.

												The graphics are what makes this game. They are so unique and gritty i can't even begin to describe them. If they had used any other game engine for this game than i don't think it would be nearly as scary. The interior graphics are some of the best i have ever seen, they are extremely detailed and invoke a sort of terror that i've never experienced before, its almost as if you can feel the dry paint on the wall. This is one of the best horror games i've played in the last 15 years. The jumpscares are the best out of any horror game hands down. The only ugly part's visually are the cemetary which have no grass covering the countours on the ground. But the interiors more than make up for it. Once you get to the delacroix' house thats where the game really starts to pick up. The puzzles are enjoyable to if not for the loading screens.But where did this little gem of a game come from? Games like this are what make me love being a pc gamer. It's unique, it uses its own game engine, it is not trying to appeal to the masses. And its just an all around experience that puts me in a surreal  creeped out mindset. I like finding special games like this deep within steams library that i had no idea existed, its kind of like that special moment when you find a unique old wooden object at a yardsale that you could never even imagine finding at a big name brand store.In other words its just a nice refreshing feeling when i play a game that is uniquely its own own game from the ground up.. I like playing games on new engines because its like a new feeling you havent experienced yet.. Just subtle differences like the way the mouse moves, the way the lighting looks, the way the characters move around, the way the textures look, the way your computer handles the performance all just come together to give each and every game its own unique fingerprint that are unlike any other game.. No two games feel exactly alike unless they use the same game engine. This is why i am just getting kind of sick of every game i boot up lately saying ""POWERED BY UNREAL ENGINE"". Playing games that all use the same engine is like hanging out with the same person everyday except they are wearing a new outfit.This games awesome, its gritty, its creepy and has puzzles that require some serious intelligence.Cons-The loading screens are wayy too frequent.-The pistol i finally found sounds very unsatisfying, there is no difference between a headshot and a body shot in terms of damage on a zombie. And the pistol does not fire as fast as you can click. There is also no blood or head popping effects from the pistols. Combat is just extremely unsatisfying and leaves a lot to be desired. But this game leaves its mark in atmosphere and its definately worth it in my opinion-You cant strafe left/right You can only run forward and turn your body with the mouse.To make this game perfect all they would have to do is-Eliminate all of the redundant loading screens-Add a new louder/more satisftying gunshot sound to the pistol-Make headshots do increased damage with satisfying skull pops/blood splatters. (Not just with the mangum/shotgun)-One or two more zombie models, and maybe a nice automatic weapon like an AK after a while			"

												I think this game is pretty great. it pays homage to the old school survival horror classics (resident evil 1,2 &3, silent hill and others). Which has long since died and i so dearly miss it. It has a dark atmosphere where you head to a remote place to do somthing and save someone (im not giving away the story). Theres puzzles/riddles like there was in silent hill (More complicated then Resident evil).The map design is pretty good, with lots of detail which makes it easy to skip over things. Its like the olden days where you had to pay attention to the game to play it. Theres no arrows, no audiologs, no flashing objects that indicates you can interact with them, simply put no bull♥♥♥♥♥♥The camera angles are a mix between silent hill third person mode and the classic stationary Resident evil style depending where you are in the gameTheres some downpoints however. My main hate with this is there's no gamepad support (which can be fixed using xpadder). secondly, but ill forgive them the character animation is b-class.Its kinda scary how the female character you play as looks like a creepy goth guy.

												Whelp Im a sucker for survival/classic resident evil games soooo I brought the game and played for awhile now. And I can say, its very.. uhm... whats a polite way of saying this, amateurish. It looks rather poor in textures and animations aren't that great even though the lighting can be interesting at some points. (Why is there no turning-in-place animation?) I would give it a pass if the gameplay is good buuuut... the gameplay isn't good. Its very sluggish. While classic Resident Evil is tankish and sluggish, it passes cause its nicely animated and beautiful. And much of the action comes in reacting fast and carefully. Here~... Theres little to think about and hardly anything to challenge you as far as the first enemies are involved. (Unless you count the controls themselves as challenge. Why can't I look one way and move another way?) Sorry, even some of the atmosphere falls off. I shook my head at the RE1 inspired bathroom scene. (Seriously?) I can't recommend this. It plays poorly and it has very little charm to help.			"

												A short while ago I wrote a review for The Evil Within, cheekily declaring it ""the best Resident Evil game since Resident Evil 4"".  Between the incredibly awkward controls (which can only be PARTIALLY remapped), interminably long and frequent load screens, chaotically uncontrollable camera angles, ridiculously overdone sound effects, and complete lack of any facial expression from our protagonist as she is bitten in the neck by a zombie in a manner SO reminiscent of Resident Evil 1 that the word ""homage"" surely wouldn't cover it in court...I guess I'm gonna have to declare this the WORST Resident Evil game since Resident Evil ANYTHING.     Nice screenshots, though...and I did dig the music lifted almost wholesale from Resident Evil 2...   Verdict: 3.5/10. (PS Apparently ""fixes"" are on the way, but since they were promised way back in MARCH of last year, I don't suppose we should be holding our collective breaths.  For now, I'm going to have to agree with the majority opinion that this game is presently ""unplayable"".)			"

												Black Soul is run with the S2 engine, the same engine that ran a little game called i'm not alone. People should of known what to expect. Very simple game mechanics and loading screens. I'm not a fanboy but the dark atomosphere is great, sound is below standard but not annoying. Finally, for $7 greenbacks this is a much better game than im not alone was.			"

												I think this game has had pretty harsh criticism.There has been a lot of criticism of poor textures, bugs and crashes, and criticism of the plot, but a number of issues have been fixed more recently.This is not a resident evil clone, it is more reminiscent of alone in the dark but also reminded me of a lesser known game called Nocturne and the Blair Witch spin-off series.  Whilst the graphics seem dated, there is a tense atmosphere throughout aided by a great soundscape and musical score.  Some of the more subtle sound effects in the indoor locations had me listening with one ear of my headphones as I thought the sound was coming from somewhere in my room.Sure the gameplay is repetitive with a very long level early on in the game that I'm sure would have put a lot of people off only for them to miss out on the more atmospheric areas.  Yes the storyline is a little samey but there are only so many stories survival horror can tell without repetition (it's not as bad story-wise as some of the more ludicrous RE plotlines recently).This is by no means a masterpiece, but considering it is a two-person team of developers this is also by no means a terrible game.  For the price it is selling at I have played much worse.  This was not meant to be a glowing endorsement, but I felt the need to have my first Steam review be in defense of what I think of as a decent game worth the money.3/5			"

												Was excited by this title and of course the price. Even liked the controls as it is a throwback to the original Alone in the Dark, which I loved. The camera angles at times make no sense as you are seeing a perspective that you cant manuever.It has an issue with NVIDIA cards it seems. No way of adjusting graphics - so it looks like a Nintendo game. Is it meant to look bad to make the ""throwback"" convincing?Worth a look for the price - it has potential.			"

												Right after you hit new game, litterally right at the start after the loading screen finishes, the very first thing you see is a low-resolution almost corrupted looking texture, followed by the sound only working on the right side for a bit until you realize the music in that room where the game loads is area specific rather than completley ambient. It only get's worse when you start to play as Marylin Manson The China Doll in Luigi's Mansion then find yourself in a small kitchen instantly dead because a zombie just so happened to be there oh so casually. So you try again and die once more because while trying to fight it or even just look around your cursor hits the task bar because you tried to run windowed mode once now it is permanatly stuck in windowed mode and the mouse is not locked to the game, not in windowed mode, not with duel monitors.I've never been disgusted with a game so quickly. I feel molested.			"

												As a survival horror fan, I can't in good conscience recommend this.  Combat, regardless of the weapon or camera angle, is a clunky mess and the highly-touted story all but disappears for hours at a time so you can fight the same four zombies over and over.  You get hundreds of bullets so ammo is never an issue and the controls are so responsive that getting to the inventory sometimes requires mashing the key for it repeatedly.  On the plus side, 1600 x 900 fullscreen is actually windowed 640 x 480 and the launcher will keep running in the background even after the game's been closed until you go into task manager and shut it down manually.

												I don't even know where to begin. Wtf is this. I've got some things to say here and they're not great. Or good. Or even mediocre.1. Game can't be configured to run on screen sizes bigger than ipad resolutions. Seriously. Like 1200x960 or the equivalent of. You can stretch the screen out to force a fullscreen but it's obviously just that - stretched. Unless this game was produced in 1995, there's not much reason for this.2. Loading screens. Like...a lot of loading screens. Is the engine incapable of loading more than one room's content at any given time? Call me impatient, but it ruins whatever sense of atmosphere you've managed to build (if any) and feels choppy/poorly constructed.3. Everything else, pretty much. I only played the beginning and that was enough to tell me that the atmosphere was lacking, the music was dismal, graphics were sub-par (like...PS1 quality. I'm pretty sure Spyro the Dragon had a higher framerate.) and the plot was stereotypical, cliche, and otherwise unimaginative. Again, only played the beginning, so if you want to tell me it gets better, go ahead - I simply shouldn't have to force myself to reach a point where I agree. Finally, gameplay left much to be desired. The only thing that really struck me was the ability to change the camera angle from cinematic to over the shoulder. Had resident evil vibes that worked for it honestly, albeit, not to a degree that spared it the criticism its other aspects earned it.TL;DR - Bad. Just bad.			"

												Originally released in 2013, then again in 2014 as an ""extended edition"", this is intended to be a 3PV horror game.Unfortunately the game is plagued with horrible bugs and crashes - the developers ended support in 2015 without addressing the critical faults. Under Windows 10, with a modern system (4K etc), the game simply crashes on launch.  Many users with nVidia cards cannot run the game. This game does not reach a very basic level of quality that would be acceptable.   It's very likely if you buy this game today, it won't work at all.			"
