												Illegitime child of Trine and Mega Man!At the beginning I have to deny some informations pointed in negative reviews.- Button delay - I had no problems like this one. Controling character was intuitive and easy. - Graphics issues - I've played Zack for over 10 hours and I never had any problems with visual side of game.- Game crash a lot - Never happened to me... not even once.- Bugs - During gameplay I saw only one type of bugs - in-game enemies. I do not know why so many people have problems with this game, but maybe you should learn how to properly configure your Windows and gamepads before you blame developers for all the evils of this world?This is not a hardcore platformer. Even Steam achievements are enough easy to make 100% and get another ""perfect game"". It's a platformer, where you can experiment while searching for hidden objects. Even if you fail, game saves your progress every time you do a few steps, so it's not a problem to do searches like ""I don't think there's a precipice, but let's check that place just in case..."".Puzzles are not very challenging and even a child should be able to resolve all of them very quickly.As everyone can see on screenshots game is maintained in cartoon style, which is very similar to Pixar movies. In my personal opinion it's a good option for 2,5D productions like Zack. Animations are fine and cutscenes are quite interesting.In-game music stimulates the atmosphere appropriate places, but is definitely not memorable. I forgot it already, and just 2 days have passed since I've finished this game.Story is trivial, but be serious... do you seriously expect every game to be Sherlock-Holmes-Story-Telling-Level?In Zack Zero storyline fits gameplay and game concept. I think it's more than enough.I can truly recommend this game to young players and for everyone who like platformers, but not hardore ones where you can easily break your gamepad.8,5/10			"

												Good little side-scroller.  Interesting suit mechanics keep the game fresh, and the art style is really enjoyable to take in while playing.			"

												Nice game.  Visually pleasing for sure.  Played it on the PC.  Loved it.  Alittle buggy, but I can deal.   If you make it for the Mac I'll buy again.  Love the rich colors bro.			"

												I got Zack Zero in a bundle. I opened it up to idle for cards. I did not expect to play it. I did not expect to LIKE it. Needless to say, I was surprised. Zack Zero is cartoony-style and reminds me of Ben 10 almost, in the ""I-have-different-powers-that-do-things"". This game has a retro feel to it, like this is something I would have played on a previous generation of consoles, similar to Tak. It's controller-friendly, and after looking at reviews I saw people complaining of input-delay but I did not experience any of this with my Onza or my FusionA. Zack has the power of fire (fantastic for dealing with enemies), earth (great for breaking through ground, and good for AOE), and ice (slows down time, and freezes enemies). He also has his regular suit for when you run out of power. It regenerates pretty fast, so don't worry. So does the health. Overall, it's pretty forgiving. There's no lives, so no penalty on dying except for having to redo the jumping puzzle you JUST DID. There's also some hidden treasures to find.I'm not saying Zack Zero is a great game. It's not. It's a good game. It's nothing original. But it's FUN to play. It's a nice break. Sometimes we need that. Don't look too deeply. It's a 2.5D side scrolling platformer that's mostly polished and is a nice break for several hours. I absolutely recommend it.I enjoyed my time with Zack Zero, and although I am not sure if it's worth the full ten, this week it's on sale for a buck and you'd be silly not to get it for that price. (and it has cards!) Also, if you've got kids in the house I'll bet they'd love it as well.			"

												Got this game during the weekly sale for $0.99 USD, and it is definitely worth paying and playing if you enjoy action platformers.If you like platformers, chaining different combos for that wonderful score multiplier, and large areas to explore, then you will really like this game.The aesthetics are very good with lots of detail in the environment. The music is nice and is appropriate for the action and atmosphere.The controls are not overly complicated, however, chaining different combos can be fairly challenging. The learning curve is moderate, again with most of the difficulty due to the combos (if you care about increasing your multiplier to maximize your score). I strongly suggest using a control instead of the keyboard. You do not use the mouse when you play this game (even in the menu screen).I think the game may not be fully optimized for Windows 8.1, as I cannot seem to be able to change the resolution to anything besides the default (1280x760 i believe). If I change it to anything else, the game appears to zoom into the top left, so it seriously obscures your field of vision (impractical to play this way). I do not believe there is a resolution fix at the moment.The game starts off with a helpful tutorial that lets you most of the available skills - its similar to the original Assassin's Creed where your character is maxed out, then you start the real game debuffed back to level 1. You even get to see the stats screen that strips away all of your skills and levels.You have 4 different suits: regular, fire, ice, and earth. You can switch to any at will, but the elemental ones drain energy - and you will automatically switch back to regular Zack once you deplete your bar (it refills fairly quickly). Each suit has different abilities and uses. For example, the fire suit can shoot fireballs (surprise!), glide in the air, and also moves the fastest. The ice suit can slow down time (extremely useful for navigating through numerous environmental hazards) and use ice attacks, freezing enemies. The earth suit cannot jump, however, it is essential for breaking through destructible obstacles and getting to secret areas.During combat, if you switch suits and vary your attacks, you will boost your multiplier (resulting in boosts to your score). This can be tricky to master in the beginning, especially if you are not using a controller as the keys bindings are very close to each other. The game progresses in difficulty at a reasonable pace. The first few boss fights were pretty easy to defeat. As you pick up the collectibles, you will gain experience for levelling up. I am pretty sure leveling up is automatic, as I have not been able to select which skills to invest in (mind you, I did not get very far into the game at the time of this review). There are secret areas with collectible trinkets for the achievement hunters. The stages are pretty big, allowing you a lot of space to explore.Overall, I think any platformer junkie should give this a try, especially if you love chaining your combos and watching that multiplier go up. There is a scrolling bar that provides feedback on your score's global ranking, as well as its comparison against any of your friends who may have the game.Recommend.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												the essence of zack zero is awkwardness. completely, though with degrees, frustratingly. I do believe the entire work is misguided. somehow, I still believe it is based on a love of videogames, but its process of modernization only offered oversights and misinterpreted tropes. to point it out basically, crocodile entertainment struggled with the basics of their game. controlling zack in the air is lacking entirely in finesse. either right or left moves zack very quick and much too far through the air. to complete most jumps, you’ll need to alternate between left and right so you can stay centered. usually this occurs in platformers that retain momentum, but zack zero has no aerial momentum to speak of. this careless implementation makes platforming more busy than it actually demands and kills its organics. the core problem demonstrates a lack of awareness that, at least, is consistently inhibited in other areas as well. however, the game is not without merit. its environment design exhibits a convincing technical competence and obvious visual excellency.the pallette, visual direction, and quality of models are rather impressive. most especially the pallette, zack zero is uniquely bright and colorful. a bright, saturated, bordering cel-shaded platformer, it certainly wins out on first impression. any given scene in the game is delightful, at least especially, when not in motion. as for the execution of the 3D in general, a trine comparison is an exact science. a trine foil can carry too, both games have a talent in visual design to make you stand up and say “wow is this really indie?” (through irony; indies containing excellent 3D have been relatively commonplace, we still enjoy the disparaging perceptions). yet, still like trine, there isn’t much of a visionary execution. their gorgeous assets are liberally applied to reproduce a world of cliche. trine is, however, more comfortable with its setting, and achieves an otherworldly effect to a much fuller degree than zack zero. that saying, trine doesn’t even strive to make its world especially otherworldly, I would use the word fantastical, so the obvious fault of zack zero is demonstrated.zack zero’s beginning sequence of levels does have an offworld impact. it’s not truly alien or anything like that, but a normalized sci-fi influence at least shines through. the planet seems to be an arid jungle, inwhich is the nonstandard appeal. altogether, it’s expressive and effective. to a general degree, anyway. never does this game go above and beyond. the after locations are metallic bases and underground caves nigh exclusively. they are visually disappointing, not only because the ideas are plain, but because crocodile entertainment could only bring plainness to their ideas. in their enemy design this remains a symbol. the enemy race is, well, a barney-like dinosaur and through the game you encounter a generous maximum of 4 barney variations. most every encounter is a mob of these same bipedal reptiles, with little visual and no mechanical variation. the resulting plainness in visual and scenario design is not surprising given the example set after the first level sequence.to put it simply, this game is unable to cope with the platformer genre as it has stood since 1988. zack zero’s platforming is seemingly competent, at first, yet after the first 2 or 3 hours, the player has experienced the majority of what zack zero has to offer from its platforming, and is expected to play through variations of the same method. I can’t even say that every level contributes at least a few new ideas, there are levels in the mid and endgame that are plainly a wasteland of ideas. it was determined that the baseline of jumping on platforms, vertically and horizontally, would suffice for the majority of the game. it can be supposed that the weakness and tapered off nature of the game’s enemies contributes to the inability to differentiate. I cannot determine what is not there. crocodile entertainment banked on zack zero having an adventurous feel, with long levels coming in all kinds of shapes and sizes, topped off with zelda puzzling. the puzzling is nice and has far more thought put into it than the platforming, but it is not good enough to carry the deadweight of the game’s core. never, if maybe one time, are the player’s powers expected to use in tandem in the game’s puzzles. they’re more like glorified locked doors; the player finds then performs the told and unchanging solution, with the variable being only which power is the solution.zack zero’s implementation of fighting combat is, as very well expected, ignorant of its placed genre, and as a result nothing other than offensive. there are two identical punches, a homing disk-something shot, and a myriad of elemental powers. zack zero’s model is unemotive and his bland animations could be called serviceable. the fire and ice powers have particles that go beyond and obscure their hitboxes, blind the player, and look particularly garish, most especially the terrible bloom-or-whatever happens when you do a fire explosion. earth attacks are relatively goofy but at least look and feel the best. enemies typically have more exciting fighting animation and presence than zack does. in between boss phases are combative cutscenes - these really show how dead and uncharismatic the protagonist is during combat. zack always has super armor, his attacks are all fast and strong, there is no clear reason to use some attacks over others, the depth of strategy is close range or long range. which of course means that long-range is the best option. that besides, earth attacks do overwhelmingly more damage than other attacks with little sacrifice, when it comes to melee. bosses go down comically fast with nicely timed ground slams. enemies do no more than approach zack and swing, or approach until contact. minibosses have attack patterns even more lame than a super mario boss, that is, they have one extremely easy to dodge attack performed over and over again. it doesn’t need to be said, though I’ll say it: the combat and enemy design all suck. in a complete move of utter unaware travesty, combat happens more than not within encounters, where every bad enemy needs to be beaten in order to progress. combat and platforming is rarely integrated and it is with flying enemies if it ever is. bosses start out as more puffed out versions of minibosses, then become the best part of the game. zack zero’s boss fights are the only aware and modernized aspect of the title and I can’t help but feel they’re not studied, just coincidental. nevertheless, the patterns become inventive, though never chaotic or dense, which is good and bad. since the game checkpoints between phases, bosses never offer a working challenge, yet it doesn’t stop the fights from being enjoyable.sometimes the game has walkable floor that looks like it’s in the background. it’s really impossible to differentiate those sections from actual background. sometimes background looks like walkable floor, but then you find out it was the background. checkpoints are very frequent, so while I couldn’t get mad, I still found these moments so incredibly stupid. there is a leveling system, with experience points gained through collectibles, that locks out abilities. the combat sucks, so again I couldn’t get mad. either upgraded abilities deal no extra damage, or enemies level up with you, who knows, but I seemed to do the same damage throughout the whole game. the story is embarrassingly, hilariously bad, and the game would have been better off without any attempt at writing. the soundtrack is largely unfitting and I rarely if ever get that feeling about accompanied music. it’s strange how catastrophically bad elements of zack zero are and how it isn’t really felt in the game. it’s pitiable, the feeling I can’t shake, that crocodile really did try their best.

												This game has great potential but also many flaws which can easily ruin the experience.Do not expect some crazy hard game, it's quite easy instead. It gave me the impression it was made with kids as its main target. Mostly for the (italian) narrator voice but also because there a lot of checkpoints. A LOT. Even during boss-fights. This leads to an overall light experience, which can be a good change from those ultra hard games.Level design and art style are without a doubt its selling points. Top notch. Colorful and variegated really draws you in.What could let you down are some occasional bugs and faulty collision detections that may happen during your playthrough.It also seems crashes are a bit too common. Have a look at the community hub as it has a lot of different solutions; I tried a few and I think it was disabling Steam overlay that did the trick for me.If you're lucky and don't encounter any of the aforementioned problems, you'll be free to enjoy the variety of the levels while swiftly moving through them thanks to pretty smooth animations. I happened to run into what it looked like frame drops (not sure as, as said, I had Steam overlay disabled) during boss fight with lot of moving objects on screen (be it part of background or stuff to avoid in the foreground) which made it hard to fight and, generally, move. Luckily, it happened like twice in the whole playthrough. :) What I found to be not good as the rest are:- camera placement, which sometimes happened to be behind decorative objects who may prevent you to see Zack and/or enemies;- changing suits, whose input keys doesn't seem to be as accurate as other keys (at least, if pressed during movements/combos. No problem if you only change suit)Other small flaws may be found in translation (italian has a couple) and narrator (yup, again. Made me feel like a kid). All this narrator thing could be only a personal matter. Perhaps he voiced also some other kids' stuff and my brain unconsciously did the connection, so take my words with caution.Found strange that there were no credits at the end, just a congratz message.. oh, and it clearly announced a sequel but I kind of have low hopes of it seeing the light, sadly :(Achievement for completing the game may not unlock properly but don't panic. Last savegame places you to the very end and I read that just a reload may help. Mine unlocked only when I closed the game, after a couple of those reloads.I've enjoyed my playthrough and want to encourage you to look beyond those flaws I've listed and give it a try. You now know what may expect you and it won't be difficult to beat.. I think you could end up enjoying it :)			"

												Zack Zero, Bugged HeroThe game looks awesome, especially for an indie title...but the basic gameplay and storyline are actually pretty bland.  The worst part of the game though is that there are a lot of glitches and bugs...you can find yourself saved to an unwinnable save point, stuck in the back / foreground, or just have the textures go haywire on you.  If you find it on a BIG sale (I picked it up 90% off), it may be worth your time...otherwise give Zack zero thought.			"

												This is very odd game.On one hand, this is a modern platform game, with (very pretty) 3d graphics, online leaderboards and it's own unique little twists on on the genre.On the other hand, this is a retro platform game, with a story and setting like something out of the 80s or 90s, and the cheesyness of that era is played dead straight, not the slightest bit self aware or toung in cheek.To play this game is to step into a strange alternate world, where games matured technologically but remained exactly the same mentally. On that alone I'd say the game is worth playing, it's very much unique in how odd it is.Unfortunatly, while I think the game is worth checking out on WTF factor alone. I can't really say whether the game is actually good or not. Personally, I find it to be a very fun platform game, but it's mix of old and new is so weird that I can just as easily see people being put off by it as I can see them liking it.This is very much a ""love it or hate it"" deal.

												Regardless of Zack Zero having a lame name, which I can only put down as a play on words and a hint towards the 'Ben 10' franchise as the game itself offers us no other reason for his name. Personally I found this game to be exactly what the main 3 developers at Crocodile entertainment...http://www.crocoware.net/Set out to produce and advertised it as, and that was to be a fun platformer dressed up to look 3d with a Saturday cartoon style about it all.The fun aspects all stem from the fact that Zack Zero is a one man army with all the Mortal Kombat moves at his disposal that you could think of. Plus if he ever dies by falling off a cliff, you simply respawn with no loss to your characters gem and special item collection. So the whole adventure serves as a fairly stress free, lets blow all this kibosh up.The story is that your girlfriend has got herself kidnapped by a very ugly looking relative of bowser. I really never thought bowser could look any uglier, but somehow he does. I guess in the evil lizard/crocodile/dinosaur/snapping turtle world fertility options are rather limited. Hence he kidnaps your girlfriend, he also holds her ransom for a chemical you have at your disposal which looks like something that would make Superman go hide behind the couch.In Australia we have a saying, ‘If your girlfriend gets taken by a crocodile and her head doesn't resurface after three seconds. Go find yourself another girlfriend.' Zack Zero has a more beautiful blonde assistant at his side, and in truth I spent many hours of the game trying to convince Zack that this Marlene of his, who can't even bake us a cake like Princess Peach, is just not worth all the lava spitting frogs, the giant lobsters, the robotic spiders and all the other efforts needed in order to get her. The game constantly throws over 30 enemies at you through the various levels occasionally breaking up the action with small puzzles here and there which even a dog going to sleep on your keyboard could solve. The game was originally designed for PS3 and then imported to PC and so it plays out extremely well with a controller. Its benchmark though is the developers attention to an imaginative, colourful world with stunning backgrounds, all of which are slightly inspired from one of the main developers earlier games known as ‘Phantis’ which can be found here...

			A walkthrough of the ZX Spectrum game, Phantis (Game Over 2). From the recording originally sent to http://www.rzxarchive.co.uk/		

Seriously how do you go from a rubbish game like ‘Phantis’ and then produce something quite extraordinary like this? They have my respect not just for that, but also because of the sheer guts and determination that they had to go through to get this product done in the first place. The game took 5 years to make in total, largely due to the lack of financial support that they received because the world was in a financial crisis at the time of this games design and banks were simply not lending out. Still they battled against innumerable odds, sleepless nights and risky financial letters to get this creation to us. A lot of heart and soul went into its design and that is easily detected by the sheer amount of illustrative detail into its artwork from the opening scene of the game right down to the very last scene.There is 2 tally boards one which calculates the high scores which requires you to not only collect all the gems and special items in each level, but also to do it in the quickest time. The other tally board simply just calculates the time it takes you to get through each level using all of ZZ's special powers.The biggest problem with the game to me is that the main protagonist really had no charisma about him, other than the fact that he knows how to blow things up. There are no corny one liners, no grandad jokes, no catch phrases or larrikin emotions which make him loveable. It’s like you control a cardboard cut-out with a rocket launcher attached. Likewise I had no invested emotions with Marlene his girlfriend and would have been more than happy to have dropped her pursuit at a drop of a hat. I tried desperately to convince Zack to swing the space ship back to his home world, plant his manly cardboard cut-out arms around his blonde assistant and sweep her away on a honey moon to a land free from Giant lobsters. Even the bad guys got more of a sensitive aww isn’t he cute out of me more than any of the good guys did. Hell even the invincible dodo chickens got more of a emotional response out of me than the main character did.In final, a really stress free ‘let’s cause carnage’ platformer that leaves itself open for a sequel. If there is going to be a sequel then I want three things in it. 1) I want it not to take the developers 5 years. 2) Since a crocodile took my girlfriend, can we keep it Australian and have a dingo take my child? And 3) The Dodo Chickens in the game seem more invincible than my super powers can I pick them up and throw them around the place like a grenade at all the bosses in the game. Thank you for making the game. Thank you for reading the review.The below video is of me playing the first level and in it i demonstrate how indestructible those dodo chickens are.

												I bought this game while it was on 90% discount sale. A really good 99 cents investment. Zack Zero is an excellent platformer with graphics color palette similar to sudeki with character movement similar to earthworm jim. The game has some decent cutscenes although the voice-over isnt as good as i would have appreciated; however not bad. +Good Graphics for a 820MB game+Fluid gameplay, no lag, no jitters unless youre in contact with enemies+Earth, Fire and ice power morphs for gameplay variety+Hidden locations with hidden items for a slight challenge giving it a slight puzzle game feeling+Cutscenes with voice-over/narration+Automatic checkpoint saves so no issues  if your character falls off the platform/dies or you quit abruptly+Fictional Alien planet exploration+No game-bugs experienced in my time spent playing this game on my system which isnt really ""latest""-Voice-over sub-par-Linear Storyline and slightly cliched-The hidden levels and puzzle attempts are rather simple. Slightly more complicated situations would have been nice. -Powers recharge very quickly so theres less strategizing on budgeting power usage. Its more about using variety of powers to get a better scoreThe cons mentioned arent really cons in my opinion. Ive just laid them out for those expecting those aspects.This review is strictly my opinion. I will definitely recommend this game especially when on sale. It has a very nostalgic feel to it and is a lot of fun. "

												I can recommend this game. Reminds me a lot of the old Jump & Runs I played as a small child back in the 90s.If you don't expect lots of story like in the Trine games this is a really good Jump & Run. Reminded me a bit of Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, the first game I ever played. There you're stranded on a foreign planet and are looking for your loved ones too.			"

												It looks fantastic for a budget title. It's mainly a 2d platformer, but it has some neat 3d effects going on. The game is very unoriginal. I still had fun playing through the game which lasted around 5 hours to finish. The checkpoints are very generous, especially for the bosses. This one is more geared for the younger crowd. There were some graphical glitches. I've played worse.			"

												I've tried to play it for an hour or so. It's a great looking game, easy to pick up. I'd actually like to complete it, but the controls feel awkward to me, and cannot be modified from the keyboard setup defaults.It's obviously an XBox port, as the controls are shown via an xbox controller, and I am certain that this game would be MUCH more enjoyable if you have one you can plug into your PC to play this one with.

												If you're looking for a AAA storyline and impressive cinematic quality cut scenes, or even decent humor, forget about it.  However, as craptacular as the narration, which comes off more like story time in the kids section of the book store, it starts to fall in to that ""so bad it's good"" category.  The plot is flimsier than dollar store toiler paper, but that's what makes it funny.  It feels like it was written by a grade schooler, and the character designs reflect a lot of those same sensibilities.  The gameplay is your typical run and gun platformer ala Megaman X8/9.  I use that example specifically because the different powers enable you to reach certain areas, depending on what you're trying to achieve.The models and environments are fairly well detailed, so I think I would've liked to have seen more in-engine cutscenes as opposed to the concept storyboards and  would've liked to have had a voice attached to the comm notifications.All that said, I paid a buck for this and got a lot more than that in value.    Zack Zero shows a lot of promise, but go in it for the old school run and jump gamplay of the nintendo era, and try to not cringe too much at the storyline or the narrator's booming voice.Other games like this would be Rochard and Shank.

												I started playing this game without expecting too much: it had a somewhat troubled development and it wasn't getting great reviews. But if you withstand some of it's quirks, it's actually a very enjoyable platformer, with nice voice acting (though sparse), cool cartoon cutscenes and some really impressive levels. Oh, and the music is pretty good too.It took me about 4 hours to finish it and I didn't find all the secrets, so it has a nice length and I didn't feel the game was padded by using the same tricks over and over. It manages to keep it fresh by using several environmental traps, cool bosses and some neat retro references here and there.Overall, I think it has some flaws, but it's still a nice platformer on the PC (and there are not many with this style here). I hope Crocodile could make a sequel, so that they could polish some of the rough edges. If you crave for some oldschool jump-n-shootin' on your PC, this could meet your needs!			"

												I was very surprised when I fired up this game after owning it for many years and feeling like it was a less than mediocre platform game.  After getting into it I found the controls fluid and the gameplay to be rather fun.  The story is about you saving your girlfriend from an alien kidnapper.  You travel through different levels that look like different world fighting similar looking enemies in hopes to save her.This is the part I don't like.  You get all of your powers from the beginning.  There is no slow accumulation of new skils.  This really kills the character development and puzzling progression.  However, it is still a fun game nonetheless.  You can be ice and freeze enemies, fire and burn enemies, rock which allows you to break parts of the level, or just yourself with a normal standard blade.Overall, I will recommend this because it is a really good indie game that should be played at least once for the fun of it.

												Nice overlooked gem. I got it for something like 99 cents, so it's up there with Marlow Briggs in price:fun ratio. I have no idea what people are complaining about with the controls. It plays brilliantly. The music is soaring and cinematic. The graphics are excellent. The suit-changing mechanic is brilliant and intuitive.But I think the developers made a big mistake with the artistic direction. Frankly, if this were anime themed like Megaman, or had bags of genuine artistic character like Rayman, people would be salivating over it left right and centre. As it is, the hero is some generic 90s cartoon type, and it just has a bad-euro feel to the design. The UI screens are hideous too. If it looked like a Konami or Capcom game, I swear it wouldn't be 99 cents bargain bin material. It's not the gameplay, because it sure plays like a lost classic from one of those companies.Didn't ruin it for me though, really fun game.			"

												Zack Zero hearkens back to the late 80s, early 90s when Saturday morning cartoons and cheesy platforming mascots reigned supreme. The platforming is decent although doesn't provide much challenge.  The graphics, music and overall production quality are very good for an indie platformer, although you will experience some bugs.  The most common bug I experienced were the sound fx cutting out at some points.  Lastly, the last level and ending of the game just scream that they didn't have the resources to properly finish the game.   It really left me with a negative last impression of the game; but all things considered it was an enjoyable experience and worth picking up if you can get it for a buck or two.			"

												Quite fun platformer with very decent graphic. Unlike Trine where you control in-turn 3 characters, you only control one but he can swap form when fighting enemies or maneuvering through the levels. Later you can also allocate skill points to invent your own fighting style ala Diablo 2. Not original design, of course, but it's quite well made. Graphic is full with vibrant color and background level is detailed enough - something that must be appreciated.But frankly I find the narration, storyline (to save  this thing and that?) and voice acting a bit cheesy, but err... not a big deal. Hacking and slashing are more important.Metacritic is definitely too off 56 for this kind of game seriously?If you're a fan of platformer you'll definitely like the game. And it's been bundled several times so quite cheap on the market. Recommended game.			"

												Just a short review as a warning: stay clear from this one! Not for the gameplay - it actually looks good and plays great - but for the technical shortcomings, which are all too plenty. Just check the discussions going on: loads of people are having trouble with this game. Many of them can't get it started, or need quite some complicated action to get it running. This is technically not a finished product - anyway not on Steam, right now. Maybe ""early access"", and even then. Is Valve getting overwhelmed a bit by the plethora of new idie-games coming out so that they can't keep up to their usual high technical standards? Let's hope not....As for me: this game managed to crash to a blue screen of death and a hard reboot three times in a row, after which I gave up on it. And yes, I do have a very stable system with crashes almost non-existent, certainly no hard reboots.So unfortunately, I cannot really speak of the gameplay. For the 20 minutes of so I managed to be in-game, it looked pretty funny, with lots of action, good graphics, and quite some humour. Alas, technical issues ruined this one for me.Overall rating: 2/10 (possible 7/10 or higher if the technicall issues were not there).Sad, really.			"

												In a nutshell: if you like the game's visuals and platformers as genre, buy it.  (If you can get it from bundle or on sale, it's actually a great deal.)Little longer: Zack Zero is a classic platformer: linear levels with secrets, enemies to defeat, and coins - in this case green disks? to collect. There is a little tweak: Zack has his human + 3 elemental-imbued form, each with different abilities (faster, can surf in air, slow but great defense) besides 2 activable abilities. In combat each of them can be useful, but managing over the map and storyline or reaching certain spots (and secrets) you need to use specific abilities.  These features are good additions to the gameplay, but nothing broundbreaking or really new here.The game is quite family friendly: there is absolutely no blood or gore in the game - robot enemies explode, others just ""shatter"". You can watch it in the game's trailer. It's like a saturday morning's superhero cartoon.Positives and negatives + Nice graphics with beautiful elemental power effects+ Enjoyable gameplay: platforming not too hard (experienced players will find it rather easy), and there are lots of checkpoints (not indicated ingame)+ Cool-looking cartoon animation to the storytelling between levels+ Easy achievements: can be done in 1 walkthough, or artifact collecting by ""select level"" option.- Bugs (RARELY) : Not as bug-ridden as older reviews claim, but there are some clipping issues with animation. In my 26 hours of gameplay ( ~ 1.5 walkthrough) I found one platform I kept falling through when tried to jump from, and one wall I stuck in it. Second can be considered as game-breaking, had to exit to main menu then continue from prev checkpoint. Lost ~ 5 minutes of game, nothing serious. -You start with your suit at level 20, then it gets downgraded to level 1. You see each abilities with power levels decrease, losing powers. Yet during the game your suit levels up, but you can't check/there is no indicators, for when will you get  for example the stone spikes power.- And sadly a real pain: at certain points denied backtracing. Platforms cease to exist backwards, you fall somewhere and can't climb back, things like this. But there is a ""select level"" option at main menu, so you shouldn't be troubled if you're going for maximising points or collecting artifacts.- I don't remember which one, but one boss fight was just plain terrible: the camera focus is glitched or something, I had to fight while being outside of the screen. As there is 3 or 4 checkpoints even in bossfights, it's not that hard, just a really awkward situation.			"

												This is a cool game, especially for kids. It's simple and enjoyable.No death penalties. Die as often as you like. You'll respawn at the nearest checkpoint and there are plenty of checkpoints.You have 4 different powers. Fire, Ice, Earth Powers and your normal attacks. You'll gain stronger powers every few levels.The story is a bit weak but it's alright.But here is the big problem which turns the review into a negative one: It's unplayabale due to crashes. A few people experienced crashes at the first level and could solve it with turning off steam ingame overlay and steam cloud for this game. Some needed to tweak the .CFG file.In my case nothing worked so far. I'm half through the game and it crashes every time at the same spot. TL;DR Good game but unplayable due to crashes.			"

												Decent enough concept.  Zack has three different suit powers (along with the normal mode), which you have to use to platform and fight enemies.  The problem is that the suit powers are barely used in-game.  There's a few times when I had to switch over, but I generally saw little reason to switch from normal, especially since it can easily defeat most enemies and doesn't use energy.  Combat in general is just a bore, especially when the game makes you fight mini-bosses multiple times with no changes.  There is some decent platforming in here, and a few moments where I found myself having fun with that, but overall, this is just mediocre.			"

												This game shows flashes of awesome, but those brief positive bits are brought down by bad controls, poor level design, and a lack of polish. The four different suit types and their different mechanics are very interesting, similar to something like Trine where the level puzzles are built around different abilities at different moments. The controls are sluggish and sometimes inconsistent. I caught my character grabbing the ledge in one case, and completely missing it when running into it in another. The enemies can move in 3D space, but you're stuck on a 2D space. That makes for some really confusing combat moments where you think you hit an enemy, but you actually didn't and take damage from them instead. Overall, it just feels like a game that could have benefitted by a good bit of polish and different design perspectives.			"

												Zack Zero is your average side scrolling action game with some platforming elements.  It isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't do anything to stand out.  It has good level design, some interesting platforming, and a bit of variety in combat.  You upgrade your suit as you go along to make you more powerful, and unlock different abilities for the four suit types (normal, rock, fire, and ice).  This gives the game a bit of a MegaMan feel to it.Graphics and sound are good.  The game runs fine on my PC with no issues.  On a side note, I have read others having issues with controls, I have not.  I do however use a 360 controller so I don't know what difference that may make.  All in all, if you enjoy side scrolling action games with platforming elements and a sprinkle of mega man weapon variety thrown in, pick this up.			"

Hit detection is awful, the controls are inconsistent (sometimes I can double jump, sometimes not, sometimes I can grab ledges, not always), the recycled enemies are absolutely dull, the level design is pointless ( ""puzzles"" consisted of moving obvious blocks onto obvious platforms), the story is absolutely atrocious and uninspired, the psuedo-3d gimmick (you and enemies could move into the foreground and background) worked against me half the time as I couldn't hit enemies who were hitting me, the dialogue is straight out of an underfunded kid's animation movie, not to mention the ""cinematic"" and dull soundtrack... ugh.I'd give it flak for the infinite lives, but that's the only thing that kept me going to completion, and what with the awful hit detection and controls it's a blessing.  It was never particularly hard, but there were very few deaths where I feel I screwed up and wasn't just cheated by the game.There were a few things that went well, however.  The level design, however plain, did only leave me at a confused halt twice, one of them was because the game bugged and I couldn't progress in the lava area.  The abilities did feel satisfying enough to use, watching enemies or the environment either freeze or explode.  That's... about it.Oh, and minor spoiler here, but the ending leaves off in a CLIFFHANGER.  They were confident enough in this game to leave space for a direct sequel.  Good lord.Edit:  Forgot to mention that the game stuttered in many places and had low framerate issues regularly for seemingly no reason, not like this is a graphically intense game.			"

												oh man, one of the worst sidescrolling games i've played..only buy it if its 2$ or lessthere's so much bug and glitches, while walking you'll suddenly fall off a cliff or get stuck inside a wall or a boulder, happened to me like 5x and that's just the 1st stage which is very short.. imagine the longer stagesthe game does not offer invincibility when knocked down by enemy and you cannot regain or recover from knockdown while on air or on the ground, in short an enemy can keep on hitting you while you're knockdown or keep on using the same skill that sends you high up the ground in a knockdown state until you're dead..gets too repetitive im only on the 2nd stage and im bored already.. waste..much like crash bandicoot only worse			"

												Zack Zero is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you plan to just play through it like a standard platformer (which, to be frank, it is - it's Yet Another Bland Indie Platformer With a Gimmick), don't, because the platforming is in no way good, and the aforementioned gimmick is somehow worse. Zack turns into three alternate forms! Ice, Fire, Earth. Now, IF you want to play it by ""its rules"", you're going to swap these constantly because higher score comes from raising ""combo"" by swapping damage types between each attack. The problem is that doing this will chew through your too-small energy meter, so you can basically only get off two or three before forcefully transforming back into Zack Prime or whatever the hell his base form is called.Let me tell you why the actual mechanics are bad, though: You begin the game as a superpowered wunderkind and then at the end of the first stage, you're knocked on the head and are suddenly Level♥♥♥♥♥ like a later Metroid game. The problem is that ZZ's stages are straight up left-to-right platforming levels, so instead of finding your powers to get cool again, you need collectables. Rareware-level collectables. Each single green dot is some XP! It's less fun than it sounds. The powers, as a result, go from having cool moves and tricks to all suddenly being one-hit-wonders (fire has a hover which you use to clear too-long gaps, ice can slow time to get under too-fast crushers, earth can't jump but HULK SMASHES open rocks beneath you and also is used every time there's a lever because you're too ♥♥♥♥ing weak to pull a lever without rocks on you?? no really).The levels aren't fun. Period. Only fire has a reliable homing attack (which chews up energy, so you only get 2, maybe 3 off without becoming Zack again) so all the flying enemies are gonna clown on you while you try taking them out, or perhaps the platform beneath you will collapse while you try shooting down the dude who's gonna dive-bomb you mid-leap. I would legitimately argue that Super Mario Bros. (1!) has better platforming and level design than this game, if that tells you anything. Obstacles come in two varieties: ""easily ignored"" or ""KILL AT ALL COSTS"", and sometimes it's hard to tell the latter because they look like the not-entirely-3D backgrounds and will come out to wreck you. Oh, also, sometimes the platforms follow the same rule! Have fun telling which random chunk of rock in the caves is supposed to be walk-onable or will drop you to the two-second death FMV for the 500th time. (Yes there is a death cutscene. Dragon's Lair as ♥♥♥♥.)Don't buy Zack Zero, it's not a good platformer, or a good score-attack game, or really ""good"" at all. It's complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you don't have a controller (I did, for the record!) the keyboard controls are the most spiteful I've ever seen for a game that needs nothing but arrow keys, ""switch forms"", and action buttons.

												Could have been a good gameFirst the good points:nice graphicssome interesting puzzlesmain character has interesting abilitiesNow for the bad:enemies are horrible, there are a few of the lesser enemies hanging around each level but nowhere near enough to provide a satisfying combat experience, bosses are equally horrid with a very simplistic ""CHARGE"" aicombat is annoying, mainly because of how long the charcter animations are, get hit and you have to wait almost a second before being able to respond, similarly trying to change tactics and alternate attacks during combat is uselessit is a 2d game but with an awkward 3rd dimension tacked on where your character  moves in the 3rd plane depending on their position in the world, makes it easy to miss jumps and fall off the world (and die)Overall the game's problems more than offsets what it offers in entertainment value.

												This game looks great, but that's about the only thing good about this game.The platforming itself is doesn't feel right at all, it feels wonky and not very responsive. Can't tell you how many times it was a struggle jumping from platform to platform.  The game I feel would've been done better if it was in 3D form platforming instead. The voice acting is laughably bad, the story is about as generic as it gets. Good guy save girl from evil aliens, like that hasn't been done enough times. Overall spend your money on something else instead.			"

No graphic settings just  the resolution .  It is  A NIGHMARE to play  whit a K&M option ,but the game detects only x box 360 controller ,so if you dont have a 360 PC contollere you are ♥♥♥♥... You can use some x box 360  controll emulators  form the internet like me ,if you really want to ,there are 1-2 free ones to get and they work nice I really dont like giving bad Reviews,but whit this game i really have to ,I hardly played maybe 30 -60 min ,dont remember really now  I just dont recomend this game to any one,especially to casual  ppl like me .

												A very suspicious title considering the similarities to the Mega Man series of games. Regardless, this game was no doubt made for console, and then ported to PC, as the controls are very confusing on a keyboard, but one can see how simple they would be on a controller. If you are going to play this on Steam I recommend using a gamepad or controller. As for the gameplay, it is a 2.5d scroller that is, surprise, very similar to Mega Man. You go through levels collecting powerups, using your suits different powers until you get to the end boss. All the while you are platforming. There is nothing special about this game, in my opinion.			"

												Believe it or not, this is the first bipolar game I've ever encountered. It looks so great in every single demo clip but it changes in an instant the second you start playing it. It has nice graphics and soundtrack but that's all it has. All the other good things you see are an illusion. The gameplay is dull, the level design is kinda meh and the controls are BAD. Really BAD. Swapping powers system seems to have a mind of its own and it often decides to activate another power than the one needed, the powers go off and on randomly and if you get to use them, the controls will be laggy and you will have huge delays between the time you press the button and the actual action. And unfortunately the controls are chunky on both, keyboard and controller. This being said, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. So I'm gonna give it only 5/10 potatoes and I'm gonna keep the other 5 for me to make some French fries.			"

												Zack Zero is a game for an obvious young child target audience, although some of the content is questionable, the story is narrated and designed for children roughly under the age of 10.  The visuals are quite good and the characters designs as well are something out of a saturday morning cartoon. The game's platforming isn't bad with the multiple forms you can transform into offering a variety of ways to progress (some forced), and although easy, it keeps in mind its target audience. The combat is also easy, and can be summarized by pressing attack and letting the lock on do its work, it takes essentially no skill but does allow the game to be accessible again to the very young demographic. Dying also seems to be of minimal penalty, further lending to the genre, which is made to be accessible.  The drawbacks to this game are twofold, the first are that there are some technical issues and even I got frames per second drops occasionally without any apparent cause and the second is that if you are outside of this game's target demographic you likely will not enjoy the experience. That being said, if you are looking for a platformer for your child under 10, this game is a decent choice.			"

												From what I hear this game is under 5 hours which really sucks because it is so good but I suppose since I paid $1.50 for it I will get my money's worth. Not sure why its review status is ""mixed"". I think a lot of people are having technical problems with it. Sorry to hear that. I have 1.5hrs so far and I had one glitch where I was jumping around in a pit and my guy disappeared and the controls froze in place but the game was still going. Was weird but what was cool was that it allowed me to go to the main menu and reload the game to fix it and what was even cooler is that it started me right about 5 seconds before that part when I continued my game so it was no big deal. The graphics are good, the effects are great, sounds and music good, and combat is fluid and fun. The only issue I've had with the controls so far is that movement while in-air is a bit too touchy. Often times I am trying to land on a platform but I touch left or right and I fall past it and die. So I often have to jimmy the stick back and forth to land a jump right just like in a old SNES game, but it is not too bad and not really much of a problem, especially since checkpoints are generous. All of the elements are cool and work well: fire, ice, and earth, and whatever the normal power is called. I don't exactly know what the benefits of switching elements in combat to get a higher score are, so I just mainly use my normal powers to fight and don't really give much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥as long as I can still progress through the game normally. It isn't rocket science people.Very fun all the way through, a real shame it has to be so short. 8/10			"

												So, this game surprised me. I was pretty much expecting an uninspired Ben 10 clone or so.While the story and the cutscenes are absolute crap (they should have contracted an good artist for the cutscene pictures and a writer for a better story) the gameplay is actually good, and the powers are a bit original so it results in an okay plataform with good exploring.Would recommend on offer.

												It's a pretty fun game. The graphics are great and the game play is entertaining. You get 3 different elements to use in addition to your normal outfit. You can use the different outfits to unlock secret areas and damage enemies easier.Time flew by the first 25 minutes until the game crashed after completing the first level. Literally after I walked through the gateway after beating the first boss it crashed. I restarted my PC and that resolved the issue. I began playing the second level and went into a tight location to destroy a box. When I moved to the side of the box I got caught in the wall. The story isn't the greatest but it does add to the game and the gameplay makes up for it.Even with the bugs I've experienced in the beginning, I would say go for this game. It's enjoyable and you can get caught up in it. Because of the bugs so far (and I imagine there will be many more based on 30 minutes of play) I would say wait until this game is on sale for about $5 or you can get it in a bundle. I got this game in a grab bag bundle and would deffinitely say it was worth it so far.			"

												- TAKE ITI didn't expected too much from this game when i got it, but since it is/was at a very cheap price I got it, and I don't regret it! It's just AMAZING, it's funny, there is action, lovely enemies (if you like crocodiles) a fabolous environment and you can controll the elements! each one have it's own features and by using your mind (and the suggestion that your partner give to you time to time) you lear how to use them to go on. It made my mood raise up, I warmly suggest to buy it!!!!			"

												I can't understand how I never heard about Zack Zero.  It plays great and looks awesome..  The controls are very fluid.  Creative in its design and execution.  Superficially very Trine-like but isn't so physics oriented.  Lots of fun if you like cool platformers.This game is well worth  regular price, but you'll feel guilty getting it on sale for only $.99!Do it!			"

												7/10.Actually a fun platformer with a story (speech, some videos). Nice graphics, sometimes you can move in 2.5D... some nice mini and levelbosses... secrets to discover, achievements... also the duration to complete was decent. Importantly, the autosave feature is very fair... all gems you get before dying are saved, you just need to replay a small area...Recommended for the price.			"

												If you dont mind bugs and glitches (crashing: can be fixed with guides on community pages and visual ones i wasnt able to fix - fire and similar effects can blur most of the screen for time they are activated) game is quite fun. Its easy so dont expect challenging platformer here, but for casual players its time well spent. For low priced platformer its worth the buy if you get it during discount.			"

												Metacritics are sometimes too hard on some games. If this one deserves a mere 50%, so no 2D Mario title could ever hit better than 25 or 30%. Yes it's an old school platformer and of course it doesn't have the graph of a new gen title but heh, it's 10 bucks not 50. You want a good old fashioned plateformer with a Ratchet & Clankesque childish look? So don't hesitate any longer.			"

												Steam should really think about adding neutral option for reviews, because that's what I would use in this case. Zack Zero have both good and bad sides. In my opinion, platformer elements in this title are great. I don't remember when was last time that I had this much fun playing mix of 3D and 2D game. Moments when you need to use different powers to move up faster, slow time, use super strenght to destroy something - those are really cool and enjoyable. Level designs are really well made, I didn't even once though that something is boring or plain. Collectables and stuff is hidden really well, but not that kind where you can't find anything without guides. As platform game, Zack Zero scores really high on my list. And yet, sadly, Zack Zero is not platformer game alone. There is action too, which is this bad side of it. Fighting every enemy was pain for me, and so the boss fights. While special forces worked fine for me in platform elements, I rarely used them in fighting - mostly at times when I was forced to. There is one more thing than can be good side for ones, and bad for others. While playing this game and watching Zack, I felt like this could be a Ben 10 game. Did devs were inspired by it? The story isn't anything great, the ending didn't make much sense and characters weren't interesting at all. And still for some reason, it could be great hit among kids as show - just like Ben 10, or similar to it cartoons.I don't mind setting like that but greatly done platform mixed with boring action makes me wonder what kind of review should it be. Good one, or maybe bad? I know one thing: I don't regret playing it for platformer elements alone. It's really mixed bag so if you are curious about this game, wait for some sale.			"
