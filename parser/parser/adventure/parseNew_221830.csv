												These guys just gets it. After playing so many ""meh"" adventures, and i'm an adventuregame lover, my favorites the last years is the  ""Book of unwritten tales"" games. They do the pop culture thing soo right, and the humour is great, which others do alot in an excessive forced way, like Sam & Max, even though i like those one too. Graphics are great, voicing are great. This one, after just 20 mins after playing,  i knew it was a GREAT adventure game. Really recommended it for adventurelovers.			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles is a fairly amusing point-and-click adventure. Much of the artwork flows like an oil painting plus the animations give it an extra level of depth and personality. It is obvious the writers and voice actors had a lot of fun in their roles. The game puts several Star Wars parodies in the storyline as well as a few references to Portal. With two characters to control it's almost like playing two stories in one.Overall, it's a mildly funny game that doesn't get overly difficult.			"

												I am a big fan of the the original Book of Unwritten Tales and Critter Chronicles is certainly not a terrible game as adventure games go, but the thumb indicates whether I recommended it (not that it's an outright bad game!) and I unfortunately I just can't recommend Critter Chronicles - mainly due to the puzzle quality.  The original game keeps a nice balance between the puzzles being relatively intuitive, yet not quite so blatantly obvious that there's nothing to it.  Generally I could always figure out what needed to be done once I found the right items, without resorting to much trial and error.  Critter Chronicles, however, strays a bit too far into the territory of some of the more egregious 90s adventure game leaps of logic where the solution is stumbled upon only by exhausting all possible options.  More than likely at some point will need to resort to the process of trying to use every item on every other item and hotspot - which is made even more frustrating by having to rather slowly transfer items between two characters, one at a time.Forgetting the puzzles, the game still retains much of the charm of BoUT.  It's still well acted (though Critter's ""dialog"" did start to grate on me as the game went on) and nice to look at, but the cast and overall scope of the game is much reduced compared to BoUT.  It comes out feeling a bit thin as a result.To a certain extent it seems perhaps a bit unfair to hold it up to the standards of the excellent original BoUT, but that's naturally what one would compare it against, since Critter Chronicles is presumably meant for fans of BoUT.  The bottom line is unfortunately that all but the most fanatical of BoUT fans could safely skip Critter Chronicles without feeling like they missed out.  I don't regret playing the game, but knowing what I do now, I wouldn't regret having skipped it either.			"

												Although The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles was released later than The Book of Unwritten Tales, it's actually the prequel of the series. However, it's significantly shorter than its sequel. Nevertheless, I found its puzzles and story much better and enjoyable.The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles is definitely not even close to a masterpiece but it's still a quite decent point-and-click game.

												There's at least one critical crash bug in this game which can prevent you from progressing, and which hasn't been fixed despite being reported on the Steam forums (http://steamcommunity.com/app/221830/discussions/0/846947320671653509/#p1) and the King Art game forums (http://forum.kingart-games.com/index.php/topic,11586.0.html) for a long while now. Clearly the publisher Nordic Games and/or the devs are not proactive in seeking out problems and helping players.Regarding the game itself (I eventually managed to get past the crash point), I didn't enjoy it as much as the original TBoUT. Puzzles are more difficult and felt more far-fetched, and I had to use a walkthrough several times, whereas remember having to use one maybe once for the original. On top of that the main character is unlikeable and overstays his welcome, and some of the jokes felt cruel or out of place. In the end it was kind of enjoyable to play with some funny moments, but definitely not a top-notch experience like TBoUT.			"

												I must admit, I approached this game with skepticism. I absolutely loved The Book of Unwritten Tales, but the Critter parts? Not so funny. I never really enjoyed controlling this non speaking character, always having to guess what I might be saying, after a couple of minutes I always got bored or irritated. But this spin-off (and prequel), The Criiter Chronicles? Don't ask me why, but it totally works. The story is simple but entertaining, in this game we finally understand WHAT is Critter. Part of an alien race crashed on the planet, we have to help him and his mates get a crucial part of their ship back from the... evil, for lack of a better term, Munkus. We will also meet again some of the characters from Unwritten Tales, like Ma'zaz, discover how Critter became friend with Nate and visit many locations of the previous game. Dialogues are funny and full of pop culture references, puzzles aren't extremely hard, but a couple of moments may be really challenging if you don't pay attention to your surroundings. Plus, a Portal (as in the Valve franchise) based puzzle? Yes, please!The Critter Chronicles is a solid game. Not extraordinary, but surely interesting and rewarding to play. Even if there are a lot of references to the previous game, it is completely possible to play one without having played the other, the two adventures are totally indipendent. Nice game.			"

												TLDR: Get it if you liked the previous game, but only on saleThe GoodThe game is cute and funny with likable characters.It shows the backstory of how Nate and Critter met.There is a hard difficulty mode if you want to make the puzzles a bit harderThe BadIt's short.Very few screens, so there is lots of backtracking between the same screens which gets annoying.Most of the puzzles are unintuitive, forcing you to go the route of clicking / talking / combining everything until something moves you along.The character switches and passing inventory between them is poorly executed. This was done better in Day of the Tentacle back in the 90s. The makers of Critter Chronicles know about DOTT, since there is a reference to it in the game.Speaking of, there are way too many pop culture references in the game, replacing actual humor and not really fitting in with the setting established in the previous game			"

												A terrific humorous adventure, with graphics sort of like finely detailed blown glass (though they do look considerably coarser when zoomed in, which isn't often).  The puzzles are quite a bit harder than the original Book of Unwritten Tales (which is welcome since it was a tad too easy), but this one has the same great writing and humor that made the first game so dang lovable.  Critter Chronicles is a lot shorter, though, but that's to be expected since it is more of a side story than a full game.			"

												Let me start by saying that I like both ""The Book of Unwritten Tales 1"" and TBoUT2 a lot and wholeheartedly recommend them both. However, that is not the case with ""TBoUT: the Critter Chronicles"" which feels like a failed experiment, prior TBoUT2, for testing various game concepts.The two difficulty options ""normal"" and ""hard"" causes far too complicated puzzles on the harder setting. Other puzzles gets harder by having all spoken clues removed. The normal setting is playable but sometimes a puzzle just ""ends"" without any visible progress feedback since the ""hard part"" has been cut.The gibberish speak from Critter itself overstays its welcome fairly rapidly and I quickly tried to maximize the playtime using captain Nate. The other two playable characters from TBoUT1/2 Wilbur Weatherwane and Ivo, are unfortunately not present.Essentially the Critter Chronicles feels much more unpolished and rushed in comparison to TBoUT1 and 2.

												Overall, I like the series.  Critter Chronicles is fun, and reminds me of classic point click games I played as a kid.  The problem with the game, and a reason I wouldn't recommend the game, is to those who have little patience for unfixed bugs.   This game will crash at the Yeti cave, and there is no way around it.  So basically you can only play half way.  The original ""Book of unwritten tails (BoUT): part 1"" had a bug where I had to load someone elses game in order to continue playing, which defeats the purpose, but the bright side is... I could actually finish BoUT: 1.  No matter how nice BoUT: critter chronicles is, the fact that I can't continue playing it after the yeti cave kind of destroys the credibility of a game.Update:  I posted the original review Nov 19, 2014.  It is currently May 17, 2016. No one has contacted me or commented on this review to inform ""me/other forums"" as of why this yeti crash continues to occur.  It could be because I have an updated Windows (10), but they have no interest in their buyers or helping anyone out with these issues in the games. So, this also gets me to be very skeptical on considering ""Book of Unwritten Tales 2.""  Which by the way, also has complaints about many bugs when you look up their reviews/forums. This is the only reason why I did not purchase it immediately.   Just Sad.			"

												This game serves as a prequel to The Book of Unwritten Tales.Pros: It appears that the developer used the same engine, so the interface is identical to the first game in the series.  Beautiful backdrops, excellent animation, beautiful soundtrack, great voice acting, fun puzzles, lovable characters.  They fixed the bug with inventory slow down.  Steam achievements!  Additional replay value with expert mode.Cons: I LOVE having a story centered around Critter, but by the end I was quite annoyed by Critter's inability to comunicate in the common tongue.Summary: I highly recommend both games in this series!  I am also looking forward to the sequel, The Book of Unwritten Tales II.			"

Still a decent game for an afternoon or two, especially if you're a fan of the first TBoUT. Doesn't advance the story in the least (everything actually takes place before Nate meets Ivo and Wilbur) so you can play it or skip it, whatever.			"

												Well. It's very better than The book of Unwritten Tales.It has difficulty level for the riddles. You can still turn on the Show Points so you won't have pixel hunting even in HARD mode.But the riddles are difficult enough in front of the first part of the series.If you play the game in normal mode you 'll have more hints by the characters and you 'll miss a couple of riddles. Generally the game does NOT change much. So play it at hard anyway!The graphics are about the same with the difference of the settings. You don't have complicated settings like AA Anisotropic or Antialiasing. You choose between smoothness and Picture quality and that's it.  Well in the first part the antialising thing mattered . I had it in 8X. Here the differences are small to nothing. Try ""Low"" in smoothness and ""Medium"" in picture quality. The last one sets the textures sent to the graphic card. If set to the best it will sent uncompressed textures directly to the graphics card so even the best cards may NOT handle some scenes and you ll have glitches. You have more vivid colors but the difference is that and ONLY that. So set it to medium and enjoy the game with more earth colors. The graphics are 3D Indie so the colors are vivid enough anyway.I wasn't amazed by the story BUT is better than the fisrt part and you have the critter to break the ice and makes you laugh. But still is better from the first. I enjoyed this game much MORE than the first one.All the others like sounds , story , characters and more.... Come on.. You play an adventure and NOT the final episode of Call of Duty or other game to see things in Reality. We have imagination as players and all the game things are MORE than OK.To all adventurers... Put the difficulty to Hard and FLY. You'll love it!			"

Short version: 80%The prequel of Book of Unwritten Tales is shorter, a little more desolate, but has a tighter pace and most importantly, more Critter! It doesn’t exactly reach the same level of excellence as BoUT did, but it’s still a fun little adventure game.Long version:Critter Chronicles was created to fix the greatest error in the first Book of Unwritten Tales: not enough Critter. It also serves as a prequel, telling the tale of how Critter and Nate met and eventually wound up as the two hapless travelling companions you found in the clutches of an ork bounty huntress.As a game it functions more or less as an expansion pack: it’s about half as short, features only three main locations, and two controllable characters. Luckily the humour remained, albeit in much smaller doses.The shortness is compensated by increased difficulty, including a larger dependence on character switching. The helpful hotspots remained, but even that is not enough to brute-force your way through everything.The levels are less detailed– mostly because most of the game takes place on a desolate iceland– and there are very huge chunks where the designers just used high-resolution 2D images instead of elaborate 3D models. Since the engine is the same, the clipping issues remained too, but maybe they are a bit more frequent than they should be.These mistakes don’t turn Critter Chronicles into a bad game, far from it, but they make it recommended mostly for those who are familiar with the original Book of Unwritten Tales.

												So what to say about this game? I have to agree with other reviewers here and say that while this game has some gorgeous visuals, having 3 chapters out of 5 taking place in the same 4-5 screens hurts  the game significantly. Especially when the puzzles in those chapters are the least intuitive in the game. For example the chapter in which you get to play Critter for the first time - I wasn't really sure what I was trying to achieve so I spent a lot of time running from screen to screen interacting with everything I could. The solutions aren't as farfetched here as I felt they were in Deponia though. Maybe I'm just generally dense.As for the story, I still enjoyed it very much even though it is fairly classic. I was especially delighted by some of the references and I laughed at every altercation Nate and Zazi had.Would I recommend this game? If you are a fan of BoUT and this game happens to be on sale, I'd say you should buy it. It is playable without a walkthrough. Otherwise, just play the original BoUT. You won't really miss anything.

												Nice setting, fun characters, good flavor texts as you explore the world.The story is a bit meh, but that is not this game's downfall -- it's the puzzles and bugs.The puzzles are probably the most unintuitives I've seen in an adventure game. Luckily, your options are limited enough that you can exhaust your options and solve them by trial and error. But that doesn't feel rewarding at all. And that's the case with I'd say 3/4 of the puzzles, or more.The game has a few major bugs that probably won't ever get fixed. The 2 biggest ones are one that makes the game crash at a certain point (there's a workaround that worked for me and others posted in the forums), and one that corrupts your savefile if you save at the wrong screen. So make sure you check the forums so you know what to be prepared for if you play this game.TL;DR: Despite its good parts, I can't recommend this game. If you have it in your library and are already a fan of the series, you might as well try it, but don't be afraid to use a guide every now and then. Just make sure you interact with everything to see how the characters react -- that's where most of the fun lies.			"

												This wasn't really as connected as the first game. It's stand-alone, it doesn't really matter which one you play first. The puzzles in this one, however, are ridiculous. They're mish-mashed together and not intuitive at all. I found myself ""cheating"" (looked up the answers on Google) because I was annoyed, but wanted to finish the story line. It was really a slog. There were a lot of sexist ""jokes"", too, which fell flat and seemed forced. It wasn't as distracting in the first game. I get that the Nate character is this ne'er do well who turns into a hero despite himself, but it was just tedious.			"

												It's a prequel of The Book of Unwritten Tales and should only be played when you've finished the original game. Basically, The Critter Chronicles is just more of the same, so if you like The Book of Unwritten Tales, you should definitely get The Critter Chronicles.However, the game is just slightly worse than the original. A lot of the locations are reused (including the ones from the original game) and some puzzles are not very logical (had to look into a walkthorugh a couple times during Chapter 4). Finally, it's about half as long as the original. The game took me only 8 hours to beat vs. 15 hours for The Book of Unwritten Tales.Despite these flaws, The Critter Chronicles is still one of the best adventure games of the latest years. It's funny, looks good, and also has a nice story plus memorable characters.			"

												If you have played the previous game in the series, all I can say is that you won't be disappointed if you buy this one.It has better graphics and arguably more humor than its predecessor, and more importantly, it will probably make Critter a much more adorable - or at least much less annoying - character for you.As to those who haven't played the series yet, well... it's an old school point and click adventure game, and this game faithfully reproduces both the good and the bad characteristics of a typical game from that genre.It means you will get tons of witty remarks, hilarious moments, and some clever puzzles while playing this game. But you will also find that the most of the gameplay involves walking back and forth between limited set of places, while moving your mouse cursor all over the screen with frustration, hoping to find some missed hotspot.For a modern title, it pays notably little attention in mitigating such typical problems which pervade point & click adventure games.So, if you feel like you are stuck, I'd like to suggest to try combining items in random manner or scrubbing the whole screen thorougly with your mouse, because there are number of not very logical puzzles, and very hard to find hotspots throughout the game.But still, I have to conclude my review by assuring you that it's one of the better made classic adventure game you can get these days.And the at very least, it also has PENGUINS and THE TENTACLE (yes, that purple one you remember from the old days). What can you expect more from an old school adventure game?			"

												Yet another point and click adventure game. If you can't tell, this is a prequel to ""The Book of Unwritten Tales"". It's also much, much shorter.Pros:It's absolutely beautiful. The animation is very fluid, and the voice acting is great (even if Critter's ""Dialogue"" does grate after a while)The story is entertaining and keeps you interested for the duration. The characters are also well developed - not just stereotypes, but flawed beings with hidden depths.Cons:It crashes. A lot. It seems that these vary from picking up an item making the game quit, to (in my case) clicking on ""Settings"" in the menu causing it to crash. So...save often!The puzzles are very obtuse. Often you find yourself combining everything with everything in order to progress...without any logical reason behind it.The constant sarcasm of the lead character can grate after a while...But...it's entertaining, pretty, and short. A bit overpriced too. But still worth a go...			"

												Critter Chronicles is a point and click adventure game with a comedy theme. Most of the puzzles are inventory based, with a few minigames thrown in. None of the puzzles are too hard, although I did get stuck once on a minigame and had to consult a walkthrough. About half of the game was completed by my nine-year-old with a little help. I think this is a great game to play with your kids, they love the sophomoric humor. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Overall I thought this game was a little more polished and clever than the first one. I definitely recommend playing BoUT first before playing this game, since the story makes more sense this way. Overall the game was very entertaining for the story and the comedy, the puzzles keep you busy but are not all that challenging.			"

												This is the prequel to the original game and it tells the story of one of the 3 main characters from that game, with his sidekick getting a much expanded role in this installment.And that is also one of the biggest drawbacks of the game, in the original game you had at certain points in the game the option to control 3 distinct and interesting characters. Here you can control 2, however one of them does not speak in a human language, so there are no helpful hints from him when you are inspecting items. This means that controlling him is annoying and a frustrating experience when you are limited to only that character for solving certain puzzlesIt is interesting to see the genesis of a few characters, especially since in the original it was left as a big question unaswered. And the story itself is quite nice, however I will say that the puzzle design is noticably weaker this time around. And the game seems to be not up to the same quality as its predecessor, as there are quite a few issues with clipping, and a serious game crashing bug connected with a puzzle that can only be avoided by making sure the game is constantly busy during that puzzle.The game does retain its charm though, and it makes for an OK entry in the franchise.5½  / 10			"

												The first game was fun. But this game is just that same joke all over again and it is extremely boring. The first game had polished cutscenes but this one doesn't. The voice acting is really annoying .The voices are also very loud while the background score is almost non-existant. The worst part is the terrible logic for solving the puzzles. It is just crazy the amount of pixel/object hunting and object combining permutations you have to do to solve a puzzle. An overall boring and frustrating experience. The selling point of the first game was it's wacky humor and that has dried up and this is just a grind. If you still want some cheap laughs and want to know how the prequel story that led to Nate and Critter teaming up then just play with a walkthrough. That's what I did right after chapter 2.			"

												If you liked The Book of Unwritten Tales it is fairly likely you'll enjoy The Critter Chronicles. It is a shorter experience (8h vs 13h for me) and not with as many characters. Which is certainly a weakpoint in my opinion. Since they cost about the same I would certainly recommend the original game over this one. The story and voice acting are pretty good... though the parody stuff and the ""do you see what I am referencing? Do you? Look closer! Are you sure you see it!?!"" type of pop culture referencing from the original game still keeps a lot of the characters from being as amusing as they could have been. And unfortunately Nate's and the Critter's backstories do not really flesh them out as characters very well. The puzzles do suffer quite severly from the same simplified inventory system that Unwritten Tales, but I think to an even higher degree. Since it is so easy to combine the right objects together and find where they are to be placed (only the right ones will give the option to combine except in a few, very rare, circumstances when you get a witty remark instead), they seem to have tried to compensate by having really ridiculous and stupid solutions to problems. This often means you are combinging things and placing things without logic or reason, but only because you have an item and a place. Obviously this is a problem in a lot of point and clicks, but the Critter Chronicles really take it to the next level. Since it is so easy (even on Hard) this is not so much frustrating though as... unsatisfactory. It gets a bit better when you are able to control the critter as well since this does force you to think a little bit more about what you want to use where... but the barrier is still quite low and it becomes a case of moving all items between characters to find who will do the thing you want them to do.In the end I will recommend this game (if you've already played the original and liked it), but I would suggest playing it for the characters more than the gameplay. You will not find a challenging puzzle experience here if you're a veteran puzzle player, but maybe a laugh here and there.			"

												A prequel to The Book of Unwritten Tales, but I would say you can play it before playing the original without any difficulty. It has the same brand of sarcastic humor, interesting and sometimes wacky puzzles, and tons of pop culture references. It's a credit to the adventure game genre, with great voice acting, good art, and a nice little backstory to some characters you have already met in the original game. My sole complaint was that a few of the puzzles required (in my case) some of that ""combine everything from your inventory with everything in your inventory"" because it wasn't obvious what you were supposed to be making (especially near the end).Overall: 9.5/10.

												The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles acts as a prequel to the first game in the series, The Book of Unwritten Tales. This game tells us about Critter and his(?) people and how he and Nate meet. + Very good voice acting and nice music+ Atmospheric hotspots+ Ok story and pop culture references+ Difficulty setting- Annoying human main character- Some bugs- A few unskippable cutscenesOverall I'd say this game is slightly better than the first game even though Nate is still quite annoying. Many good features from the first game are found in this game as well. Again the voice acting is very good, the music fitting and the story being told only lacks because the game doesn't take itself too serious while making as many references to pop culture as is possible without being annoying - hinted at are Star Wars, Star Trek, Batman, Borat, The Simpsons and more.As said before, Nate is annoying which is irritating because we spent quite a lot of time with him. Although he'll show nice traits from time to time, especially when it's about something important, Nate acts like a self-centered, narcissistic buffoon when interacting with other people. As The Mary put it: ""There is something about you that makes me wish I could move my arms.""I encountered  a number of small bugs which didn't obstruct the flow of the game.When Critter closes the hatch after Ma'Zaz is trapped the hatch clips behind the door of the closet.The closet is missing its right door later in the game.In case you have the horse shoe on a string in your inventory when making the Baby-Critter-sandwich the horse shoe will vanish from your inventory.The game features two difficulty settings, normal and hard. Where normal plays quite like the first game with spacebar showing hotspots and the current mission. On hard mode hotspot display is deactivated by default and the solutions to puzzles often take a few more steps than they would on normal. I'd suggest playing on hard first.The game has again the atmospheric hotspots that add to setting up the scenery but vanish once explored leaving only the important hotspots - very helpful.Since the game has steam achievements some of which are bound to the difficulty setting the game basically requires two play-throughs. For that reason I would have liked to be able to skip the cutscenes between chapters.Even more than the first game The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles is easily recommendable. It's no Sam&Max or Monkey Island but still a good and solid game. I had fun with both books.			"

												Loved it.  One of the characters is very Han Solo like and the humor is very amusing.  Some of the puzzles can be tuff but that makes figuring them out boost your own ego in ways.  Wonderful and touching story.  Characters that you tend to love . . . If you liked The Book of Unwritten Tales, you'll like this one too.			"

												Another beautiful game from The Adventure Company. Loved it, great dialog and puzzles. In this game we find out how Nate met Critter (which is THE most adorable furry thing in the world). As always pop-culture references abound and are hilarious. Highly recommended for all adventure lovers out there! :)			"

												From Games Fiends (www.gamesfiends.com)In England, the vision of a  “white christmas” as portrayed in films and TV programmes is a horrible lie. Even home produced TV content still pumps out fake snow during the Christmas specials despite us all knowing that it’ll only♥♥♥♥♥♥it down with rain.So I was quite pleased that my assignment over the festive break was to review the snow heavy The Book Of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles. It’s a happy go lucky entry into the point and click adventure genre that’s full of warmth and good humour, if lacking in certain other departments.A prequel to the first game, The Book Of Unwritten Tales, you start the game as Nate, on the run with a questionably acquired airship before you are attacked by a bounty hunter seeking to return the ship back to its owner, along with yourself for punishment.After a lot of back and forth across the same few screen locations and some relatively easy puzzle solving to rid yourself of your pursuer. The plan immediately backfires and you end up crashing into the cold tundra of the Northlands. It’s here that you meet the star of the show, Critter, and the rest of his tribe. As with the previous game, you can switch between both characters in order to solve the puzzles that will help you both escape from the frozen wastes.the book of unwritten tales the critter chronicles imageSolving puzzles in Critter Chronicles was relatively easy, and that’s coming from someone who usually struggles with such things. I assumed briefly that maybe I was no longer stupid but sadly that is not the case at all. The ease of the game is mainly down to one the fundamental issue I have with it. The heavy and repetitive use of backgrounds and locations. Even by two thirds of the game through I think I could count the number of backdrops on one hand. There is a significant amount of location re-use that does mean you’ll never get too lost trying to solve puzzles, there are only so many permutations you can attempt before you stumble across the right one. The net result is that the game that feels more like a smallish DLC episode rather than a title priced at £17.99, so I’m not convinced about the entry retail price here. It’s questionable.So what does it get right? Firstly atmosphere, the game world is beautifully drawn and realised, even though the human characters don’t shine quite as much as the their creature counterparts. The game has a warm hearted comedic tone that gave me a few good chuckles throughout. Whilst the first chapter was rather dry and plodding in nature, the introduction of the Muppet inspired alien Critter and his species really liven up the second and third acts. Playing the game as Critter made for some very amusing moments, particularly as eats and pulls out of his stomach all of the items you acquire, and his imitation of certain objects when you click on them. The game also features an ultra adorable baby critter and an ingenious use for penguins that could solve the world’s energy demands if harnessed on a large enough scale.the book of unwritten tales the critter chronicles imageThe voice acting features some lively performances that could have easily been lifted from a Saturday morning cartoon. However it can sometimes sound as though the developers have rounded up a local amateur dramatics society, with some of the acting sounding very forced, particularly with the lead Nate. The score that accompanies the game is also quite enjoyable to listen to and fits in perfectly with the light hearted fantasy world that has been developed.Overall The Critter Chronicles was an enjoyable slice of point and click adventure. It has a warm heart and some lovingly realised characters. Ultimately though, much like the frozen desolate wastelands, the game feels too isolated from the world itself. A sparse cast of characters and repetitive use of locations makes the game feel very narrow in focus.Whilst the puzzles are quite simplistic, that could be considered a bonus for those of you that enjoy the telling of a story more than the taxing of the brain. I wouldn’t hesitate to snap up this game and its predecessor, The Book Of Unwritten Tales, if you see them going for a good price on Steam.6.5/10 "

												I was expecting more from this prequel after my enjoyment of The Book of Unwritten Tales. The story line is a little weak without the knowledge of TBUT, and it doesn't have the same charm to make up for such weaknesses, The script is still good, but playing as Critter for such an extended period of time got a bit tedious for me. I'd still recommend playing it, but wouldn't urge you to go out of your way to do so.			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales - The Critter Chronicles is the sequel, well story prequel to the original Book of Unwritten Tales by King Art Games.If you had played the original, you will be immediately familiar with the art style, music and atmosphere of the game. It is a shorter story lasting around 8 to 10 hours depends on your play style, and tells the prequel story of how Nate and Critter first met each other, and their adventures that takes place before the original game.Once again it is another light-hearted tale that pokes fun at itself and pays homage to lots of fantasy and RPG stereotypes and old adventure games. In fact one of the puzzle solution near the end of the game would not make much sense to someone who had not played a certain Lucasarts adventure game before. For those who have played it however, it certainly a funny and nostalgic treat.While this game is shorter then its predecessor, the puzzles felt alot more devious and require you to think out of the box (at least for the hard mode version). More then once I had to consult a walkthrough as puzzle solutions can be a little cryptic.The annoyances that plague its predecessor continue with this game such as not being able to make the character walk faster, and the typical ""mouse-over everything on the screen until something is clickable"" type of situations. This game doesn't end in a cliffhanger, but it would have been nice if it was tied directly to the first game.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Definitely pick this up if you enjoyed the first game in the series. For newcomers, I recommend playing the first game to better understand and appreciate some of the story elements in this game even though it is a prequel. Be forewarned, the hard mode of this game is alot more challenging then the original game.			"

												Critter Chronicles is a point and click adventure game with a comedy theme. Most of the puzzles are inventory based, with a few minigames thrown in. None of the puzzles are too hard, although I did get stuck once on a minigame and had to consult a walkthrough. About half of the game was completed by my nine-year-old with a little help. I think this is a great game to play with your kids, they love the sophomoric humor. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Overall I thought this game was a little more polished and clever than the first one. I definitely recommend playing BoUT first before playing this game, since the story makes more sense this way. Overall the game was very entertaining for the story and the comedy, the puzzles keep you busy but are not all that challenging.			"

This is still a very good game, fun and full to the brim with the same brand of humour tht made The Book of Unwritten Tales such an enjoyable game, and I definitely recommend it. However, even considering that The Critter Chronicles has a much higher penguin count, I can't help but feel that the first installment in the series was a stronger title.This is still a game more than worth buying though, although maybe not at the full 20$ retail price.

												Kinda liked TBoUT 1, but this prequel, not so much. The story was interesting, but it really suffered from bad puzzle design. It's really inconsistent in the way it handled the puzzles, and there's way too much guesswork involved in the solutions.Here's an example of a bad puzzle (of which there are many), I'll be vague and won't spoil the exact solution: There's a part in the game where you'll have to disguise yourself. There are no clues as to who you are supposed to be disguised as, and the solution is a homage to an older adventure game from a different developer, which is almost impossible to guess. The only way to solve this puzzle is to try all item combinations and pray that it works.			"

												This game was a great continuation of the first two games. I enjoyed playing as Critter and even though some complain about it, I liked his simple little language and felt proud when I was starting to understand him. As compared to the first two, this game had a slight decline in the humor level - I just didn't laugh as much. I also found myself turning to walkthroughs more often for this one. As critter doesn't speak english, he doesn't give very good prompts. It is worth buying on sale to finish out the story if you've played the first two. If you haven't played the first two, you should start at the beginning. The first game is the best, and sets a necissary foundation for the other two.8/10			"

Almost all the puzzles are the ""How was I supposed to know that?"" kind, and even the humour is off.  The first act is ok, but it goes downhill from there.Perhaps the most eloquent indicator is that I was in the middle of the second chapter when I last played, and that was 8 months ago.

You get to find out even more about the characters whom you've fallen in love with, and like TBOUT, the artwork is great. The only thing I find with this game is that is can sometimes be choppy and glitch/crash. However, I think it's important to play this game for the character development of critter and Nate , so I still recommend this game. Plus, it's fun! And there are a ton of funny puzzles. I hope they keep coming out with more TBOUT games, because I always enjoy them and highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys point and click games with a great story.			"

												This is the prequel to the original game and it tells the story of one of the 3 main characters from that game, with his sidekick getting a much expanded role in this installment.And that is also one of the biggest drawbacks of the game, in the original game you had at certain points in the game the option to control 3 distinct and interesting characters. Here you can control 2, however one of them does not speak in a human language, so there are no helpful hints from him when you are inspecting items. This means that controlling him is annoying and a frustrating experience when you are limited to only that character for solving certain puzzlesIt is interesting to see the genesis of a few characters, especially since in the original it was left as a big question unaswered. And the story itself is quite nice, however I will say that the puzzle design is noticably weaker this time around. And the game seems to be not up to the same quality as its predecessor, as there are quite a few issues with clipping, and a serious game crashing bug connected with a puzzle that can only be avoided by making sure the game is constantly busy during that puzzle.The game does retain its charm though, and it makes for an OK entry in the franchise.5½  / 10			"

												A really enjoyable prequel, if you loved the first one you'll love this too: it's a ""more of the same"", but in a positive sense, and it even gives now the chance to choose between a Normal and an Hard difficult setting.It has just one flaw, minor or major is up to you to decide: in relation to the above difficult settings, you cannot get all the achievements because you will get only the ones related to the chosen difficult setting. Which make sense when you play Normal to not get Difficult's achievements, but totally make no sense the other way around (because Normal is the same game with much less puzzles, so by finishing it in Difficult I solved all Normal's puzzles too)			"

												I bought this game after playing it's demo. The game was the first one of ""The Book of Unwritten Tales"" series I played  and it was funny enough so I change my opinion about adventures game genre and I don't know why it doesn't interesting me before. This part is shorter than previous one but I like it more 'cause of Nate's (one of main character) phrases and action.The puzzles aren't complicated in the game  and the game's process turns it's efforts to story and nice pastime.

												The Critter Chronicles is old school Point n Click adventure done right.  Simple story, excellent characters, and the most random and nonsensical ways of solving puzzles all while being humorous and referential.There really isn't much to analyze about the game.  There’s no deep story or allegorical moral, just a straight adventure. But I've given too much credit to other games in this regards.  The Critter Chronicles is very clear on what your goal is in chapter and even in the subchapters.  Hold Space and tells you the puzzle you should be figuring out.  That's actually ground breaking when compared to other games that don't reveal what your goal is until after you do it.The characters are great as well.  This story lends itself more towards a Star Wars parody with Nate being a reluctant Han while Critter is an amalgamation of Chewbacca, ET and several Muppets. Though, the love interest is definitely a Leia Organa clone, she plays opposite of Critter.  There aren't many characters but the ones included they got right.Puzzle aren't too hard. Nate drops verbally hints as what to do, but even if you missed one they aren't so devious that you couldn't figure out with a bit of time. A few puzzle though left me frustrated. At one point I had run through all the possible combinations of interacting with objects that broke down a checked a gameboomers.  In bright Red Letters the guide pointed out I need to examine something I already had in my inventory because that would change it. That was annoying. I also accidentally skipped a puzzle not realizing the order I was supposed to do things. A few other puzzle were tough but not Goat level.The real reason to love this game though is the referential humor. It pokes fun of 80s nostalgia while also being an homage. Star wars and Harry Potter references are clear, but a surprising one was day of the tentacle. Lots of little things were included that show a lot of love in the game.My only real criticism is the lack of customization of controls. The mouse speed adjustment and middle click to reveal hotspots would have been a big plus.Overall, it’s another excellent game in the series, a little short but if you like classic Point n Click adventures this one is for you.

												Humorous casual point and click puzzle solver where we find out how Critter met Nate.Our pair infiltrate a submarine headquarters for the evil villain, an MC Escher inspired wizard's house, a hidden temple, an alien space ship, and a sasquatch cave. They meet the strangest people, make friends, (launch babies?) escape traps and drop references to other movies/games that make you laugh.  Critter wants to save his family, impress his girl, defeat the bad guy, and save the world.  Nate tries to save his own butt and ends up being a hero anyway.I like it even better than the first one :)			"

												While I loved the the other games of this series, this game  crashes, then abruptly closes.... at a part which I need to complete to advance. My system is more than capable (Alienware 15, Win 10, Intel I7 6700 HQ,  12GB RAM, GTX 970)  More wasted $$ on a poorly coded game.  I am not the only one this has happened to, it seems.  Obviously the developer does not care enough to put out a fix.....  :-(UPDATE:Contacted the developer, who claimed this was a known bug in the game and promptly sent me a work-around to correct the problem. YAY! I now can recommend this game !			"
