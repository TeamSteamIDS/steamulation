												I don't play rogue-likes.That was my starting point with ToME(4), aka Tales of Maj'Eyal.  I'm not really a fan of the genre, though I am a fan of tactical RPGs.  It was only after some interesting comments on another game forum (Grim Dawn, great game, look it up) that I decided to give ToME a try.Unlike some other rogue-likes, ToME gives you the option to play softcore.  There are varying difficulty levels in addition to different degrees of 'rogue-like-ness' (multiple lives; from 1 to infinite).  The classes vary from basic and simple (Bulwark, Rogue, Archmage, etc) to surprisingly unique (Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Solipsist, etc).  The unlock system can be a pain, but it does encourage you to progress through the game, explore and play various archetypes.The lore is great; the world has been excellently crafted (imo).  While it doesn't read like a AAA novel, the depth of the backstory is pretty astonishing considering it's been done primarily by one man (props Darkgod).When it comes to the gameplay, everything is surprisingly newbie-friendly (for a rogue-like).  The UI is simple and easy, the controls are variable (keyboard and/or mouse, re-bindable) and the overly-complex item usage often found in the genre has been notably streamlined.  The graphics are solid.   Now, take that with a grain of salt; this is a 2d game of tiles and sprites.  If you're anticipating something like Dragon Age, you're going to be disappointed.  I know that I was unpleasantly surprised.  That being said, it has definitely grown on me and it certainly gives enough information on what's happening.All that being said, this IS a roguelike.  You WILL walk around a corner/open a door/open a chest and get exploded.  Careful, cautious play is highly encouraged.Overall, if you find yourself wanting to try out a roguelike but finding they are a little too 'hardcore' for you, give ToME a try.  It's the only roguelike that I have found myself returning to, time after time.			"

												Well...how to start. First, now that I have a few games under my belt and have a least started some of the overall learning curve (there is a lot of information to digest in this game), I would like to say BRAVO to the developer.  This game is for any old school RPG'er that misses great mechanics and gameplay.  I cannot stress enough how engaging this game is.  Anyway, I will list some of the goods and bads of the game.The Good The developer, DarkGod, is very attentive to the boards and genuinely is interested in his customers.  This is a positive that is almost nonexistent is most software. (Especially indy stuff.) The choice of characters/classes is vast.  Yes, you have to play to unlock all of them.  That is part of the fun. Character development is very customizable and detailed.  For me this is a plus, for some this is the source of extreme confusion. The UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat inclined learning curve.  I have been playing for 60 odd hours and I am still finding ways to use it and new things I didn't know it could do with it. The workshop support is tremendous.  You can customize this game to suit your needs. This is a Rogue Like game that has difficulty settings from casual to hard core.  If you want, you CAN play with unlimited lives.  Or, if you fancy a good challenge, you can play 1 life on crazy difficulty.  The choice is yours.  (I read a few reviews complaining that they died too quick.  So set it on easy and learn to play; it is that simple.) Tremendous amount of trophies.  One ninth of them are very gettable for anyone. (The trophes are copied nine times for different levels of play.  And, yes, if you do higher level trophies they will get all the same trophies below them.  You just have to do a little dance to have it happen.  If an old fart like me can figure it out (I read posts) then I imagine most people can do the same.) The story is not bad at all.  Far more engaging than most much more expensive games.  If you think it is boring and unimaginative you probably haven't actually read and/or played through much of it.The Bad No, this game is not perfect.  The biggest drawback, from some people's view, is the graphics.  They are very yesterday, yesteryear, last decade possibly.  (For me this is not that big of a deal, I will gladly trade eye-candy for good gameplay.) I have experienced some game lag in different parts of the game.  Not sure what causes them, but they are surely there.  I have never had it crash, but I have had to wait 30-90 seconds for it to come out of an apparent mini-freeze. This game can be unflinchingly mean and nasty at higher levels.  For some this is a deal breaker.  For me it is a lot of fun.  So do with that what you want.  (I have read many blog/posts about people rage quitting and never playing again.  For those people...never play Magic the Gathering, you will end up hating life and your friends.) The UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat inclined learning curve.  Yes, I know this was listed in my ""Goods,"" but it is most definitely a negative for a lot of people. Kind of gets in the way of life if you get into it.  It is a ""just one more turn/zone/thingy type game that will overtake your life if you let it.That is all that I can think of off the top of my head.  I have an old head.  (And, most of the other parts as well.)  So, in closing, get the game.  It is too cheap and well made to not have it in your library.  If this is formatted incorrectly, I humbly apologize for my oldness and lack of modern techno-goodness; it has been years since I ""formatted"" anything and I imagine quite rusty.***Sits back and waits to get troll-fired*** "

												I've never written a steam review before but TOME is so good that I have to chime in with my 2c. This is the first rogue-like game that I've ever played and I was extremely skeptical of the genre before giving TOME a try but I can honestly say that TOME is the best game that I've played in a very, very long time, and as a D&D nerd who grew up in the 80's, this game hits so many of the right notes from an RPG perspective that I have simply not been able to put it down since the summer sale and I've only played 2 out of the like 30 classes.The replay value is through the roof and the challenge is out of this world difficult, but like Dark Souls, it mostly feels very fair and does become more manageable as you get better at the game. I can't believe I only paid something like 2$ for this game as it is worth the price of a full AAA title easily. In fact, if I was a developer who had slaved away on a mediocre AAA title this game would make me seriously re-evaluate my life choices. As far as I can tell, this game was developed by one dude, and stands head and shoulders above so many titles that took 100+ people to create that it should serve as an inspiration to hobby game developers everywhere. I can't believe how good this game is, you have to buy it.			"

												[posted this initially on the 3rd but reviews were broken at that time.]I'll start this by telling you that I've been playing TOME since it was Tales of Middle Earth. That's right, originally it was based on Tolkien's work and was an offshoot of a long lineage of games directly related to Rogue, via Moria and then Angband. There was a middle variant in there at some point called Pernband.Some back story:At some point DarkGod (the main dev) decided to rewrite the client because the old angband client was full of spaghetti code and it became untenable. So came t-engine. Tome was then written as a module of T-engine (all made by DarkGod for no $$ I might add.) In Tome 3 there were Jedi!!! and other fun ideas but it was chaotic. Tome 3 was a mess, (Tome 4 was much cleaner.) But it was still pretty opaque as Roguelikes go. I would tinker with it, have fun with lost souls etc and then get bored. So I went the way of many players got involved in other games only came back periodically when I got a yen for playing with Lightsabers again. At some point, I noticed Tome 4 was progressing and downloaded and everything was different.Gone were most of the touches of the Angband and Tolkien worlds. You can still see a few here and there but TOME had become Tales Of Maj Eyal with an original story and a total reworking of the graphics and mechanics. On and off Ive done some beta testing (though my forums account from then was deleted more than once so I guess being inactive on the forums is a good way to get culled.) At some point I managed a couple of end games. I won once and once I sacrificed my guy (I still don't know why that doesn't count as a win...) Every time I came back more and more stuff was added and then I saw that they had finally made the leap to Steam. I wanted to buy it immediately because I believe in the game and the devs and why not support them? But I was reticent with all the other games I have and also had to wait for money to pay for it anyway. I probably should not have waited but I did and when I did finally get the steam version I was not disappointed with either the basic game or the DLC (which I had no previous knowledge of.) Divergent note that tangentially relates to this review: Bob Dylan has said on songwriting that if you can't change a song, if you can't mess with the words or change the arrangements it is dead and you should bury it. That is a paraphrase because I don't have the exact quote on hand. But this is how I feel about games. TOME is a living game, always changing. Many pay to play games are not. They merely make some stuff they took out initially available for DLCs when the wells run dry. TOME is not like those games. TOME is developed by a caring group of dedicated players and programmers who are making an epic play experience.Yes epic. You have a ton of races and classes which unlock as you play. Sometimes the unlock is just something you were going to do anyway but sometimes in true RPG fashion you have to investigate and figure out some puzzle or quest to get the unlock you want. And you can unlock them in something like 9 different modes. The game offers 50 levels of experience in whatever build combo you choose. As you learn more about classes and races you find yourself getting deeper into the decision making process and you realize you have many more choices than you will quickly be able to play with. This could take a long time. As is without any further changes. And the game changes from game to game so you may not always get an event or area you thought you might. And different play styles create vastly different approaches and in-game storylines. There was a lot of discussion when Maj'Eyal became the world of the game about how terribly difficult the game was (is) so now there are multiple modes for discovering the game. The most rewarding depends on your personality and proclivities as a gamer. You can play with Easy and Exploration and virtually never risk death, or you can unlock, insanity and madness modes and play only in true Roguelike fashion (1 life, though there are items you can find to hedge that bet.) Or you could play as I do on Normal with Adventurous. To each player their own. This is an innovation I wish more devs would think about. Multiple play modes for multiple types of players means more fun for everyone.The game has a few pit falls. It is deep so it is not hard to get into trouble if you are tired, hungry or bored. Don't do that. Play when you are fresh and excited and keep it that way. You won't complete it in a day. (The main quest line takes a minimum of 10 hours I think if you skip everything else and I highly recomend you don't do that.)You may also find that the game lore is hard to penetrate. This is partially due to writing style and partially because who wants to read so much of it? Yes you should read the lore the first time you encounter it at the very least. You may or may not glean valuable clues from it but if you need to you can go back to it later. Once you have unlocked certain features you will be able to access ALL of the lore you've ever seen as a player. You may notice that I am not giving a lot of specifics here because part of the fun of this game is playing it unspoiled. You can of course look stuff up or ask for spoilers if you aren't into all that.I will say the sound effects while fairly professional are not my cup of tea. I am not really a game sounds kind of player though. I typically turn sound off in games I play and I only checked them out in TOME out of curiousity. You might find them entertaining. Apparently, also there is music. Something I didn't check out. (I am an older guy with a very staid taste in music. If it isn't Classic Rock. Folk, Blues or Soul from the 60s-70s then it probably isn't on my mp3 player. Though I do enjoy more varied styles, when I am gaming that's mainly what I listen to.)I write all this mainly to enthuse about how much I am enjoying playing TOME again and want you to know it is worth every penny to buy it on steam.  The community addons alone make the game extremely customizable. Gandolfo in game chat, Winter Wolf on Steam.			"

												If you're already a roguelike fan, chances are you've played this game - and probably enjoyed it. So for the purposes of this review I'm going to assume you're had little to no experience with traditional roguelikes, and perhaps some experience with ""Roguelites"" such as Binding of Isaac, FTL, Rogue Legacy, Risk of Rain, or Spelunky (not an exhaustive list). These games share some similarities with more traditional roguelikes in that they feature procedural level generation, perma-death and often have steep difficulty curves... but are blended with other genres such as platformer or top-down action. Tales of Maj'Eyal is, however, a more traditional roguelike due to the way you control your character.Turn-based games are typically seen as boring and time-consuming for obvious reasons, but in ToME (and in many other traditional roguelikes) everything is literally instantaneous. You can take turns as quickly as you want, you can move your character and issue commands as fast as you and your computer can process. There is no waiting for fancy character animations to finish playing. Enemies move as you move, so you don't need to wait for them to take a turn. In fact, something I love about ToME is that there is essentially no 'grinding'. You level up, you find items, you go through the game in a mostly linear fashion (although you can choose which order you do dungeons in), but around every corner awaits the possibility of death. Whether you are level 1 or maxed out, there is a potential for you to die if you make a mistake.ToME is a tactical strategy game at heart. Very few deaths will happen because of bad luck, most of them will be a result of mistakes (usually a series of them). This is made possible because there is a plethora of escape options and vision scouting abilities, ensuring that luck plays no part in your experience. As you play you will encounter 'rare' monsters which have a wider range of abilities than most, often requiring you to play very carefully and think out every move you make. Excluding your primary damage-dealing abilities, nearly every ability your character has is for a unique purpose: faster movement, teleports, swapping positions, stunning, healing, shielding, evading, removing effects, and so on. Character positioning and knowing when and how to use your skills is the key to sucess in this game. The basic gameplay is solid due to the strategy elements, but the variety of character customization and items you can find is where the real excitement comes from. There's quite a lot of different classes and races to choose from, many of which have very unique playstyles. Each character's passive and active abilities can be leveled up point-by-point so you can customize exactly what they're capable of, and you cannot max out everything so you must decide what works best for you. As you progress into the game, you'll find items with a huge list of modifiers and special traits. You will constantly be comparing two items and thinking about which is better, especially weapons. How much base damage a weapon deals is rarely the deciding factor in whether or not you will use it, as each individual item can have dozens of different effects and stat changes you to consider. The level of customization depth adds an incredible amount of replay value to the game.The game's aesthetics, however, are not great. I mean the graphics are decent... for a roguelike, a genre that is often associated with graphics consisting of colored ascii characters and nothing else. But I won't beat around the bush on this one: the graphics look pretty bad when compared to almost anything else. And I don't just mean low quality, I mean the art style is terrible. Generic uninspired fantasy crap. The screen is often cluttered with ugly doodads and bulky objects, enemy sprites look ridiculous, I honestly feel most people will take one look at the game and go ""This game looks like trash. I am not playing that."" - and I don't blame you. I just hope you can look past the terrible aesthetics to find the beautiful game within. You know, inner beauty.Above all, ToME is free. You can download the full base game from their website, and if you enjoy it you can purchase a copy of it on steam (or throw the developer a direct donation). The game is consistently updated, has full mod support, and has an website that tracks all of your character data and allows you to look up other players to compare. Although the base game is free, ToME has a couple of DLC 'expansion packs' that are only available for purchase, but these are HUGE content packs for people who love the base game and want more stuff to tinker with.I recommend this game to anyone who has enough patience to get past the learning curve.Rating: A			"

												That game can be described in one word: amazing.I mean, beside being such a complex game created and maintained by one dev, it has dozen of features and things that make it even better:- Humor. Dialogues, story, everything is filled with dark, hidden, or obvious humor. Even the achievements have sometimes the best names I've ever seen (""I cleared the room of death and all I got was this lousy achievement!"")- Death. You can probably die a thousand times differently. - Death (again). You can choose to have an amount of lives to spend, or you can go in full Roguelike-Permadeath-Nightmare/Madness difficulty, but in that game, you will die a lot, that's for sure.- Network. No multiplayer, but just a global chat, that also let you know when another payer achieves something, or DIES. So you know you're not alone.- MOD THAT GAME TO DEATH- You have so many classes and races to play as and to combine in the vanilla, you probably won't even know what to play anymore after you modded the game to death. There is probably a character-mod for every single creature in the game. There is even a mod that allows you to play as a TREE.- B*tch, I'm a Mega Turtle Storm Knight- The story is a big part of the game. TomE isn't a simple randomly-generated-try-or-die-exploring-maze Roguelike. It has continents, locations, races, people, events of the past, yeah, a story.- B*tch, I'm a Star Elf Paradox Mage- There are so many items, you don't know if it's possible to have something balanced in that. And a lot of the items have a story, and special abilities. Also, you're not limited, in terms of what you wanna wear. Wanna be a human mage that shoots fire with his sword ? Go ahead.- B*tch, I'm a Dwarf Arcane GladiatorI just love it.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

												Besides the developer taking time out of his life to hear me out, and treating me like a human being, this game is amazing :) Imagine your favorite roguelike.. Now, from that roguelike take out the fact that: Potions can kill you, necklaces can choke you, weapons can weld themselves to your hand, Identify scrolls can be burned to a crisp, and you can be violently killed by eating moldy bread :)While I love those type of deaths, once you play ToME and notice that those deaths are not there, you realize now that if you die, it truly is your fault. Death comes from combat (or the occasional sandworm burrow collapsing in on you, haha), and the combat is great.. Almost every single build has multiple ways you can grow, almost to the point that they play like different classes altogether when raised in certain ways.. And then the raw variety of classes is amazing as well.. And the random loot generation is some of the best I've dealt with on the MANY, MANY random-loot games I've played :>Add to all that the Infinite Dungeon (how far can you go?), the Transmogrification Chest (all picked-up items rest weightlessly inside the Transmog Chest, and on changing floors you can auto-sell everything out of the chest for a 10% cash penalty, makes inventory management a breeze), a very active and friendly playerbase with in-game chat (its basically an IRC room tacked to the bottom right of the game), the ability to link items and enemies through chat to share the joy of good loot, or the bitter terror of a hyper-strong unique enemy, semi-random in-game events that can potentially save you from the brink of death, and more.. :>This game has the most achievements of any game on Steam (over 1000), multiple difficulty levels (some that determine the strength of your foes, others that determine how many lives you get: Roguelike one-life-to-live, Adventure 5-lives-to-live, and Exploration mode, unlimited lives with which you can get comfortable with the game ((or plunge fearlessly into the Infinite Dungeon!)Anyway.. Try it.. It won't suck out your everlasting human soul, I promise.. It won't.. consume.. you.. GOTTA GO PLAY ToME! (And don't let my hours played through Steam fool you, I've got about twenty times that, from before it was ever on Steam, haha.. I probably don't even want to know how many hours..)			"

												I bought tales of Maj'Eyal way WAY back when it was still in beta, long before Greenlight was around. It was worth my $10 then, and it was absolutely worth another $6 now. It's an absolutely fantastic game that is probably the best Roguelike I've ever played. There's tons of depth, lots of great classes, a great campaign - I've sunk probably hundreds of hours on it already. Every game is different/fun/exciting in a new way. There's enough difficulty options to tune it for any person of any skill level, and even experienced veterans of the game will find plenty of additional challenges after they've finished the main campaign once or twice.

												Good roguelike, technically an evolution of the old Tales of Middle Earth Angband variant but you won't notice unless you've played the old ToME.  It's quite forgiving for the genre.  It's not nearly as spoiler-heavy as Nethack or ADOM, and while it doesn't have the same ""transparency"" as Dungeon Crawl, it tends to be a little easier.  There is a multiple-life ""adventure"" mode which can be turned off.  There are essentially no consumables in the game; the roles typically filled by these are instead unlimited-use abilities subject to cooldowns after use.One interesting feature is that if you log in to play, there is an in-game chatroom.  The online population rarely reaches above 200, so the chatroom isn't actually too cluttered.  I have frequently seen developers online answering questions/taking bug reports.  This game is available for free on the developer's website, but there is one class and a few other minor features that are only available in the paid version.			"

												Wouldn't it be nice to have an RPG you could just play forever? To have a huge, randomized world to explore, hundreds of enemies to battle, nigh infinite loot to find, and dozens upon dozens of characters to try? Tales of Maj'Eyal certainly tries to be just that, and if you can get past some balance and aesthetic hangups, you might get your wish.ToME, as I'm going to abbreviate it from here on, is a roguelike RPG of incredible scale. Right from character creation, you have dozens of combinations of races and classes to choose from, with more to unlock as you explore the world. There's plenty of exploring to do across said massive world as well, what with the layout of the continents and dungeons randomized each time. Enemies and loot are even more randomized, scattered throughout in ways that encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of every level of every dungeon. There are towns to visit and NPCs to take quests from, and though the main story quest is the same every time, your start and some elements later are determined by your race and your class.Every time you start a new character, you're in for a dramatically different adventure, just as you would expect from a quality roguelike. Right from the start there's a huge amount of variance between the classes. You have everything from different flavors of warriors and archers to exotic professions like chronomancers and abominations. Leveling up gains you new stat points to spend, skill points in two separate classes of skills, and occasionally the chance to learn entirely new skills. Coupled with the ridiculous amount of loot to find, there's a lot of customizing to do, and dozens of skills to use on a single character between their class skills, racial skills learned skills, runes, infusions, and item-granted powers.If all this sounds overwhelming, it really isn't because of how the game is played. ToME is turn-based at your pace, meaning things only happen when you move or attack. Attacking can be as simple as bumping into enemies to auto attack, or laying out combinations of skills over dozens of turns. And this is where the balance starts to become an issue, because for most fights you'll be doing the former. Most enemies in ToME are little more than filler, assuming you've been diligent in exploring and leveling. Despite the vast array of enemies to battle, many present little challenge. It's the rare unique enemies and ones with certain devastating abilities you have to watch out for, and in stark contrast with the rest of your foes these can end your life in one or two turns. Every single character I have lost has been to an unexpected boss or unique that wrecked me instantly after cleaving effortlessly through their minions.To its credit, ToME has a wide assortment of difficulty settings, and the default level gives you several lives to experiment with before succumbing to permadeath. But it's a band-aid on a much deeper balance wound. Most of the adventuring in ToME presents so little challenge you can run on autopilot, until suddenly dying to the one thing in the room that poses a threat. This creates a strange whiplash effect between mounting boredom and sudden frustration. And the methods for overcoming a challenging boss won't always be clear thanks to the immense volume of stats and abilities that you normally don't have to keep much track of. Even after a dozen hours it can be hard for me to tell what my character is ready for.The result is a game that's not too daunting to get into, but presents a real challenge to master. Every attempt is a long and gratifying series of small discoveries and victories before the inevitable end comes. There's plenty of unique items, new classes, and lore to uncover even if beating the game isn't in the cards. I still haven't come close to whatever the end is, but after 20 hours I'm still not tired of the meat grinder. Maybe I really can play this forever, and even if you can't, you'll get a lot of quality adventuring out of it.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal or ToMe brings me back to ye olden days of turn-based roguelikes like Castle of the Winds. Curerntly I have around 850 hours and keep coming back to ToMe from time to time. For its simple sprites and tiles, this game has a crazy amount of depth in combat and character building, and each playthrough always has its own flavor. Sometimes those flavors can be quite bitter, as the world of Maj'Eyal can be a deadly place to the impatient or the overconfident. A few pros and cons:Pros:- ToMe is difficult, but as you learn the game you'll do better every time- Every playthrough is unique! Different zones, uniques or orange loot, events and side quests with every character!- Great character customization! 10 races, >20 classes, each with several talent paths to choose. Even more with DLC- Full of lore! Every zone, item, and boss has a story behind it.- Loads of information is available to you. Can look up enemies skills, saves, resistances, etc. Nothing is hidden!- Great mod support! Make your own race or class, with blackjack! And hookers!Cons:-Some classes are little weaker compared to others, especially the starting classes.-Game engine kinda bogs down when zones get really crowded , or while saving-Rare mobs basically roll different class skillsets, so some rares can be quite insane with certain unlucky combinations-A playthrough can be as long as a full DnD campaign.-RNG is a cruel mistress sometimes  "

												Excellent game, if stat screens make your pants feel funny, I reccomend this game, it is truly one of the best modern roguelikes, with many interesting mechanics, very different classes, varied races, an interesting world and lore. I love it.Tons of content, and it's even free. I must have played like 200 hours before acquiring it on steam, because DarkGod deserves the money, and a game like this for this low price is almost a steal, The game starts out being relatively simple to play, with few races and classes avaliable, and few complicated mechanics, but as you progress in your runs and do different stuff, you unlock interesting new races and classes.Hell, you can time travel. TIME. TRAVEL.One of the best parts is that, in order to unlock classes and races, you have to do some pretty interesting things. For example, unlocking mages requires that you find the existence of mages, and some important finds affect later playthroughs, like finding the anti-magic people of Zigur or a certain chest that once you find all your characters start with.This game is so awesome, that it helped me stay sane during a week of post-surgery lying face-down on a hospital bed.I reccomend this. Seriously, if you like roguelikes and don't mind text, give this a try for free at te4's page, and I strongly reccomend buying it, it barely gives you features, mostly cosmetic ones, but something of this scale deserves a purchase, and for this price, it is well worth it.I love it.

												I only just recently discovered this game, thanks to it being introduced to Steam, and my only regret is it taking me this long to find it. If the idea of the old Rogue/Nethack mixed with a little more RPG and the tiniest dash of MMORPG appeals to you, I highly suggest checking this out. You can try it for free from DarkGod's website (just search for tome of mag'eyal on google, and it should be the first link). Being a Steam addict, I'm glad it is available here however (I might not have discovered it otherwise). I enjoyed it so much after the first 6 hours, I donated 20 Euros on the website. I've already seen enough of this game to know I well get AT LEAST that much enjoyment. Obviously DarkGod believes in his game as well, otherwise it wouldn't be free to try as much as you like. I like that attitude in a game developer, and I hope everyone who finds enjoyment in the game feels it is worth rewarding as much as I do. :)			"

												I love this game.  Until yet another of my lovingly, painstakingly crafted characters die.  Which happens a lot.  And then I hate it with a passion.  My blood boils.  I bark profanities.  I rage at the unfairness of it all.  I slam my fists down and swear that I'll never play this crappy cheating killfest of a game ever again.  And I sulk.  I pout.  Maybe I pound down a half gallon of ice cream.  I curl up in a fetal ball and weep a bit, wondering if I'll ever find a game that doesn't treat me so badly.Then I play some other rouguelike for a while.  But it's not the same.  I think wistfully of the good times.  The robust character creation.  The dynamic levelling.  The intriguing quests.  I suppose it wasn't all the game's fault.  I played my part, after all.  But I can't go back.  It will only hurt me again.  Or will it?So I crawl back on my hands and knees like the sucker I am and beg to be taken back.  Why?  Because I love this game.  And you will, too.  Until you die.   Which will happen a lot. "

												This is it. This is, in my opinion, the best roguelike on the market. ToME is an incredibly deep and strategic RPG/roguelike which takes place in an insanely lore-rich world of classic high fantasy. The game is strategic in that time moves in ""turns"", meaning time ceases to move between actions or movements. This allows you to carefully plan each action, rather than requiring twitch reflexes. If you want fast paced action, look elsewhere. Animation is minimal, yet the graphics are extemely charming, and convey quite clearly everything that is happening.Character creation is rich, deep, and super flexible, albeit extremely complex. I've played the same class a million times, but the result is always different depending on how I lay out the stats and skill points, which is probably my favorite part. I am constantly finding fun and oddball builds which get a million times farther than I expect. If you like making characters for tabletop rpgs you'll love this♥♥♥♥♥♥The difficulty is pretty brutal, but it always feels fair. There are ways to turn this down for chickens, or up farther for masochists and vets. As you play, you get better at making characters and becoming better at survival. But there are a TON of things to unlock too. There are different classes, races, and starting items to unlock in addition to ""campaigns"", which are essentially different game modes. If you get bored of adventuring around the continent, turn on endless dungeon mode. Tired of that? Arena mode is a blast too. Basically, this game is insanely fun, super challenging (and therefore rewarding), and the world is written with a very tasteful degree of seriousness. Humor can be found in dialogue but it is subtle and never breaks the immersion (no memes thank the lord.)If you enjoy roguelikes and don't have this game, do yourself a favor and cop it! If you like it, go get that dlc too. My best character so far has been a halfling doombringer. if that doesnt convince you I dont know wat will			"

												Certainly of the best roguelikes available, you can't bypass this game if you like the genre. A quick review of its pros/cons : + amazing choice  of classes, each with a very different gameplay+ 3 different game modes : story, arena, infinite dungeons (the last 2 are to unlock by playing the 1st)+ 5 different difficulties, and 3 ways to play : exploration (infinite lives), adventure (finite number of lives), roguelike (1 life)+ old-school graphics, slightly ""enhanced"", which usually do a wonderful job+ nice background music, for the most part+ very deep and smart system, with tons of modifiers, stats and talents to look after+ you can play it as slowly or as fast as you want+ playable with mouse only, keyboard only, or a mix of both, as you wish+ functional and scalable UI+ tons of lore if you're into reading ;)- some graphic tiles are a little messy (thinking of the glittering caves, or whatever they're called, for example), making some dungeons a bit tough to ""read""- the UI, while overall nice, could be better : overalapping texts, annoying popups, and item comparisons which are frequently a mess to analyse- do NOT buy this game if you're looking for an easy 100% achievements :D There are 1395 achievements, most of them require to play at least 9 times, and they don't fall that easily, most of the time (case in point : I have 91 achievements after 67 hours of game time, lol). These obviously could have be done better, like for example automatically unlock lesser difficulties ones when you achieve one (what's the point of doing the same achievement on normal if you just got it on insane ?)- a few crashes (mostly when starting a new game or loading one, strangely : I don't remember having a crash while in game)- it is possible to get stuck : on my last infinite dungeons run, I ended up in a ""corner"" where the door disappeared (on purpose) and the walls were not diggable. As I had not found any teleportation means yet, my only option was to suicide (target my talents at myself). If it was on ""roguelike"" mode, it would have been a game over.You can get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of playtime with this game, if it appeals to you, without ever being bored. Personnally, I'm a bit burnt out after nearly 70h, but I'll probably come back to it later, if I ever find the time.Not only recommended, but almost mandatory for every gamer who likes rpgs, dungeon crawlers or roguelikes :)			"

												I strongly dislike roguelike games. All too often, they throw a million different obtuse mechanics at you, including but not limited to hunger (discouraging exploration), unidentified items (discouraging the collection of loot, which serves as a major incentive to crawl a dungeon to begin with), or cursed items (discouraging the use of higher quality gear because you'll never be able to unequip it, or equipping it literally kills you)DarkGod (the developer of the game) decided to try something different, here. Understanding that mechanics like cursed items and hunger are relics of the past, he did away with them. This entire game, conceptually speaking, takes a good, hard look at what makes other roguelikes unapproachable messes and tries to understand what the real meat of the genre is, and he has spent years polishing his vision to a fine shine. DarkGod has given you a a huge variety of archtypes, each with their own subclasses that specialize in one thing or another. Simple ""bump"" based combat that dominates other games in the genre has been replaced with a rich skill system that encourages you to carefully consider not only the positions of yourself and your enemies, but what skills to use in order to ensure your survival. Rather than relying on hard to find or expensive to purchase consumable items, you will find ""runes"" and ""inscriptions"" that are infinitely re-usable, but come with a cooldown, demanding that you make strategic use of them. The skill tree system forces you to make careful decisions in regards to pumping skills that make it easier to not die, or pumping skills that make it easier for you to kill enemies, which is itself another valid form of survival. Many skills combo together in ways that you can't easily imagine, which, if you slow down and take enough time to think it through, a situation which appears hopeless at first glance can be turned around through sheer determination and enough tactical thought.I will readily admit that I am not well versed enough in the genre to elaborate any further on what this game does better than its competitors. But I do know that I have avoided playing roguelikes for years because of obtuse mechanics, and this game did away with enough of them to captivate me for dozens of hours already, and will almost certainly rob me of even more of my time as the days go on. If you've played games such as Nethack, Pixel Dungeon, Desktop Dungeons, or Dungeons of Dredmor and were turned off by them, I believe this game is accessible enough to be worth giving a shot, even if you have otherwise given up on the genre.

Posted: June 21, 2015
												So... it took me 63 hours to finally manage to beat the game in Normal/Adventure mode for the first time. Now it's time to write a review... wait, gotta buy the DLC first... including the one that doesn't do anything, to support the dev. I felt like a criminal for how much I paid for ToME from the start... Ok, done. Now... where was I?Oh, the review. I paid 10 times more (each) for 2 or 3 games during summer sale than I paid for Maj, just a couple of days before getting it. What happened was I didn't play any of the others (AAA stuff) once after I started ToME, and now I'm writing this review while thinking about what class to play next.If you haven't played any game like this one before, and by looking at the screenshots feel like it doesn't look (literally) good enough for you, keep in mind that the point is: while it doesn't have the fancy, modern graphics, it does right everything most games these days do wrong-- everything that makes it a GAME is great.I'll try to keep it short:Roguelike - It is, but on Adventure mode you get about 7 lives (+some items you may find that can resurrect you once). You can go hardcore, 1-life Roguelike if you want.Races/Classes - Several of them, unlockable. I'm still missing 5. They are very different from each other, with many different and interesting skill trees. You gotta put some thinking into figuring out what you are gonna make and how you are going to build it.Items - Diablo-like, random drops and attributes, different rarity and tier levels. You feel the thrill of finding good loot. Lots of uniques too. You can stash them and retrieve with another/new character, boosting them hard on your future playthroughs. Just 3 at a time tho, which is annoying, but you can re-do it as many times as you want and so distribute any number of items between your dudes.Map/Dungeons - Always the same dungeons, but spawning on random locations across the map and with randomized interiors. Some minor events and sub-dungeons are also randomly generated.Quests - Not a lot of them, always the same, but some are very interesting and give nice rewards.Lore - LOTS of lore scrolls to be found, telling the game's universe story. I didn't read them, I never do, I don't have the patience, but if you like immersing yourself a bit deeper, you won't have a problem with that.Elite/Rare/Unique/Boss Monsters - These are the ones who usually take those 7 lives away from you... along with the rare multihued wyrms... and magic wielders... and map encounters...  and everything else if you are a Mage.Gameplay - You gotta build your character right, position yourself right, pay attention, have an escape plan... some parts are really though until you get a good hang of the game-- which is great, and a good part of the fun.Graphics/Sound - They work perfectly, the visual effects are nice and the music is pretty good.Bugs/Crashes - I got 3 in 63 hours. Fixed a ""0 turn duration skill"" by going back to the main menu and then continuing the game, fixed both crashes by clicking ""Close"" on the in-game dump note. I had to kill one of my temporal hounds on the second one though, otherwise the dumps kept coming, but it was easily fixed.This is a great game, awesome cost/benefit. I'm usually skeptical about old-school graphics, but they don't take anything away from ToME, and this baby does very well what most modern games screw up - the part that really matters.And now... I'm going Paladin next. To see if I can get that holy gentleman past the freaking Master... EDIT:My paladin died on the last boss fight. I'm still mourning him... or rather all the items he took along to his grave. I hope he is in hell... forever...Doombringer, the DLC class, is awesome.I also found out I'm not man enough to face the Atamathon.On the downside, Temporal Hounds always end up glitching somehow (and Time Warden is the s**t, my best dude). I had to edit and repack some of the game's files to fix one of them. It worked, but required some effort. And now, doing the Prides on Nightmare with that very same TW, the game began freezing hard, forcing me to reopen it to keep going every 20 minutes or so.So... avoid Temporal Hounds if you can. I can't, I like puppies. On the other hand, I didn't have any problems whatsoever with the other classes... my summoner (who spawned a lot more stuff than 3 dogs) worked fine until he got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by The Master.			"

												I had sort of low expectations for this game due to the cluttered, amateurish look of the screenshots (it honestly reminds me of some of the janky Arcen games), but it blew away those expectations.This is a roguelike, turned-based RPG with classes, races, stats, and abilities. The loot system is similar to Diablo and other ARPGs, with randomly generated loot of various qualities and special effects, along with unique loot. The art style is similar to old-school western RPGs like the Spiderweb games. An overworld map contains various towns and dungeons, the latter of which unlock gradually as you progress and complete quests.Now, the part where this game really defied my expectations is that it provides a very streamlined experience, without a lot of the typical drudgery that goes along with games like this.- First of all, the game itself is very intuitive to pick up and start playing without needing a tutorial. The interface is mouse-driven, no need to memorize keybinds (although it does offer fully customizable keybinds as well).- The game seem to understand that the appeal of games like this is both the satisfaction of level progression, as well as the hunt for rare loot. Early on, you get an item that can recycle junk loot into gold, as well as a item with unlimited charges that basically provides a Town Portal effect that teleports you out of the current dungeon. This eliminates the trap that Bethesda games, for example, typically fall into, where you want to be a packrat and collect every piece of loot you come across, but are severely limited in the amount of weight you can carry.- The game offers several difficulty levels, from unlimited lives, to several lives, to permadeath.- The game has an ""auto-explore"" button, where your character will automatically move around the current dungeon floor until it finds an item of interest or an enemy. Movement can also be control via clicking on visible locations, and your character will move to the select square.			"

												Have you ever bought a game you were unsure about, & quickly found yourself with buyer's remorse?  Yeah, we've all been there before.  Anyway, this game was the exact opposite of that.  Not too long after I purchased ToME on steam, I learned that there's a free version you can get from the website, & that what you see here is a 'premium' version that's also availble to donators.  Meanwhile, I don't regret a single penny I spent here.  I'm somewhat new to roguelikes, & more preferred the fluff of swords & sorcery.  What you've got here is a graphically simple single-player turn-based tactics-style rpg.  Different modes include one life, multiple lives based on level, & infinite lives to learn how to play.    Certain features are unlocked with different achievements, including specific classes, races, &, oddly enough, redheads.  Every class I've tried has been a new experience, promotes a different style of play, &, most importantly, has been fun.The support is amazing; every issue or bug I've faced has been addressed, worked on, & fixed in less time than it takes for me to get ahold of a real person on most customer support lines.  The player base is helpful with in-game questions.  Oh, & the game's creator has a fun habit of giving out random buffs or extra dungeons to everyone online when he's feeling squirrelly.Overall, I'd have to say this has been one of the most satisfying game purchases I've made on steam,  or anywhere, for that matter.

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a rogue-like RPG game. Although many people dislike hardcore rogue-like games, Tales of Maj'Eyal will satisfy even the most casual player. Here are some pros and cons of the game:Pros:1- One can disable or tweek perma-death option. Ideal for casual players.2- There are endless possibilities for character creation. A big variety of races and a even bigger variety of classes.3- You can unlock new races and classes as you play the game and complete certain tasks a certain way, opening up the possibility to run more than one playthrough (considering you play casually *coughs*).4- Really well done skills and skill tree learning system.5- Trasmogrification Chests are the BEST THING EVER. It's basically a chest the player carries that allows him to pick up all and any item in a level, disconsidering his/hers emcumbrance. After you complete a level, you can choose which items you want to stay with and easily sell the rest instantly.6- There are lots of ways to reach the end of the main storyline, and I gotta say, what a storyline.....7- Players can dig through most walls if they have a pickaxe.... that's awesome and adds to what makes this game so different.8- The world treats you differently depending on your race, class, past deeds and more.9- Ability to re-spec most talents and skills.10- I'll add a pro to the amount of different magical channeling power the game has. a.k.a. Mana, Stamina, Vim, Psi, Equilibrium, and more. It adds variety and explicitly shows the player that no magic type is the same.11- The player can learn some skills they would never possibly have by equipping certain items.12- The ability to stroll through easy levels.13- Inscriptions and runes are freaking nice. I have never seen a rogue-like game doing that sort of system before.14- The dungeon balancing system is gold.Cons:1- I know it's a rogue-like game, but it's not meant to be completed without dying at least once, no matter how strong you are. You will either have a stupid death, or a big monster will exploit your weakness and insta-kill you (props to High Peak) (more info below the cons)2- Certain classes are heavily unbalanced compared to others. Example: Play as a Doombringer, and then switch to an Alchemist. You'll feel the difference.3- Dungeon balancing system not working for High Peak. If there was ONE PLACE in which this system SHOULD have worked.... it just didn't budge.Sit down guys, it's story time.First character I made, was an elf archer. Nothing special. He died after I got ambushed by a hand saw guy. GOLD.The second character I made (with permadeath off *coughs*) was the most ignorant guy I could've ever created. A Higher Doombringer. I would simply run through hordes of enemies without a problem, no biggy. That's the character I used to learn about the game, the story and to explore Maj'Eyal and the Far East.The best/worst experience I can tell you guys, was basically as I entered High Peak (last level of the game). I quickly noticed mobs 17 levels above mine. ""Wtf is that supposed to mean?"". Luckily my character was just an ignorant prick, so I started ""playing"" the game. As I cleared areas and moved to other areas of High Peak, I noticed the level difference between me and the mobs was getting bigger and bigger. ""Now that's a problem"". Plus, all the mobs there seem to confuse you, blind you, time warp you, pin you down, slow you down, silence you, and... the worse in my case... disarm you, every... freaking... turn. ""Wtf am I supposed to do?? I can't even calculate how many turns I'll have until I can cast certain skill, because I'm slow and being time warped"". I felt like playing the game inside a vortex while high on heroine, because.. oh man... all of the status effects actually play a visual role on your screen (which is a pro). I wish I could tell you about my final boss experience, but that's way too much for now. Even though it was serious BS, I give my High Peak experience a 10/10. That's simply a rogue-like game for ya.

												Tales of Maj'Eyal (TOME) is a viciously addictive roguelike adventure which contains a number of key features that both improve the gaming experience overall and crucially distances itself from other run-of-the-mill roguelikes. It is 2D and turn based, preferring gameplay and depth over graphical wizardry.One important distinction between TOME and other roguelikes is the lack of emphasis on procedural generation. TOME actually has a plot, one that spans continents and the void between worlds, a story of darkness, magic and of course world domination. Throughout each playthrough, the story is the same, albeit with some slight alterations/additions depending on the actions you take and the starting class you select. There is a world map, and the major story locations do not change. Although the layout of each dungeon is procedurally generated, this is not empasised as a selling point of the game - it is merely a tool used to highlight the other qualities this game possesses. And boy are there a lot of qualities.First and foremost - the character classes. Good luck finding a more comprehensive, deep and exciting set of classes in any other roguelike, or any other GAME for that matter. TOME has over 15 of these, ranging from the stalwart Bulwark to the insidious Shadowblade to the righteous Sun Paladin, TOME has you covered for any kind of playstyle you wish to try. Each class then has a vast array of talent branches to follow, and the branches you choose to develop will essentially create a subset of the class you have chosen. The customisation possibilities are massive, resulting in a lot of replayability and tactical flexibility.Combat is a highly tactical turn based affair, with a strong emphasis on positioning, cooldowns, and your innate knowledge of your own abilities versus your opponent's. Once within your view, every enemy you encounter can be right-clicked on to view their statistics, abilities (passive and active) and resistances. There are no consumables in TOME. The use of each of your skills and items works on a cooldown system, and managing these cooldowns effectively will make the difference between you slaying a boss or becoming a small stain on a tower floor.And believe me, the latter will happen far more often than the former if you're not prepared, because TOME is HARD. Hard as in one-hit-kill hard. Hard as in the game gives you 3 options - Rogulike (1 life), Adventure (gain lives as you level up) and Exploration (infinite lives) - and taking the Roguelike option early on will result in tears. Hard as in some of the more powerful enemies in the game are comprised of two separate random character classes, and God help you if you face one with two even remotely synergistic classes under its belt.And to be honest, if there's one thing that drives me nuts about TOME, it is the difficulty. No doubt this makes me a console casual, but I'm serious. The difficulty of TOME is not embedded within the general gameplay, such as a game like Dark Souls, but rather in its frightening inconsistency of enemy threat. The existence of enemies with randomly combined abilities, together with the fact that there are over 10 different damage types (Fire Cold Darkness Light Mind Temporal Blight Nature bleh) means that at some point (normally after you've spent 10 minutes breezing through a horde of useless trash mobs) you will suddenly bump into a Godlike terror that sends you screaming into the abyss of death with a single, sloppy blink, simply due to having the perfect storm of resistances, abilities and relative level that results in a big tick in the Rekt column. Despite my affection for this wonderful, deep and mechanically interesting game, it is also by far the game I have rage-quitted the most.TL:DR Version....Good - Excellent character classes, tactical combat and involving storyline.Bad - Insane difficulty spikesOverall - if you enjoy a good tough roguelike, you should already have this game!

												A very good introduction to classical roguelikes. TOME streamlines some things while keeping true to the formula of old school games like Nethack, ADOM, and Brogue. There's a free version that's basically the same as the paid version - you can download it from the TOME website if you're not sure you want to buy this yet.TOME has automatic identification. You also get an item called a transmogrification chest, which basically cashes out your loot while you're still in the dungeon - reducing the risk of overencumbrance or loot saturation. TOME also has a modern engine and tileset, although the tileset is rather ugly. Most importantly for new players, there are five difficulty settings and three permadeath settings. The permadeath settings are especially useful, because they provide the option to 1) explore with unlimited lives, 2) play the game as intended, but with limited lives, and 3) play with permadeath like a true roguelike.While it has convenience features, TOME is still an old school roguelike. Beating it without spoilers is a large undertaking, although not as difficult as Nethack. The different dungeons/areas are all different types of difficulty and as a level one character you might wander into a powerful monster's lair and get immediately annihilated. This is the kind of game where you'll need a wiki open most of the time if you're not a masochist.TOME is also very feature-complete. Not only is there a standard story/open-world mode, but there is also an arena and endless dungeon. The Steam Workshop opens up modding opportunities. There is a huge amount of lore (my estimate so far is at least the length of a full book). There are lots of classes, many of which only become avaiable to you once you've reached a certain point in the game, which ensures there's always something fresh. It has over a thousand achievements, which is the highest out of any game on Steam (when it first came out Steam couldn't even handle it, the devs had to work with Valve for a few weeks to get them working properly).One thing that really spices up the game for me is the ability to play as anti-magic. There's a faction in the world of TOME that is violently opposed to arcane magic. You can join them as long as you don't use any arcane magical items or cast spells. It's not as much of a challenge as it seems because there are non-arcane ""natural"" enchantments too, so anti-magic is a valid choice for story, roleplaying, or gameplay variation. It makes melee classes quite a bit more interesting and immersive.I highly recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal for people who are interested in getting into classic roguelikes, or old roguelike fans who want to play something newer.

												This is such a deep, challenging, engrossing and replayable game. There really aren't enough games like this in the world! A really excellent roguelike, with a great UI and a lot of the chaff cut out. It's very combat centric, but with a believable world and a lot of great gameplay options. Rather importantly the designer has not been afraid to throw out poor features - potions are replaced by limited cooldowns, hunger clock doesn't exist, no item identification, etc. It's so focussed, and because it's so focussed it goes into extreme depth in producing a complex and interesting experience.There's a good reason this has won Roguelike of the Year for many years running - it's simply the best there is, in a class of its own. There are lots of other great roguelikes of course, but there's only one ToME.			"

												You want this game. Trust me, you do.Not convinced? Alright. Before I get into anything, you don't even have to take my word for it. Go to the te4 website and play the game for free. Yes, the full game, minus donator features which are in no way necessary. But you'll want to donate anyway, because it's that good of a game. (Trust me)Are you a fan of Roguelikes? What are you doing? How have you not played this yet? For shame.Not a fan or never really played traditional roguelikes? Well then...I bought this game in December of 2014. I've played well over 300 hours since then and still play it regularly. How many games do you own can you honestly say you play regularly two years after buying it?And I still haven't nearly seen everything. I've beaten the game *once* on normal roguelike in that time. Yes, it's a difficult game. I see a number of reviews complaining that the combat is simplistic and that you either steamroll over things or die. Well, if you approach something that you can't steamroll over as if you can and don't attack strategically, ya, it's going to kill you. The world is dangerous and death is around every corner. Be prepared. There will be scenarios where you can't be prepared and you will experience 'cheap' deaths. Such is the nature of roguelikes. Anything can happen. Just roll a new character and let the fun begin again. You'll get used to doing that.If you're not someone who's attracted by the idea of permanant death, don't worry, there are options for multiple, or even infinite in the donator/steam version, lives. That combined with many difficulty levels, you'll surely be able to find the difficulty that's right for you.Trust me. If you like roguelikes, fantasy, stratagy, turnbased combat, adventuring, death, worldsaving, kitties, angry orcs, god-slaying cephalopods, more death, achievements, vacuums that suck up your free time, or fun, you'll like this game. Trust me. It's got all of these in plenty.*Still* not convinced? Ok, like I said, go try it for *free* from te4.org. Or you can trust me. You won't regret it. It's a fantastic game.			"

												I hate roguelikes. I like difficult games but roguelikes are the antithesis of fun to me. I hate losing my progress, I hate not being able to save scum, I hate dying and losing the feeling of satisfaction just when my character is starting to get somewhere. That being said, I am in love with Tales of Maj'Eyal. It's (shockingly) a roguelike turn-based RPG with varying levels of roguelikeness. For example, when I die - and I die a lot - I choose to start over at level 1 with the same character rather than make an entirely new one every time.At first glance it looks like some college kid's freshman project, but the UI is clean and has all the information you need without seeming overwhelming. The writing is often hilarious and the lore is deep and engaging. Character sheets, stats, and numbers make me gibber and hyperventilate, so if that's your thing prepare to pore over your character until your eyes bleed. The world has a surprising amount of depth with many races and political/social dynamics between them. At 7 bucks it's really a no-brainer if you like RPGs or turn-based combat; it's definitely one of the best games I'd played in the genre.			"

												This game does some things that push it above other roguelikes in terms of fun:1) Interface is very player-friendly compared to most roguelikes. You can pretty much play the game with just your mouse if you want to.2) The player character is actually decently powerful at the very start. You can one-shot vermin and easily take down wild animals. It's not like most roguelikes where the player will probably get butchered by random crab. You'll only die to huge swarms of enemies or powerful unique enemies.3) The world is significantly less random than in other roguelikes. The actual structure of dungeons are randomized, but the dungeons' content and locations are chosen from a fairly short list.Basically - The game is closer to being a normal RPG than most roguelikes, and it's more fun because of that.

												I have played rogue likes for years, poured thousands of hours into them. The is one thing I can say about Tome. It is by far the best I have played. The difficulty is perfect on standard settings, making you feel challenged without feeling cheap, nearly every time you die you can go back and look at why. Usually debuffs or a lack of resistances. It makes builds often be fluid as you level around what you need and what you equipment provides. Higher difficulties provide and even bigger challenge, whilst still feeling fair, your decisions have to be on point, a wrong move can mean death. The unlocks are numerous and range from races and classes to little cosmetic changes. If you enjoy roguelikes, I highly reccomend this game, if you're new to roguelikes I think this is a perfect place to get aquainted with them			"

												Although it is hard to get into in a way from the sheer information you have to know, none of the difficulty in the game involves having to learn a deep crafting system(there is one in the embers of rage expansion, but its really simple, and completely optional for most classes), having to grind, or having to get amazing rng drops (at least on the reasonable difficulty levels). Even then players that are bad/new at roguelikes can just change the difficulty level/the amount of lives they get to enjoy the game without fear of losing progress.With or without the difficulty, you will still get the gripping gameplay of a roguelike (although it is of course better if you have a chance of dying). Additionally, there are many unique classes in the game so that you can find a playstyle that suits you.Overall, I believe it is the best roguelike of all time, because it keeps the good things about roguelikes and avoids most of the annoying things about them.

												There is little point in writing a review for this game and even less in reading one. A nearly full version of the game is freely available from the game developer's site at te4.org. If you enjoy the game (which I'm sure that you will), then you can buy it to unlock the last few features. If it isn't your cup of tea (you monster), then you are none the poorer.I'll go ahead and write my pointless review, though. I have nothing better to do with my life.Tales of Maj'Eyal (TOME) is a quirky, old roguelike that has seen a few iterations. Once “Tales of Middle Earth” it has morphed, refined, and evolved over the years stripping out the Tolkien story elements and replacing them with quasi-World of Warcraft story elements. It's still changing and improving, new patches are always under development.I am ambivalent about the story. I like that there are no REAL bad guys, nor faultless heroes, everyone is just looking out for themselves and their own. Even the demons have legitimate gripes and may in fact be right. On the other hand it's all rather shallow, and borrows a little too heavily from WoW. Elves toy with magic out of their league, blow up planet and shattering continents, some elves turn into naga, a group of humans are trapped on another continent hounded by orcs, where have I heard this before? Player motivation is limited to “Maybe there is treasure there?” and “I heard a rumor about this place, maybe there I can murder something?”Honestly though, who plays a roguelike for the story? Gameplay is where TOME shines and why it is probably my favorite game right now. TOME is a self-declared “tactical roguelike”. You'll need to carefully manage cooldowns and move around the battlefield to survive. Some of the bosses can really tax your ability to juggle offensive and defensive spells.There are many classes to try, no two of whom play the same. Some classes are great at jumping on opponents and soaking damage, others can dance around the battlefield dodging arrows and picking enemies off one at a time. Even the mages have a great variety, from the long range nuking elemental Archmage to the short range heal-and-shield celestial Anorithil.This game also sports a massive amount of mods and player content. People have created new classes, races with unique starting areas, and additional quests. Check out the steam workshop but also the developer's site, as some people only post their mods there.My biggest gripe is that the game is a little too random. There are too many stats and most of them are worthless to any given character. Multiple times I've gotten to mid-game without finding any useful gear, either from drops or shops. Rares, opponents with player abilities, and random bosses can be obscenely powerful, some can't even be killed and you have to run away from them.As for the DLC they are both great additions and should be purchased. One warning, the new classes added to the game can make certain rares really tough if you don't know how to handle them. The Embers of Rage campaign is a sequel to the base game and might spoil some of the story for you. I recommend buying the base game first and purchasing the DLC once you have beaten the game at least once.			"

												A pretty good rogue. It's not about graphics but the gameplay obviously.  What really works for me personally about the game is that it is effectively one long endurance battle(I've been a long distance runner for many years and it's a similar mentality). It's randomized, progression is inevitable(both in your character, and forced upon you), you can choose a number of ways to fight between the various classes, etc. but again you must always be alert in order to succeed. Or you lose everything.I enjoy not feeling completely alone in this game.... because it has a chat. Sure, it's most obvious use is for help questions, but it's much more like dark souls in that you see people dying, world events occurring, and what forms is a sense of unity in the community despite everyone being alone on their own journey.The game is free from the website, but why not buy it for the cheap price anyway?Fun to play when you need something casual, too.

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike in its best possible form. Assuming you're familiar with roguelikes, ToME's main draw is its combat. Whereas games like Angband, Nethack and the like have a lot of focus on navigating the dungeons and managing your items, ToME sets itself apart from other RLs through its tactical approach to combat. In ToME, every class is absolutely loaded with skills and abilities. Passive perks, active spells, buffs and the like. There's a class for everyone and a lot of fun to be had with them, and combined with the races you've got a lot of potential for characters. You could play a Berserker and cut people down through your bloodlust, an Alchemist who crafts potions and bombs on the fly to tear apart a crowd, or a Paradox Mage and change the perspective through the manipulation of spacetime itself. Each class has tons of abilities and skill trees, and you can invest into specific types of abilities (say I wanted to focus on grappling instead of one-handed skills) to suit your tastes or your needs for that situation. Combat is a matter of knowing when to use your abilities and resource management. Using an ability puts it on a cooldown and uses up a certain percentage of a turn. Some abilities don't take any time at all, some may use up your entire turn. Each one has a different range, a different effect and a different cost. Summoning skeletons, controlling minds, throwing enemies across the room, and stopping time are among the many abilities you can learn within the game.Ability costs are an important element. Early classes such as Mages and Warriors may use mana, which is about as straightforward as it gets. The more advanced professions may use alternative resources such as Hate, which is built by attacking and being attacked - or Paradox, which can be used freely, but the more it's used, the higher the chance for you to be affected by random effects such as teleporting and spell backfire. Learning how to effectively manage these resources is half of the challenge, and as you get stronger and fight tougher enemies you'll need every bit of your wits and patience if you want to make it out alive. As with other roguelikes, there's of course plenty of equipment and items to find, and it ranges from armor and weapons with random stats to powerful, unique items that may have a little more behind them.While it's not central to the game in any way, there actually is quite a bit of information on the world you're in. You'll find little lore pages scattered around the world which tell you just a little bit more about Maj'Eyal. For anyone who doesn't care, the game doesn't force this on you in any way, but for those who want a little extra, it's there.The game actually has a wonderful presentation given the genre. The little tiles for the characters and maps look quite nice and I can totally tell what I'm looking at, so there's that. The music is nothing to write home about but it's all good stuff and fits the environments well, making my dungeon crawls quite the enjoyable romp. The HUD and info are all pretty clear and easy to understand, and as you get more skills the hotbar expands so you've got everything in one place. You can play the entire thing with mouse, keyboard, or with both, which is nice. It's always nice to keep your options open and luckily there's a lot of em.Interestingly, there's also online servers. You can store your characters online and keep items in a cloud vault to transfer them between characters. If you access your profile online it'll show all your characters and everything, which is a neat touch. There's a global chat too and the community is very friendly, which is great! If you die, your death is also broadcasted to the entire server, so you have extra pressure. It's a needless feature, but a great one nonetheless.Key Points+ Roguelike combat is indeed challenging and tactical+ Solid music that really helps with the atmosphere+ Classes are all fun to play and interesting+ Optional lore pages do great in providing players extra incentive and fleshing out the world+ Comprehensible and easy to use UI+ Serverside saves!Get If- You LOVE roguelikes- Smashing goblins with energy blasts you rewound through time and blasting foes with your blood sounds like your cup of tea- You LOOOOVE roguelikes- You're looking for something combat-centricFinal VerdictA must-play, and it's cheap as dirt too. There's a free version on the website but if you can, support the dev and buy it on Steam. You get neat perks and stuff for it, and the replay value as is typical for roguelikes, is practically infinite.			"

												I have had steam for a very long time and I've enjoyed many a game in my day. However, I have yet to play a game compelling enough to make me want to take the time to write a review; until now.Tales of Maj'Eyal is a rare kind of game. On the surface, it doesn't look like much, but there is so much depth and complexity to this game, its simple appearance doesn't do it any justice (not that there is anything wrong with the appearance). I say this is rare because I feel that most games do the opposite; they may have amazing visuals, but often fall short when it comes to depth and complexity. Visuals don't hold my interest very long if the game doesn't have much else to offer. What it lacks in visuals, it makes up for in mechanics.This game is a rogue-like RPG, but it changes a few things up. For one, there is no need to eat. Some may argue that this detracts from the rogue-like experience, and normally I would probably agree, but I feel that this game is more focused on the tactical combat aspect as opposed to the survival aspect, and I commend it in that regard. Another difference is the lack of potions. Instead of potions, which require farming to replenish, this game uses something called inscriptions, in the form of runes or infusions. These inscriptions fill the same role as potions, but they operate on a cooldown instead of being limited-use, effectively eliminating any need for farming potions, which is a fantastic idea, in my opinion.The game is difficullt. You will die, a lot. At the time of writing this review, I have 376.8 hours under my belt and I have only beaten the game once, but I don't plan on giving up any time soon. One thing that makes the unforgiving nature of the game more bearable are the persistent unlocks. When you first boot up the game, you will have a relatively limited selection of birth options, in the form of races and classes. As you play, you unlock more birth options permanently, in addition to unlocking new game modes and even skill trees. There is a ton of replayability here.The developers of this game are consistently polishing the game and considering feedback from the community. A cool feature of this game is an in-game chat room where you can ask for tips, discuss strategies, and talk directly to developers. It's a great feature and is probably the closest thing to multiplayer we will see in a game like this. You can tell that the developers poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this game to make something exceptional. And they have succeeded.This game is nearly perfect in my eyes. It is an exemplary rogue-like, and although it does some things a little differently, it does them extremely well. It has come such a long way and gets better every day. Do not hesitate if you are on the fence. Send me a personal message and I will convince you. This game is worth every penny and the developers deserve support for the great work that they do.10/10 Would get clobbered into troll soup again.TLDR; Buy this game.			"

												The best roguelike you can buy.  There is an insane amount of depth regarding class choices, race choices, skill choices, optional sidequests, difficulty levels and a deep, engrossing storyline with all sorts of lore.  My favorite feature is the in-game chat where you can ask any questions that you might have during the game which is much simpler than trying to dig through a wiki or forum.  It sacrifices some of the more traditional roguelike features, namely having permadeath disabled by default (there is an option for it) and not requiring the player to eat.  Additionally, the world is mostly static with some of the dungeons being static as well.  Of course, the large majority of dungeons are randomly generated so there is always a changing strategy.  My favorite roguelike, 10/10.			"

												If you're looking at this game and its reviews, you probably have certain curiosity and interest in the ""old style"" or ""true"" Roguelike games. You might've tried some but have been put off by their sheer complexity and extremely steep learning curve, so you've come looking for something a bit less complex, something that offers a good entry to the genre.So the question is whether this game can be considered as such?In my personal opinion, yes it can.It combines many elements from roguelikes (such as random generation, permanent death, statistical minmaxing, variety)and elements from modern (RPG) games (such as UI&actionbar, character&story progression)For a new player the system will feel familiar and accessible enough to not put off by it while still offering deeply strategic and intricate systems for more advanced players.As you might've already read from other reviews, you can get the almost full version from te4.org for free.

												I don't always play roguelikes, but when I do, it's either Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or Tales of Maj'Eyal. The additional stuff added in each of the regular patches for this game probably have more content than the average RPG on Steam. The only negative I can think of is that the game takes a while to learn (I'm 200 hours in and still am learning new things), though that's also an upside if that type of game appeals to you.			"

												Currently this is my most played game on Steam, and for a good reason - the number of options for character building, equipment combinations and unlockables in ToME is enough to warrant hundreds upon hundreds of playthroughs. Granted, many of them are going to be short - this IS a roguelike, after all - but the game has enough to offer for both experienced veterans of the genre and explorers who are just in for the sights. ToME features a huge main campaign with a pre-determined world map and randomly placed quest dungeons, several dozens of class/race combos with unique skill trees and expansive battle mechanics to liven up the experience.Unlike many other modern roguelikes, ToME's one and only focus is combat. Even though there's an overworld and a bunch of peaceful cities, don't look at them as more than just trade hubs. What you're gonna do 99% of the time is look for a way out of yet another impossible situation that you recklessly rushed into, be it an unexpected boss or a group of trash mobs that you foolishly underestimated. Luckily, the player is always equipped with numerous tools to deal with trouble or escape to safety - there are runes, infusions, magic artifacts, proccing gear, abilities, status effects designed to keep you alive and your enemies either dead or, at least, a safe distance away. Learning how to use all of these is a different beast entirely, and you'll quickly find that even the normal difficulty playthrough might take you more than a hundred hours to master (even though the total time spent for an actual normal playthrough run without deaths might not exceed 10 hours in total). Once you've done it, higher difficulties unlock, and there's a good chance you also discovered some new classes/races to play along the way, so that your next game is completely different from the previous attempt.1.5k achievements (currently the record-holder on Steam), insane replayability, a quest progression to keep you motivated, and brutally difficult yet fair fights in the classic turn-based Rogue fashion - there really isn't much else to say. ToME deserves all the praise it gets, and the regular updates only make it that much better.			"

												50 hours into this game and not planning to stop anytime soon.This game is fantastic! Cant stop playing 10/10So much depth its almost overwhelming.  After 50 hours I still discover new things and have so much more to learn.The classes are so varied/fun/unique and there are plenty of them (most of them locked at the begining of the game).10 years of developpment and it shows.  There is so much content here it makes AAA games look like games from google play store.Get this game now!! The value you get for the price is insane. "

												i dont go out of my way to post reviews unless a game is really bad or they stole my money, but im going out of my way to recommend this game to support the devs and this 'genre' of crpgs if you could call it that.my friend that i play dominions 4 with told me about it and how it used to be tales of middle earth. im a big fan of neverwinter nights 1, which is probably my favorite game of all time next to deus ex, so i thought i'd check this out.i had never played an ASCII style rpg and that threw me off at first. i was like 'wtf is this' because i was ignorant and i didnt understand. i died over and over before even getting to the damned troll king or out of the first area, but with every new character i made i learned a little more. i slowly figured out the stat system, how the mechanics work together to create synergy, how to kill and stay alive, when to fight and when to run, how to avoid pitfalls and confidence traps. eventually i grew strong enough to go out into the world of maj eyal. being someone who cares a lot about lore i read every scrap of paper, i read the inscriptions on the statues of the king and queen in the capital city and learned about the weird oppressive history of the place. it blew my mind.although its something thats off the beaten track - dont be scared. this is a diamond of a game if you like dungeons and dragons or crpgs in general. difficult, deep, satisfying. i would highly recommend this game. it is one of the best crpgs i have ever played.

												It is pretty rare for me to play any game beyond 50 hours. This is partly due to my lack of time, and partly due to the fact that I jump from one game to the next at a rapid rate. Few games can hold my attention for very long, as many are quickly consigned to the heap of unplayed or lightly games cluttering my Steam collection.Tales of Maj'Eyal is one of the few that have captured my interest and kept my interest, as one of only 7 or 8 games that I've played beyond 50 hours (four of which are either MMOs or server-based games where I idle). Part of the reason that Tales of Maj'Eyal is so special to me is that it is both flexible and complex at the same time. As with many of the other rogue-likes that I have played, Tales of Maj'Eyal features some potentially difficult moments and countless opportunities for deaths. When I first started playing Tales of Maj'Eyal, I died quite often in Trollmire, one of the starting zones. Even now, with more than 50 hours under my belt, it's still not uncommon for me to face various mid to high level enemies (stone throwing giants and dragons in particular) that can potentially one-shot my character.And here's where the first appeal of Tales of Maj'Eyal comes in. Unlike many rogue-likes, death doesn't mean the end of your character. In the standard adventure mode, you can come back to life after one death (or more often, as you level). In exploration mode, you can come back to life an infinite number of times. Not only that, the resurrection NPC allows you to resurrect on the world map instead of right where you died, especially helpful if you went into battle against an enemy that you have no chance of beating. If you want the standard rogue-like permadeath mode, Tales of Maj'Eyal offers that too, along with three difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard). Even if this sort of convention goes against standard rogue-likes, it does make this game more forgiving and more open to someone like me who has limited time to play and/or start over new characters. When I do want to experiment with new characters and playstyles, Tales of Maj'Eyal offers a fair range of both races and classes. Each of these races and classes has different skill trees, and one playthrough offers a different experience from the next. I started out playing a defensive warrior type, then moved on to play an archer showering arrows, then a summoner leading an army, and now am experimenting with a mage that manipulates time. As you play through the game and complete tasks and quests, even more options are unlocked.This flexibility and complexity is what makes Tales of Maj'Eyal the perfect rogue-like for me. Oh sure, other rogue-likes offer benefits that Tales of Maj'Eyal doesn't. Dungeons of Dredmor has (in my opinion) better item mechanics and better art. Elona (YMMV) offers more complexity, and there are so-called action rogue-likes that might provide more instant gratification without so much frustration. I suppose the graphics are somewhat outdated as well (though, pretty good compared to many other rogue-likes).When I first started playing Tales of Maj'Eyal, I thought of the game's relationship to the original Rogue similar to that of World of Warcraft to Everquest. Perhaps it might be insulting to compare Tales of Maj'Eyal to World of Warcraft, but some elements of this comparison are apt. LIke WoW, Tales of Maj'Eyal makes the rogue-like more accessible, more graphically attractive, and hopefully, more popular to a general audience.That last element is what I truly want to become a reality. I have no idea how popular Tales of Maj'Eyal actually is (not being much of a forum goer or researcher on the topic), but I feel like it definitely deserves far more attention and acclaim than it receives. Perhaps a mobile version might help improve its exposure to the general public?For anyone who's interested or simply curious about this game, there's no reason not to give it a try. After all, the full base game, with most of the features, can be played for free on the Tales of Maj'Eyal official website. If you feel like the game is right for you, you can then buy it, either on the official website or on Steam to get the donator features (special class, various cosmetic features, vault, etc) and then, when you want more, buy the DLC expansions.In short, why is Tales of Maj'Eyal a great game for me and potentially a great game for you? I think it comes down to the fact that Tales of Maj'Eyal is a rogue-like that can be accomodated to your tastes. The difficulty can be whatever you want it to be, the playstyle can be whatever you want it to be, and the game is sufficiently long enough and filled with quests and lore that it'll be hundreds of hours before you, me, or anyone else could come close to experiencing it all.Again, there's no harm in giving it a try. Download the game on the website to see if it's right for you. If it isn't, then you'll just move on to something else. However, if you're like me, perhaps you will discover that Tales of Maj'Eyal is a gem of a game, one that really stands out from the others and shines like a beacon of a light in the vast collection of games available on Steam.

												The only things I can say about this game is ""This!"" and proceed to rub it into your face if you even mutter the term ""roguelike"" and go as far as to say that this game is ""too cheap for it's content"". I may not be able to be a monthly donator, but hot digidy am I going to buy every single expansion as soon as they pop up.Tales of Maj'Eyal is - albeit a tiny bit linear - a sub-randomly-generated roguelike adventure that relies more on tactics and availible active skills than any other roguelike game I've played this far (if we don't take keyboard-mashing MMOs such as WoW, EVE and others).The character progression offers vast customization and has decent impact on your playing style, and that's if you only take one single class into consideration, and there are maaaany various classes (which you have to unlock by playing out certain in-game events such as defeating bosses, gathering lore, completing sidequests or just as rewards for progression). The fact that you have so many options in such a (relatively) linear roguelike gives plenty of replayability, an I'm not even talking about unlockable difficulties and mods that add more challenge, randomness and options. Yes, this game has many, many mods.If you like roguelikes, difficult games in general and good character progression, get this game!			"

												A very traditional hard-as-balls roguelike. What sets this apart from other genrecompetitors like DCSS or nethack is the very accessible interface and overall decent presentation with a very good default tileset (that can be swapped out, if you feel like it).Make no mistake, I have barely scratched the surface of what this game holds. But there is an insame amount of stuff in this, half a dozen races, several ""sub""races, classes with subclasses and almost all of them come with a unique opening. Very impressive stuff. And everytime I die, even if its in the early stages due to some unfair RNG, I still keep rerolling thanks to the massive amounts of content, every run is different and you will always find another titbit of lore or a new quest.Its hard to not miss the references to other fantasy worlds. This used to be set in the Tolkien universe, but for the sake of it being a commercial product, all of the connections had to be removed. Still it holds an interesting world with unique characters and well-written lore.If you're into roguelikes, ToME is almost a mustplay. It takes a lot of time to get used to its ""rogueiness"" and I recommend changing some of the horrible default keybindings, but once you get out of that beginnerslump, you don't want to stop playing.With over 1350, this certainly is the game with the most achievements I've ever played.

												This is one of the best games I ever played! I'm not particularly a fan of the Rogue-like genre, because I don't like the idea of progression loss. YET, I only like to play this game in the Adventure mode - the standard mode that the game was made to be played with limited lives (I eventually gonna try Rogue-like mode, with just 1 life). If you don't like this, you can play in exploration mode, that gives you infinite lives.Tales of Maj'Eyal has a very immersive gameplay, regardless of its simple graphics. The story is pretty good and interesting, but what shines is the well composed challenging elements. It's different from riddles or gimmicks that other games put you through. The situations that ToME put you are complex, composed by various elements, that you need to judge and measure to take decisions. THIS. You FEEL the situation, you feel the DANGER. And you must to analyse and find a solution that can be simple or complex, still there is not only one solution, it is circumstantial. Sometimes you can't see solutions to a challenge but you progressively learn how to deal with it. One of the best feeling that the game gives you is the discovery of a solution to a apparently impossible situation.Yes, the challenges are complex. But, the game gives you various options. Whereas you learn the dangers that you can face, you learn how to counter it. And, for this, you have a vast character building system, with numerous races and classes that you can combo and choose between vastly different playstyles. Each class and race have different ways to deal with situations, some classes and races are best to deal with some types of dangers, some have flaws that you must find a way to cover. And to deal with that, you have Trinkets, items and equipments - that gives you habilities to use -, you can loot or buy them in shop - you must choose wisely what you want to keep with you.The exploration element of this game is good, there's tons of secrets to discovery and unlockables enable, like races, classes, and skill trees options to make your characters. The game has around 1500 achievments to unlock, if you are a achievment hunter.The storyline is very good and interesting too, but beyond the main storyline, you have a deep and complex universe, which you unfold gradually in various logs and pieces of story that you must find in dialogue options, logs, places, doing secret quests and getting achievments.The one-guy dev team is active and keeping the game alive, with online support, events, random blesses of the DarkGod, updates and expasions. The game is still alive. Even though you can play the game for free, it's definitely a game worth supporting. You can donate directly or buy the Steam version, those gives you donator privillege. Let's Feed The Dark God to bring more Awesomeness to us!Finally, if I should describe this game in few words:Sheer Badassery!			"

												Slept on this game for a long time while I was totally consumed with Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.  Didn't think any roguelike was capable of dethroning DCSS.  I'm still not convinced that ToME is better, but it's damn close.  Normally, the idea of quests in a roguelike immediately turns me off, but they're non-intrusive here, dialogue around quests with NPCs is minimal and in general the whole experience doesn't really feel repetative, and if you choose to read the text, it's suprisingly good actually.  Kinda cool collecting the various bits of lore that's scattered around dungeons.If you're a junkie for stats, you'll find them in spades here.  I don't think I've ever played another dungeon crawler or roguelike with so much variety in all of the randomized items you'll find and different types of damage.  There are some extremely creative modifiers that I doubt you'd find in big budget crawlers like Diablo III, probably even rivals the depth of Path of Exile.There's just an incredible amount of content here that's flawlessly executed.  Top notch developers who seem to eat/sleep/breathe this game with continued support and very friendly as well.  DarkGod freqents the in-game chat and don't be too surprised if he happens to use his godlike powers and transforms your character into a pirate or grant you other bizarre powers on a whim.It takes a bit to learn all of the rules and details but it's totally worth it.  When you factor in the low price (I believe there's still a free version to play if you're interested in trying it out?), it's absolutely one of the best games on Steam.			"

												""Do you recommend this game?""Yes, yes I do. When in search for something new to play, I came across this game while it was on sale for a measley 2.00. That also included all the DLCS. I had never played this type of game before, and if you look at my games library you would know this to be true.  I almost passed this game by but the 1620 achievements caught my eye. 1620 achievements for a 2.00 game? Admittedly, it was the achievements that made me purchase the game, what the heck, 2.00, if i dont like this game, no harm done, right? I love collecting achievements, although I am not good at it! So, there I was creating my character, giving them a name and choosing a player tile. I entered the world of Maj'eyal a lvl 1 archer. I died as a lvl 1 archer. Game Over. My character had disappeared. There was no, try again. No respawn. Nope. Game Over. My first lesson on what Roguelike means. ;) There is different lvls of difficulty though, you do not have to play it as roguelike until you get to know the game really well. Exploration mode allows you to play with infiinite lifes, Adventure with limited lifes. I am probably the worst player at this game, I am still learning the game 30 hours in, and admittedly the highest lvl I have made it to is lvl 16 on normal mode. I have lost track of how many times i have died and had to start over - but that is the testimony to the game. I keep coming back to try again.........and again.......and again. This game is fun and really a challenge. Its cheap even when not on sale and worth the money.  "

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is one of the bigger Roguelikes that along with Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and Dwarf Fortress help set the standards for what makes a good Roguelike. Unlike the two other roguelikes listed above you'll find an actual story being played out along with Lore and Monster Details that really tell you about the world your character is playing in; while not getting in the way of in-game play. Game Mechanics are plentiful but they are spelled out and not hidden from the player. User Interface for the most part is easy to get into and use.There are a couple of hurdles one will need to commit to however in order to play this game - like any Roguelike there is the overall Game Depth and Learning Curve and Tales of Maj'Eyal is no different. Character skills sort of level up similar to what you might find in an MMORPG or Diablo-like, but skills themselves are also much like their counterparts - not descriptive enough to tell you what they do and requiring you have to test them out or read up on them. For people coming from other Roguelikes, you may be thrown off by the sheer Tactical Nature of combat, Additionally it is worth noting that the game is meant to be played in Adventurer Mode - IE, Multiple Lives, not One. Lastly, the game is long - very long. A full run in the original Age of Ascendancy Campaign (The Main Vanilla Campaign that the game started with) from start to actual finish is probably going to be longer then most other Roguelikes bar a few.All in all though, this is a very enjoyable game. Once you get past the couple tidbits that might hold you back or throw you off you'll likely have lots of fun playing with multiple races and classes in separate but distinct ways.			"

												almost 800 hours of playtime and several wins and i still play this game and love every minute.Have you ever play Angband? Nethack? Roguelikes? Old cRPGs?Tales of Maj'Eyal could something you are looking for.ToME offers a wonderfully diverse cast of races/classes and various difficulties to play on, providing high replayability.Each race/class provides a unique assortment of skills and abilities talents that are all chosen as you progress and level-up through out the game, allowing you to effectively be in control of the strength and development of your character.The graphics are very remenant of old-school rpg gaming with some new polish added in.I find the style of graphics and presentation to be one of the endearing and strong aspects of ToME.the simple gaming feel with a complex system in root, where your success is uniquely determined by your choices, actions, and strategies.As a roguelike at its heart, death in game is no stranger.  Sometimes it comes a bit quickly and unexpectedly.Other times you can see your mistakes play out and see where things could have gone better.Death is a natural course of the gameplay, but each subsequent playthrough provides an opportunity to hone your tactics or knowledge to help your next character out.You are rewarded for learning from mistakes and improving your strategies, I feel this is one of the defining strengths for ToME.You can however play with extra lives if perma-death is a bit daunting =)The asking price of $6.99 is extremely generous in my book, as i have spent ten times more money for AAA games and have often played them a fraction of the time that i have spent on ToME.I very highly recommend Tale's of Maj'Eyal anyone who is a fan of older style rpgs, tactical combat, or rewarding skill systems.

												Amazingly complex turn-based roguelike with a huge amount of replay value.  Whatever your style of combat you can find a build that suits you.  The game is well maintained by a developer who obviously cares for his community, takes their input, and keeps improving the game.  Before it made it to Steam I logged over 300 hours and I would estimate I've played maybe 10% of the builds that appeal to me.  Cannot say enough good things about it.			"

												1 of the best roguelike. It is indeed a ""Rogue""-like.Interface is modern. Many frustrating features in other Roguelike is not here.The game play is deep and not between the casual and hardcore.Hardcore player can turn the difficulty their way and casual player can play ""soft"" roguelike.The skill/talent in this game is as deep as most RPG fans will love.Replayability is superb with so much race/class combo.

												The graphics were really offputting at first, but I went ahead and bought because it has received high marks... so glad I did! This is my favorite game right now and probably will be a for a long while! It's nice to find a game that is actually challenging! This game is great and I am looking forward to whatever the devs have in store for updates =)			"

												One of the best rougelikes I've had the pleasure to play, the sheer amount of stuff that this game offers is mindboggling, I recommend this to anyone who likes real rougelikes, and even to people new to the genre, because there are difficulty options that make the game worth playing for min-maxing veterans and unexperienced newcomers alike			"

												Ahh, Tales Of Maj'Eyal. What is there to say about it? Well---Odyessy was hit for 50 nature, 50 temporal, 30 fire--Killed-Ow.Tales Of Maj'Eyal~Spoiler Free Review!~--------NOTE---------This review is based off the majority of my play with mods. For around 90% of my hours on the game, I have spent it with mods. I shall list what mods I used at the bottom of the review, but none are extreme enough to change any of the core concepts of the game. The mods I've used made information easier to understand.Oooh boy. I absolutely love this game. I really, really do. If I had to pick a single game to bring with me into, say, Space, this game would be my pick, hands down.CommunityYou know what's strange for a Rouge-lite game? Having encouragement to directly talk with the community. Yeah, strange, isn't it? Whenever you're in the game, and you're online...you're connected to the community with a button-press away. There's a window on your screen (that isn't intrusive) where people's achievements within the game and conversations are. You can link items and monsters you find to show off to others the items you've found, or to ask for strategies on creatures you've never faced before. I do reccomend a mod called ""Die In Obscurity"" so you don't see how every single person dies. It can overflow the chat at times. Afraid of spoilers from the community? No problem! The moment someone types something that's considered spoilerly, they will be sent to ToME Spoiler Chat. It's an automatic system, so you won't even see a glance of spoilers. I've NEVER had a issue with the community, and have had quite a few conversations with the dev himself, Darkgod. The moderators are absolutely awesome as well! Good on all of you!So, yes, this is indeed a positive for the game. I encourage you, as well, to take part in the community!CombatI'll talk about the story in a bit, but I believe this is to be the BIGGEST draw to the game. The combat.You see, Tales Of Maj'Eyal is complex. This, sadly, can be a heavy drawback for those who would rather actually enjoy it. In every single turn (every single move you make) has a LOT of things considered, from the speed of projectiles flying at you, to how spells affect the enviorment are re-checked to apply their affect again, and how everyone runs around. This is perhaps one of the only turn-based RPGs I know that has a heavy emphasis on mobilty. You CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT run around without a plan. You. Will. DIE. Doesn't matter if you have badass armor and defense-increasing skills on. You cannot block everything or tank everything. Even TANKS in this game have to consider mobility, and know when it's time to run and reposition themselves. The only class that can remotely do this is Bulwark, which I feel is ""THE"" class everyone should play first. They have a rediculous amount of defense, but it won't get you too far in the game alone. Learning the game takes time, and many deaths.On the bright side, this complex combat is actually very satisfying once you understand how it works. There's SO MANY WAYS TO END YOUR FOES. From DEVOURING THEM to YELLING AT THEM TO DEATH. The amount of classes is purely absurd, and to this day I've STILL not tried them all. On top of that, you have Races. Humans, Elves...There's many more, and each has sub-species within it. The reason why I won't say who they are, is because it's considered spoilers. Sorry. Although, I will say there's only a few races that have classes usable only by them, you can mix and match pretty much anything. There's a lot of depth in a single class, and with so many, there's a lot to learn here. On top of that, the loot is satisfying to obtain. I've even carried some things I couldn't use because it just sounded so badass. I ain't giving my Corpsebow to a mere shopkeeper!Also, the difficulty settings are very varied. You have two different kinds that come into play when you play the game. Difficulty, and the Style of the Difficulty.{Easy}{Normal}{Nightmare}---and so on---   Those difficulties change how hard the game is. How strong foe's talents are, the level of the zones, and so on. The higher the difficulty, the more EXP you earn. There are three difficulties locked when you start the game.And the Styles:{Exploration}  Infinite lives. You are beyond death! The difficulty I say you should NEVER play, it ruins the experience. But if you don't like having a bad time, I won't judge you. There are a lot of gorgeous sights to see in the game.{Adventure} You gain lives on select level-ups. Simple, not overpowered, but not the core experience.{Rougelike} ""You ARE your character."" You only have one life. The moment you die, your character is immediately deleted. :gameover: However! You can still find ways to revive yourself in game, such as a rare-as-it-can-get vial. THIS is the Style of difficulty I always play on. It's my preference.AppearanceIt's visuals....are alright. It's your typical fantasy style, but it's not too distracting for me, actually. It's the enviorment I'm in, so I roll with it. It's great for what it is, there's a LOT of variety here! You'll be in space, heaven and hell, wintery landscapes, swamps, and volcanoes! Personally, I like it. But I can see how people might be ""turned off"" by it. Honestly, there's not a lot to say. One of the few games I say imagination works in it's favor!SoundIt serves it's duty. Spells sound like spells, fists sound like fists, steel sounds like steel. There's no glaring issue with the sound, but nor is there anything that stands out as supreme. The soundtrack? Well...The music in the game is the same, it serves what it's meant to do. I honestly have muted the music for a long time now, and have other things in the background, like the news or music. It's one of THOSE kinds of games, despite it's complexity, where you can focus on other things while playing it. It IS turn based, as well.On that note, like how I feel with Sanctuary RPG, once I've played long enough, I'm ""in tune"" with the game, reading information at only a glance, making actions with speed and care. Even when I set the game down for a few weeks, I was very easilly able to get back into this state.StoryThe story of Maj'Eyal is a fantasy, what would you expect? If you can suspend disbelief, you will find so much to read and learn about the word. Well written poems, stories, and last words of daring adventurers before you. There are several campaigns, but the one with the most amount of story is, well, ""Tales Of Maj'Eyal"". There is also the Arena and the Infinite Dungeon. Personally, the Arena isn't very fun to me, but I absolutely LOVE the Infinite Dungeon. You and the endless dungeon crawling experience that this game offers, with nothing in your way beyond blood thirsty monsters and glorious loot. It feels alive.ConclusionAll in all, there's not too many RPGs like this. Where it manages to be...a community driven single player game. It's definately unique in that regard. With such a cheap RPG, why not buy it? Well, the initial ramp of difficulty (and throughout the game, regardless of skill) requires stategy over going wild with a sword, so this isn't the kind of game you can sit down with if you have little time. It respects your time, however, and the community is very helpful, VERY alive...The sound and appearance will not satisfy everyone, but it serves what it lives for. Things sound exactly like they would. I don't think giving it a ""Score"" would satisfy myself with the review, so I'll simply give the answer of ""I highly reccomend this."" To ALL RPG fans!Mods that I use and reccomend.(gahh there is no more room on the review so here have a pastebin with the last tidbit)http://pastebin.com/m2genWSA "

												As an avid roguelike fan with many hours in CDDA, ADOM, Brogue, Dwarf Fortress and Caves Of Qud, I can quite safley say this is a great roguelike with alot of variance in classes and unlocks allowing you to replay multiple times with characters.Game is a good beginning roguelike for anyone looking to get into them.8/10 Solid game(Did i mention sometimes the dev comes in and starts dropping some memes?)

Some of it was in offline mode, some in a non-Steam version.I've enjoyed this game enough to purchase nearly a dozen copies for others, and it's a fantastic roguelike.I'm not going to write a proper review. If you enjoy roguelikes, you owe it to yourself to either purchase this, or try the free version from the ToME4 website.			"

												I'm totally blown away by how fun and how well made this game is.  Small price, small download size, but BIG fun!  It's a nice looking tile set roguelike RPG with a tactical turn-based combat system.  I suggest not using the 'auto-explore' feature so you can get the sense of actually lurking around and wondering what's around the corner, or behind the next door.  Surprisingly enough, you'll come face to face with rare mobs on a fairly regular basis with nice loot, but they're not just going to hand them over to you.  No Siry Bob....you'll have to take it from his/her/it's cold-dead, clawing/oozing/hairy or whatever type of hand.Lots of choices on the type of character you want to play, and you actually unlock more options of all kinds to make your next play characters even better or to try something completely different.  Don't worry, you'll be playing more characters you can count on it.  You can only die so many times, if at all, before your character goes bye-bye to the beyond.  Just use his death as a great excuse to try out that new unlocked race/class/gear or whatever.Anyways, try it out, I'm sure some of you will be caught off-guard by how fun and good the game is for it's download size and price as I mentioned.Oh and forgot to say something for achievement fans.  There's slightly over 1,200 achievements in the game, so I'm sure that will tickle your fancy.			"

												This game is one of the best roguelike dungeon crawlers out there.  The graphics are not spectacular.  Lets face it they look 15 years old.  There's not a storyline with gloriously rendered full motion video cutscenes.  It has one but its absolutely irrelevant.  What it does have is fair, fun, and difficult hack and slash slash and ranged combat with dozens of different classes with tons of fun skills to unlock and enough difficulty levels that you can find one that *will* challenge you.  It has many many hours of content.  All the dungeons, item drops, and monsters are randomized so every game will be a bit different than the last.  Its gameplay aspect is so great that it doesn't need eye candy and filler to fool you into thinking you got good value for your money.  This game is the real deal.If you like roguelikes and appreciate games with adequate difficulty and the threat of permanent death (optional), this is one you should not miss. "

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a must play for anyone who has any kind of interest in the roguelike genre. It's a proper turn-based, grid-based tactical game with perma-death (although you can play it without it if you're a puss :D). Set in the fantasy world of Eyal, a land which is filled with deep lore and interesting stories and characters. The number of races and classes available is huge and the varying combinations of these make the game immensely replayable.. And you'll want to replay it because it's incredibly addictive but also very difficult. (you will die. A lot) The difficulty (something which should be expected from any true roguelike) is not unfair however, and there is always a way in which you could have gotten out of the situation which killed you, you just might not know it untill a few playthroughs later. The more you play TOME, the more options for skills and gear and combinations of these you become aware of and this, in turn will increase your chances of surviving a little bit longer.The game has a huge number of things to unlock by carrying out various actions in the game world, from new races and classes, birth options which affect every character you make thereafter and new skill trees for existing classes. Again, if you have ANY kind of interest in roguelikes (not for everyone for sure) then you owe it to yourself to pick up TOME and spend a few hours learning the basics. If you're anything like me then you will find it hugely satisfying and enjoyable.The game is actually available for free on the website with an option to donate. Donators and people who buy the steam version will get a few extra bits and pieces plus an extra 'donator class', the possesor. Made by one man over a long time, TOME is a labour of love and the creator has no plans to stop anytime soon. The game has recently recieved a free update and more are planned, as well as new future DLC at some point down the line. If your not sure, pick up the free version on the site, I can almost guarentee you'll want to donate or buy it on steam after a few hours playing, it's that good you'll want to give something back and support future dev. Oh and if you like achievements, this game has more than any other game on steam, over 1600 at time of writing :O			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a true Roguelike (i.e. it plays much like Rogue[en.wikipedia.org]).The Good:It is massive.  There's lots of classes, areas, items, and spells, and things to do.  Very little feels redundant or samey.Unlike most Roguelikes, there is a plot.As claimed, there is indeed no need to grind.Permadeath can be turned off with no penalty.  This partially makes up for many of the bad aspects of the game.The Bad:Tales of Maj'Eyal is a true Roguelike.  Most of its flaws are common to most members of the genre.Like most Roguelikes, there are horrendous balance problems.  You will frequently encounter creatures of widely varying levels in the same area.  Some of these enemies move so fast, and hit so hard, just seeing them on your screen almost guarantees death.  If you have permadeath on, and aren't a masochist, you're going to have a bad time.Turning permadeath off doesn't completely solve the balance problems.  It also just feels bad.  Resurrecting where you were, with full hit points and no negative statuses, with the enemies as you left them, results in you either being deathlocked or overpowered.  I would rather it have saved every 5 minutes, then load the save from 5 minutes ago when I die.  That would both feel fairer, and prevent the deathlock problem.  Being able to willingly back up further (lose more progress) would be even better insurance against being deathlocked.Like most Roguelikes, there are terrible guidance problems.  In most Roguelikes this is due to there being no guidance at all.  While Tales of Maj'Eyal has problems with insufficient guidance, it does have some guidance, due to the main quest and side quests directing you to the ‘next’ areas.  However, sometimes you encounter strange interactive widgets and need to decide what, if anything, to do with them.  There is no guidance here, and if you do the wrong thing the results are often lethal.  Tales of Maj'Eyal has somewhat unique problems with malicious guidance.  The main and side quests will frequently send you to places without any hint that you better purchase some items or allocate points in some abilities to counteract the next boss' game-breaking abilities, or simply lead you to locations full of enemies far beyond your level.  If you're going to play this, save yourself some frustration and just look everything that should have been in the game up on a wiki.You will occasionally encounter wandering friendly characters.  They always need to be safely escorted out of the area.  There should be more variety in what they want from you.The Ugly:A few people are complaining about the graphics.  Traditionally Roguelikes didn't have graphics (or sound).  Everything was represented with text characters and you had to learn to read the screen (e.g. @ is the player character).  You could usually select a location on the screen for a more detailed explanation.  While many of us enjoyed using our imagination, it did prevent Roguelikes from being popular with the masses.  The few that have graphics now often adopted them due to running out of ASCII characters to represent things with, before Unicode support was widespread and good monospaced Unicode fonts were available.  So it's a matter of perspective whether Tales of Maj'Eyal has good or bad graphics.			"

Posted: March 4, 2016
												I fell in love with this game when my otherwise normal, default human Sun Paladin character (yes, all holy and loaded with light powers) had acquired an item called 'Taintblight' that not only turned him undead, but also allowed him to retch caustic vomit. This puke was so mighty that it not only healed him and removed status effects, but also damaged opponenets and cleansed their buffs, all in a large radius around my knight. Combined with my power to project a path of sunshine that took no time to traverse, I'd skate into a room full of baddies, glowing all holy light, spew vomit, and then finish everything off with a direct invocation of the sun that's more like a quasar igniting at the edge of a blackhole.Did I mention that my random lamp item that made me undead was called 'Taintblight'?This collision of three entirely different abilities and a crazy and evocative random name generator is only one example of dozens such synergies and strange stories that I have experienced in playing Tales of Maj'Eyal.Of course much of that imagery came from my own willingness to fill in the blanks because Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike run by one guy (as far as I can tell), who has packed in a tremendous amount of lore, options and imagination. The graphics are like sprites from a nineties turned-based game that would run on a 486. The sounds aren't really any better. The muscial score is acceptable, but since the whole affair runs at my leisure, I listen to absolutely anything else while playing.But the value in this game isn't in its looks, but in all the options, variations and odd enemies it offers.While the game can be played like a true roguelike (one life and you're done), there are several difficulty and re-spawn options that help make the game more accessible to players looking for different challenge (and frustration) levels. There are also several unlockable races and classes whose progress is tracked across multiple playthroughs. By opening up more options, the game stays fresh the longer you play.Of course, having so many class and race combinations leads to wild imbalances in capability. Some combinations simply become mathematically better, overall. However, the game throws so many different kinds of enemies and effects that attack, weaken and kill your character in so many ways that almost any character will expose an Achilles Heel at some point in a playthrough.The game has incredible difficulty spikes, so playing true roguelike is recommened only for those with tremendous intestinal fortitude. I recall losing a rogue-like character 20 hours into the game due to missing a debuff icon that I didn't recognize, laid on me by an unusual random boss that was blocked by one of the over-sized two-block larger enemies. Of course, since it's turn based I could have taken a beat and re-examined the fifteen different effects, good and bad, that were on my character at that moment, so the mistake is ultimately mine.That said, I didn't play again for a few days.This does bring up a complaint about the game's lack of documentation. There are a ton of systems packed in, entire mechanics that might only be encountered on playing a particular character class. These often behave differently from every other resource in the game. Am I expending this resource straight away or do I have to build it up? Does this resource have a conflict or synergy with my armor choices or my other talents?All these esoteric, imaginative and rule breaking powers interact in ways that aren't always clear. After logging over a thousand hours in this game, over three years, I still don't know what a few of the stats mean.While most of the dungeons are procedurally generated, some smaller zones are always the same and the overland map only varies based off a handful of bonus zones that require prerequisites to appear. This sameness of the larger world and the horrifically imbalanced and hazardous random patrols make travel between dungeons tedious. But this is a relatively small criticism since the overland travel isn't a large portion of gameplay.If roguelikes are your bag, this one offers both a sense of progression from overall play by doling out new classes and races with unlocks, as well as a wide variety of enemies and all sorts of crazy loot. The difficulty spikes can be tremendous, so that the higher difficulties really demand use of the game's clairvoyance and/or movement powers to survive. This game seeded and fostered my imagination and provided all sorts of unusual combinations of gear, talents and events to keep my thoroughly entertained. Though I don't tend to play for long stretches any more (except with new DLC), I keep coming back for twenty or thirty minutes of play on whatever experiment of race and class that appeals to me at the time.I can't think of any other game (except an MMO), that has had me coming back again and again for more than a couple months, let alone three years.

												For all of you recursive min maxers out there, this game offers plenty of complexity to keep you busy for a long time.  This is especially true once you unlock the adventurer class after your first win.  The possibilities  for talent combinations are immense, and they grow as the developer adds new stuff.Feeling a bit timid?  That is OK.  While ToME is an authentic and challenging roguelike experience, the user community is there to back you up.  The answers to most of your questions are just a short chat message away.  There is no AAA PvE title out there with more to offer in Tactical variety than ToME.  Don't be fooled by the archaic appearance.  ToME is well worth the asking price.			"

												At first glance, this game doesn't seem like much. But this game is truly amazing. Here are a few reasons why:- The storyline is revealed slowly over time, making you constantly want to go further. You can tell they put effort into the tiniest of side stories, as even they are filled with emotion and humour. - There are a ton of classes and races wich you can customise they way you want to play them. Everytime you play with something new you get ideas of how to play the other classes and it makes you curious to try out new things. - Gameplay is fun. You can choose to rush through areas, cleaning them quickly and moving on. Or you can really take your time and consider the most strategic way of approaching a battle. It should be said that there is a lot of reading to be done in this game. I highly recommend that you read everything  you get your hands on, as that is what gives the game depth and humour. I love this game and highly recommend it.			"

												One of the most amazing game I've ever played. I've played a lot more before it was on Steam, and now I'm coming back to it.If you like roguelikes with huge character customization, try this. The amount of depth is mind blowing. You can easily play this thousands of hours, and always discover new things. Yesterday I tried the doomed class for the first time and I was amazed how original it is, and completly different from the classes I know the most. My favourite roguelike with Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.Thank you Darkgod and your team for your work. Merci! (pour mes amis fr, le développeur est fr et accomplit un travail de dingue).			"

												Has got to be in the top 3 best RPG/Roguelikes I have ever played! Hands down, truely a hidden GEM. Beware... DarkGod will have his just dues paid in blood (You will DIE.... alot) But still the game is so very simple and complex at the same time. You don't have to play with Perma-death if you don't want to. (I have tried all the modes) rouge-like (perma-death) is where the real challenege is. The story and lore is great, a bit of read at times. I'm sure for most who play, its no biggie. I really like that there is a global chat and network while your in game. It broadcasts when someone dies and how, or when someone gets an achievement. I have found a few tips and tricks just by reading some of what other peeps were saying.Overall: ToME is great and a must have if your into rougelikes, and not a bad start if you want to try more of them.I also dare the achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s of the world to give it a try :) upda			"

												Remember those gold box D&D games?  This is that x1000.We paid, what, $40 for those games in the 80's.   Today, I'd happily pay $20 for this game, and be grateful for the discount.God knows I've paid that and more for 'alpha' games that turned out crap, or worse.  If this is $10, buy it.  If it's $20, buy it.  At the time of this writing, it's $1.39.""fly, you fools""			"

												It's okay visually. The 'story,' such as it is, is okay. But in terms of the game mechanics, diversity of character and item options, and the progression of difficulty it is one of the best games I've played. If you enjoy playing a game because of how the game is played then I highly recommend it.			"

												If you like roguelikes - rogue, nethack, slash'em, stone soup, or even things that are similar-to-but-not-quite-roguelike - such as dark souls, rogue legacy, DiD playthroughs of games like skyrim, etc.. then this is almost a must have.  Fantasy, turn based, w/the key roguelike elements of permadeath (no re-loading to your last save if you die, have to re-roll a new character and start over from scratch instead) and great difficulty (but not insurmountable).  Through your many deaths, however (and there will be many) - you will learn how to survive to the deeper reaches of the game.  Great unique classes too.  Many of which are unlike any I have seen in any other game.  If u just enjoy speccing out characters in rpg's and mmo's then this game will scratch that itch too.  Though many of the classes need to be unlocked through achieving things in game in order to play them.The game has a free version too, so you can try before you buy.  Buying makes you like a 'donator' and you get extra features like a class and a game-mode that free players can't get.  But you can play for free and still unlock the majority of things.  I'm buying even though I already have the game and have been playing it for years, just because Darkgod and contributors have put so much good work into the game that if anyone deserves some of my game $, they do.  So if you're not sure about the game, give the free version a try, then come back and buy it if ya like it.If you're not a patient person, or don't like difficult games, or you need your rpg's to be 3d or real time, then ya might wanna pass.  But otherwise, worth checking out.  One of my favourite games.			"

												There is nothing more to say than if you're a fan of roguelikes, buy this game now.So many games now seem to call themselves roguelikes without actually having the core elements of a true RL but this captures them all and still manages to modernize the Genre.There is an abundance of classes, races, skills, items, quests and more achievements than most people can dream of and with the randomly generated battles, loots and side quests the replayability is off the charts.Like many RL's though, it can be a little challenging to get into if you've not tried the genre before BUT there is an informative tuturial and modes/features ingame to hep out those who have no played before, or those not so keen on the whole permadeath thing. Also, the in game community is 100% helpful and polite so if you're stuck with anything you can usually just ask in chat. But be warned, like ALL good RL's don't expect to pick this up and it be easy and you 'complete' it first time you try. You will die, many times, but every time is worth it.With many many many hours of this clocked on Desura already this is way worth £5 (and more)			"

												Big features that make this different from other roguelikes: No consumables. Class powers, potions, scrolls, etc. all work on cooldownsNo identification of items neededAuto Vending of unwanted lootA large overworld with two continents and tons of varied dungeons and questsThis is a free game, so download it from the developer's site if you wish. Buying it on Steam gives you the same rewards as if you donated to the developer.ToME 4 is one of my favorite roguelikes. It has ok graphics (phenominal for its genre), decent sound design, distinct graphical effects for spells and the like, and a whacky variety of races and classes. The world of Maj'Eyal has some pretty cool lore, which is good because there are huge piles of it.If you play this game, start on Adventurer mode. You get an extra life at set levels, and until you have a really good grasp on the game, playing on Roguelike (ie one death and you're done) is an exercise in frustration. Until very recently, I refused to play on anything other than the one-life setting. This was a mistake. Don't be me.			"

												Has got to be in the top 3 best RPG/Roguelikes I have ever played! Hands down, truely a hidden GEM. Beware... DarkGod will have his just dues paid in blood (You will DIE.... alot) But still the game is so very simple and complex at the same time. You don't have to play with Perma-death if you don't want to. (I have tried all the modes) rouge-like (perma-death) is where the real challenege is. The story and lore is great, a bit of read at times. I'm sure for most who play, its no biggie. I really like that there is a global chat and network while your in game. It broadcasts when someone dies and how, or when someone gets an achievement. I have found a few tips and tricks just by reading some of what other peeps were saying.Overall: ToME is great and a must have if your into rougelikes, and not a bad start if you want to try more of them.I also dare the achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s of the world to give it a try :) upda			"

												Massive story-driven roguelike, crafted over the course of years with great care.It breaks several traditions and streamlines away a lot of unnecessary baggage (consumables, or the classic Angband loot problem) -- and replaces it with a whole lot of entirely unnecessary but fun complexity.And if you're into lore, there's at least one book's worth of text spread across the game, if you're willing to find it.Overall, a very solid title. Whilst it's available for free on the creator's website, it is a project well worth supporting.			"

												this might be TL;DR for some people - for raw pro/con just scroll down.It's a shame this game only has 27 (even if all of them are positive) reviews.Folks this game is great! The base version of this game is free and may help you to determine wether or not this game is for you.My first experiences with this game were kinda ""meh"" not because the game is bad but just because i felt like it was hard to get into (that might be a personal thing tho). I made a big mistake by shoving it to the side for a while thinking this game wasnt for me. In a phase of boredom i picked this game up again and used my time to get into it and hell - I'm fascinated. i litteraly can't stop playing - this game has so much depth and so much to give for such a little price it's just wow.Darkgod is the prime example for a good game developer - give it for free and let the people choose wether or not to pay for it. I feel bad now for picking this gem up when it was on sale and i only payed about 70c so i donated another 5 Euro for now just because the game is so great (i'll probably donate even more just because i won't stop playing this game aslong as things are beeing developed for it)Enough for the story telling now lets get to the raw information:Pro's:Great story: you got ALOT of texts to read for background information about races , the past events , demons , long lost civilizations etc etc etc. if you realy want to you can get ALOT of information.Gameplay: AMAZING - the game has so much depth telling you all about it would fill about 100's of sites so just go find out yourself you realy won't be disappointed. trust me on this.Roguelike typical RNGtons and tons and tons of randomly generated equipment aswell as our all beloved legendary equipment which stays the same.Brilliant skills and spells which would also be too much to talk about in detail right here.Graphics: Lovely oldschoolish graphics (i know it's not for everyone but for me personaly it's great.)Active developer: Darkgod is always working on this game , hell he even shows up online regulary and starts random events for everyone thats playing in that moment ( this can be Zones , small buffs , useless but funny buffs or even other things which i'm not gonna mention.Online community ingame: Okay now this one is great and probably my most favorite function in this game - even tho this is a singleplayer game it has an online function which is basicaly just a chat where you can link items , talk to people , see what other people do (deaths,archievements etc). This is especialy helpfull when starting out because the community is great and always helpfull (hey Xlambda , minmay etc :D). When you're more experienced it's still helpfull for lets say Item comparsion or just simple chatting while playing along.Cons: A little hard to get into but as i said above that might just be me personally and yet it's not that hard just takes a little bit of time and dedication. Thats about it.I give this game a 10/10 on my personal scale - im TOTALY in love with it and 'am planing to play it for a LONG time.Darkgod you're my hero.			"

												A dungeon crawler rpg roguelike. I think its awesome. Its accessable and easy to get into. numerous races and classes to play as, and you will unlock more of both as you play, even with just the base game! Even workshop classes you can download, havent tried any of those though.So all your dungeons are randomly generated each playthrough, but the over world stays the same im pretty sure. Each race starts in a different place and with a different backstory depending on your race and class. The main story quests stay about the same but its nice that you can tackle them in anyway you want, I still havent been able to beat the game.One of my favorite things about TOME is the different campaigns, the base game has 3, The main one and two unlockable ones. One is a gladiator arena campaign and if you beat it with a character that character will be the last boss for the next character! very cool. Another thing I find sets TOME apart from other roguelikes is the selectable difficulties, they not only have easy,normal, hard type selections but also there is exploration,adventure,roguelike choices where roguelike gives your character only 1 life (unless you can find magical items that add to it)  to live through the quest, Adventure gives you a 'free' life after certain level milestones, so when you die with an extra life you get to choose if you want to respawn where you died or outside the area. And exploration gives you unlimited lives.There is a lot to loot here too, all types of weapons and rarities.All in all id recommend this game to anyone looking for a good rpg or roguelike,			"

												Well, since picking up ToME, I've sunk an ungodly ammount of hours into it, and loved every single one. A classic roguelike, though that word is bandied around a lot. Better to say that this one is ""Like Rogue"". Haven't enjoyed a roguelike this much since the early days of ascii games.			"

												Played through this game a couple of times.  It (along with Ancient Domains of Mystery) are my favorite examples to date of the genre.There are a lot of unlocks that you get by playing through the game, and different race/class combinations lead to really unique playthoughs.  It is an imaginative right world that draws you in despite its simplicity.It is also really really really hard to make it though on hardcore mode (I normally play the limited lives options, but I have made it through on hard mode once after many many many many failures).The character customization options are deep, the combat tactical and difficult, and the world interesting.  I would recommend you give it a try (provided the low end graphics are not a problem for you).			"

												Best Roguelike I have ever played. It gets rid of some of the unnessesary junk like hunger and identifying items, but sacrifices none of the gameplay depth. It focuses on hardcore dungeon crawling action mixed with questing. Most of the classes are initially locked, and while I thought this sucked at first, looking back on things, it actually got me to try out classes I would have never tried otherwise. As it turns out, I actually liked those classes and had a fun time playing them. All the classes play entirely different from each other and have a wide variety of different skills to choose from. There are also many races to choose from, each with their own bonuses and unique skill tree. Thanks to the numerous skill and race choices, playthroughs of the same class can play quite differently.  The game is incredibly fleshed out in these respects, keeping each play fairly fresh.			"

Product received for free
												9/10One of the best games of it's kind. Atmospheric music, complex combat system but you don't actually need to look up too much (or any) of it to do well at the game. Good interface which is fully customisable. The lore is deep and interesting. There are many characters/classes for almost every playstyle ever existed. The map is set but the dungeons are randomly generated with random unique loot (the item itself isn't randomised) providing almost infinite replayability. Would benefit from having an intuitive tutorial system but you can get the hang of it in a few tries. I recommend starting in the easiest difficulty setting just to get a feel for the game.			"

												Is it hard? Yea it is. Is it roguelike? Yea it is. Is it a hard  roguelike? No. You could tell it from traditional nethack,  this game discarded all those hardcore stuff, focused on combat only. You don't need identify scroll to identify unknown object, you won't have trouble in arranging your bag, cuz things you don't need could be directly transmogrified.So it's a love-hate relationship. I treat myself as a 'old-school' gamer, but have to admit, this kind of direct, magnified, pleasure, is unresistable. However, this game has 'old-school spirit', that's difficulty. The enemies' levels are adjusted, so the game will never be easy. And you will always die stupidly.Most addictive roguelike game i have played. "

For those new to roguelikes, download free titles such as Stone Soup, IVAN, or brogue. TOME is much more accessable than those titles due to mouse controls and full graphical interfaces, but they will give you an idea on what to expect.			"

This was one of the major advantages for choosing this title over other roguelikes. The fact that this game is also really fun and rewarding also helps. :)Of course you'll start out like any other RPG. You'll receive your quest and do what you want. Once you stand on the world map for the first time though it's up to you what you want to do.You can unlock so much different classes, races and other things like an underground fortress to call as your home, trying out new classes, builds, racial combinations, you name it. Permadeath is no punishment, it's an opportunity to change your game once again.			"

This game is an RPG players dream, so so complex and sort of complicated.  Has three settings, Adventure which is limited lives, Rogue which is true one life play, and then some other setting I really hope you don't play on which has unlimited lives.  The world is pretty massive, with towns and dungeons and random events, some based on your stats I beleive. The fact that races and classes, which are plentiful, are unlocked by completeing quests and achievments is MORE then enough to make you want to play this all night. I can't think of a single rpg that offers anywhere near the amount of content and playtime for the price.  Playing every race and class and getting to the end game would take months or years..  Anyone who loves old school RPGs will be very pleased. 9 / 10  (not counting graphical fidelity)  This is pure gameplay my friends.			"

												I have been searching for an old school brutal RPG for so long that I had almost given up, until now.  Everthing about this game speaks of patience, time and careful  development.   The developer/s have clearly played a vast array of games themselves and have created a game that will speak to the sophisticated RPG'er who isn't solely drawn to graphical thrills. The depth of character development and it's importance to your longevity in the game world is something I cannot stress you enough to take your time with.This turn based RPG is unforgiving and it's game types and difficulties are designed to help you learn to survive.  There is no ""Loading a save game""  when you're about to be 2 hit by a unique boss twice your lvl who has just seen you, warped behind you cackling with glee at it's next meal.  Brutal, ingenious and rewarding, this game will challenge you to develop strategies just get out alive more often than being concerned about killing your foe.You only have so many lives Adventurer.98 / 100 "

												I have been searching for an old school brutal RPG for so long that I had almost given up, until now.  Everthing about this game speaks of patience, time and careful  development.   The developer/s have clearly played a vast array of games themselves and have created a game that will speak to the sophisticated RPG'er who isn't solely drawn to graphical thrills. The depth of character development and it's importance to your longevity in the game world is something I cannot stress you enough to take your time with.This turn based RPG is unforgiving and it's game types and difficulties are designed to help you learn to survive.  There is no ""Loading a save game""  when you're about to be 2 hit by a unique boss twice your lvl who has just seen you, warped behind you cackling with glee at it's next meal.  Brutal, ingenious and rewarding, this game will challenge you to develop strategies just get out alive more often than being concerned about killing your foe.You only have so many lives Adventurer.98 / 100 "

												I bought this along with a few other games. When I did I figured this one was the weakest of the bunch. I was certainly mistaken. This is the game I easily have gotten the most play time out of. I have played quite a number of roguelikes. I even have my own roguelike category tab. This is far and away the best of them. It's not as flashy as something like rogue legacy but, It has incredible depth. When you load up a roguelike if your looking to challenge yourself and find your own way through the game; This is the best there is.Pros:. Incredibly in-depth character building. Tons of classes . A huge world uncommon in roguelike games. Large backstory. Tons of skills and unique ways to get new skills. Good in-game communityCons:. Near non-existant tutorial. Some hidden mechanics. Small imbalancesThis game is a learn as you play type of deal. It has in-game chat to help you find your way though. If you see me in the game say hello. "

												Don't be fooled by its looks, this game is great, deep and has a lot of content to offer.This was the first roguelike I've dived into. It has a good tutorial mode to get into the game and the genre itself. Thanks to its visuals it's a lot more accessible than other good roguelikes. This was one of the major advantages for choosing this title over other roguelikes. The fact that this game is also really fun and rewarding also helps. :)Of course you'll start out like any other RPG. You'll receive your quest and do what you want. Once you stand on the world map for the first time though it's up to you what you want to do.You can unlock so much different classes, races and other things like an underground fortress to call as your home, trying out new classes, builds, racial combinations, you name it. Permadeath is no punishment, it's an opportunity to change your game once again.			"

												A super good roguelike with one of the best if not the best combat system out there. Diverse skill trees, Diablo-style randomized loot system with some uniques thrown in, great graphics, lots of player-made addons and all of this costs next to nothing (or actually nothing if you just download the free base game from te4.org). I have 70 hours on record writing this and I just got my first win with skeleton arcane blade and it was amazing. I'm likely starting a new character right after I post this review.This game can't be recommended enough for anyone who likes roguelikes, especially oldschool ones. Great for beginners as well, since there are various levels of difficulty and even the perma-death can be switched to adventure mode which grants extra lives depending on your level. "

												This is a really, really solid RPG. Lets start at the begining. I am an old-school gamer at heart. I started gaming in the early 80's and was only recently introduced to the roguelike genre, which has actually been my favorite genre for about 2 years now. I know Rogue was put out in 80 or 81, but for whatever reason I never got into this genre (perhaps it is because I played alot of consoles at that time?). My first introduction to roguelikes was BoI, among other actual 'roguelites'.Anyways, I know the whole Berlin Interpretation of what a roguelike is, but really in the sense of ToME and others, it is just a great RPG with permadeath. This requires you to really take your time and think about your actions. Playing drunk, or while on the phone is certain death, am-I-right? Tales of Maj'Eyal has a really neat universe set in place, with a great UI that is all keyboard based (although you can use the mouse, it is debatably less efficient). Compared to other 'true' roguelikes, this game has a great tileset and overall graphics that are very much appreciated. When you equip armor, so does your avatar. There is rain, mist, etc. Keep in mind you can get this game for free from the developers website, but you shouldn't. Donate, or buy it on Steam (basically a donation). Pay for it because this is top notch game developement. YOU WILL GET DOZENS OF HOURS OUT OF THIS. At least. It is not multiplayer, but it is the first MSORPG... Thats right - Massive Single Player Online RPG. Its brilliant. You play your own game, yet are in constant chat with the rest of the world. There is even some sort of item sharing in this chat that I haven't used yet. Best part - no need for a Wiki - I simply ask a questions (I've asked dozens) and some kind soul always has an awesome response. Awesome community that is very helpful.TL;DR10/10 This is how game developement is done.			"

												8.5/10Chances are, if you made it past the trailer and the preview pictures, you're going to like this game.  This game and genre isn't for everybody and you know it.  Personally, I was just looking for a low graphics game to have for play on my laptop... only to find myself putting in tens of hours on my desktop as well.My first roguelike was Dungeons of Dredmor, which was fun, but in terms of gameplay options and experimentation, it just wasn't enough.  This game is more than enough.  There are 26 classes in this game, most of which have unique playstyles and minimal overlap.  Between those, there are many ways to build most of them with endless opportunities to experiment and die horribly in different ways.  The UI is confusing at first, but very functional once you get the hang of it.  There is a significant mod community for those who are into that.The game comes with most of the classes and some races unlocked.  This is somewhat controversial but for me was highly beneficial for my enjoyment of the game.  Making the classes unlockable makes the game much less overwhelming to pick up and provides a significant sense of progression even when your character fails to win the game.  Once those classes are unlocked, higher difficulty options and mods continue to extend the game's life.Healing potions and most consumables are replaced by cooldown-based ""Inscriptions"" and ""Runes,"" which is perfect because it removes any sort of ""saving for a rainy day"" hesitation players tend to have in combat.There are a couple of issues with this game.  Some rigs may encounter excessive memory leaks with the default graphics settings.  Graphics and sound are expected to be minimal but there are a few obnoxious sound effects and themes in the game and some volume imbalance.  As commonly seen in these games, early level progression with many classes at higher difficulties is extremely frustrating.  But these issues are minor.  Stop reading and get the damn game.			"

Perhaps you want to raise minions from the corpses of your foes, or perhaps you simply want to summon them from the depths of your own mind. If you have a ""dream class"" in RPGs, chances are ToME has it. If it doesn't, chances are a mod for ToME has it. It does a great job of making you feel powerful, and also creates really unique experiences and stories that you can share with others. Give it a shot.			"

												(Don't be fooled with my playtime on record - I've started playing this game regularly six years ago and must have invested at least 300 hours in it.)When we look at roguelikes nowadays, we think of a couple things - text or pixel graphics, large pool of character customization, similar design but different feel every playthrough, massive replayability. Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) simply offers the best roguelike experience one could get: deep, nuanced gameplay that is not only highly customizable and replayable but also accessible to even someone who's new to the genre.One of the greatest hurdles that roguelike games have in appealing to the mainstream is the massive complexity that can be seen in some roguelikes. ToME, in fact, is a testament to this - featuring the most number of unique classes that I've ever seen in a game, all of which have differing playstyles and specializations, ranging from the ever-reliable warrior to shield-bearing mages manipulating earth magic to combat alchemists controlling massive golems. In most roguelikes, this complexity is rarely explained - and some would attest to finding out what X item is for as a part of the roguelike charm. What makes ToME remarkable, though, is making this complexity as accessible as possible. The tooltips for each skill, talent, or item not only gives concise, pertinent information that is easily understandable but even features some lore or description - which, in combination with in-game lore fleshes out a massive and detailed world.The graphics also are very pleasing. They obviously are not as polished or as pretty like the Endless series (Dungeon of the Endless etc), but the individual NPC/PC tiles have a tabletop RPG feel and further help flesh the world out with great visuals. The sound shines through in this game - the background music for each zone fits the zone's theme well without distracting the player.Replayability is also one of the major criteria that roguelikes are measured with. ToME is, in all seriousness, the absolute best value game - there are so many race and class combinations you can try, and within one class there are several ways of playing. A great non-spoiler example of this would be the Rogue, which can focus on hit-and-run stealth tactics, using debilitating poisons and tricks to bring down enemies to their knees, or using a variety of traps to contain and damage foes. One of the absolute best examples of this would be (spoiler) the melee/ranged hybrid Temporal Warden class, which simply has so many options and gameplay styles: Bounce around the map, doing damage and teleporting out of sight all in the blink of an eye (Threaded Combat); Summon entities to fight with you (Temporal Hounds); Bend space and time to prevent damage to you and stop enemies in their tracks (Stasis); or even focus your attacks on one enemy as you seal their fate (Fate Weaving). There's simply so many things you can try that even with a non-procedural map and game flow there is still almost limitless replayability to the game - if you can beat it, that is!I've played roguelikes for a long while - coming from classics like Angband, to modern games that stretch the limits of the genre such as Dungeon of the Endless and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and to modern reimaginings and improvements on the genre - where games like Elona and ToME fall. While most modern roguelikes stretch the definition and innovate the genre in so many ways, ToME sticks close to the genre's roots and provides a high quality, high value gameplay experience. Thus, Tales of Maj'Eyal stands tall as the absolute best that the roguelike genre can offer.			"

												I have sort of conflicted feelings about Tales of Maj'Eyal. In short, if you judge it purely as a roguelike, I don't thing it don't hold up too well. Part of the reason I may think that may be my preference for NetHack influenced roguelikes, and my lack of familiarity or appreciation for Angband influenced or Ancient Domains of Mystery influenced rogelikes, but I am not sure how much Tales of Maj'Eyal's design is based on those games.On the other hand, judged as a RPG Tales of Maj'Eyal does a lot of things right. It has a rather interesting tactical battle system, lots of different character creation options, many ways to tweak and customize your skills, any many items to find that offer a lot of tactical death. It's story, while perhaps presented in a way that relies too much on finding and reading lore text, is at least interesting and presents a few dark twists on the standard high fantasy setting. No mater how you judge it, the interface is great, mostly easy to use but able to do a lot, the battles are fast-pasted and fun, and it can be very addicting. The graphics are simple but more then functional enough for what they are, and there are enough interesting special effects and visual flare to make up for the more static sprites. The music is generic but memorable and sometimes can actually be pretty fantastic, even if it is more or less all part of free game music packs. I think that is all that really needs o be said, but here is some more detail about how I think about it as a roguelike:The big problem with Tales of Maj'Eyal's design as a roguelike is simply that the game is too long, story heavy, and not random enough. There is variation in the loot you get and the monsters you face, but the over all world is basically set. Same world map, same town, same quests. The layout of a lot of the random zones are different but the basic themes of the zones are set, and each zone has a set rank for items, a set number of floors, a set list of enemies and possible bosses. Due to how the game is balanced and how enemies never respawn except in a few cases, it's basically required to repeat every zone and sidequest each run or you end up drastically underleveled very quickly, and due to each zone having fixed level requirements you can't even vary the order that much.  Although you actually have multiple lives before dieing in the default mode, permadeath still is a problem and when it happens you have to start over from he start and go through the same old stuff you already saw again. There is a mode where you can simply have infinite lives, but I kind of wish there was some kind of middle ground, perhaps a way to start over with a new character but with a number of story events that carry over and alter the world. There is a unlock system that adds new races, classes, skill trees, and other things, and that helps, but it still only adds so much and may of the unlocks are obscure or tedious.I also have a problem with a lot of the streamlining or elimination of a lot of roguelike staples potions and scrolls are gone, and instead characters can equip a number of infusions or runes that can be used over and over again but have a cooldown timer between uses (actually every skill and magic spell in Tales of Maj'Eyal uses cooldown timers, I am not really a fan of them but it works). Wands and other tools work in a similar way as well. This eliminates stockpiling of consumable items, but also eleminates the sort of careful rationing of your resources you need to worry about in other roguelikes.It's only logical because of this that the whole item identification game is gone and no items have overall negative effects, eliminating the kind of risk vs reward of using items in a panic. Many people may not like needing to worry about identifying stuff but the feature exists in roguelikes for a reason, the same reason randomized levels exist, to make sure you can't just win with rote memorization, and so every action you take has to be done very carefuly. Roguelikes since the original Rogue have always been about exploration and experimentation and the whole idea with unknown items was a big factor in that. But again, despite all of these things I don't like about it as a roguelike, I still think it's a really good RPG. Maybe there isn't really that much of a difference, most roguelikes are basically RPGs after all, I just thought I would share my feelings on the subject.			"

												I'm a roguelike fanatic, and this managed to scratch the itch like no other game in the genre I've been able to find on Steam so far. The closest I can compare it to considering its style of humor and sheer skill diversity is Dungeons of Dredmor, but this has FAR more depth. As an added bonus, the creator has been pushing out steady and meaningful updates for years. Even the DLCs are full-on campaigns rather than expansions of the original.In short, if you like roguelikes, RPGs, and enjoy planning for complex interacting skill trees, you'll love this gem.			"

It actually just presents itself very differently from that type of rogue-like, how there is more of an open ended singleplayer rather then just a random dungeon crawl deeper and deeper. The skills and talents for all of the classes and races really make it stand out and interesting.Good Video Game.			"

												This game is fantastic.First, it is compatible with every major OS, Windows, Mac, or Linux. We should all support games that do this as long as they're good, so this is just a setup statement.Second, it has a good freemium model. The free game as obtained on http://te4.org is fantastic and stands well on its own. I enjoyed myself enough that I paid to get more over there, and I've added it to my steam account once I realized that I could, just so that I can give it this very positive recommendation.Third, the game is easily one of or the best roguelikes of its kind. Stats aren't heavily inflated. The game doesn't move super fast. Its systems are understandable and the learning curve isn't extremely steep, even if it is a bit steeper than normal games, being a roguelike of the format it's in.I recommend everyone go over to http://te4.org and give this game a try. If it's your kind of game you'll absolutely love it. I play off of steam when I play it, for the portability to play it anywhere, but I'll guarantee I've loved what I've played so far, and will keep on enjoying it as I keep going.			"

												Nethack is the grand daddy of rogue games. There is however one another title that deserves to be named along with this classic as an equal and that is Tales of MajEyal. It is just that good and made & maintained with such a passion that speaking of this game along with any other rogue title would be to give it too little credit. So for the potential buyers: So do you like Rogue games? Get this. Your library will not be complete without this title.  Do you have fond memories of Nethack? Get this.  If you don't fall into either of the 'categories' i just mentioned well then you better think twice as this game is very demanding (rage quit material) and there are easier and more accessible titles around.

												Tales of Maj-Eyal (TOME) is a magnificent game. It uses a deep system of combat and customization that starts simple but starts digging quickly. The story is engaging and often humorous, but appears almost entirely in the background through gameplay elements rather than tedious cutscenes and copy-pasta tv tropes. Everything about the game deserves praise: the combat, the customization, the freedom to make ambiguous moral choices, the art***, the replayability.Despite the omfg-is-that-dog-poop art, every other element of this game is so amazingly well done that this game has *earned* its glowing reviews and I felt obligated to add my voice to the choir of praise.***the part about the art deserving praise was a complete and utter lie. Not a fib, not an exaggeration, but a lie. The art for this game is the worst video game art I have seen, ever. It's truly unacceptable and there is *no* excuse for the author's failure to get a few fans to replace it with... anything really. ......F*ck*ng seriously, start upgrading the art already, you've got plenty of fans who would do it for free.

												There are many roguelikes out there, but few are quite like Tales of Maj'Eyal.There are a few things that really stand out. The skill system is one of them. You can choose multiple skills, but you have a limited amount of skill points. Some really stand out, while others may seem underwhelming. Every single skill has a purpose in one way or another, and has a use.The class system is another one. There are 10 races in the base game, all with different skills. You start with a small handful, and can unlock the others by playing the game. There are 26 classes with different playstyles in the regular game, 19 of those unlockable by playing the game as well. There's one ""bonus"" class that can get any skill from any tree in the game, and you unlock that one by beating the game once. DLC adds 5 more classes, and 4 different races to play as.There's also little risk to trying this game out. There are some features only people who purchase the game get, but they are mostly cosmetic, and in one case it's a new class. You can get the demo on the developer's website, and have access to the entire base game. The bonus class is quite fun to play as, and the DLC just adds more stuff.And in the case of Rage of Embers, it's an entirely new campaign to play.			"

The game system is easy to learn and logical. I have found no glitches, lag or crashes. It has great replayablity.  There are assorted classes and skills and new classes open up as you play. There is an achievement list. Different levels of difficulty and hardcore death or not as you desire. There is minimal loading on world map and only a bit between areas in dungeons. It is a good solid game and well worth the money.			"

												I have 100+ hours on this game already - and that's on Steam only;  you can get a free non-Steam version of ToME on its website - so I feel it's time to make a review.First things first, it's a roguelike alright: permadeath, randomized world, tile-based graphics, yadda yadda. And yet it's a great introduction to the roguelike genre, because there are options to play it with a number of lives, or even unlimited ones, to get the hang of the game! Not EVERYTHING is randomized (there are fixed artifacts, fixed locations, etc but it still feels like a roguelike). Also, it contains intuitive UI and gameplay. For example, there are practically no consumables like potions and scrolls - not in the sense we're accostumed to. Instead, your powers (and some items) have cooldowns along with, naturally, some resource management (stamina, mana, psi, etc.). Cast X spell/move? Wait Z turns to use it again. Or, maybe, use some talent that can reset some cooldowns ;-). That cooldown system is really intuitive and just one of the many reasons I'm in love with ToME.Now let's talk about the world. I'm not an old ToME follower but unless I'm mistaken, it used to be set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth, until it was changed to a more original lore. And it's a great lore: the continent of Eyal was, some time ago, devastated by catatrophic used of magic (i.e the Spellblaze), there are still mage hunters (Zigur), there are political issues (Halflings are militaristic and even used to slave Yeeks); heck, even the demons have a touching and fantastic backstory! So, in terms of lore, the game has good stuff to offer. Some of the actual places are very creative, too: tunnels of sand that can collapse and swallow the uncautious adventurer, underwater ruins, necromancer dens, forests, deserts, and so on...In terms of races/classes, there are 11 races and 26 classes, allowing for tons of builds. There are your classic warriors (Bulwark, Berserker), mages (Archmage, Necromancer) and even exotic classes that can manipulate things like their foes' dreams (Solipsist), draconic powers (Wyrmic) and even time itself (Temporal Warden, Paradox Mage)! Most of the races and classes are unlocked as you progress in the game and do certain tasks, which aren't too hard, honestly. But if you're impatient, then you can look for an addon (mod) that unlocks everything right out of the bat. ;-)Anyway, it's getting too long. I typed all of that to convice you to PLAY THE GAME. Seriously, play it. It's great, no matter if you're a roguelike veteran or new to the genre (like me, actually)!			"

												The graphics are awful. UI is a pain. But somehow this game has become the one I've spent more time playing than any other on Steam. Tales of Maj'Eyal is one of the best roguelikes ever made with its creative classes, worlds to discover, and surprises to keep players entertained. Also, it does away with tedium like hauling junk to sell at shops and hoarding potions that never get used. It's a solo game, but with connected chat one never really feels alone in the world. Sometimes the game designer appears and bestows stuff upon the connected players. Plus if you like achievements, then this is the game to play.			"

												Titans of stats, loot and abilities engage in often ridiculous combat.Insane amounts of content. Unique and satisfying progression. Incredible random loot. Fun and tactical combat. Plenty of space for build experimentation. Varied, highly original classes/races. Regular updates. A mix of silly/epic lore and worldbuilding. Different experiences each playthrough. Plenty of easter eggs. Great boss battles.You need to reach around level 20-25 to really get a feel for the game. This truly is a god among roguelikes, imo.			"

												(I have just under a hundred hours logged into this game from before it got onto steam.)It is an interesting roguelike that plays a little differently from others of its' genre.. If you want an idea of what makes it different;No identification. All items are identified immediately upon picking them up. This wasn't the case in earlier versions of the game, but the large and increasing number of fixed artifacts and no need for identification scrolls made it somewhat pointless.Potions and scrolls are replaced by infusions and runes, which give on-demand abilities that consume no permanent resources -with a limited number of slots for these abilities. Regeneration infusions are the primary method of healing, replacing healing potions, and runes of teleportation replace scrolls of teleportation as an escape from trouble. Nothing is lost in their use, but they have cooldowns.A system for ""extra lives"". Before you crucify the game, extra lives is either a startup option akin to lowering the difficulty(""roguelike"" mode for one life, ""Adventure"" for three, ""Exploration"" for unlimited) or through very rare artifacts or abilities in-game. Also, it doesn't save you if you decided to hug an Elven Corruptor and he blows you up the first turn you revive.Disable-heavy combat. Simply, being resilient to damage through armor or magical resistance is not as important as being difficult to disable. Stuns and confusion are the leading killers, not high burst damage. This makes it very easy to get chain-disabled and killed if you haven't prepared properly with high saving throws or effect clears(certain runes and infusions will remove a detrimental effect from you on use). All of these things combined could make it seem like a somewhat casual roguelike, but in practice it isn't really any easier than similar contemporary roguelikes. The only element that is truly missing is resource management. You still must assess risks, prepare for and pick your battles carefully, and adapt to what the RNG has provided you. The cooldowns-based combat and lack of resource management should be considered an interesting spin, not an intentional dumbing down.			"

												ToME is a thoroughly enjoyable old-school fantasy RPG with loads of races, classes, skills, items, and enemies, deep and interesting quests in a large world, and a variety of difficulty and permadeath options, all wrapped up in a graphical package with a decent UI.Great things:- Story: lore abounds throughout the world- Breadth and depth of world: dozens of dungeons, some quite deep, on multiple continents, as well as towns, roaming NPCs, and plenty of areas that are unlocked by quests- Variety of monsters: there are rats and orcs, but so much more, as well - necromancers, fantastic magical creatures, hordes of wyrms... the list goes on- Variety of gear: multiple tiers with many levels of quality, tons of interesting egos, artifacts, and unusual things like lanterns and charms- Variety of maps and dungeons: every place feels different and has a different theme and story- Variety of graphical sprites: some dungeons look alike, but most places have a distinct look - also, plenty of weapon, armor, and character sprites to keep things interesting- High ratio of progression to tedium- Exploration mode gives you infinite lives, for those who like an easy game once in a while- 1,600+ achievements- Many UI and graphics configuration and customization options- Extremely good price for the amount of depth and replayability (less than one US cent per achievement, too)Not-so-great things:- Can feel very unbalanced at times (compared to other modern roguelikes): it's common to step into an enemy's line-of-sight and die instantly from a sudden powerful attack, even on normal difficulty- Default tiles are a bit painful on the eyes: I prefer the OldRPG tiles from the Steam Workship, which give the game a somewhat more Legend of Zelda-like look- In-game map is just colored blocks with no additional information- Automatic waypoint navigation is only available through add-ons, and the choices there are imperfect at best- High-DPI displays: if you zoom the UI, the hotbar is buggy unless the hotbar icon size is set to default (32 pixels)- Linux + NVIDIA: Some graphical flickering and slowness, especially with shader effects enabled			"

												There are many roguelikes out there, but few are quite like Tales of Maj'Eyal.There are a few things that really stand out. The skill system is one of them. You can choose multiple skills, but you have a limited amount of skill points. Some really stand out, while others may seem underwhelming. Every single skill has a purpose in one way or another, and has a use.The class system is another one. There are 10 races in the base game, all with different skills. You start with a small handful, and can unlock the others by playing the game. There are 26 classes with different playstyles in the regular game, 19 of those unlockable by playing the game as well. There's one ""bonus"" class that can get any skill from any tree in the game, and you unlock that one by beating the game once. DLC adds 5 more classes, and 4 different races to play as.There's also little risk to trying this game out. There are some features only people who purchase the game get, but they are mostly cosmetic, and in one case it's a new class. You can get the demo on the developer's website, and have access to the entire base game. The bonus class is quite fun to play as, and the DLC just adds more stuff.And in the case of Rage of Embers, it's an entirely new campaign to play.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal (TOME for short) is a in turn based roguelike that at first glance is something many would pass over but it comes with an amazing amount of character customization, story and enjoyable difficulty. This game also has, at the time of this review, the most achievements of any game on Steam. There is also an explorer mode which allows you to enjoy the story, up to Insanity mode to maximize the pain. The Steam edition also has a connected community chat in game which allows you to share death messages or interesting finds to talk about. The community is wonderful, the developers also update the game with new features. If you are still unsure about the game you can download the game for free at the developers website. If you like it, consider picking this up on Steam and supporting the developers!			"

												This is what roguelikes are meant to be. Fair but brutal. Easy to pick up, but can also plot, plan, conive, and strategize to the end of days. Loads of start options (classes, races, that sort) to unlock, with a decent assortment of default-unlocked characters ranging through easy-hard and beginner-complex spectrums. Graphics, sound, music all functional enough to work nicely, backed by gameplay that would've still dwarfed them anyhow if it would've had a big studio throwing insane money at artists to pretty it up. Completely turn-based, so you can jump up to answer the phone or door or grab a snack or whatever else (like just trying to think your way out of a rough patch when it looks like next move could be the last) without needing to find a pause, but you'll likely find yourself already up later than intended claiming to yourself that you'll go to bed after just one more level. Replayability already high when played on regular difficulty and some extra lives allowed, then you can always turn up difficulty while playing one-life mode and playing a class you're less comfortable with to make it more interesting, while also hunting down large amounts of achievements, some of which are challenging all on their own, others are challenging except in the rare case that the RNG components smile on you. Or start a character with difficulty turned down and/or lives set to infinite just to get a better idea of what will and won't work out later before doing it on a ""real"" savefile. And then you could always get into using or making mods if you're into that. Have spotty internet sometimes? As long as you had it already downloaded, completely works in offline mode (with minor limitations of not getting special event dungeons unlocked if the dev sprinkles it to everybody, and offline mode has a separate shared stash from online mode).Still not sure? Poke around their website, there should still be a free version available (had some minor limitations when I did so years ago, looks like less limits now?). Worth every penny to buy though. Looking forward to getting Embers expansion and checking out its content before or after when I eventually get through more of what's already offered by the base game and Ashes expansion.			"

												I have 100+ hours on this game already - and that's on Steam only;  you can get a free non-Steam version of ToME on its website - so I feel it's time to make a review.First things first, it's a roguelike alright: permadeath, randomized world, tile-based graphics, yadda yadda. And yet it's a great introduction to the roguelike genre, because there are options to play it with a number of lives, or even unlimited ones, to get the hang of the game! Not EVERYTHING is randomized (there are fixed artifacts, fixed locations, etc but it still feels like a roguelike). Also, it contains intuitive UI and gameplay. For example, there are practically no consumables like potions and scrolls - not in the sense we're accostumed to. Instead, your powers (and some items) have cooldowns along with, naturally, some resource management (stamina, mana, psi, etc.). Cast X spell/move? Wait Z turns to use it again. Or, maybe, use some talent that can reset some cooldowns ;-). That cooldown system is really intuitive and just one of the many reasons I'm in love with ToME.Now let's talk about the world. I'm not an old ToME follower but unless I'm mistaken, it used to be set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth, until it was changed to a more original lore. And it's a great lore: the continent of Eyal was, some time ago, devastated by catatrophic used of magic (i.e the Spellblaze), there are still mage hunters (Zigur), there are political issues (Halflings are militaristic and even used to slave Yeeks); heck, even the demons have a touching and fantastic backstory!

												A pretty brutal roguelike with a very simple easy to use interface. All of the usual fantasy tropes present and accounted for as well as some other fun additions not commonly found in such games. Classes run the gamut from standard beat stick warriors and glass cannon archmages all the way to the strange paradox magi and psionic solipsists.The game can be especially frustrating when playing low hp characters who can die in a single turn if you don't scout ahead so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a short temper, but if you're a fan of roguelikes it's a pretty solid addition to your library.And if you're aren't sure you want to buy it you can play the game for free on the creator's website.

												For those of us who can play a game without needing to be wowed by fancy graphics -- but instead be enamoured by the depth, challenge and gameplay of a rogue-like, this is for you. I LOVE this game. So many different race and class combinations and then you realize there are heaven knows how many builds for the character combos you like the most. Fun loot, detailed story (that you can just as well skip if you just want to hack and slash), and every time you play you can unlock a new game mode or race or class to make things more interesting. This brings me back to my C64 days -- where your game HAD to be good by virtue of substance because it was not technically possible to deliver elegant style. You can play for ten minutes or hours on end -- it's a great palette cleanser for other games as well!			"

												A true roguelike that got rid of some of the arguably unnecessary and frustrating features of roguelikes (e.g. cursed armor that just randomly kills you) and minimizes off-time with it's auto-explore feature.The thing that really shines about this game is the character progression and creation though. Unlike traditional roguelike different classes play COMPLETELY different and indroduce new and interesting mechanics (like the manipulation of time for example). Almost every style of play is to be found here; from being a nasty necromancer and summoning skeletons and bone giants to slaughter your enemies to the time manipulating bow - dual weapon hybrid to the anti-magic ""slime mage"" that posisons his enemies, summons slimes to control the battlefield and uses PSIBLADES (F***ING PSIONIC LASERSWORDS).In addition to the HUGE amount of classes, the classes themselves are extremly complex by having many different skill-trees to develop and unlock. While some people might see this as a negative I feel like this adds a lot of complexity of depth to the game and makes you able to play classes in completely different ways.TL;DR: DO YOU LIKE DEEP RPGs? DO YOU HATE DYING TO BS AND WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DEATHS? DO YOU NOT MIND F***ING UP AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE YOU SUCK AT THE GAME?THEN GET THIS FREAKING GAME BECAUSE IT'S EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED AN MORE			"

												A great Roguelike that makes it easy to get into the genreJust like Dungeons of Dreadmore of SWOTS: The Pit, this game eases you into the idea of a Roguelike gently so that you can try it out without it being quite as brutal as, say, Nethack or DoomRL. The graphics are not a selling point in this title, but the gameplay should be. With tons of unlocks, lots of ways to stat and build characters, castes and quests to choose that will vary gameplay widely, and a big variety of enemies, if you've never gotten into a RL before but would like to try, get this.If you're like me and more experienced in the genre, I still recommend it as this does some interesting things with the forumula--the capacity for kind of rogue-like not-quite-permadeath; the ability to (for example) forswear all arcane magic in exchange for joining a new faction of the game and learning magic-disrupting powers; the fact that one school of magic is powered mostly by paradox (and you can meet and kill yourself! ?.?) means that this is much more in-depth a game than the RLs of the 90s. Sure, you can pick this up free on the developer's website, but you should pay for it (here or there) just to support the effort. 8.5 out of 10--which back in the old days on PC Gamer, meant that this is a classic well worth your time. :)			"

The very fact that this, supposedly, roguelike, allows this, fills me with joy cause otherwise it'd definitely be too hardcore for me to continue playing past couple of first(miserable) runs.The graphics are minimalistic but class diversity and meaningful loot more that make up for it.

												I told myself not to write a review before I've actually beaten the game, and while it took me longer than expected (admittedly not in small part due to me fooling around instead of playing serious builds), this is it.This is hands-down my favorite game ever.Before i begin: You can play the game for free by downloading it from te4.org (the official website).Purchasing the Steam version will get you a few perks you would otherwise get by donating. (those aren't major, however the DLC is and is in my opinion definitely worth it)So do test it first before buying and then buy it if you want to support the creator (mostly a single guy by the way).Things that are great:-It's in many parts a traditional roguelike (which I am a fan of), that means: turn-based combat, procedurally generated dungeons.-It's in some parts more forgiving than traditional roguelikes: option to choose between permadeath, a limited number of lives or unlimited lives (while the last takes away from the fun imo), multiple difficulty settings (easier, which will not get you any achievements, normal, which is pretty hard, on to various degrees of insanity)-the most interesting choice of classes i know from virtually anywhere: There are the classic Berserker, Archer, Archmage but also things like Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Brawler, Solipsist.-Every class is played differently: due to completely different sets of skills and build possibilities, each class has its own unique playstyle.-no grinding: all dungeons can only be cleared once, there are no respawning mobs. Additionally there are no consumables, these are replaced by ""inscriptions"" which are infinitely usable, but on a cooldown, meaning there is nothing you have to save up for a big bossfight, but you still have to think about when you use what in that fight.-impressive gameworld: The sheer amount of lore there is for you to find is impressive. This is a point where it differs from many classic roguelikes: It has a main quest, a story, and lots of backstory, all of which I personally found to be interesting and engaging. The various dungeons feel interesting and different.-it's challenging: You actually have to either think about what you are doing, or prepare to die a lot. You might die a lot even if you do until you figure some things out. To me that is a good thing, to others it might not be i guess, but that's what exploration mode (unlimited lives) is for: figuring stuff out.-great community: Why is this important? While it is not a multiplayer game, there is an in game online chat. It shows character deaths and character achievements (this can be turned on/off) and can be used for chatting. This is extremely helpful for asking about things you might need to know, and in my experience the community will be more than happy to help.The things you might not like:-Graphics: This is a Tileset-based game. It doesnt feature great animations or anything like that apart from spell effects. If that is extremely off-putting to you, i'm sorry. As to the tileset itself, I like it, others might not.-It may not be easy to get into: There are many stats to keep track of, sometimes making it hard to decide which items to take over others, the GUI is great in my opinion, but at the start it can take a bit to get used to it. So if you have any questions while playing: dont hesitate to ask in chat!-it's challenging: see above-If you are an achievement completionist, you might get into problems with this game. Just a warning.All  in all, i very much recommend to try it.And dont give up after a few deaths :P			"

												I was very skeptical about whether this game would be any good.  At this point I can say it is more than good.  This roguelike is pretty brilliant if you ask me.  And I think it's developed by just one dude.  That's the impression I've been given.Turn-based combat, a large amount of enemy variety, some randomly generated elements, and strong character building makes for a good amount of fun and diversity in every playthrough.  There are many races and classes for you to choose from too, all with their own unique qualities in the form of different stats and skills.  There's good variety in the armor, weapons, and the many other items you can find and equip as well.  Pretty good sized map to explore, and the game has well written lore and dialogue.  Lots of humor, but also some pretty twisted stuff.  It's great.You can also select a difficulty setting AND a permadeath setting at character creation.  The two are separate things.  There are 5 difficulty settings ranging from Easier to Madness.  And 3 permadeath settings.  Roguelike which gives you one life (unless you find a rare way to resurrect yourself).  Adventure which gives you multiple lives.  And Exploration which gives you infinite lives.  I've mostly been trying Nightmare/Roguelike.There are 1386 achievements.  Most of them are repeated achievements for different difficulties/permadeath settings, but if you do an achievement on a high difficulty/permadeath setting you can get the lower ones along with it (consult the Steam forums to find out how).  Along with achievements, there are a bunch of secrets you can unlock.The game also has two DLC.  Both are cheap, so if you buy the game pick them up as well.  One adds new classes and two new zones.  The other is a Steam UI celebrating their launch on steam.  I believe there may be more DLC on the way but I can't say anything for certain.Worth every penny.			"

												The most complete turn-based rpg you will find in steam, and it's not only good because of the enormous contents it has to offer, but also the great amount of replayability that makes this game really catchy.Prior to playing this, i weren't really into said kind of games, thinking those're boring. This game were my first try, and today is a game i often play when i'm bored.Pretty simple at the beginning, you choose a class, a race, a name and a gender, then the gamemod (you'll unlock them as you play) and the difficulty/lifes for your character, with complete freedom to choose between some easy and relaxing way to start understanding how the game works, or to begin with an insane journey with only one life that you'll probably lose very soon.As i mentioned, you can unlock other gamemods while you play and complete certain tasks, and same thing is for other classes and races to have further plays with, trying out new playstyles and techniques.It can be an unfair experience most of the times, even when playing with a standard difficulty and with a set amount of lives, so don't try to get too upset when losing your character from a single killing blow by a ""something""-caster (if not ""anything""-caster), or for losing a fight with strange unique monsters that have for some reason your same skills/spells, or by overpowered monsters that have 40 more levels than you, that appeared when moved a little harmless rock.It's surely an experience that should be tried by those who even thinks to dislike this genre of games, because this is a new perspective that should be taken into account if you didn't liked a previous one of the same subject; this doesn't mean that this game will be valued the same way by everyone who tries it, since it still is (and always be) one of the most difficult games, where to succeed one of the best way is not to win it, but to lose trying to do it.

												This is the best roguelike on steam. Strikes a perfect balance between usability/user friendliness with depth and complexity. I'll review this game by highlighting what I think sets it apart from other games in the genre.No consumable items - TOME doesn't have potions, scrolls, or wands. You choose a limited number of abilities that give you the function that consumables play in other games - quick heal, regen, teleport, blink, fireball, etc. This eliminates the issues lots of people have with hoarding consumables, not knowing when to use them, the pain of having them destroyed, etc. Picking and choosing the right abilities adds a layer of depth that doesn't exist in other roguelikes. Fast - this game plays lightning fast and is very streamlined, thanks to the lack of consumables. Of course, it's turn based, so it's only as fast as you want...but I tend to play pretty fast, and lots of roguelikes feel sluggish in comparison.Broad - Lots of classes, from your standard mage and warrior to the cool weird things like Chronomancers and Wyrmics (dragon-fighters). Deep - The different classes feel distinct. In addition to the obvious (different skills and equipment), different types of classes have different types of resources (mana/stamina/equilibrium/hate/probably some other ones) that work in different ways.  Combat Is Fun  - This is the only roguelike I've played where melee combat is actually fun. You get lots of buttons to push that do different things. In most roguelikes, the coolest thing about your melee character is the equipment you find. In TOME, you can actually do cool♥♥♥♥♥♥- charge, shout, whirlwinds, cleaves, etc. Simple - This doesn't mean easy and it doesn't mean shallow - it just means simple. Clean, streamlined design. The action bar is great - every option your character has is on it, so you always know what you can and can't do. No navigating labyrinthine menus, no checking your inventory after you died and remembering you could have used your blink, etc.Overworld - Like ADOM and not like Crawl, TOME features a static overworld that's always the same and features the same dungeons/locations, which are themselves randomized. This isn't necessarily better or worse, just putting it out there.This game is an absolute blast. If you liked Dungeons of Dreadmor, you owe it to yourself to take a step up to a more serious and more interesting game. :)			"

												Graphics are simple but the mechanics are deep. Classes have skills like in WoW but with more skills and more customization akin to an ARPG. Things that could be tedious are streamlined not to be, for example loot you don't want is automatically disenchanted for gold at end of level. The campaign to actually win is long, but not too long. You can play with only 1 life or with a few lives and unlock a few more the further you get, which is great because even a very experienced player will likely die a few times on nightmare difficulty and above. The classes are completely unique and have a lot going on with them. If you enjoy min/maxing a brand new class with a bunch of abilities, you can do that for hundreds of hours since there are so many classes. This game has a tendency to make time pass by faster than expected like in Civilization games. Only negative I have with it is that the early game on the highest difficulties is too unforgiving.Also my initial impression of the game wasn't great, it took me about an hour to start to realize how good it was.

												This is seriously one of the best rogue-likes out there!  It is quite punishing, but not oppressively so like Dungeon Crawl.  There is a steep learning curve, your first adventure, or first few dozen adventures will probably not yield you anything game-wise, but you will learn.  Playing around a little bit, you will start seeing synergies with how the different skills for the classes interact with each other, and then start building yourself a truly powerful character.For me, nothing feels better than having your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by the game repeatedly, and then, figuring out the class you're trying to do, and waltzing through the end-game content like a seasoned veteran...because you are!  You will learn the strategies, understand the tactics, shape your reactions to the situations appropriately, and you will conquer!  You will earn your end-game god-like status not by farming, or investing time at the expense of brainpower, you will earn it through sweat and, sometimes, tears of frustration, but you absolutely will earn it, and when you deal that final blow, you will feel like you truly accomplished something great......and then you will start the process over again, learning a new class!

												This is my first time encountering TOME ever here on Steam.  I've already put almost 20 hours into the game this weekend alone, and I'm wondering why I didn't play this game sooner!The depth (more than 1000 achievements!) and time that you can spend on one character, only to watch it die and having to start over is a great thing in gaming .  You get to really care about the investment!  Combine the price with the many mods and the massive amount of depth the game has and you have an awesome package! "

												Compared to the other reviewers who clocked hundreds (thousands!) of hours, I can't say much about the game. It's one of the best Rogue RPG I have ever played, its depth is amazing, and god the possibilities... ! I love the fact you need to unlock new races and classes with specific actions which makes me feel much better whenever I lose the game (compare it to Stone Soup for instance where your death doesn't change your options).The game mechanics and the skills system let you build so many different characters, it's just mental. Simply one of the best rogues out there period. Very often it's priced at around 1 euro, which is amazingly cheap for what it offers.			"

Four dudes and a monster that looks like ramen noodles pop out and have me surrounded, they gangrape me until I die.How big was this chest I opened, that it could hold four dudes and a pack of ramen?Anyways, pretty good roguelike.

												Tales OF Maj'Eyal is an incredibly complex and deep Rogue-like game with turn-based combat and a large amount of content.I've put more then 100 hours into the game and I haven't unlocked even half the classes/races (Maybe I just suck). There is a race and class for any type of player, but with this game you will want to try every one of them. Usually I find some quirks to these type of games, but everything you need is there, with a simple interface and all the information you need, so your never left in the dark on what a skill does or why you just died.There is a huge amount of content, with randomly generated dungeons for you to go through and many different quests to partake with many easter eggs to be found. I always seem to find something new and exciting every playthrough. There is also many different gamemodes and difficulties to contour to any player.I think this game is perfect for anyone who loves this genre of game, or even people new to the genre. Graphically its not too complex like ASCII graphics, and once you truly get into the game you will find it hard to stop.The game also has over 1000 achievements for those who like to collect, and with a current price tag of 7$, theres no reason I can think of to stop you from buying this game.

												Honestly, some of the most fun I've had with a roguelike, can only name a few that I'd rank higher than it. Unlike most roguelikes, there's an overworld with towns, said overworld and said towns are not randomly generated, but have fixed layouts, only the dangerous areas that would loosely define as ""dungeons"" are random in layout. Each option feels quite different, and usually has a somewhat unique play style, with race choice as well as class. The game doesn't exactly feel unfair until mid to late levels when the adventure starts getting into ridiculous territory.Visuals for something as lightweight as this and static sprites are quite nice, there's some 3D effects and 2D effects based on special abilities being used, the sprites are large and detailed enough to know what you're facing before you mouse over it.Controls are fairly simple, opting for an action bar where you can slot all your different items/abilities, which may deter some of the hardcore players of roguelikes. There's also mouse support, and right clicking on your character or other things allows one to play mostly with the mouse if one prefers.Sound is present, there's music for every area, sounds for different attacks and special abilities, nothing to really write home about, but it's not bad.Game mechanics are fairly solid and scale up to the point of more or less halfling going toe to toe with kaiju god-slaying robot of death, though quite a few of the mechanics are not 100% intuitive, difficulty is pretty variable with lots of options. Achievements are a colossal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥though, as a result, as getting an achievement in one difficulty setting doesn't unlock it for any others, and a lot of the achievements have 12 variations or so based on difficulty settings. Will say that some randomly generated enemies can be impossible to kill, I had an issue with a named bone giant who was impossible to kill at the level cap with ridiculously strong abilities as a summoner.The game also has a plot and rewards you for being a nice person or a total jerk as well. It's not super deep, but it's enjoyable.The engine's moddable as well, I recall the official site having an eastern fantasy campaign.			"

												Nice beginner-friendly graphical roguelike. It's from the less wackyrandom branch of roguelikes so there's less stuff you have to learn by dying constantly and not so many unfair instadeaths. This can be a good thing if you don't like RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, but if you enjoy Nethack-type randomness more you might find this game a bit boring.The best part of the game is the character development. There's tons of classes and races and while you start with the more usual ones like warriors and rogues, through game events you will unlock dozens more ranging from time-travellers to plague cultists with quite unique gameplay mechanics. There are tons of optional skill trees to unlock through quests so your characters will become quite varied.Minus points for the completely bland levels, monsters and itemization. There's an ADOM-type overworld map which ensures that not every area is a traditional dungeon, but the levels themselves are just plain boring with no interesting features. Then again the game does have a great auto-explore function so at least you don't have to slog through the dull mazes manually, this is a really good addition, you can fast-forward to the next encounter. Item-wise there are no consumables like the usual potions and scrolls so while it keeps the game less cluttered it also reduces the variety of events and loot a lot. The only items are gear you wear/wield so you can get bigger numbers on your character sheet, sometimes you can get artifacts/runes which grant an extra skill. Simple, but gets grindy and boring. It doesn't help that you mostly have to do the same areas again when you make a new character, they get repetitive.This game leans a bit more towards traditional RPGs because the lack of random craziness means that you usually die just when you get too cocky and proceed to a situation you can't handle and on the default difficulty you're allowed to make some mistakes. Characters seem to lead much longer lives than usually in roguelikes and a successful run takes something like 20 hours. I just wish it had more memorable and dynamic areas and enemies, but the class and skill system is still better than in most roguelikes.While there are many things that I don't like and I find the brutal unfair roguelikes more entertaining, I still think ToME is good. It's really fun to try out new character concepts and once you're getting bored with them there's something completely different you've unlocked and you start over.			"

												Short version: This is a wonderful roguelike and well worth the price.Longer version:  Tales of Maj'Eyal is a nicely balanced turn based roguelike set in a well written world filled with lore.  The graphics are nice and simple, with many similar roguelikes using ASCII instead.  There is a nice selection of classes and races with a large amount of unlockable classes that all have interesting differences to set them apart.  For 2 examples, you could be a defensive tank with the bulwark class, or an alchemist, lobbing magic infused gems as explosives while your golem protects you.Another nice detail is the differentiation between arcane, nature and psionic abilities, including the presence of items ""Infused by arcane disrupting forces"", which can mess with any arcane abilities.  And what roguelike would be complete without randomly generated gear, with a nice amount of pre-generated artifacts(with written lore/descriptions) to add to the mix.  Lastly, this game also has a good selection of difficulty level, with normal, easier and nightmare unlocked by default, along with the for exploration mode, adventurer mode or roguelike mode.  As the names might suggest, the roguelike mode is permadeath, with a rare few exceptions, while adventurer mode gives you a couple lives, along with a few more as you reach the higher levels, though enemies do fully reheal if you respawn.If you're a fan of roguelikes or turn based rpgs, then this is a game well worth looking into.

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike with modern design.  Rather than being a simple dungeon crawler, it's a full-fledged RPG that plays like a roguelike - with more options for character building and more things to do.  Playing the game unlocks new races and classes to play, so permadeath isn't just a penalty, but a feature that lets you play something new and exciting.  Every race and class plays differently, so you will rarely lack for new things to do.Bottom line: beneath the seemingly simple veneer is a great game that's more than worth your time and money.			"

The game is free online for you to download and play. This is the payed version that automatically gets you all the donor perks and steam achievements.

												A traditional turn-based dungeon crawler, without all of the traditional dungeon crawler inconveniences and inherent shortcomings. No consumable hoarding, no grinding, no unmanagable interfaces, tons of hotkeys available for you to bind, a mouse gesture binding feature, tons of races and classes to start and even more to unlock, the list goes on. Definitely worth the modest price if you're an existing roguelike fan or are interested in the genre.			"

												What I have played of this game has been absolutely amazing, and I wish I had more time in my day to really delve into all it has to offer. This game entails the heart of what makes many love Roguelikes. All the features of a true Roguelike are in this beautiful game, and if you don't wish to go the hair-pulling route (that many of us are masochistically fond of,) you can set the lives distribution from permadeth to limited, or even infinite if you so desire. The art style is simplistic but beautiful, if not nostalgiac. Those who have been playing Roguelikes for a while or who know the genre from its roots may find a nice feel of classics such as Nethack and Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) in this game, as it keeps elements of those games, as well as the genre's originator, ROGUE itself intact, while throwing in a few modern entities that work very well.For those who like the classic roguelikes, whether it's the retro ASCII or the Tile-set based games, you'll find a lot of enjoyment in this game. A high recommendation to any pure Roguelike or Roguelite fan.			"

												Easily one of the best roguelikes I've ever played.  You start with only the more classic character archtypes unlocked, but that's good because it gives you time to get acquainted to the game's quirks, like consumable items being replaced with cooldown timers on charms, runes and infusions.  This makes how well you do significantly less dependent on luck, and more on just how you play.Additionally, Cursed is, even in it's simplicity, the most insanely fun class I've played in any roguelike to date, and super easy to unlock.The Wiki is super useful, and it doesn't take away from the game to follow a suggested build before trying your own thing out, either.  http://te4.org/wiki/Main_Page "

												This game can be found for free (legally) , but it's worth paying for.  You get a very deep game that is a good fusion of roguelike gameplay and a classic RPG- and you can change the settings to get what you desire, and you can even unlock a pure dungeon-stomp.  I don't like how classes are locked to start, but there are mods to change this- the mod potential of this game is pretty strong.   If you like either RPGs or roguelike games, this will be a very good pick, provided you adjust to settings to fit the game how you wish to play it.			"

												Honestly, some of the most fun I've had with a roguelike, can only name a few that I'd rank higher than it. Unlike most roguelikes, there's an overworld with towns, said overworld and said towns are not randomly generated, but have fixed layouts, only the dangerous areas that would loosely define as ""dungeons"" are random in layout. Each option feels quite different, and usually has a somewhat unique play style, with race choice as well as class. The game doesn't exactly feel unfair until mid to late levels when the adventure starts getting into ridiculous territory.Visuals for something as lightweight as this and static sprites are quite nice, there's some 3D effects and 2D effects based on special abilities being used, the sprites are large and detailed enough to know what you're facing before you mouse over it.Controls are fairly simple, opting for an action bar where you can slot all your different items/abilities, which may deter some of the hardcore players of roguelikes. There's also mouse support, and right clicking on your character or other things allows one to play mostly with the mouse if one prefers.Sound is present, there's music for every area, sounds for different attacks and special abilities, nothing to really write home about, but it's not bad.Game mechanics are fairly solid and scale up to the point of more or less halfling going toe to toe with kaiju god-slaying robot of death, though quite a few of the mechanics are not 100% intuitive, difficulty is pretty variable with lots of options. Achievements are a colossal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥though, as a result, as getting an achievement in one difficulty setting doesn't unlock it for any others, and a lot of the achievements have 12 variations or so based on difficulty settings. Will say that some randomly generated enemies can be impossible to kill, I had an issue with a named bone giant who was impossible to kill at the level cap with ridiculously strong abilities as a summoner.The game also has a plot and rewards you for being a nice person or a total jerk as well. It's not super deep, but it's enjoyable.The engine's moddable as well, I recall the official site having an eastern fantasy campaign.			"

												Easily one of the best traditional roguelikes out there. It's more accessible than say Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Nethack, or other classics, but there's still tons of depth to be explored. TOME has decent looking (for roguelike standards) art, countless build possibilities (thanks to its in-depth character customization), and fun combat that actually involves the usage of skills as opposed to just bumping into enemies the entire time.

												I've played a lot of roguelikes before. Most of them feel like one long dungeon run. Some of them have a sort of level select (crypt of the necrodancer) or progress through different levels (rogues legacy/binding of isaac).But none of them had the feeling like you were an adventurer, going on YOUR OWN adventure. They kind of drop you in a dungeon and say ""have fun, here's your dungeon"".But in TOME (tales of maj'eyal) you got an overworld map. You can go to really difficult areas or fight random adventurers who just roam around. There's towns you can visit and tons of shops.It's very immersive, especially for a roguelike. It makes me want to play some pen and paper D&D again.And there's a ton of skills and items you can get. And lots of random events. Many random bosses / minibosses who will destroy you. There's just a TON of content. It's not difficult to get into, although discerning what loot is useful or not is definitely beyond casual.You can chat with other players, which even in a single player game can add a lot. You can see when people die, which even if you aren't talking to them, is interesting to watch.And my personal favorite feature is that you can have multiple lives. It's not a great feature in the spirit of roguelikes, but in the spirit of gaming it's fantastic. This is usually an instant ""omg this game sucks and isn't a roguelike"". But I love everything about these type of RPGs, EXCEPT for the permadeath.For some reason, finding a mix of roguelike aspects in a non-roguelike RPG is impossible. That is, things like traps, random events, deep character customizations, random/persistent effects, and just general ""I have no idea what this will do, but I'll try it"". The ONLY game that ever came close to that which I know of is Din's Curse. Although TOME has the feature as a gamemode, so that's fantastic.			"

I got it on sale for 1.80$ and I don't regret it one bit. It's worth so much more than the full price, you're basically getting charged pocket money for what it is.

												Amazing roguelike game, challenging but not unfair and easier to get into than many other roguelikes. If you're unfamiliar with then genre, think  turn based Diablo. There is a huge selection of classes to choose from, and you can play the same class multiple ways since you have a limited amout of skill points. The game's tileset looks great, but there is an ASCII mode too if you prefer that. The music is well done, and so are the sound effects.The game is available free on the developers website if you'd like to try it out, but you wont have access to a lot of features that come with the paid version, mostly an item stash and Steam Workshop mods. Definately worth picking up.			"

												Nice beginner-friendly graphical roguelike. It's from the less wackyrandom branch of roguelikes so there's less stuff you have to learn by dying constantly and not so many unfair instadeaths. This can be a good thing if you don't like RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, but if you enjoy Nethack-type randomness more you might find this game a bit boring.The best part of the game is the character development. There's tons of classes and races and while you start with the more usual ones like warriors and rogues, through game events you will unlock dozens more ranging from time-travellers to plague cultists with quite unique gameplay mechanics. There are tons of optional skill trees to unlock through quests so your characters will become quite varied.Minus points for the completely bland levels, monsters and itemization. There's an ADOM-type overworld map which ensures that not every area is a traditional dungeon, but the levels themselves are just plain boring with no interesting features. Then again the game does have a great auto-explore function so at least you don't have to slog through the dull mazes manually, this is a really good addition, you can fast-forward to the next encounter. Item-wise there are no consumables like the usual potions and scrolls so while it keeps the game less cluttered it also reduces the variety of events and loot a lot. The only items are gear you wear/wield so you can get bigger numbers on your character sheet, sometimes you can get artifacts/runes which grant an extra skill. Simple, but gets grindy and boring. It doesn't help that you mostly have to do the same areas again when you make a new character, they get repetitive.This game leans a bit more towards traditional RPGs because the lack of random craziness means that you usually die just when you get too cocky and proceed to a situation you can't handle and on the default difficulty you're allowed to make some mistakes. Characters seem to lead much longer lives than usually in roguelikes and a successful run takes something like 20 hours. I just wish it had more memorable and dynamic areas and enemies, but the class and skill system is still better than in most roguelikes.While there are many things that I don't like and I find the brutal unfair roguelikes more entertaining, I still think ToME is good. It's really fun to try out new character concepts and once you're getting bored with them there's something completely different you've unlocked and you start over.			"

												Don't be fooled by the simple, tile-based graphics. This is easily the most polished roguelike I've played. It demands a lot of thought, and rewards you with deep and engaging gameplay with important choices to make on multiple levels. As you progress through the story and unlock more races, classes, and skills, the number of possible play styles available multiplies. It takes a lot of time to even begin to master, but is compartmentalized in a way that allows you to play in short doses if your life is generally busy.One warning: don't get this game if you're a compulsive completionist. There are close to 1400 achievements; it's simply impossible to do more than a relative handful of them unless you're one of those lucky YouTube entertainers who plays games for a living.			"

												There's really only 1 thing that bothers me about this game - unlocking an achievement on a higher difficulty setting doesn't do the same for a lower difficulty. Given that I'll never play on anything but roguelike, that leaves me with a bunch of achievements I'll never get.Other than that, this is a great roguelike. It is class based so there are some choice moments when you really wish you could use that awesome item you found, but that's true of most of the genre. Most of what I've seen has been that good choices and skill synergy trumps RNG drops.Starting out, your choices are pretty limited. You need to fulfill certain requirements to unlock additional races and classes. Thankfully, these conditions aren't hard to fulfill and will (mostly) naturally happen as you progress through the game. I was kind of annoyed by that, but it did give me a chance to play around with some of the basic skill trees and get a feel for the combat styles in this game.If you do pick this up, I'd recommend taking a look at some of the add-ons like the advanced item compare, better escorts and improved sorting. I played my first 70 or so hours without them, but they do improve QoL.			"

												The person w/the 2,300 hours convinced me to buy this. Is that a glitch? Holy smokes!Back in like 1990 I had a friend who's father had a gaming room w/his computer setup. He was like a god amongst us kids because the games on the computer were so unreal compared to Nintendo.Anyway...he would play something that looked like ToME, and have maps/posters up all over his walls. I believe they were OLD D&D turn based games for DOS. This game took me right back to being there, standing in awe, watching his father play. This game transported me back to that time.Thanks for that. Now I have to go tell my wife why I haven't really done anything around here lately.			"

												This rougelike keeps destroying me, yet I keep coming back for more. It might take an hour or so of playing to really understand what's going on and how the game works, but once you figure it out the game really opens up.Pros:- Many races and classes to choose from, allows for quite a few styles of play- Combat greatly rewards the use of tactics- Turn-based, so you can take as long as you need to to strategizeCons:- Campaign mode is quite long, can easily play a character for 6 hours then have them die, which is heart-breaking- Loot doesn't seem to matter much for magic-based characters. Also not much incentive to buy anything as a mage either.- Although dungeons have random layouts, the campaign mode is pretty much the same every time. This can make the beginning of the game tedious once you've done it several times and it doesn't really changeNeutral:- Graphics. I personally like the graphics in the game, but some might find them datedAll in all I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys difficult, turn-based rpg's. If for some reason you hate grinding or repetition, you ay have problems with this game. "

												Even though I have tried to post other game reviews, they never are posted for some reason or another. So with that in mind, this is my ""first"" review. My experience within this game is limited (37.9 hrs at time of post), but my time with this game may be much more when looked at in the future. Now lets get to the meat of the review, the pros and cons.Pros:+Great, meticulous tactical gameplay+An intricate skill tree system (Which can be expanded through various events)+Unforgiving (given that it is a rougelike game)+Dedicated support from DarkGod, the sole developer (He has been working on this game for over 17 years!)+Good support for mods and addons+Enticing lore! The world feels very alive and the stories are very well thought out.+Fun and deep character creation, especially as you unlock classes and races+Interesting classes (I bet your other RPGs don't have Oozemancers or Temproal Wardens!)+A good community+Very challenging and it will test your abilities+The game can be downloaded for free on its website. You won't have access to some small features but you can unlock those by donating money to DarkGod. Otherwise, you can just buy through Steam and get those goodies right off the bat, like I did. +An exploration mode with infinate lives. You can accustom yourself to the game and tinker with various builds and whatnot (This is a special perk for those who donate should you download it from its website) +Alternative modes to play should you get bored of the main story lines (Infinite Dungeon and Arena) Cons:-Graphics are quite dated but this is largely a non-issue. The developer started working on this game in the late 1990s so the engine that the game runs on is very old. Could potentially deter gamers who have only really experienced more recent games like Skyrim, Diablo 3, etc. But you know, their loss.-Can be rage inducing. The amount of times you die is ridiculous and due to the RNG within the game, you can get very unlucky and run into a monster or mob that erases your pixelated♥♥♥♥♥ But hey, you knew what you signed up for ;)-Bugs, crashing, etc. Though these are rare, there have been hiccups which might kill you or just cause you to crash. (I know of one with a passive which allows you to speed up immensely for a short time after killing an enemy and moving with it may cause your game to crash. It has happened to me many times but it was just an annoyance since I set back to my previous save point) It's minor, but something to keep in mind since you can be punished brutally if you make a mistake.Conclusion:This is just a great game and one that recieves so much love. Being someone who is relatively new to the ""Rougelike"" genre of games, this game has got me hooked! Outside of the few minor annoyances, this is a full, flushed out game. This thing has recieved more time and dedication than most marriages do in the U.S. (lol) There is so much story and content to this game, most of which I have yet to experience for myself. This game is frustrating in the best of ways. It drives you to go further, try new classes, races, etc. DarkGod (from what I have seen and heard) is very active and continues to work on content for this game. One example is the new expansion he released in February, ""Embers of Rage"" and he has hinted at more expansions that he is or will be working on in the future. He also will create special events in the game and play with those currently playing. I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to those who enjoy a good RPG or rougelike game. It is one in a long string of games that I have enjoyed so much that I binged on it. While this game was released on Steam in 2012 and is a bit dated, I will support this diamond in the rough and I hope you do too!			"

												A roguelike with a wonderful amount of depth. There are class and race combinations to suit any play style, more of which will be unlocked as you play the game. Don't want to wait before you can play as a Yeek paradox mage? That's fine, you can install a mod to unlock everything from the start, but I think you'd be denying yourself the joy of slowly exploring and discovering more about this world and what it has to offer.Speaking of modding, there's a whole host of great stuff available, ranging from minor tweaks to full overhauls; the mod catalogue is well worth a browse.Highly recommended!

												This is probably one of the best roguelike dungeon crawlers on Steam (for the price:play ratio). I've played (and supported) this for many, many years and seen it grow and change and evolve... All I can say is:  if you've not played it (and are a fan of the genre), where the hell have you been?!There is so much content and so much to discover, You'll find plenty of people with 100+ hours of gameplay and they'll tell you that they've barely scratched the surface of the game.  It's a game that, in general description, sounds generic but I promise you, it's anything but.You won't be wasting any money if you like a good dungeon crawl (one that is both blissful and brutal.)

												When I first looked at it - let's just say I was not impressed.It looked like a browser MMO knock-off: brigtish colours, long-donkey bar (that'd not be customisable I bet and ofcourse no shortcuts etc.). Prolly got like 3 cookie-cutter races/classes combo, gender locked on top of that.Boy, was I in for a surprise.Tales are a beautiful, complex and deep game with a plenty of room to make your build, your characted - the way you want it. Wanna have a hulking ghoulish brute ogre? Here you go. A hulking ogre brute ghoul? You know were I'm getting.The plot itself is pretty linear, but offers some motivation and intertainment.Also It is obvious (for me, at least) that the devs are big, big, BIG fans of pnp boardgames - and the game itself, being a generalised homage of some of them, racking some xtra points from your truly.

I just unlocked a new rogue class so I am starting over with it as it is more for combat vs stealth.

Lost both children due to neglect, one is in jail for driving his 2003 Jeep Cherokee through the entrance of a Bank of America in Dallas Texas while high on methamphetamines, the other starved to death under my watch.3. My dog starved to death, his food bowl lay empty and untended for weeks while her whines and barks begging me for mercy were but a distant echo coming from the skies in the land of Maj'Eyal4. Lost 87 lbs. and fallen unconscious twice due to dehydration. 5. Lost my job because I didn't show up to work for 3 weeks and didn't phone.6. Lost my house due to non-payment of mortgage. 7. Moved into my 76 year old mothers basement and drank all the alcohol in her house. She is currently asking me when I'm going to shower and find a job.However, I've come pretty close to beating it on Insane/Adventure, so it was all worthwhile.			"

												I got this game thinking it mitght be something good, but i wasn't too impressed with the videos in the store page (note: I'm not one to judge ""bad"" or ""outdated"" graphsics, I actually enjoy ToME (Tales of Maj'Eyal) graphics).After I installed it and played the tutorial i was a little overwhelmed with the possibilities and startet an elven alchemist run. Because I had no clue of all the graphical cues and I didnt know that i was getting rekt untill it was too late I died on the very first floor.  After that I startet a human Archer and got out of the first area killing the boss and I was proud of my achievements.Ater only a few runs I was hooked and couldn't stop playing the game for 30 hours in 5 days. I have never ever experienced something like it and had to take a break from the game since I was very frustrated for beeing bad :PI encourage everyone that loves rouge-like RPGs to get this game, you can play for many many hours.Pros:Great level and enemy variety and no run is the sameMany different races and classes with many different skills for a nigh unlimited replayabilityYou can unlock many classes, races and skills and there are many achivements to get (pretty much impossible to get all)Many different resources like mana, vim, psi...You can disable permadeath and choose either unlimited deaths or limited deaths insteadloads of loreThe ""only one more turn"" problem some games have. I lost lots of sleep because it suddenly was 4AMCons:You can get ♥♥♥♥ed by RNGSome classes are really bad and others are god-worthyIt will take you some time to get used to the UI and graphics, but once you got it its great.You will die. alot. sometimes very early on and othertimes to an incredibly powerful foe who randomly spawned there only to ♥♥♥♥ you over even though you had your best run so far. I love that but might be a big nogo for some people.Sometimes it laggs a bitThe ""only one more turn"" problem some games have. I lost lots of sleep because it suddenly was 4AM(this is both good and bad)There are probably many more things i didn't mention because i forgot. and I lost gametime on steam for some odd reason, i have like 20 hours more in the game than whats displayed.TL:DRGreat game for a great price with great replayability.

												Holy crap it has live events!The game is tileset turn base with mouse support. Its looks old but has a lot of modern elements added on. If you like tatical turn base cRPGs and don't mind tilesets then this is seriously a great game. SO MUCH CUSTOMIZATION! So many choices and so many ways you will die... but fear not as there are a few game modes ranging from infinite lives to true roguelike. Easy to play but its got a really robust mechanic system. Also has modding support. Tons of gear, tons of weapons, tons of monsters, tons of areas, tons of lore, and a stupidly high number of race/classes (of which u get to choose how they level and play via skills and perks and the RNG gear)Oh ya and no grinding. Once u clear a floor or whole dungeon its cleared for good. I think new hostiles can spawn on the overworld map though like hostile patrols, though not 100% sure.I should mention the game is 100% free (aside from the DLC) at te4.org though its made and maintsianed by 1 dude so worth it to buy it if you like it. And u can connect online to play but you won't see anyone as you are more or less just uploading your data and sometimes u might be playing and recieve a special world event because u were lucky to be logged in when it started :)4/5 is my personal rating for the game. Its great verging on fantatsic! And I would recomend this to more mature older gamers like myself. People that play D&D or really old games.			"

												This is mostly an old-fashioned turn-based roguelike (by opposition to rogue-lites like Spelunky and Binding of Isaac, which are usually real-time), though it lacks the item identification and the potion and scroll consumables we've come to love from its ancestor Angband, or better titles like NetHack and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. It also really likes cooldown-based abilities, so at times you'll feel like you're doing MMO combat.I found the game too easy initially on Normal, starting the game as a Cornac Berserker regular enemies were no challenge at all, only bosses took some work to kill. The game also drops you in a forest which is quite boring to explore, and the graphics don't make very clear which tiles are traversable and which are not. I recommend using the auto-explore function ('Z' key, rebindable) in levels where you're mostly meeting trash mobs.With time the game ups the challenge (and you can run into very dangerous areas if you're not careful, the game gives you a message which alludes to the difficulty when changing zones), and with level-ups you start discovering the deep RPG and item system. No complaints here, developing and equipping your character is very interesting, even though the game drowns you a in a sea of magic items with prefixes and suffixes, like Diablo and its ilk. (And unlike diablo, it has a lot of very small modifications to 10+ damage types. Yawning when you find yet another super-rare/legendary is never a good sign.) You unlock new characters and features through quests in the game, which I found cool.Combat is quite compelling whenever there's a sense of danger. As in most roguelikes, not getting surrounded and paying attention to everything before making a move is key. Between equipment, infusions/runes and skills, you have a lot of abilities with cooldowns, so most turns will be spent picking the right one or positioning yourself to use one rather than simply running into an enemy to auto-attack. What I was most impressed with is when facing boss-type characters, they use pretty much the same ability system as you, and they sometimes have a lot of skills. While it makes identifying a dangerous enemy at a glance pretty hard, it does make for rather epic fights as they cast spells, heal and trigger cooldown abilities just like you. Trust me, the first time you meet an enemy with knockback and spells is really scary when playing a melee character.The interface, however, is REALLY AWFUL (despite ridiculous frontpage claims of ""modern graphical and customisable interface, intuitive mouse control""), especially the inventory. It's not really comfortable to use with the mouse: instead of displaying a tooltip for what you're hovering your cursor over, it insists on always having some object selected, obscuring your view with the information display. Movement with the mouse is also not very intuitive, as your character will move to where you point... until it finds something ""interesting"" or an enemy, and then you have to revert to moving a square at a time if you want any semblance of control. It would actually seem like a good idea to learn the game solely with the keyboard at first, maybe even play another, keyboard only roguelike before this one. Only then will the mouse control layer make full sense. There's also a problem of information overload when looking at map tiles (and other stuff): do I really need to know that I need a ""special breathing method"" to traverse walls everytime I'm looking at one? The game cruelly needs to display only crucial information at a glance, and then offer to say, press shift to show detailed info like now in the tooltip (see Civilization IV and V and its most complex mods for good examples).The game has a fixed overworld, story elements and quite a bit of lore, which set it apart from NetHack and Crawl which only offer a giant dungeon. I found this refreshing, but I it comes with suggested level indications for dungeons and minimum levels to use some items, very jarring and immersion-breaking compared to the natural increase in difficulty as you go down in levels in other titles. It's gonna have a massive impact on replayability, too, the world map feels pretty small. There are towns and shops to return to and sell your loot: I think I slightly prefer the approach of Crawl where you can't sell stuff or transfer it to other characters, so you just dump stuff you don't need without hesitation. But if you like sorting through tons of loot Diablo or Borderlands-style, you'll be happy with this game.There's no downside to resting ('R' key) in this game. In fact I recommend resting as soon as you finish beating a group of enemies, to recharge your health and stamina and bring all your abilities off cooldown. (Annoyingly, some charge bars like ""equilibrium"" which is need for some powers are ignore by the rest function, leading you to spam the skip turn button or use a mod if you want to get back into an optimal state.) Having to spam rest like this doesn't feel too great, it feels like the game had a hunger mechanic like other roguelikes to urge you on and prevent abusing rest, but dropped it along the way leaving Rest feeling orphaned.There are a few other weird leftovers in the game, like a ""Scrying Orb"" which auto-identifies objects... and is completely pointless since objects always auto-identify in this game. Somehow the author hacked that in with a magical item at some point and left it as-is. Also, most annoyingly the game drowns you in loot but unlike, say, Crawl, anything you leave on the floor will disappear after a while. EXCEPT in ""vaults"", small enclosed areas with treasure guarded by monsters. Good luck identifying what was a vault when coming back to an area you've cleared, though, there are no indications except the room shape. This is an annoying non-feature you'll feel compelled to use, if only to stash stuff until you find the player home (which is also the in-game location of your te4.org, microtransaction-fueled online item Vault), or to make sets of element-resistant armor for various situations.Overall I quite like the game, but it has a lot of room for improvements in the UI and graphics clarity department. Some of the gameplay choices made that set it apart from other roguelikes give a different, but not necessarily better experience. And as mentioned there are small but nasty oversights in the game design, which ends up feeling like a work in progress based on other roguelikes rather than its own thought-out entity. The community also seems to be blind to most of these flaws, and over-protective of any choice the author makes.Try it out to experience the sheer amount of content a true roguelike can offer, but do expect a flawed gem. It might be the best game in the Angband family of roguelikes, having gotten rid of annoying stuff like non-persistent levels while still offering mechanics pretty unique to the family like multiplying creatures.You can go to my Steam profile for more info on classical Roguelikes and suggestion of both free and paid ones.

ToME is superbly written: the storyline, dialogs, lore are all fully fleshed out, and even item descriptions are interesting.ToME's combat is fun: every class is unique and interesting, and each class completely changes the way you play the game. But most important of all, the game is well-balanced. Every class can finish the game, and even if you die you don't feel like it was an impossible situation. Oh, did I mention you are given additional lives at specific levels so you can resurrect yourself if you reeeeeeeaaaallly want? I wish more roguelikes had this option, haha.ToME is a fantastic roguelike and I would recommend it to any fan of the genre.			"

												This game is fantastic if you are into roguelikes and/or old school RPGs. I'm somewhat OCD about saving all consumables in games like this, to the point that I never end up using them, so I LOVE the fact that they don't exist in ToME! Instead you get limited scroll/potion slots (infusions) that function the same, but work of a cooldown and therefore don't make me feel guilty at all for using them. Many parts of the game have reveal similar attention to removing non-fun parts of the genre without resorting to over-simplifying it (or indeed simplifying at all, this is still quite a complex game!), such as the fact that when you begin you still have the similar loot/encumbrance/return-to-town-to-sell cycle, but before too long you get an account-wide unlockable item to instantly sell anything that you pick up.

												YES!  ToME is finally on steam!  If you have never played this game, you can download a copy to try at te4.org.  If you enjoy tactical RPGs and rogue-likes, forget trying it, just go buy it, now.  I have been playing this game since about halfway through its beta, and its truly an amazing game.  Punishingly hard if you are careless, but rewards those who learn to really use the abilities of their character.  And oh, the abilities.  Pick one of the 24 (!) classes (fewer at first--you have to unlock the advanced classes through gameplay; this is a good thing, as you would get slaughtered playing these classes as a new player!) and pick one of the 9 races (again, some require unlocks).  These combine to determine which ability groups you get to put points into.  And points can be scarce--pretty much all character classes can be played 2 or 3 different ways, and some can be done 4 or more different ways, depending upon how you spread your points around.  Add in a mostly-fixed overland map with mostly-procedurally generated dungeons and some tough boss and miniboss fights and an amazingly varied loot system...and you've got a game with frightening levels of replayability.  And for good measure, add a developer (All hail DarkGod!) who listens to feedback, talks with his players on the forums, and seems to spend more time than is physically posible working on the game.  (Maybe he is a Chronomancer?)  What are you waiting for?			"

												Let me get some things out of the way first. No, this isn't a great looking game. If you're looking for smooth animation, amazing visuals, flashy effects, etc., you won't find them here. The music isn't great (I play with it muted and one of the many video game and movie soundtracks I have on itunes playing in the background), and sometimes the ambience is a little annoying (whoever owns the dog that barks nonstop in every city needs to put a muzzle on it or something). Now, for the good things. The gameplay is hard as nails, unforgiving, confusing at times, and all around frustratingly hard, as any good roguelike should be. You have to option to play with more lives, even infinite lives, but I always play on the ""roguelike"" mode, where you only have one life, unless you find more. Knowing what is happening around you at all times is a must in this game, as losing focus of even one enemy can mean death, as I learned the hard way in my most recent death (opened a door, orc necromancer on the other side, managed to escape at first, but on my way back to see if I could get around him, was flanked by his summoned army of skeletons and ghouls). This is a true roguelike, with everything happening in turns as you wander through forests and dungeons, killing everything in your path, picking up loot, buying weapons and armour, and, when you make a mistake, dying with no continues or reloads (at least on roguelike mode). All in all, a really fun game full of challenges and endless replayability. 7.5 / 10			"

												ToME combines the depth of the classical RPG, the friendly user interface of the modern cRPGs like Diablo, and the challenge and replayability of a good roguelike game. Unncessary complexities that might otherwise make a turn-based dungeon crawler tedious are streamlined using functionalities like auto-explore, auto-cast, and auto-sell. At the same time, the game retains all the complexities related character customization and strategy. There are 25 classes, and nearly all of them play very differently from the others. Adding to the strategic depth is the amount of effects the environment can have on a character, from vision blocked by fog to getting crushed by collasping walls to suffocated in water. The dungeon design makes great use of these elements. There is always something new to look forward to when you start a new game, which is a great news, because the game is challenging enough that it's only a matter of time before your first character runs out of lives.

												The first thought you'll have if you aren't familiar with the sub-genre of roguelikes after looking at screenshots/videos is that this game is primitive. What I can say after almost 30 hours put in to the game is that looks can be deceiving.Hidden behind the smoke of a 2D tileset is a shockingly rich, deep, & complex RPG which will constantly test your skills in character development and strategic combat. Like many of its irk this is game which with almost every failure you walk away with new found knowledge which will allow you to (potentially) proceed further upon your next playthrough.I would personally recommend the roguelike difficulty for fans of the sub-genre as this is how i initially delved into and enjoyed the game but if permadeath leaves you squeamish there are alernative game modes which will allow you to learn the game without losing a character after a single death. I expect to spend many more hours learning and enjoying this gem.			"

												TL;DR fantastic ♥♥♥♥ing game by a fantastic ♥♥♥♥ing creator that is worth every ♥♥♥♥ing penny 9/10So I know my time played doesn't reflect this, but back way before the oozemancer came out in this game, there was a period where I didn't have any real internet connectivity for two years, which made playing any type of game impossible and downloading anything the same. One day I had the bright idea to get a roguelike, since I could hotspot my phones data service to download something rather small that would DL quickly. I got a bunch of roguelikes and I like to think it spawned my eternal love for them during those two years. Anyway, ToME was one of those roguelikes, and I SWEAR TO YOU I played it almost every single day for hours on end. It is an INCREDIBLY fun and addicting experience. As an avid roguelike player the graphics mean virtually nothing to me, being used to ASCII and barely perceptible tile sets. I still praise the games artwork and aesthetic design highly though. It is so simply rendered yet beautiful in its approach. The gameplay is amazing, turn based, plenty of abilites, plenty of choices, plenty of different ways to build different characters, plenty of differenct races, plenty of different classes. Plenty of everything. I just recently bought it on steam, along with the dlc, and god DAMN let me ♥♥♥♥ing tell you, the DLC is ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. In a game that already set a high bar on its self, the DLC pushes that bar and in some places even cracks it open. DarkGod has truly made an amazing game that, with time, I imagine most if not all people can get into, given its alternating difficulties and approach to the traditional roguelike challenges. Also, for a roguelike, it is relatively newbie friendly. Easy to play and hard to master ya dig? "

I've played blind, no reading the wiki or anything, and am finding it just as thrilling as any of the classics. When you die, it's fair and you know what you did wrong.

												It's a decent rogue-like that tries to mitigate some of the more annoying aspects of the genre, but still suffers from most the same problems, I mean ""features"",  that all traditional rogue-likes share.  No amount of skill will save you from the luck-based aspects of the game.There are a wide variety of classes and races, many of which are gated behind in-game achievements or events.  Classes and skills are uneven, but the game is constantly being tweaked.  Although it's a single-player game, you can play it while logged into the server and chat with other players in game, see their achievements, and have your achievements automatically announced.  The game's developer DarkGod will also occasionally show up and spawn in-game events, which can be very entertaining.The Steam version qualifies you as a ""Donator"" which unlocks additional content and there are many Workshop add-ons that enhance the game, including one that unlocks all of the gated races and classes.

There are particle effects, and the world changes based on your actions as you follow a story line across continents. There are a ton of things to unlock in the game, and the classes and races play very differently. If you're looking to break in to the more traditional roguelikes, this is a great place to start. Veterans familiar with the genre will also have a lot of fun, but they probably already know about and have played this game before. If you're not sure how you'll like it, there is a free version of the game that has everything except a few ""donor"" features from back before it was on Steam, that aren't necessary.			"

												Rougelike done right.I love Rougelikes. They're swimming in options and strategies and are playable in either small chunks or long sittings, their random nature makes them highly replayable, and they're just generally nifty keen.That said, they also tend to be cruelly unforgiving and really frustrating in the early levels, combined with obtuse interfaces and extremely unhelpful in-game information.Tales of Maj'Eyal takes the good and throws away the bad. It has more starting options than any roguelike I've ever seen, and has a fleshed-out world for you to explore. The interface, while not flawless, gives you all the information you need to make good choices and the early levels get you used to adventuring without killing you because you tried to mount your horse from the east instead of the west, or whatever.I highly, highly, highly recommend this title to anyone who likes any other titles in the genre, or anyone who is at all curious about them.

												There aren't many games that fit the genre of roguelikes on Steam. Dungeons of Dredmor is one of them, Sword of the Stars: The Pit is another one.Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike game in it's truest sense, however, it has some gameplay elements that I personally didn't see occuring that much in other RL games like ADOM.For one, there is pretty much no division between activatable skills and magic spells (something like what Dungeons of Dredmor does). The main difference between them is that different classes use different types of power points (warrior classes use stamina, arcane mages use mana, hate for afflicted classes) that behave differently (mana gets restored with time for magic classes while hate is only increased by hitting hard and taking damage).Another major difference is the absense of magical potions or scrolls. Those are replaced by infustions. A character can store a limited amount of infusions that can be activated any number of times (those can be replaced by new infusions), except that they have a cooldown. This greatly changes the health restoration system other roguelikes and action-RPG games have. Instead of stacking with a huge amount of potions that you drink at will, you have to take note of how much health you have, how much you lose in combat, and how many turns do you have to survive until you can use another infusion.The game itself can be downloaded for free from te4.org. Buying ToME from Steam automatically makes you a donator, which unlocks an additional class for dwarven characters, a somewhat easier exploration mode that allows you to revive your character unlimited amount of times, and an ability to share a limited amount of items with your other characters.

												One of the best RPG/rogue-like games I've ever played.. And I've started playing such games back in 1992, probably with Lords of Chaos, which I've absolutely loved back then.It's deep and rich beyond measures.. Both in story and contents.. Retro graphics gives it even more 'authentic' looks, for a nostalgia's sake.Absolutely love it!And since I've bought it at a discount for less then 2eur It feels like a steal and I feel bad about it. :D			"

												- super fun game, if you hate roguelikes there is an infinite lives mode that basically turns it into an rpg (but it works better as a roguelike, trust me)- addictive a.f., tons of content, a good amount of which is randomized - items, dungeon interiors, enemies, events - all of which adds to the massive replayability of this game- random generation of items and enemies almost never feels unbalanced or unfair, and the dungeons are fantastic- tons of classes and races, with their own skill trees, heaps of stats and whatnot, pretty much rpg quality- easy to learn, hard to master- steam workshop!- unlockable campaigns!- have i mentioned TONS of content?i definitely reccommend buying this game, it's a bargain at full price, and an absolute steal when on sale.what are you waiting for?

												I'm not usually a fan of roguelikes, but ToME has won my heart. ToME is superbly written: the storyline, dialogs, lore are all fully fleshed out, and even item descriptions are interesting.ToME's combat is fun: every class is unique and interesting, and each class completely changes the way you play the game. But most important of all, the game is well-balanced. Every class can finish the game, and even if you die you don't feel like it was an impossible situation. Oh, did I mention you are given additional lives at specific levels so you can resurrect yourself if you reeeeeeeaaaallly want? I wish more roguelikes had this option, haha.ToME is a fantastic roguelike and I would recommend it to any fan of the genre.			"

The graphics and UI may be simple but the lore, quests, and random events are just amazing. I've managed to unlock some races, classes, and talent trees and still have a lot more to go. After 40+ hours on a dwarf bulwark I only managed to get to the far east and ended up dying in a orc den. If you enjoy rougelikes this a must. Can't beat the price for hours of replay value.			"

												As of writing this I have a mere 14 hours. For a game of this magnitude, my limited gametime is a drop in the comparative ocean. However in these 14 hours I have enjoyed countless adventures and hence feel the need to express my feelings towards this game.TOME is a Roguelike in its purest form; that said, it is the formula of dungeons within dungeons and static set pieces that allow its narrative to shine. This is not a game of simply smashing your way through numbers to obtain numbers to increase your numbers this is seen in many RPGS and hack'n'slashes;  there is a rich layer of lore found in conversations as well as scrolls and other objects that add a level of depth and immersion that many other ""have a quick go"" Roguelikes lack somewhat. Make no mistake, this game is a labour of love.Despite the level of depth and complexity, TOME is incredibly easy to pick up and play; most aspects of playing are self explanatory. Items and their inherent effects are explained concisely and character sheets are detailed but not cluttered to the point of being rendered unusuable. The inventory is forgiving and even offers to empty itself for you after every floor of a dungeon, eliminating annoying overencumbered messages. As stated previously I have amassed 14 hours in this game; in this space of time I have had a measly 1 character exceed level 10. This is a difficult game, an attribute which may put players off but attracts me all the more. Sometimes deaths leave you feeling cheated, especially random encounters in the overworld where an enemy caster can easily 2 or 3 shot an unprepared player from afar; this is countered by the player being transported to another plane upon death by a being of great power. The player then has the choice of being teleported to somewhere safer or dropped back into the fight rejuevenated. I would be lying if I said the latter act of manning up didn't cost me more than one decent character.WIth the huge amount of races, talent trees, classes etc character creation is a powerful tool and allows you to progress in many different directions. Want a Cursed Elf? Check. Dwarven Alchemist with his own pet Golem? K. Halfling carrying out his own Hellish agenda of slaughter? Got it. Options such as these, the item system and the procedural world give the game practically unending longevity.If you can say yes to enjoying Roguelikes, turn based battle, thoughtful strategy, massive replayability and a deep fantasy setting, TOME is a worthy purchase for you.

												This game is FOR FREE at thier website.If you want a deep but easy to play roguelike with massive replayability due to the unique classes available with profound customization for each class. Then look no further. I've never played a game where you can erase the existence of an enemy through temporal powers, become a dragon wielding a massive two handed sword with various dragon-breathes, murder people in their sleep (literally), and even create a small undead army at your disposal. This game has been carefully crafted in various ways, for one the grind that's in some games is gone in this game, where shops restock only by your progress into the main campain and you later get a item that seperates what you find from your invintory until you decide to put it in your invintory, then, there's the fact that enemies you face have various tactics. For example, a corruptor can conjure bone sheild that negates all damage for 3 attacks! So if you never invested in a way to deal multiple hits with one attack, you'll have a more difficult time! Then the UI and interface is fully costimizable, you can even auto cast spells, such as buffs and take them off your UI!There are various items that have unique prefix-suffixs stats and effects attached to them, much like diablo or torchlight for example. Many powerful items are guarentied to drop from a boss, (aka a yellow artifact item) and if the item doesn't suite your need, you can store it away for the next character you make to use! If you don't even want to use that item, then you can convert into not just gold, but into energy for a special building you acuire. The progession of this game is really solid and at times depend on your race, as some races level up more slowly, but are inately stonger then others. There are plenty of random events and quests that you can undertake, yet they aren't completely random to the point of unfairness.The skills and abilities you can accuire are amazing and unique! You can create a gravity mage, or a invincible sword and board user that utilizes deadly counterattacks, or even a summoner where you can sacrifice creatures for various effects or contorl creatures to make one powerful creature! Then you have player races with unique abilities as well, for example a dwarf can eventually phase through walls, and a ghoul that can basically throw up on the ground that damages enemies and heals you! Last you have prodigies that are power and unique feats you acuire later on in the game, for example you can have a effect where an attack will kill you, but you'll save yourself from death, while slowly losing life to the point where if you don't heal you'll actually die!The main story is quite interesting and there's a ton of lore that you'll find and is quite deep. Some of this lore can help you find secrets through-out the world and clear up some of the strangest things you'll encounter... There are various difficulties available, so you can have a more casual experience by not losing your hero after he dies, or a more hardcore one where you have one life to live with stronger enemies! There are also various other adventures you can have, without downloading anything extra, for example you can enter into a arena if you just want some good old action, or if you want to have the old experience where it's just you and a dungeon, then you can enter into the infinite dungeon and never look back!In fact, I never looked back after playing this game, and never regreted it. There are plenty of games that are not worth your money or time, and this not one of them due to the quality of the mechanics and diversity of character crafting.			"

Auto-explore takes the tediousness out of roguelikes and there is always action. Great mechanic that replaces potions and scrolls. Buy the game here and gain access to a vault to twink other characters, a mode with infinite lives, some custom tiles for you character, and more. There is a small DLC available also.Extremely worth it if you like roguelikes. Worth it if you're new to roguelikes.... worth it if you hate roguelikes!			"

												I played this game a few years ago and when I saw it pop up on steam, I had to get it. It successfully mixes roguelike gameplay with old style CRPG gameplay. There are tons of unique items all with there own descriptions and graphics. Combat is turnbased and the skill/magic system actually works kind of like World of Warcraft. Things are on a cooldown system and combat is very stragetic. The one down side to this game is it takes a while to learn. When you start out, you only have 3 or 4 classes you can use. As you progress through the game, more classes will unlock when you complete certain quests or achievements. I would recommend this game for any fans of RPGS or roguelikes.			"

												NOTE: This review has been modified since posting. It was originally posted in January 2015 as ‘negative’, and is from March 2015 onwards rated as ‘positive.’ In addition, the content has been altered to reflect recent changes to the game.First of all, know that this is not a ‘rogue-lite’. I have yet to see the final level, and there are others on the forums who have played for hundreds of hours and have yet to win the game. For the TL;DR people: The game is amazing, but completing it on normal difficulty will take hundreds of hours because the learning curve is steep, and end-game balance depends on creating the most powerful build you can – theory crafting is a must, and if you don’t, the game will become unwinnable 30 hours before you realize it. For the rest of us, read on.ToME has 26 classes at the time of this writing, all of which feel and play very differently. Like most RPGs, skill points are gained upon leveling and can be used for both active and passive effects. The skills for each class are unique and allow players to develop their own playstyles, though generally each class has its own style of combat and a playstyle that rewards sticking to their class-specific strengths. Summoners draw hordes of creatures to overwhelm opponents, archmages channel elements to great effect over an area, and rogues set traps and use stealth to outmaneuver or outwit opponents. There are even more creative classes in here, like a time warden (or time mage) that specializes in temporal effects and paradoxes.The world has tons of surprises and interesting levels/areas to explore, acceptable story and interaction (for an old-school roguelike) and though nothing ever changes, the vast variety of mechanics assured that the game did not get old for me after 100 hours of gameplay, and likely will not for another 100 hours.But Tales of Maj’Eyal does have its problems. The first and perhaps least bothersome is a learning curve that feels more like a cliff than a slope.The tutorial explains a little of the game's mechanics, but understanding is better gained by blundering through the world and slowly learning what each of the many confusing formulas and statistics mean, and how important they are to the core gameplay. It takes dedication to keep coming back when mountains of unknown skills and abilities assail you from every side, and through trial-and-error, learn to slowly overcome that mountain. Perseverance does pay off – I actually enjoyed the game very much once I crossed the barrier between hopeless bungler and still-hopeless-but-educated noob. The larger problem is that in order to win the game, the player’s character must be designed for perfection – built to optimal capacity with a full understanding of the many talents, stat formulas, status effects and saving throws present in the game engine. It’s not enough just to go with the most damage, or discover the best damage reduction, or center your build around strategic options – you must do all of these things, and do them with the dedication of a crazed League of Legends professional gunning for the gold.This is where the game fell apart previously –it can become unwinnable very early on, and new players will never even know. They may even feel overpowered for a while, as they make one-strike KOs against hordes of enemies and pass tens of dungeons without a serious challenge in any of them. Rares, elites, and bosses fall without challenge - then suddenly, a belligerent abomination of a boss-class monstrosity strikes, and they find themselves hopelessly outmatched, their only recourse to grind for levels.So they go to a new dungeon – and it happens again. Another new dungeon – wait, were the normals this hard before? And why can’t I use my spells? My abilities? Where did everyone go? And… how did I get one-shot by THAT? Players be warned: No matter how many lives you have, you can make a mistake in your character build early on and not realize that your character is doomed until late-game, when you have already invested thirty-or-more hours into their development. With permadeath, obviously, you may not live long enough to realize your character build is impossible to win with. But even with unlimited lives, you will eventually reach the point where the bosses are impossible, and no matter how well you fight, how clever your tactics, you have no option but to die – or quit. Before the 1.3.0 update, this meant that you must start the game over again from the beginning.This is why my review changed from negative to positive. While limited and full-permadeath players will still have to deal with the intense frustrations of sub-optimal builds, there is hope for those playing with unlimited lives after the 1.3.0 update: Full talent re-spec is available at all times, so if you’ve created a build that seems sub-optimal to your playstyle or eventually becomes self-defeating, you can easily change your skills to accommodate your newfound knowledge or equipment. Be warned, however, that stat points and category points are still permanent, so consider playing a Cornac (+1 cat points) your first time and keeping some stat points in reserve for future use while you learn the ins and outs of your chosen class.Also, be warned that there is no way to carry multiple save files for your character in this game. The game will save on entering and exiting a dungeon, as well as upon making most major decisions, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions. So to recap: Tales of Maj'Eyal as it is an interesting game that supports a wide variety of skill sets and play styles, though impressive knowledge of the game mechanics that can only be acquired through vigilant study required to develop a successful playstyle. Full talent re-spec alleviates (but not eliminates) the steep learning curve, but if you like RPG roguelikes with unique classes and deep strategy, investing your time in this game will reward you with probably the best roguelike you’ve ever played. Just be prepared to invest heavily.*Full disclosure here - I played the game on 'normal' difficulty for every playthrough. There is an easier difficulty that decreases the monsters' strength/abilities by 30%, but it does not give classes, races or achievements and so it does not appeal to those like me who want to feel they are accomplishing something while playing.

Plenty of class options and with unlocks, more class options than I even know what to do with. More than enough race options. TONS of skills to choose from. Loot galore that even changes how your character looks (I know this is important to some, myself included). You can play traditional roguelike with permadeath, semi-roguelike with limited revives, and adventure mode with as many revives as you want. With the character progression, large world, varied quests, and enemies everywhere, I can't stop playing. This game is easily worth the money.			"

												If you are looking for a good roguelike with a great combination of the following: lots of classes, tactics, skills/talents/spells, items, workable mouse based UI and good tileset, nice story, lots of text to read (optional), then this game is your choice. The game is relatively difficult for beginners, so you'll have to learn the ropes by dying a few times (or few dozen times) before you can advance the story further, unlock more advanced classes, zones, etc. Rather complex gameplay mechanics doesn't help until you figure out how all the statistics work together. The full version is still free to download on the official site, so there is no reason not to try this awesome game.			"

												ToME is pretty addictive: make a character, wander about, unlock secrets (quite a few unlockable races and classes), feel powerful, realize you aren't moments before your death becomes inevitable, and repeat.I only have 20 hours invested, so my opinion is pretty limited. A game like this is usually epic in scale, but I can already tell I will get more than my money's worth out of ToME.I already have memorable experiences like the time I was chasing a rogue down a hallway in a creepy ruins when suddenly the ruins dissapeared, replaced by the Plane of Fear; a vast sprawl of smouldering wastes and demonic hosts. Did I not see a portal? Is this a trick? Can I disbelieve? Sadly, Conan the Berzerker died moments after realizing he was screwed, but it was a Super Cool death and we are amused.			"

This game is hard, brutal and you will die.. but you will enjoy it along the way.   Keeping this short and simple.  If you enjoy roguelike games this is a must buy.			"

												Wow. If you have any love whatsoever for old-school roguelikes, Tales of Maj'Eyal cleans up lots of the muck and interface insanity and delivers one of the most polished, fun and narrative takes on the genre. Unlock wonderfully awesome classes like the chronomancer, and as you accomplish feats in the game, you earn persistant loot, characters, and modes that will be with you every time you roll a new char. Play it on ""roguelike"" difficulty to stick with one life (unless you find a way to cheat death in-game) to get a difficult but fair challenge. Steam workshop is enabled for the game, and there are several community mods and enhancements already available, so you can add scenarios, classes and more should you want. Also, on sale!! <brain explode>			"

												This game has suprised me with its depth of content, the synergies some classes possess are badass, however optimal builds are not handed to you on a giant platter like other RPGs. Your success here depends on how involved you want to get with learning your class and the various status effects in the game.Highly recommend picking this up if your a fan of Roguelikes, or RPGs with some complexity and challenge, not to mention charming graphics :)P.S if you do buy it, for the love of all that is holy get the better escorts addon - it wont disable steam achievements.

												This game has already started to consume my soul and I think it will do so for quite a long time. A lot of complexity there, but not an unmanageable amount, nor an uninteresting type. The game will destroy you, and it will keep you coming back for more, and more, and MORE. Brings to mind a quote from a recent movie, something about living and dying and such...but this is fantasy, not post-apocalypse. Looking at others' playtimes, I see I've barely scratched the surface with a measly 36 hours so far, but already it's managed to enthrall me and challenge me. Still only playing on the starting difficulty, but roguelike mode (so one life only, instead of several) and I have yet to get a character even to level 20. I can't even imagine how thoroughly the higher difficulties will rip me to pieces, but I'm looking forward to it. Even if you don't know if you'll like the game that much, or have never played a roguelike (this one is fairly close to the ""true"" formula, but without the (to me) annoying need to eat or starve to death), it's a very cheap buy. If you think you'll like it at all...go ahead and go for the pack with the expansions to save yourself a few pennies since you'll likely grab the whole thing soon enough. Now that that's out of the way, I guess I'll get back to dying endlessly.			"

The bulwark has enough of defence to withstand onslaught of enemies, but even with that 90% of deaths for my character resulted due to the hasty way of playing. Be sure to have a way to escape critical situations. Also, be aware that there are situations when you will not be able to escape... I managed to reach lvl 34, but after stupid death I am skipping this game for some time. Don't play pure rogue-like mode if you are beginner and do not wish to waste your nerves... ;)			"

												When it comes to lore, Tales of Maj'Eyal is a gem. This dark and twisted universe has to be written by someone with keen observations and deep compassion for human condition. This shows especially clear with the DLC contents. The world view is more original and well-constructed than many games, mangas, movies and novels that I have seen.Gameplay is as solid as other reviewers said. More beginner friendly among the major roguelikes, in my opinion. And it's addictive. For people like me who are not so good at planning one's own character, there are many class guides in the official forum, which is very helpful.There is only one aspect that is not that great, that's its graphic tile. Oh, and music can grow old after long time of play. But... even with those being just so-so, this game still worth every minute and hour of my time for it. (Maybe it would be too good to be true if it has amazing graphics, heh.) Definitely worth the money.			"

												this is the great hidden gem of PC gaming, the best game i have played in years... in a world of pick up and put down mediocrity this is a true classic that can remind each and everyone of us why we love video games. It clearly demonstrates the level of quality and depth that is possible in a game release when a game is given the ongoing development attention it truly deserves.You know that feeling you get when you look at the list of your steam games and feel 'meh, been there done that, what shall i play?' - with TOME in the list you have one title that will always scream 'PLAY ME, THERE IS MORE TO SEE, MORE TO LEARN, MORE TO LOVE'.after over 350 hours with TOME (almost all before the steam release) I still keep going back once i get bored with everything else i try..... it's the game that keeps on giving!

												Rougelike done right.I love Rougelikes. They're swimming in options and strategies and are playable in either small chunks or long sittings, their random nature makes them highly replayable, and they're just generally nifty keen.That said, they also tend to be cruelly unforgiving and really frustrating in the early levels, combined with obtuse interfaces and extremely unhelpful in-game information.Tales of Maj'Eyal takes the good and throws away the bad. It has more starting options than any roguelike I've ever seen, and has a fleshed-out world for you to explore. The interface, while not flawless, gives you all the information you need to make good choices and the early levels get you used to adventuring without killing you because you tried to mount your horse from the east instead of the west, or whatever.I highly, highly, highly recommend this title to anyone who likes any other titles in the genre, or anyone who is at all curious about them.

One of the things I hate about ToME is the absurd amount of achievements. If  you are new to the Rouge-like genre, this or Dredmor is a great starting point. Both are very forgiving and fun.

												There aren't many games that fit the genre of roguelikes on Steam. Dungeons of Dredmor is one of them, Sword of the Stars: The Pit is another one.Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike game in it's truest sense, however, it has some gameplay elements that I personally didn't see occuring that much in other RL games like ADOM.For one, there is pretty much no division between activatable skills and magic spells (something like what Dungeons of Dredmor does). The main difference between them is that different classes use different types of power points (warrior classes use stamina, arcane mages use mana, hate for afflicted classes) that behave differently (mana gets restored with time for magic classes while hate is only increased by hitting hard and taking damage).Another major difference is the absense of magical potions or scrolls. Those are replaced by infustions. A character can store a limited amount of infusions that can be activated any number of times (those can be replaced by new infusions), except that they have a cooldown. This greatly changes the health restoration system other roguelikes and action-RPG games have. Instead of stacking with a huge amount of potions that you drink at will, you have to take note of how much health you have, how much you lose in combat, and how many turns do you have to survive until you can use another infusion.The game itself can be downloaded for free from te4.org. Buying ToME from Steam automatically makes you a donator, which unlocks an additional class for dwarven characters, a somewhat easier exploration mode that allows you to revive your character unlimited amount of times, and an ability to share a limited amount of items with your other characters.

												As of writing this I have a mere 14 hours. For a game of this magnitude, my limited gametime is a drop in the comparative ocean. However in these 14 hours I have enjoyed countless adventures and hence feel the need to express my feelings towards this game.TOME is a Roguelike in its purest form; that said, it is the formula of dungeons within dungeons and static set pieces that allow its narrative to shine. This is not a game of simply smashing your way through numbers to obtain numbers to increase your numbers this is seen in many RPGS and hack'n'slashes;  there is a rich layer of lore found in conversations as well as scrolls and other objects that add a level of depth and immersion that many other ""have a quick go"" Roguelikes lack somewhat. Make no mistake, this game is a labour of love.Despite the level of depth and complexity, TOME is incredibly easy to pick up and play; most aspects of playing are self explanatory. Items and their inherent effects are explained concisely and character sheets are detailed but not cluttered to the point of being rendered unusuable. The inventory is forgiving and even offers to empty itself for you after every floor of a dungeon, eliminating annoying overencumbered messages. As stated previously I have amassed 14 hours in this game; in this space of time I have had a measly 1 character exceed level 10. This is a difficult game, an attribute which may put players off but attracts me all the more. Sometimes deaths leave you feeling cheated, especially random encounters in the overworld where an enemy caster can easily 2 or 3 shot an unprepared player from afar; this is countered by the player being transported to another plane upon death by a being of great power. The player then has the choice of being teleported to somewhere safer or dropped back into the fight rejuevenated. I would be lying if I said the latter act of manning up didn't cost me more than one decent character.WIth the huge amount of races, talent trees, classes etc character creation is a powerful tool and allows you to progress in many different directions. Want a Cursed Elf? Check. Dwarven Alchemist with his own pet Golem? K. Halfling carrying out his own Hellish agenda of slaughter? Got it. Options such as these, the item system and the procedural world give the game practically unending longevity.If you can say yes to enjoying Roguelikes, turn based battle, thoughtful strategy, massive replayability and a deep fantasy setting, TOME is a worthy purchase for you.

Awesome [AW-suh m] adjective1.causing or inducing awe; inspiring an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, or fear:an awesome sight.2.exhibiting or marked by awe; showing reverence, admiration, or fear.3.Slang. very impressive:That new white convertible is totally awesome.4. The most accurate descriptor for Tales of Maj'Eyal--------------------------------When it comes to Steam games, I'm a compulsive shopper. I buy anything and everything that tickles my fancy. About a quarter of my purchases are terrible, horrible mistakes (The Guild II, 7 Days to Die, etc.) that never get more than an hour's playtime before I uninstall them in disgust. I always regret buying those games, but that's the price of window shopping.Then there are the games that are decent for a playthrough, maybe two, before I move on and forget about them. They tend to be solid games (Shadows of Mordor, Two Worlds II, Shadowrun, etc.) but nothing to write home about. They make up a good 65% of my library.The last 10% are absolute masterpieces, that I will never tire of playing. I'm happy to say that ToME fits snugly into this category. I purchased it due to its aggregated review score and its resemblance to Dwarf Fortress, expecting that I'd get a week or two of enjoyment out of it before I got bored and moved on. Well, let me tell you, that is not going to happen.In a nutshell, I'd describe ToME as a streamlined version of Dwarf Fortress adventure mode, with the emphasis shifted from proc-gen content to coherent and enjoyable adventures. Now, I know that some DF purists will be turned off by that description - after all, procedurally-generated worlds and histories are a big part of DF's appeal, aren't they? - but bear with me.Whereas DF uses proc-gen to determine EVERYTHING, from cultures to the landmass to an individual's fascination with cheese[mikaelisaksson.com], ToME uses it sparingly. The world map, quests, and bosses stay relatively constant from playthrough to playthrough (though there are occasionally some small variations in the last category). This has allowed DarkGod (the one-man dev team behind ToME) to build an extremely long, complex, and open-ended plotline that will see players through 50 experience levels - and for the record, if you play roguelike mode, you'll have a hell of a time even breaking 20.Where proc-gen is used, it is used very gracefully. All dungeons randomize their layouts (and to a lesser extent, their themes) for each new playthrough, and gear, with the notable exception of the rare, unique items, is also random. Minibosses, which randomly appear throughout dungeons after the initial quest has been completed, are all named, given a random race (anything from masses of worms to furry little Ewok slave-drivers), and given an arbitrary group of abilities. To put it simply, though the broad strokes of the game are fixed, the details of every run will be distinct and unique.There`s one more aspect of the game that bears mentioning in reference to encouraging multiple playthroughs, and that`s character design. When you first start the game, approximately 75% of the classes, 50% of the races, and 66% of the game modes will be locked. Mind you, that still leaves you with something like 7 races and a dozen classes to choose from. As you complete certain events, various aspects of the game will be unlocked for future playthroughs. There`s nothing more exciting than unlocking a class encouraging an entirely new playstyle after a long, epic campaign.Even within a single class, the room for freedom of choice is incredible. Every class has somewhere between 30-60 skills associated with it, each of which has five levels of expertise. In addition, you receive another 30 or so skills to choose from based on your race. Considering that even in a perfect playthrough, you`re only likely to get 160 skill points or so, you`ll never be wanting for new ideas for character builds. It bears mentioning that on top of all of this, there are ways to learn the skills of other classes too.I'm going to end this review with a quick pro/con list, since those are all the rage on Steam these days.PROS-Nearly infinite replay value-Strong RPG elements-Farscape references. The world needs more Farscape.-Moody, atmospheric music-Incredibly detailed character creator-Moddable-Dedicated community and dev-Lore-a-licious. If you like fictional worlds with a lot of backstory, you'll enjoy your time on Eyal.-Surprisingly complex combat system, even for boring old sword-and-board builds-No shortage of humour, without being a farce-The option to play as a latex-clad Dwarven gimp with a wooden paddleCONS-Most people will count the tile-based graphics as a con, though I find them pleasantly nostalgic-Less complex than DF (pretty sure that applies to every game, though)-The initial dungeons become old rather quickly for roguelike players, despite being randomized each time-The randomized mini-bosses can occasionally feel a little unbalanced (in either direction)-I can't play it 24/7			"

												YES!  ToME is finally on steam!  If you have never played this game, you can download a copy to try at te4.org.  If you enjoy tactical RPGs and rogue-likes, forget trying it, just go buy it, now.  I have been playing this game since about halfway through its beta, and its truly an amazing game.  Punishingly hard if you are careless, but rewards those who learn to really use the abilities of their character.  And oh, the abilities.  Pick one of the 24 (!) classes (fewer at first--you have to unlock the advanced classes through gameplay; this is a good thing, as you would get slaughtered playing these classes as a new player!) and pick one of the 9 races (again, some require unlocks).  These combine to determine which ability groups you get to put points into.  And points can be scarce--pretty much all character classes can be played 2 or 3 different ways, and some can be done 4 or more different ways, depending upon how you spread your points around.  Add in a mostly-fixed overland map with mostly-procedurally generated dungeons and some tough boss and miniboss fights and an amazingly varied loot system...and you've got a game with frightening levels of replayability.  And for good measure, add a developer (All hail DarkGod!) who listens to feedback, talks with his players on the forums, and seems to spend more time than is physically posible working on the game.  (Maybe he is a Chronomancer?)  What are you waiting for?			"

												Let me get some things out of the way first. No, this isn't a great looking game. If you're looking for smooth animation, amazing visuals, flashy effects, etc., you won't find them here. The music isn't great (I play with it muted and one of the many video game and movie soundtracks I have on itunes playing in the background), and sometimes the ambience is a little annoying (whoever owns the dog that barks nonstop in every city needs to put a muzzle on it or something). Now, for the good things. The gameplay is hard as nails, unforgiving, confusing at times, and all around frustratingly hard, as any good roguelike should be. You have to option to play with more lives, even infinite lives, but I always play on the ""roguelike"" mode, where you only have one life, unless you find more. Knowing what is happening around you at all times is a must in this game, as losing focus of even one enemy can mean death, as I learned the hard way in my most recent death (opened a door, orc necromancer on the other side, managed to escape at first, but on my way back to see if I could get around him, was flanked by his summoned army of skeletons and ghouls). This is a true roguelike, with everything happening in turns as you wander through forests and dungeons, killing everything in your path, picking up loot, buying weapons and armour, and, when you make a mistake, dying with no continues or reloads (at least on roguelike mode). All in all, a really fun game full of challenges and endless replayability. 7.5 / 10			"

												I have played this now couple evenings and already can say that this is one of the best rogue style games I have played. It's not perfect, not even near, but it is fun to play and it does many things right that other rogue style games have failed.Pros:- Pure rogue style game with permadeath characters- A lot of items and variables, no two games are same- Many classes, skills, etc.- Things seems to be nicely in balanceCons:- Graphics (but this is normal in rogue style games)- Some UI / text features are not good and there is some small bugsOnce again game is going to be awesome price / entertainment hours ratio, because almost excelent replayability value.

												(In future may write a longer review, but as it is on sale right now, here is my recommendation in short form)Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is extremely good at what it is- a roguelike of the dungeoncrawler RPG type, that can also be played as a more regular RPG with limited or infinite lives. Combat is a fairly quick turn-based system, that requires a decent amount of care as death is quite easy to come by. Items, statistics, and talents are complex yet fairly easy to parce, with items especially having a wide variety of possible enchantments and special effects, along with many unique items. There are a wide variety of character classes and races, some of fairly traditional RPG stripe and some highly unique, most of which unlock with play.Both as a roguelike and as an RPG, ToME has extremely high-quality lore and worldbuilding- every unique item has some kind of description or history, many of the bosses and areas have reasons for existing, and Maj'Eyal, the world, itself has an interesting history and substantially long questline (which is also quite difficult- while playing without infinite lives, I have never come close to beating it)The game can be played with permadeath, limited lives, or infinite lives, and with the regular Maj'Eyal questline, or in the Infinite Dungeon (which works as you would expect), or in Arena combat.All in all, an extremely good game with a variety of ways to play depending on what you are looking for.

If you get this and you're remotely interested from the trailer, you will enjoy yourself for a LONG time (oh gosh just all the possible classes!)They've also got a global chat (the game is Single Player) where you can ask for tips.My two complaints are that anything other than melee is hard to adjust to, and that you could enter an area that will quickly kill you.

There is a LOT of that.-Those who excel in tactical combat and character-building.My Favorite Pros:-Plenty of options for characters.-There is an overworld map.-The Summoner class is actually balanced.-That feeling of anticipation that comes with every single character level.-Fantastic music.My Annoyed-At Cons:-Those freaking Bone Golems...-Those freaking adventuring parties...-That freaking sealed area with Green Dragons...-That freaking sandworm dungeon...-THAT FREAKING SANDWORM DUNGEON...!-Why is the sandworm dungeon so necessary?!-The only time I've won thus far is with a Halfling Berserker.

												If avernum is 2oldskool4you, this is a good introduction into CRPGs. While it's not the deepest, or most expansive, or the most immersive out there, it is the easiest to learn, and you can be thrown into the deep end and learn pretty quickly. While ther's a very limited scope of character customisation aesthetically, and no custom classes (Avernum 6 spoiled me on the character customisation front, I guess), This game does have an array of features and is well worth the price, especially on sale.PROS:-randomly generated dungeons-a good sense of humour, when the situation calls for it. An example is some of the journals you find whilst crawling the first dungeon. ""why did I let that crazy wizard experiment on me? Oh right, I was broke.""-a bunch of modes and campaigns for CRPG noobs and vets to enjoy alike-lets you play chaotic evil, which I often do.-the dev is awesome. Too often I come across devs who look at negative reviews and just ignore everything, calling the reviewer ignorant and accusing him of not playing the game, and refusing to fix the problems. Looking at you, 8bitmmo guy.-constantly updated.CONS:-It's not Avernum 6, therefore it is inferior. ALL BOW BEFORE AVERNUM 6! HAIL SPIDERWEB! HAIL SPI- *cough* Right.-AI is a little ditzy.

												When it comes to lore, Tales of Maj'Eyal is a gem. This dark and twisted universe has to be written by someone with keen observations and deep compassion for human condition. This shows especially clear with the DLC contents. The world view is more original and well-constructed than many games, mangas, movies and novels that I have seen.Gameplay is as solid as other reviewers said. More beginner friendly among the major roguelikes, in my opinion. And it's addictive. For people like me who are not so good at planning one's own character, there are many class guides in the official forum, which is very helpful.There is only one aspect that is not that great, that's its graphic tile. Oh, and music can grow old after long time of play. But... even with those being just so-so, this game still worth every minute and hour of my time for it. (Maybe it would be too good to be true if it has amazing graphics, heh.) Definitely worth the money.			"

BEST combat/character build system EVERYou can never get tired of the various builds TOME4 can offer even if you have limited interest in build types. Watch your hero grow to be the ultimate awesomeness is a great pleasure for me.Combat in this game is the best I've seen in all games, the more skilled you are, the more fun you'll get(in higher difficulties of course). In many games, when you achieve ""mastery"" everything just becomes a cakewalk. This is never the case in TOME4. You get cocky and you die. TOME4 is so focus on combat that it DOES NOT have many traditional RPG/roguelike elements such as hunger, tireness, thirst, consumables... You can actually feel that every mechanism in it is born for battle(except some aesthetics options). This is good for TOME4 because adding these will only undermine what TOME4 already have.(Unrelated: Non-combat focused roguelikes can be really good as well, have you tried elona? If you ignore the male chauvinism filled in that game, it is magnificent.)Constantly updatingIt has an ancient history(In the field of computer games) and it is still updating. Major, huge updates including new classes/races/skills/graphics/mechanisms. Online features(can be disabled)It offers in-game chat with other players. if you visit the main website you can also check your many characters' details. You can discard them all if you don't want them and that will not affect your gameplay in any way, the only problem is that you won't be able to exchange items stored online between your characters.Friendly to beginnersIt offers a good tutorial and most of the stuff stay locked until you progress. You won't be overwhelmed by information if you are not prepared. Active player communityThe forum and wiki are quite useful and TOME4 have tons of mods developed by the players. You can get them easily in the workshops.Darkgod is SmartThe developer of this game, Darkgod, is extremely smart. The game mechanisms are so well developed that there's no grinding/taking advantage of AI/boredem in late game. Expect a difficult challenge in early game and expect it to be more difficult in late game as well. Darkgod is KindYou can play this game for free if you download it from the official website. If you pay for the game and DLC you can get many customizable aesthetic options/exchange items between characters/new classes etc. The price is ridiculously cheap as well. Darkgod also accepts additional donations in the game's official website.Watch how many hours other reviewers and I spent on this game. It's insane.			"

												ToME is pretty addictive: make a character, wander about, unlock secrets (quite a few unlockable races and classes), feel powerful, realize you aren't moments before your death becomes inevitable, and repeat.I only have 20 hours invested, so my opinion is pretty limited. A game like this is usually epic in scale, but I can already tell I will get more than my money's worth out of ToME.I already have memorable experiences like the time I was chasing a rogue down a hallway in a creepy ruins when suddenly the ruins dissapeared, replaced by the Plane of Fear; a vast sprawl of smouldering wastes and demonic hosts. Did I not see a portal? Is this a trick? Can I disbelieve? Sadly, Conan the Berzerker died moments after realizing he was screwed, but it was a Super Cool death and we are amused.			"

												Wow. If you have any love whatsoever for old-school roguelikes, Tales of Maj'Eyal cleans up lots of the muck and interface insanity and delivers one of the most polished, fun and narrative takes on the genre. Unlock wonderfully awesome classes like the chronomancer, and as you accomplish feats in the game, you earn persistant loot, characters, and modes that will be with you every time you roll a new char. Play it on ""roguelike"" difficulty to stick with one life (unless you find a way to cheat death in-game) to get a difficult but fair challenge. Steam workshop is enabled for the game, and there are several community mods and enhancements already available, so you can add scenarios, classes and more should you want.

												If you are looking for a good roguelike with a great combination of the following: lots of classes, tactics, skills/talents/spells, items, workable mouse based UI and good tileset, nice story, lots of text to read (optional), then this game is your choice. The game is relatively difficult for beginners, so you'll have to learn the ropes by dying a few times (or few dozen times) before you can advance the story further, unlock more advanced classes, zones, etc. Rather complex gameplay mechanics doesn't help until you figure out how all the statistics work together. The full version is still free to download on the official site, so there is no reason not to try this awesome game.			"

												NOTE: This review has been modified since posting. It was originally posted in January 2015 as ‘negative’, and is from March 2015 onwards rated as ‘positive.’ In addition, the content has been altered to reflect recent changes to the game.First of all, know that this is not a ‘rogue-lite’. I have yet to see the final level, and there are others on the forums who have played for hundreds of hours and have yet to win the game. For the TL;DR people: The game is amazing, but completing it on normal difficulty will take hundreds of hours because the learning curve is steep, and end-game balance depends on creating the most powerful build you can – theory crafting is a must, and if you don’t, the game will become unwinnable 30 hours before you realize it. For the rest of us, read on.ToME has 26 classes at the time of this writing, all of which feel and play very differently. Like most RPGs, skill points are gained upon leveling and can be used for both active and passive effects. The skills for each class are unique and allow players to develop their own playstyles, though generally each class has its own style of combat and a playstyle that rewards sticking to their class-specific strengths. Summoners draw hordes of creatures to overwhelm opponents, archmages channel elements to great effect over an area, and rogues set traps and use stealth to outmaneuver or outwit opponents. There are even more creative classes in here, like a time warden (or time mage) that specializes in temporal effects and paradoxes.The world has tons of surprises and interesting levels/areas to explore, acceptable story and interaction (for an old-school roguelike) and though nothing ever changes, the vast variety of mechanics assured that the game did not get old for me after 100 hours of gameplay, and likely will not for another 100 hours.But Tales of Maj’Eyal does have its problems. The first and perhaps least bothersome is a learning curve that feels more like a cliff than a slope.The tutorial explains a little of the game's mechanics, but understanding is better gained by blundering through the world and slowly learning what each of the many confusing formulas and statistics mean, and how important they are to the core gameplay. It takes dedication to keep coming back when mountains of unknown skills and abilities assail you from every side, and through trial-and-error, learn to slowly overcome that mountain. Perseverance does pay off – I actually enjoyed the game very much once I crossed the barrier between hopeless bungler and still-hopeless-but-educated noob. The larger problem is that in order to win the game, the player’s character must be designed for perfection – built to optimal capacity with a full understanding of the many talents, stat formulas, status effects and saving throws present in the game engine. It’s not enough just to go with the most damage, or discover the best damage reduction, or center your build around strategic options – you must do all of these things, and do them with the dedication of a crazed League of Legends professional gunning for the gold.This is where the game fell apart previously –it can become unwinnable very early on, and new players will never even know. They may even feel overpowered for a while, as they make one-strike KOs against hordes of enemies and pass tens of dungeons without a serious challenge in any of them. Rares, elites, and bosses fall without challenge - then suddenly, a belligerent abomination of a boss-class monstrosity strikes, and they find themselves hopelessly outmatched, their only recourse to grind for levels.So they go to a new dungeon – and it happens again. Another new dungeon – wait, were the normals this hard before? And why can’t I use my spells? My abilities? Where did everyone go? And… how did I get one-shot by THAT? Players be warned: No matter how many lives you have, you can make a mistake in your character build early on and not realize that your character is doomed until late-game, when you have already invested thirty-or-more hours into their development. With permadeath, obviously, you may not live long enough to realize your character build is impossible to win with. But even with unlimited lives, you will eventually reach the point where the bosses are impossible, and no matter how well you fight, how clever your tactics, you have no option but to die – or quit. Before the 1.3.0 update, this meant that you must start the game over again from the beginning.This is why my review changed from negative to positive. While limited and full-permadeath players will still have to deal with the intense frustrations of sub-optimal builds, there is hope for those playing with unlimited lives after the 1.3.0 update: Full talent re-spec is available at all times, so if you’ve created a build that seems sub-optimal to your playstyle or eventually becomes self-defeating, you can easily change your skills to accommodate your newfound knowledge or equipment. Be warned, however, that stat points and category points are still permanent, so consider playing a Cornac (+1 cat points) your first time and keeping some stat points in reserve for future use while you learn the ins and outs of your chosen class.Also, be warned that there is no way to carry multiple save files for your character in this game. The game will save on entering and exiting a dungeon, as well as upon making most major decisions, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions. So to recap: Tales of Maj'Eyal as it is an interesting game that supports a wide variety of skill sets and play styles, though impressive knowledge of the game mechanics that can only be acquired through vigilant study required to develop a successful playstyle. Full talent re-spec alleviates (but not eliminates) the steep learning curve, but if you like RPG roguelikes with unique classes and deep strategy, investing your time in this game will reward you with probably the best roguelike you’ve ever played. Just be prepared to invest heavily.*Full disclosure here - I played the game on 'normal' difficulty for every playthrough. There is an easier difficulty that decreases the monsters' strength/abilities by 30%, but it does not give classes, races or achievements and so it does not appeal to those like me who want to feel they are accomplishing something while playing.

												This game is FOR FREE at thier website.If you want a deep but easy to play roguelike with massive replayability due to the unique classes available with profound customization for each class. Then look no further. I've never played a game where you can erase the existence of an enemy through temporal powers, become a dragon wielding a massive two handed sword with various dragon-breathes, murder people in their sleep (literally), and even create a small undead army at your disposal. This game has been carefully crafted in various ways, for one the grind that's in some games is gone in this game, where shops restock only by your progress into the main campain and you later get a item that seperates what you find from your invintory until you decide to put it in your invintory, then, there's the fact that enemies you face have various tactics. For example, a corruptor can conjure bone sheild that negates all damage for 3 attacks! So if you never invested in a way to deal multiple hits with one attack, you'll have a more difficult time! Then the UI and interface is fully costimizable, you can even auto cast spells, such as buffs and take them off your UI!There are various items that have unique prefix-suffixs stats and effects attached to them, much like diablo or torchlight for example. Many powerful items are guarentied to drop from a boss, (aka a yellow artifact item) and if the item doesn't suite your need, you can store it away for the next character you make to use! If you don't even want to use that item, then you can convert into not just gold, but into energy for a special building you acuire. The progession of this game is really solid and at times depend on your race, as some races level up more slowly, but are inately stonger then others. There are plenty of random events and quests that you can undertake, yet they aren't completely random to the point of unfairness.The skills and abilities you can accuire are amazing and unique! You can create a gravity mage, or a invincible sword and board user that utilizes deadly counterattacks, or even a summoner where you can sacrifice creatures for various effects or contorl creatures to make one powerful creature! Then you have player races with unique abilities as well, for example a dwarf can eventually phase through walls, and a ghoul that can basically throw up on the ground that damages enemies and heals you! Last you have prodigies that are power and unique feats you acuire later on in the game, for example you can have a effect where an attack will kill you, but you'll save yourself from death, while slowly losing life to the point where if you don't heal you'll actually die!The main story is quite interesting and there's a ton of lore that you'll find and is quite deep. Some of this lore can help you find secrets through-out the world and clear up some of the strangest things you'll encounter... There are various difficulties available, so you can have a more casual experience by not losing your hero after he dies, or a more hardcore one where you have one life to live with stronger enemies! There are also various other adventures you can have, without downloading anything extra, for example you can enter into a arena if you just want some good old action, or if you want to have the old experience where it's just you and a dungeon, then you can enter into the infinite dungeon and never look back!In fact, I never looked back after playing this game, and never regreted it. There are plenty of games that are not worth your money or time, and this not one of them due to the quality of the mechanics and diversity of character crafting.			"

												One of the best turn-based rogue-like RPG's ever made. Don't let the graphics fool you, the gameplay is incredibly deep with a large amount of races, classes, enemies, quests, skills, items and free choice. ToME is all about gameplay and less about graphics, kind of like Dwarf Fortress. Even the dialogue and lore (there is a lot to read if you so desire) is well-written and the world is interesting to explore and uncover its mysteries.There are a lot of stats but they are all straightforward and easy to find. You will rarely be confused about what a certain stat does, and you don't even need to know about everything. You can dive in straight for some proper min-maxing or just play and learn as you go. I recommend to start with an easier, straightforward class like the Bulwark. Then later you can try out the more difficult to master classes with interesting names like the Oozemancer, Stone Warden or Paradox Mage. There is enormous build variety. You can unlock the more specialist classes, skill trees and even races just by playing the game. By spending some extra points you can even use skill trees that are not available to your class from the start. Battles are very engaging and for the more difficult fights you will have to think about your next turn. With plenty of skills and items available you can really think about your strategy. Or maybe you don't want to fight at all, there is no shame in running to come back later and finish that boss when you're stronger. The game appears to be very well balanced, which is a great achievement if you consider the enormous build variety.The game is large, there are a lot of places to explore, the only problem i have with the world is that every new character has to pass through the same locations which can get a little boring if you die a lot (which you will). Luckily all maps are randomly generated and there are several game modes (infinite lives, multiple lives, 1 live), so you don't have to go all hardcore.ToME was made for pure fun. You don't like mindlessly exploring empty maps for a single piece of loot or to find the exit? Just press the auto-explore button and skip all that nonsense. Your character will automatically explore and pick up everything until it sees an enemy. There is very little grinding just to get XP, almost everything you do is part of a quest or will lead to one. Are you overleveled? The game will ask you if you want to skip the whole area! If you manage to get far enough in to the game you will get your own flying fortress with a small shared stash that you can expand by donating more. There's also the (in-game!) Steam Workshop that contains a great many mods to make your life in ToME even more enjoyable. And an in-game chat with plenty of helpful and experienced players.Do you like Steam Achievements? This game has 1395 of them!Totally recommended to any true fans of rogue-likes and skill-based RPG's. Pay for the game or donate to support the developers or get the game for free on their website!

												This has become my favourite roguelike. Deep tactical combat built around activated talents and cooldowns makes this completely different from the traditional ""walk towards things until they die"" formula. It feels like a turn based action rpg rather than Nethack.ToME has several gamemodes. Story mode has lots and lots of written original lore but it may get repetitive after several runs. You will die and have to start over many times and it is ♥♥♥♥ hard unless you know what you're doing. And that experience comes from dying enough times to learn how not to. Playing story mode is required to unlock other gamemodes and more than the few initial character classes and races.In Arena you fight a set number of waves of increasingly difficult enemies, and if you win, your player character becomes the new final boss of the arena. It is not balanced for all character classes, some are significantly weaker because there's rarely time to rest your cooldowns, and most of the time there are lots of enemies on the screen.Infinite Dungeon is just what it says. The challenge in it comes from the randomness. It is somewhat level scaled, but whereas in story mode you know what kind of monsters and bosses are in each area, here you can't really prepare for anything. It is the old school roguelike experience but the modern game mechanics still make it quite original.Conclusion: Thinking man's roguelike with unique gameplay and diverse content. Tons of mods available. It is also completely free at http://te4.org/ but buying it on Steam gets you some donator benefits.			"

												Highly recommend this to ANY roguelike fan, or someone looking for a grand adventure they can fully customize. Tales of Maj'Eyal is a game brimming with content, depth, and hard work. In the character creation screen alone you will see how many races and classes are offered to you from the start, let alone unlockable through various quests and gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, it's everything you could ask for in a roguelike. Plays super easily, and one quick tutorial will get you ready to take on the world. There's so much to discover and try out, you will get an enormous value out of this game. Definitely give it a shot!			"

												One of the best Roguelike's ever made.I have played it off and on for over a year and it just keeps getting better with every version.  I am very happy that it made it onto Steam because it gives a lot of people who do not keep up with the Roguelike's a chance to find and enjoy it.If you like turn-based rpg's  ,Roguelike's ,or just plan good games you need to give this one a try.  It is easy to play and you can learn the basics in an hour but you will still be learning new things after hundreds of hours.			"

												My favourite roguelike so far on Steam.good:Action and abilities are fun, good gameplay variation w/ unlocks and classes.  Plot is nice as are the quests and special dungeons.  Enemy variation is a plus.less good:UI is a little rough (particularly around the inventory) and it's a bit easy to get jacked by ranged enemies.  More randomization around the world and dungeons/dungeon assortment would go a long way on replays.  I wish item quality and progression power curve was a little more angbandy, it's a little flat.

Posted: June 9, 2014
												My first impressions of Tales of Maj'Eyal...First, I think it is important to point out that although Tales of Maj'Eyal is featured as a roguelike game with perma-death, it can also be played with limited lives as well as unlimited lives. So, even if you do die you can still advance through the entire game with all of your hard earned stats and gear! That's really like 3 versions of the game!  So far, it seems like a very solid and polished game. It's obvious that a lot of love went into the making of this game and it shows through the professionalism of the product. Everything is explained in great detail through text boxes.It should also be noted that not all of the character races and classes are unlocked at the beginning of the game, and must be unlocked through playing the game. There are sub races and classes branching off of the main choices also.When you die in Exploration mode, you can teleport back to the battle before you died, but must fight that same battle from the beginning again, or teleport a little further back out of harms way.  You also get the choice to retire your character roguelike style, so be extra careful when making one of these choices after dying!  That is the only penalty for death that I have seen so far, but this is only based on my experience playing on Easier difficulty and Exploration mode (unlimited lives).Pros:+3 game modes; Roguelike (perma-death), Adventure (limited lives) & Exploration (unlimited lives).+5 difficulty settings.  Easier, Normal, Nightmare & 2 more locked settings.+Generous level cap of 50.+Extensive character customization with skill trees and infusions.+No consumables.  You don't have to worry about food or water.+Ammo is unlimited, but you will have to reload your quiver once in a while.+Fast movement and strategic turn-based gameplay.+Save feature. You can have multiple saves for multiple characters!+Many towns, dungeons and creepy places to explore, and conquer!+Can use both keyboard & mouse.+Streamlined to play on many computer systems and configurations.+Many races & character classes with sub races and classes to choose from.+Randomly generated tactical battles and dungeons/maps. Both good & bad!+Easy modding support with Steam Workshop integration.+User friendly GUI with great explanations of everything!+Great little tutorial provided.+Cool sound track and sound FX.+Smart AI.  Both character and monster AI.  Monsters will hunt you down!+Options, options and more options!  The game is completely customizable!Cons:-Death comes too easy due to free roam exploration and randomly generated tactical battles & dungeons/maps.  You can encounter areas without warning, where you will die instantly.  Beware of dungeons you cannot exit because you activated a battle with monsters 30+ levels above yours!-Randomly generated tactical battles and dungeons/maps. As I said, both good & bad!-The game gets a little boring after a while.-Once you beat Arena mode, your character is useless.-You cannot play the regular game with Arena characters.-The price is a little high for an indy game.  I usually get these kinds of games for $1 on my iPad.You can use keyboard, mouse or a combo of the both. There are many key commands which most can be accessed with the mouse too. The keyboard commands are logical choices and easy to learn, but can be remapped to your liking. You'll be using the mouse most of the time though. I have not seen any In App Purchase (IAP) selections or buttons, so I assume most of the content so far is in the game.Tales of Maj'Eyal seems like a nice little game that is very stable and polished with love for the genre. It's old school fun with a twist of 21st century ideas. Being able to set up the game with limited and unlimited lives was a very nice touch and gives the game some options to appeal to many other gamers! You even get your own set of achievements and recognition for playing with limited and unlimited lives! I'm happy with my purchase! :D Happy dungeon crawling! :)My system specs are:iMac, i5 Quad-Core 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon 6970M 1GB Video RAM, 4GB System RAM, running OS X version 10.6.8.I rate this game 4 stars out of 5.

												An Excellent game for people that want an intro to rougelikes. It is pleasing to the eye (by rougelike standards anyway) and is very easy to learn how to play and has muliple difficulty settings but the game is deep and challenging enough to keep you occupied for dozens and dozens of hours . Its alot of fun to figure out things like the correct dungeon order for certain classes or unlocking new races/classes by exploring more and more of the game each playthrough. The game is free online if you really don't wanna fork over the five bucks here but you do get the donator's perks for buying the steam version that include things like a special class, an exploration mode and custom tiles, nothing essential to the game at all but hey, it's there.

												When this game hits v. 1.3.0, I'm getting banned from an item because I did hilarious shenanigans with it.It has an on-hit proc to destroy projectiles and zap nearby guys for some lightning damage. Only that in doing so, it causes a LUA scripting error. And when that happens, certain steps in a turn get skipped. Like putting skills on cooldown.Naturally, I exploited this and told the developer that coded it, ""Hey, I'm doing completely stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥with your weapon.""When 1.3.0 hits, if I equip it, it'll try to murder me dead. This weapon is Shantiz the Stormblade, and it's a dagger. 44 Dex to equip, gives +20 Dex.Also you can be a murdertrain, infect guys with turboebola, and CHOKESLAM DRAGONS.			"

												The first thought you'll have if you aren't familiar with the sub-genre of roguelikes after looking at screenshots/videos is that this game is primitive. What I can say after almost 30 hours put in to the game is that looks can be deceiving.Hidden behind the smoke of a 2D tileset is a shockingly rich, deep, & complex RPG which will constantly test your skills in character development and strategic combat. Like many of its irk this is game which with almost every failure you walk away with new found knowledge which will allow you to (potentially) proceed further upon your next playthrough.I would personally recommend the roguelike difficulty for fans of the sub-genre as this is how i initially delved into and enjoyed the game but if permadeath leaves you squeamish there are alernative game modes which will allow you to learn the game without losing a character after a single death. I expect to spend many more hours learning and enjoying this gem.			"

												TL;DR fantastic ♥♥♥♥ing game by a fantastic ♥♥♥♥ing creator that is worth every ♥♥♥♥ing penny 9/10So I know my time played doesn't reflect this, but back way before the oozemancer came out in this game, there was a period where I didn't have any real internet connectivity for two years, which made playing any type of game impossible and downloading anything the same. One day I had the bright idea to get a roguelike, since I could hotspot my phones data service to download something rather small that would DL quickly. I got a bunch of roguelikes and I like to think it spawned my eternal love for them during those two years. Anyway, ToME was one of those roguelikes, and I SWEAR TO YOU I played it almost every single day for hours on end. It is an INCREDIBLY fun and addicting experience. As an avid roguelike player the graphics mean virtually nothing to me, being used to ASCII and barely perceptible tile sets. I still praise the games artwork and aesthetic design highly though. It is so simply rendered yet beautiful in its approach. The gameplay is amazing, turn based, plenty of abilites, plenty of choices, plenty of different ways to build different characters, plenty of differenct races, plenty of different classes. Plenty of everything. I just recently bought it on steam, along with the dlc, and god DAMN let me ♥♥♥♥ing tell you, the DLC is ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. In a game that already set a high bar on its self, the DLC pushes that bar and in some places even cracks it open. DarkGod has truly made an amazing game that, with time, I imagine most if not all people can get into, given its alternating difficulties and approach to the traditional roguelike challenges. Also, for a roguelike, it is relatively newbie friendly. Easy to play and hard to master ya dig? "

												I give this game a 4/5.Pros:- Wide variety of classes that play dramatically differently.- Classes are fairly well-balanced, although some are considerably more complex and require more careful play than others.- Lots of loot, and items can have a wide variety of buffs or even debuffs.- Mod support.- The game is long.- Decent default tileset, and many more available in the workshop.- Transparent numbers for the most part, so careful planning is possible.Cons:- Death is frequent and often feels random.  Because of the wide variety of abilities, status effects, and damage types, it is very difficult to build a character that can effectively defend against being one-shotted.  It's not fun to see a boss and instantly die.  There are also far too many ways to be stunlocked.- There's no way to grind experience or equipment.  There is a fixed amount in the world and you get what you get.  Resistances are key and largely only come from equipment.  Gold is very limited, so despite the plethora of shops it is very rare to be able to afford anything useful.- Some of the class mechanics are very complex and not well explained.  Or explained at all.  I'm looking at you, chronomancer.- Some classes are very equipment-dependent, which means if you don't get the right artifact drops you cannot play effectively.- The game is easy for the first couple hours and then it suddenly spikes towards the end of the second tier of dungeons.  Every game starts with the same run through the same 6-10 dungeons before the ""real"" game starts.			"

												As roguelikes go, this is one of the best. It has as much depth as the likes of NetHack/Dungeon Crawl, while being far more accessible. You've probably seen plenty of games like this: some of them grab you and some don't. This one will reward you for all the time you put into it. I've played blind, no reading the wiki or anything, and am finding it just as thrilling as any of the classics. When you die, it's fair and you know what you did wrong. You can turn off permadeath while learning the game, as well. In short: it's a very solid dungeon crawler, check it out.			"

												WARNING: NOT FOR THE WEAK Tales of Maj'Eyal is an epic fantasy roguelike in a Tolkienesque universe in which your mighty heroes will die in great heaping mounds, alone and unremembered, and there's nothing you can do about it. While there IS a mode which allows infinite respawns, it rather defeats the point of the game, which is twofold: 1.) Death is permanant. 2.) Every world is randomly generated and different. (Within certain parameters, obviously. The Wood Elf's always gonna start in a randomly generated forest area and the Dwarf's always going to start in a randomly generated cave. This is because even the people who made this game realize that it would be a bit absurd to face down a level 1068 demon from hell when you start out in your underpants with a weapon stolen from the toy shop.) Poor Jimmy the Dwarf Warrior never even made it out of the starter cave. But Mahariel, the Elf Archer chick I've  been running lately has consistently lived over an hour. This might sound a bit frustrating, but it also lends a fresh air of discovery everytime you play. And in that sense, it's probably the standard that all Fantasy RPGs should be held to. Not just indie ten dollar or less titles, but the big A-Listers like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, and the like. (If things feel mundane in a FANTASY game, something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.) With minimalist graphics and a shoestring budget, Tales of Maj'Eyal manages to remain engrossing and compelling throughout with evocative music and little smatterings of lore, alongside gameplay that rejects the handholding most games these days embrace. ToME does not hold your hand. It punches you in the testicles. That said, no game is perfect, so here is my criticism. One of the general problems with the old school/minimalist vibe they're going for is that your character never really has their place in the world defined. You're just sort of there, playing around in this big sandbox with no real connections to it. You never have an uncle or a sister or a friend or whatever that serves as an anchor. The closest thing you get to party members are ineffective, personality-devoid asshats you have to escort to exit zones in repetitive sidequests you'll never pass up because the rewards are too damned good to turn down. But interpersonal interaction? Forget it. NPCs are just like ""Hey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, go do this for the XP and bonuses so you can do slightly harder stuff for the next ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,"" and you're like ""sure"" and that's that. You just run around going on quests, killing stuff and getting loot because that's how pimps roll, I guess. Of course, one or two half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥excuses aside, Skyrim isn't much better in this regard, so I suppose it might not be fair to blame the presentation for this. The thing is, with all this lore and stuff they dangle in front of your nose, explaining the truth behind the Orc genocide or the politics behind the human-halfling alliance, or the hatreds between the two elven peoples, the fact that none of it really has to do with your interactions with other people, who serve only as quest givers or static decoration, really gives one the off-putting feeling that you have shown up to a party five minutes after it ended. Ultimately, the main character of the game is the world of Maj'Eyal itself and your interaction with it, and it is a compelling world which will be new everytime you play it. The immersive vibe you get from exploring a new bit of dark wilderness or dungeon with moody music playing in the background is excellent, and the lore documents encompass sad, hilarious, and terrifying without skipping a beat. It is a shame that the epic immersion Maj'Eyal offers is strained by the two-dimensional clods who inhabit it, but hey, it's a Roguelike, what were you expecting, War and Peace? Just get the damned game.			"

												ToME is an excellent roguelike lite. As in, you shouldn't really count of ToME in the same group as Nethack, ADoM, or even Crawl. ToME is, first of all, much more focused on combat. There is no hunger, very little inventory management, very few ways (none?) to lose your character outside of actual combat.(for clarity: bump attack means an automatic attack that happens as your character attempts to enter a space occupied by a hostile character. Yeah, autoattack)The combat doesn't much remind the bump/cast combat of most roguelikes. It's more like WoW, turn based. And I don't mean this in a bad way. Most turns you have to use skills even as a melee character, as opposed to bump attacking like you probably would in most actual roguelikes. There are a lot of skills, considering the game currently has at least 25 classes, many of which have multiple unique skill lines (each containing 4 skills). Now, let's get this out of the way: the game is free, unless you really want to buy it on Steam, or otherwise. The game is also easily worth the Steam price, and much more besides. A single playthrough can be easily over 10 hours, and the game has a lot of replayability. It is fun.Downsides? Having played this a lot (though not nearly as much as some), I'd say: the normal difficulty is way too easy, with some exceptions. The higher difficulties aren't viable on some classes (the higher you go, the less viable melee is, in general), and getting oneshot becomes increasingly an issue. There are ways to deal with getting oneshot, but they usually involve tedious gameplay. Like, using certain spells to check what's behind every corner, always. I personally *hate* playing like that, so currently I can either play on too easy difficulties, or play on challenging difficulties with random oneshotting mobs. Mind, you can easily get several playthroughs (like, 30h+) worth playtime before encountering this issue.Erm.. so yeah. Good game, worth getting.			"

												So if you have not played this game then you are a fool. The game is a roguelike. it's easy to get into, taking a lot of the confusion and annoyance of having to learn new keys out of the mix. The story line is immense and there is a ton of ingame lore. There's a decent amount of randomized equipment and amount of specilaized awesome equipment. This game eclipsed my addiction to Civ 5 for quite a while and still commands my attention after I finally beat it.			"

												I grew up on Nethack, matured into Crawl: Stone Soup, and now obsess over ToME. If you are a fan of classic rogue-likes or if you are new to the genre, ToME is a great experience. There are many layers of complexity in content, lore and character progressing that makes for many hours of play.Just as a side note: the graphics aren't pretty. Try not to let the graphics detract from the excellent depth of the game. Also, the game is fairly difficult. If you are new to rogue-likes, play in 'exploration' mode until you unlock some of the races and classes and get a better feel for the game.			"

												If you've ever been a fan of a Roguelike game, you know just how addicting the genre can be.  Tales of Maj'Eyal strips away the usual esoteric layer over the traditionally deep turn based combat with easy to access tool tips, combined with rudimentary graphics which are a nice attention grabbing upgrade to the ASCII characters of yore.  There's enough visual fidelity and modernizing to be engaging, but still plenty left up to the imagination.  The game has a large pool of classes and races to choose from, with drastically differing play styles.  My only real complaint about ToME is replaying through the same story isn't as fresh an experience as a traditional, more randomly generated Roguelike.  The upside to that is the strong lore and story make for a more engaging experience the first time through.			"

												One of my very first forays into the inescapable depths that is the roguelike genre. I've put hundreds of hours into this game (not on the Steam version) and still pop back in every once in a while when I want to experience a true roguelike game. I would highly recommend this as a gateway drug into the realm of roguelikes for any newcomers to the genre. It's got a very easy to use GUI (no need for all the crazy keyboard commands), a talent tree which many gamers are used to seeing when developing characters, and a tileset, for those that can't read ASCII. While I haven't played it as much, some of the common complaints are that the early game feels a bit grindy. The lack of a hunger clock sort of encourages visiting all early level dungeons, even if you can stomp over them. Some ""unfair"" deaths by some combinations of powers that some rares/uniques have. This can be especially frustrating, but TOME's adventure mode gives several lives (Gasp, the horror!), which does help to at least mitigate that frustration a bit.The game is fairly lengthy, and the replayability of the game is amazing. Many of the classes have a very distinct feel to them, which makes it fun to experiment with various character builds. The most frustrating thing about this game is that it takes a while to build up a character the way you want it, and then a harsh combination of a boss can easily wipe it out if you are like me and refuse to skip places and come back to it later.Overall, a great game to try out and play. If you're on the fence about ""buying/donating"" to this game. You can play this game for free on te4.org. You will get access to nearly everything that a donator would so you really won't be missing much, but if you enjoy it, I recommend you toss some $$ towards the DarkGod since he's done an amazing thing with this game.

												I give this game a 4/5.Pros:- Wide variety of classes that play dramatically differently.- Classes are fairly well-balanced, although some are considerably more complex and require more careful play than others.- Lots of loot, and items can have a wide variety of buffs or even debuffs.- Mod support.- The game is long.- Decent default tileset, and many more available in the workshop.- Transparent numbers for the most part, so careful planning is possible.Cons:- Death is frequent and often feels random.  Because of the wide variety of abilities, status effects, and damage types, it is very difficult to build a character that can effectively defend against being one-shotted.  It's not fun to see a boss and instantly die.  There are also far too many ways to be stunlocked.- There's no way to grind experience or equipment.  There is a fixed amount in the world and you get what you get.  Resistances are key and largely only come from equipment.  Gold is very limited, so despite the plethora of shops it is very rare to be able to afford anything useful.- Some of the class mechanics are very complex and not well explained.  Or explained at all.  I'm looking at you, chronomancer.- Some classes are very equipment-dependent, which means if you don't get the right artifact drops you cannot play effectively.- The game is easy for the first couple hours and then it suddenly spikes towards the end of the second tier of dungeons.  Every game starts with the same run through the same 6-10 dungeons before the ""real"" game starts.			"

												If avernum is 2oldskool4you, this is a good introduction into CRPGs. While it's not the deepest, or most expansive, or the most immersive out there, it is the easiest to learn, and you can be thrown into the deep end and learn pretty quickly. While ther's a very limited scope of character customisation aesthetically, and no custom classes (Avernum 6 spoiled me on the character customisation front, I guess), This game does have an array of features and is well worth the price, especially on sale.PROS:-randomly generated dungeons-a good sense of humour, when the situation calls for it. An example is some of the journals you find whilst crawling the first dungeon. ""why did I let that crazy wizard experiment on me? Oh right, I was broke.""-a bunch of modes and campaigns for CRPG noobs and vets to enjoy alike-lets you play chaotic evil, which I often do.-the dev is awesome. Too often I come across devs who look at negative reviews and just ignore everything, calling the reviewer ignorant and accusing him of not playing the game, and refusing to fix the problems. Looking at you, 8bitmmo guy.-constantly updated.CONS:-It's not Avernum 6, therefore it is inferior. ALL BOW BEFORE AVERNUM 6! HAIL SPIDERWEB! HAIL SPI- *cough* Right.-AI is a little ditzy.

												The first thought you'll have if you aren't familiar with the sub-genre of roguelikes after looking at screenshots/videos is that this game is primitive. What I can say after almost 30 hours put in to the game is that looks can be deceiving.Hidden behind the smoke of a 2D tileset is a shockingly rich, deep, & complex RPG which will constantly test your skills in character development and strategic combat. Like many of its irk this is game which with almost every failure you walk away with new found knowledge which will allow you to (potentially) proceed further upon your next playthrough.I would personally recommend the roguelike difficulty for fans of the sub-genre as this is how i initially delved into and enjoyed the game but if permadeath leaves you squeamish there are alernative game modes which will allow you to learn the game without losing a character after a single death. I expect to spend many more hours learning and enjoying this gem.			"

Content can be modified by players and adds to replayiblity. What I enjoyed the most about the game is the combat text.

Posted: April 27, 2015
												I've been playing roguelikes since the late 80s, early 90s, starting with Nethack when I was a young girl.  Later, I discovered ADOM, and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.  It took me a while to warm up to Angband and its variants, cause I was used to ""Hacklikes"", which are fundamentally pretty different games.  I'll be using the terminology ""*Bands"" to refer to the latter, the * meaning put whatever you like there.  Games like Angband, Zangband, Cthangband, Animeband, Hengband, etc.  I'm going to do some comparing, because in order to understand why you should play ToME, some history and context is useful.  You've gotta know what you're getting into, here.Comparing Hacklikes to *Bands is a lot like comparing X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter to X3.  Roguelikes aren't generally ""fast-paced"" (with the exception of some wonderful titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer), but when I say that Hacklikes are faster than *Bands, what I mean is the planned length of a successful game is much shorter.  You can beat Nethack in a determined afternoon if you know exactly what you're doing and get a bit lucky.  *Bands are designed to be played for hundreds of hours before completion.  This distinction wasn't apparent to me until I got a bit older and explored the *Bands more thoroughly, because at first I just found them boring and samey.Tales of Maj'Eyal (and how do you even say that out loud?) is, historically and in spirit, a *Band game.  It used to be called Tales of Middle Earth, and was based on a game called UMoria, which is in turn an Angband variant.  For ToME 4, they discarded the Tolkein and created all new lore from scratch, and changed a LOT of features.  This is largely the ToME that you'll be playing if you buy this game.So, what characterizes a *Band, and ToME in particular?  What kind of games are these?Whereas in Hacklikes, you are pressed forward by limited resources and infinitely spawning monsters, in a *Band, the game flow is based around infinite resources.  Take food, for example.  In most if not all Hacklikes, your character becomes hungry over time at a pretty good clip, and you have to find food or you will die.  So, much of the early game becomes about knowing which monster corpses are safe or even beneficial to eat, as well as locating non-perishable foods such as rations (which are in turn quite heavy in bulk, necessitating inventory management of very limited space).In *Bands, you also get hungry, but the rate at which you do is very very slow compared to Hacklikes.  Monsters generally don't leave corpses, and you can always buy rations in town, which you can always get back to easily with a scroll of recall.  Hacklikes generally have no such spells or scrolls (if they have towns at all), and shop inventory is very limited and, depending on the game, usually does not restock.Hunger is, however, a mechanic that later on becomes almost a non-issue in winning Hacklike runs.  There exist items that can slow digestion or produce infinite or near-infinite food in most all Hacklikes, such that the hunger mechanic mostly kills off early characters or very unlucky midrange characters.  And in *Bands, I'm a relative noob, but I've still never lost a character due to hunger.So, why even have a hunger mechanic, then?  The developer of ToME probably asked himself that very question, and did away with hunger for ToME 4.  This is only one of many smoothed out, streamlined mechanics that fully embrace the *Band / infinite resources heritage of ToME and make it more accessible for newcomers.  There are also no unidentified items, for instance, and the game offers you an ""adventure"" mode where you have more than one life, or an ""exploration"" mode that's unlocked and visible right from the start, with infinite lives.  Of course, I'm bullheaded and old-school, so I only play on ""roguelike"" mode, where dead is dead.  But you might find you have wiggle room in other modes to learn more per character.You're still going to die a lot, especially if you play anything other than a Bulwark.  But the classes are very interesting, and the lore is very well-written and interesting.  You gradually unlock more birth options (for new characters) as you play and find certain sidequests, but nothing else is persistent between runs, unlike many of the rogue-lites and mystery dungeon type games that have been popular lately.  This is a very hardcore, old-school roguelike of the *Band lineage.  You'll be playing any particular character for a very long time, growing attached to them and overcoming many challenges before dying horribly 100 hours from now because you got stupid for a second.  And then you're going to start over, because it's insanely fun.Alchemists in particular are probably my favorite class so far: You get a golem that you can equip and that has laser eyes and charges into battle to take hits for you while you throw grenades from the back lines.  I like to name mine after my boyfriend.  Summoners are also a lot of fun: you can throw wolves at peoples' faces, and summon dragons and minotaurs to kill things while your turtle tanks for you.  But I really recommend playing Bulwark or maybe Berserker to start: they're much less flimsy (Bulwarks in particular, they're the sword/mace/axe and board characters) and will let you learn more and accomplish more birth unlocks per run.Healing is accomplished through cooldown abilities rather than limited items, and you have a lot of options for talent specs to build even a particular class in very different ways.  Different races have very useful and interesting bonuses and penalties and racial skills, and as a woman I appreciate that there's no in-game difference between playing female or male.  Roguelikes aren't the games to do gender political commentary, lol.So, if you get ToME (and you absolutely should), you're basically getting what games like the Elder Scrolls series aspire in their most ambitious moments to be: a long-term playfield where you can go on adventures and explore dungeons and become strong from nothing.  Most modern crpgs try to achieve what roguelikes, and *Bands in particular, already had nailed a long time ago, and if you play this version of ToME, you're getting the best of any game I've seen so far in this already-amazing and venerable genre.One last thing: this game includes a chat feature that lets you talk to other players as you play on a few different channels, and I highly recommend you use it and get to know some of the other people who know a lot about the game.  Your mileage may vary of course, but in my experience the community for this game is both dedicated and very welcoming and helpful.  The chat is a fantastic feature.			"

TE4.org.  Its missing a few features the steam client has but totally worth the price of free.  The game is made off of an open source game engine and is being pretty much devloped by a single dude. If you like it, like I did, then picking up the steam version is a great way to donate to the continued development of the game and get some extra in game swag.

												A fun, challenging roguelike crawl through a brutal, unforgiving world. Exploration mode for the more reckless of us (infinite lives) who want to see the story. Only downside is there seems to be a memory leak or something. It is still fun, just needs a little bit of optimization.			"

												The best rouge-like I've played. The mechanics are great and the number of strategies, damage types, load outs make it fun many many times over. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup was my favorite until I played ToME, now I'm constantly on this game when I free time.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes rouge-likes or RPGs, or even just a game with deep mechanics.Thanks DarkGod!

												I have been playing ToME for a while now, and I am still enjoying it.The game is turn based roguelike about creating a character from a race/class combination, and slowly growing stronger by killing monsters and finding random items while trying to not die.The world, the general theme of the dungeons and the main quests are always the same, but each dungeon floor is unique for the playthrough.The game is not always fair, but at some level I really enjoy randomly ending up in bad situations, like what to do when you're all of a sudden being cut off from the stairs to the previous level, poisoned, low on hp, and surrounded by monsters; with practise and a bit of thought and soime luck a lot of bad situations are possible to come out of alive, and I find it hugely rewarding when I manage to pull off an unlikely escape to come back and clean up after recovering.The game contains a large number of secrets that allow more character creation options when they are discovered, which I feel adds a lot of depth to the game; I'm still trying to find them all.Leveling up allows some skill points to be allocated to any group of skills you know (Some groups may be added to the basic set of skilkls from your race / class combination), and stat points to be distributed among a fairly standardized set of stats. I feel that it is a bit unfortunate that the skills typically scale off a particular stat, for example berserkers have skills that scale off of strength and vitality, so investing in other stats is hard to justify.The game is still under active development, and patches to address balance issues or add content or fix bugs are released regularly.This can be a bit of a mixed blessing, as sometimes monsters that used to be easy yesterday all of a sudden can get you killed because they were buffed in a patch.The game seems to have some minor annoying bugs that still haven't been fixexd, and a few major ones seem to bite people occationally. As of the latest patch the game seems to have trouble saving when playing online at times, but I am sure this will be fixed soon. As I understand it the entire game was created by a single developer, and given how many things there are that interact I think that he has done a very good job.The graphics could be prettier, and the engine could probably be optimized a lot, but if you can stand dying a lot in the beginning while learning how everything works the game is really fun and rewarding with a high skill ceiling for players who enjoy exploring and creating powerful characters who survive against all odds, and if you haven't picked up this (slightly unpolished) gem already I strongly suggest you do.

												This game is fantastic. Every single class I have tried has been incredibly interesting, and there are 27 classes in the game right now. The graphics are simple, yes, but they are very easy on the eyes. My only complaint is that some information is unintuitive and hidden, for example switching control between controllable characters takes a turn. That doesn't really make sense, and the game doesnt indicate it anywhere, you just have to figure these things out on your own. There are many little moments like that.  But nitpicking aside, this is one of the most interesting RPG's I have ever played.			"

												TOME is basically a fantasy based roguelike with crazy deep character customization and story that you just wouldn’t expect from its simplistic interface and graphics.So let me first start off by telling you where to download this for free. TE4.org.  Its missing a few features the steam client has but totally worth the price of free.  The game is made off of an open source game engine and is being pretty much devloped by a single dude. If you like it, like I did, then picking up the steam version is a great way to donate to the continued development of the game and get some extra in game swag.  I’ve been very surprised by this little gem and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys games like ftl, risk of rain and rpgs.			"

												A very fun and very accessible rogue-like, loaded with content and numerous class/race/item unlockables you earn just by playing.  Has a large number of races and classes that all feel different from one another, different difficulty settings (how many lives you get) and unlockable bonus campaigns (such as an endless dungeon and arena).  The game is free on their site, but buying or donating gets you a few extra perks, such as transferring items between characters, a dwarf-only class (Stone Warden) and an infinite lives mode.The game doesn't hide anything from the player, so you'll know exactly what each stat point and skill does, what every piece of equipment will do for you, and exactly how strong each enemy is.  It's not gonna stop a wayward lightning bolt from ruining your run, though!I already put dozens of hours into it before buying it, and have already put 2 dozen in since.  Wholeheartedly recommended!			"

												This game has slowly become quite addictive.. Deceptively simple, yet wonderfully complex as you have many character types, skills and weapon combinations to choose from. I was very happy rampaging about as a skeleton once unlocked :-)Complete and utter death add caution back into your tactics, think and retreat, and a little more excitement, but you can also choose to play in different modes to suit you, unlimited lives, limited lives - or the true - one life.A wonderful little understatement of a game I fully recommend - be warned, you lose a fair few hours / days / weeks with this one.

Controls are good and remappable, workshop support is neat, the music lends itself well to establish mood, and the difficulty is there. It's a roguelike in the classic sense, as in being like the original Rogue. Lots of unlockable content including classes, races, and even gameplay modes. Active bug and error reporting in game is a great sign. Zero crashes or game breaking bugs, just some minor stuff. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a game of this genre. One of the few good ones on steam, if there are more.			"

												To me, this is the ultimate roguelike. My first roguelike was Castle of the Winds back in the mid-90s. I've since played other traditional RLs such as NetHack, as well as ""roguelike-inspired"" games such as the Diablo series and Path of Exile. ToME4 combines the best of both worlds in a package that is user-friendly, engaging, and extremely entertaining.The problem with traditional roguelikes, by modern standards, is the poor user interface and sometimes opaque game mechanics. Their replay potential is very high, but the barrier to entry is equally high. ToME4 keeps the high replay factor while providing excellent GUI. It has full support for both mouse and keyboard controls. Information that would be relegated to wikis for other roguelikes is instead readily available to the player, which gives a very streamlined playing experience. You can jump right into ToME4 and start playing without having to spend hours reading. That's not to say the game is easy, however; I've put well over 100 hours into the game and I'm still nowhere close to finishing the primary campaign.On the other side, this game takes some of the best features of action RPGs (e.g., Diablo) while avoiding the pitfalls of that genre. There's a strong element of character progression and customization, through complex gear as well as skills, and many race/class options. However, ToME4 avoids the grinding/farming gameplay that plagues most ARPGs because enemies in ToME4 don't respawn. You progress through the world and clear the various areas, but you can't stay in an easy section and kill endless monsters for loot and experience.I originally downloaded this game for free from the ToME4 website, but after playing for a few days I bought it on Steam to support the developer (and get some extra unlocks in game!). This game is a phenomenal value and a must-try for any gamer. If you're not sure if you want to spend the money on the Steam verison, try it for free by downloading from te4.org .			"

												First of all, let's get it out of the way: Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike (in the traditional sense). That genre is notoriously difficult to approach due to its depth, random elements, and permadeath. However, ToME is much more approachable than its brethren. In terms of Permadeath, there are three options that you, the player, may select when creating your character: Exploration (you have infinite lives, and you can still unlock races/classes/other) , Adventure (you have finite/limited lives. By progressing, you earn more lives.), and Roguelike (you are the character, death is final... though, there are means of cheating death that you may discover).   In terms of random elements,  you will rarely straight up lose/win because of your luck (though it definitely seems that way at the start). Within ToME, randomness can affect your loot, the difficulty of champion monsters (enhanced versions of a regular monster), enemy placement within a dungeon, and types of obstacles (i.e. dungeon variations, random events, etc.). Despite all of that, ToME gives you a few powerful tools to compensate.    The ability to inspect ANY unit that you can see, as a free action. This allows you to see what abilities an enemy has, their stats, defenses, and much more. This means that if some enemy is new to you, or a champion variant is using some strange new ability, you can inspect it and adapt accordingly.  Dungeon Consistency. Certain dungeons in the game will always be present in any playthrough. They will always fall within the same power level, and (almost) always have the same type of enemies. So, if you know you are approaching a certain area that is hypothetically filled with insane amounts of electric damage, you will be able to plan accordingly. The other aspect of this is that certain character excel in different dungeons, and are terrible in others. As you become more familiar with the game, you learn to play around your characters strengths/weaknesses, which leads me to the next point...  The ability to RUN and ESCAPE. Some encounters are straight up unfair/impossible. Perhaps you got surrounded by a buch of weak enemies and are being stunned repeatedly. Or, you are stuck in a corner with a big, spooky minotaur. Unless you are tanky as all hell, and can heal for days, it is actually perfectly acceptable to just run/teleport to safety.In terms of depth, or wealth of mechanics, ToME is easily one of the best (if not the best). While other roguelikes may give you a bunch of ways to interact with a single item or the environment. ToME's depth comes from:   Vast amount of start options (race/class). It is impossible to emphasize how DIFFERENTLY some of the classes play from one another. You do not just unlock new classes and races, but new racial groups and types of classes outside of just the  typical warrior, rogue, wizard archetypes.  Unique Items (items can have class abilities attached to them, or even unique abilities).  The lore (if you care about that sorta thing).  Environments/dungeons. Past a certain point in the game, you feel like you are starting a whole different game (for the main campaign). It definitely caught me off-guard.  Boss encounters. With minimal spoilers, you definitely want to inspect some of these guys/gals/things.Honestly, this is easily my favorite game in my library. I don't play it too often now, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself.			"

It clearly demonstrates the level of quality and depth that is possible in a game release when a game is given the ongoing development attention it truly deserves.You know that feeling you get when you look at the list of your steam games and feel 'meh, been there done that, what shall i play?' - with TOME in the list you have one title that will always scream 'PLAY ME, THERE IS MORE TO SEE, MORE TO LEARN, MORE TO LOVE'.after over 350 hours with TOME (almost all before the steam release) I still keep going back once i get bored with everything else i try..... it's the game that keeps on giving!

												Played this game for 60 or so hours around 3 years ago, it was free to download but an option to donate. I actually really dug it so when it went to steam decided it was time to support the creator by purchasing it. It's worth the full price, but if you're cheap like me you can wait for a sale as it seems to go on sale semi-frequently.Pros-          Deep class options, a min/maxers dream.          High replayability due to not all classes being available from the outset (must be unlocked) as well as many different ways to approach situations.          Story is decent enough, if you're into reading and lore this game has it.          It has graphics, even spells have decent graphics, no ASCII here!          Perma death, it's a roguelike folks!Cons-          Perma death, it's a roguelike folks..          The graphics arent great, if you're used to cutting edge stuff, this might be a shock to your system.          The amount of options for classes can be overwhelming, and there are limited classes available from the outset.Summary-          If you like roguelikes, the Avernum series, or the old unforgiving RPG's of yesteryear, this one is a must have.

												So much replayability its insane.Tons of classes and races to choose from each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. No two classes feel the same. You have your basic classes like Archer, Archmage, Rogue and Berserker and then there's also really weird classes like the Possesor, the Temporal Warden (control time and space) and a class that uses the power of dreams and thoughts. (and many more, I think there's like a total of 30 classes)In one playthrough you won't be able to see everything a class has to offer, so that gives you reason to even try out a class you already played as again but as a different race.There's a basic campaign mode, an arena mode where you just fight enemies and an endless dungeon mode.You can choose whether you want to play it as a rogue-like, have a limited number of lives or have infinite lives.Something I really like is this game lacks consumables, you just gain healing or mana regaining abilities that have a cool down.Then there's dozens of different mods that add even more content to the game. There is so much freedom in this game its ridiculous.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is one of the best roguelikes I've played. It's accessible, modern, and fun. I've actually bought the game 3 times and have even donated to the developer. What makes it stand out is that a lot of top-down 2D roguelikes are influenced or based on ASCII graphics and keyboard only controls and even with addons cannot get past those humble origins. Tales of Maj'Eyal was developed with graphics from the start and fully supports sensible mouse controls supplimented by reasonable keyboard input.			"

												Let me settle something first that sometimes confuses people looking at the tags on Steam. The first tag is ""Rogue-like"", the second is ""RPG"". This is not a traditional ""learn as you go on a mighty quest"" kind of RPG game, it is a rougue-like. You will learn as you die. You have one life (or multiple on Adventure mode) and will thus have to be tactical and smart with the decisions you make.Now, getting with the review, this is a fantastic game that i highly recommend you try if you are a ROGUE-LIKE fan, not a traditional RPG fan. The game doesn't bring miscellaneous lose conditions to discourage and hinder you like other games in the genre (Damn hunger meters). This is not to say that the game is a cakewalk, rather it is far from it. The game expects you to die and to learn from it, take the time to analyze why you took 30% of your health in one shot, check the game log, inspect enemy monsters before you rush in so you can take them on effectively.The game has excellent replayability, due to the diversity of races and classes as well as random dungeons and alternate layouts. Different races and classes also start in different areas and have slightly differing dungeons available, allowing for even more content that you may have not known was there in the first place. This, along with random loot that can have a wide variety of effects leads to the player enjoying exploring the world and tackling rare monsters.Even more content can be unlocked with the Arena and Infinite modes that can be obtained once you get to a certain point in the Campaign (both are fairly early). Arena mode lets you pick a race and class and lets you test your skill against a 30 or 60 wave gauntlet. Infinite places you in an infinite dungeon where you explore and try to survive for as long as you can.Overall, this game is a fun challenge for anyone who has the patience to see when to run and when to fight as well as the ability to say ""I just spent 10 hours on a character and he/she died. That's fine, let's see where we went wrong and try again."" And for those who read the negative reviews and saw ""i ran into a wall of lvl 20 guys at lvl 1, game is unbalaced"", they ran into a event (which you can avoid and come back to later) where you open a locked door and fight high leveled enemies for better loot. It's a high risk high reward area, and if you don't think you can do it, don't.TLDR: If you have the patience to realise you made a mistake and analyze it, and you enjoy rougue-likes, this is a good game. You will die, a lot. This is part of the game. It is wonderful and has replayability like no other. Also, don't open sealed doors unless you are ready to fight high level guys who will kill you if you don't know what you're doing.			"

												i hated darksouls. it wasn't hard, it was grinding to me. this is hard, this is the game i wanted darksouls to be.i don't know what it is about this game that i love. it seems extremely basic on the surface but underneath it there's a depth that seems to go on forever. i have about 34 hours in this game and i've only gotten to level 15 before i end up dying. the deaths are frustrating but at the same time, i learn from it, i get better and to me that's the heart of a roguelike. a lot of different classes with different playstyles that you can unlock. the unlocking itself becomes a game, more of a push to get further in the game, to go a little more slowly when you encounter a new enemy and read up on their abilities. the one thing i don't like is that it's not really apparent on where to go. you have to do the dungeons in a specific order and that's not really apparent in the game. luckily many people out there have written an order they like and one that seems to work well, so i would check that out first.the game just feels like a community. people submit lore to be added to it and the creator will surprise people with random events if you happen to be on at the right time. for instance, there was an event the other day where he gave everyone on a flute that turned their character skin into a pirate, with pirate noises. just little touches like that from the creator shows the kind of care and admiration he has for this. so yea. i love this game, i reccomend the hell out of it if you like a challenge and don't mind dying a lot. it seems simple on the surface but it's so much more. so much			"

												This game is fantastic.  For the price you can't beat what the game offers.  Tons of races and classes.  Incredibly indepth RPG elements.  Fantastic difficulty that punishes you for your mistakes and is otherwise balanced.  A nice soundtrack with immersive audio like birds chirping or dogs barking in the distance.  The game is also entirely randomized so no playthrough is the same as the one previous, except for story events.Tales of Maj'Eyal is singleplayer but with a built in chat so you can talk to other people who are currently playing.For the price no one should write this gem off.For anyone wanting to see this game in action you can catch my stream at Twitch.tv/Kojinto :)			"

												TOME is a fun, but somewhat complex game. The best part about this game is the huge variety of unlockable races and classes, each with a unique set of talents. The worst part about this game is the fact that there are a huge variety of unlockable races and classes, each with a unique set of talents.If you've enjoyed playing more old-school (and wiki-reliant) roguelikes like Nethack, TOME is a great game. It has a huge amount of depth, and a wide variety of viable playstyles at different difficulty levels. The ability to unlock things as you explore the world makes the game feel more rewarding on death than some of the older games in the genre, but even when you first start playing there's enough going on to keep you occupied. There are also some convenient QOL features like autoexplore and everything being on cooldowns instead of consumables means you can focus on combat rather than carefully hoarding mana/stamina/equilibrium/health pots.If you're looking for a casual roguelite with a quick iteration time, look elsewhere. 9/10			"

												The only Rogue that holds a candle -in the sanguine night- to Tales of Maj'Eyal is NetHack.  With an open world, seemingly endless class / character combinations, & Workshop, it is perhaps the greatest most ambitious Rogue to date.  The iconic graphics and simplified controls (over Nethack's cornicopia of keyboard commands) the game is more accessible to the new player, while at the same time a very difficult game to learn.  To make a game of this scale and magnitutde in 3D graphics would be cumbersome and HUGE -putting games like Skyrim to shame- with a much wider breadth and scope found within the imagination.  The level of customization is more akin to D&D than any new RPGs, but far more insane, like 3.5 rules on acid.  For love of gods & the sake of humanity, buy this game & play it.			"

												This is a good game, actually suprisingly good. Its rogue-like, with super deep RPG elements. The loot is (i think) randomly generated, seems like everything is. But it ends up making for some awesome stuff... Like im a warrior and found a necklace of strength, a trinket that makes a damage absorbing shield, ect. Also there is like 20 others things on each of those items... Its crazy. At first youre like, uhh, this is too much. Then when you understand what it means (also hold CONTROL to compare to your equipped) you are so glad for the extreme depth. I havent played a whole bunch, but I really love hoping on for a few hours and progressing through this game. Im on my 3rd character and each time you learn so much you didnt know. Also... The best part I got the game off HumbleBundle for $1. Value to entertainment is EXTREMELY high on this game.			"

												Absolutely smashing.Some short info of the game to sway you to buy it:>Roguelike with various difficulties and modi, like Nightmare Adventure, Medium Roguelike (permadeath - read: Man mode)>Fixed overworld map with fixed and random dungeon locations>Buttload of interesting items & stat modifiers>>Fixed artifacts, random artifact generation, standard stuff with 1 or more ""ego"" *fixes affecting various stats>Progression with permanent (and cloud saved) unlocks>>Unlockable skill trees (like extra schools of magic), races and classes to add diversity>>>Some classes have special resource bars and can utilize items in unique ways, diversity is huge in this game>>>Class design (in most cases) is simply amazing, where the game gives you the feeling that your chosen class is simply OP, until you die to your own incompetence and want to start over again just to make it better this time. A lot of the classes have very unique design as well, offering synergies, combinations of effects and other things I have yet to see in other roguelikes.>Amazing web services, just check out a random profile: http://te4.org/users/kalmazaton>Fixed zone bosses and possible bosses, as well as randomized mini-bosses>A lot of room for challenge and exploration in general>Dev involvement. Our sexy overlord drops by in chat frequently, so do some people helping out with the programming.

												By far my favorite roguelike.Why?It doesn't obfuscate things to the point it demands a wiki, I mean, a wiki still helps, but you don't need it to avoid instadeath to a counterintuitive puzzle.It promotes tactical combat, by removing single use items and using a skill hotkey system, every class has access to a reasonable toolkit for addressing each combat situation without risking making the game unwinable by burning through resources that will be mandatory to win later conflicts.It provides for many, diverse, playstyles which unlock at a reasonable rate as player's demonstrate greater and greater competence. Though some of the gating is a little more finicky/grindy than it needs to be, in general its a great way to dole out extra content as you familiarize yourself with old content.			"

												This is a good game, actually suprisingly good. Its rogue-like, with super deep RPG elements. The loot is (i think) randomly generated, seems like everything is. But it ends up making for some awesome stuff... Like im a warrior and found a necklace of strength, a trinket that makes a damage absorbing shield, ect. Also there is like 20 others things on each of those items... Its crazy. At first youre like, uhh, this is too much. Then when you understand what it means (also hold CONTROL to compare to your equipped) you are so glad for the extreme depth. I havent played a whole bunch, but I really love hoping on for a few hours and progressing through this game. Im on my 3rd character and each time you learn so much you didnt know. Also... The best part I got the game off HumbleBundle for $1. Value to entertainment is EXTREMELY high on this game.			"

A lot of the classes have very unique design as well, offering synergies, combinations of effects and other things I have yet to see in other roguelikes.>Amazing web services, just check out a random profile: http://te4.org/users/kalmazaton>Fixed zone bosses and possible bosses, as well as randomized mini-bosses>A lot of room for challenge and exploration in general>Dev involvement.

												(09/10) - Near PerfectionI struggled guys.... i struggled.Not inside the game, but on this rating.The game is just perfect. It has such a depth that it can easily hold up against modern tripple A RPG´s.I wish some other games took some advise from thisone, heck even civilisation has less depth than this game.So, why only 9 points you ask? Well... i wish i could give 10. And i honestly would for myself, but some people may argue this:It´s the same stuff you play through all the time.And it is. The dungeons don´t change (at least their names and their bosses. The dungeons themselfes are still randomly generated) and it is always the same order of stuff you have to do.I spend nearly 300 hours in this game and never got tired of it. But still: 9 points for being the best RPG i know, thus being the best roguelike i know thus being one of the best games on steam.For this rediculous price (it´s actually free if you want to play it on it´s homepage) i have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue why anyone would not pick up this game, other than being scared by it´s graphics.

												Very satisfying, well done, and accessible roguelike. Plenty of traditional mechanics under a great looking UI. You can tell this is a work of love and effort from a dedicated single dev. Skill trees are what really make this game pop, and inject a modern mechanic into a classic format. Also if you play on ""endless lives mode"" it's actually quite a relaxing game. Nice to take your time and have monsters patiently wait for you to decide what to do.As for cons, the biggest is balance, especially after mid-level (15+ or so). Initially the content matches your level, you're using all your skills, and there is plenty of challenge. But eventually you either go into areas that are way too low and have boring gameplay of ""press Z to autoexplore, smash things, health never goes below 99%"". Either that or you run into some random purple boss who 3-4 shots you. Or better yet a purple boss who is WAY higher level, like 35 when you're 15, and you have no chance.So that can all be a bit frustrating. But when the balance is great the game is great. It just happens a little too irregularly for me. I think the dev focused a lot on the early level <10 game, with the intent of permadeath and remaking characters, but once you're past that a few flaw emerge.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is an old-school ascii-roguelike game with a tileset as it's skin. This means that the game offers huge amount of content, almost cluttered UI but for a patient gamer opens up as a solid option for those that want to experience the deep roguelike setting with some improvements. First of all, Tales of Maj'Eyal is a free-to-play game, by buying it you will receive some improvements/add-ons to it but the core gameplay remains same. As a Steam fanboy and a roguelike fan it was enough for me that the game was on Steam but I'm not 100% sure if it's enough for those counting their last dollars since you can enjoy this game legally without paying, though it's always nice to help the developers ;) In Tales of Maj'Eyal you pick a race (Human, Elf etc.) and a class (warrior, wizard) with some unique options not seen elsewhere. You begin your quest in pre-determined area (dungeon) and after moving through it you get to the world map and are free to go wherever you desire (although you will get killed in most of the places you *can* go). There are several difficulty options to choose from between few extra lives and permadeath. You can also unlock new races, classes and quests by achieving different things in-game (no spoilers here) but it will take some time to get to that point since the game is rock hard. By the time I'm writing this I've played something like 6,5 hours and haven't scratched the surface yet so there's definitely a huge amount of content and replayability here.If you have ever played/enjoyed ADOM this is a game for you. If you want to see what those old roguelikes would be today this is game for you.If you hate dying this *might* be a game for you. Pros-Graphics-Hardcore difficulty-The amount of content-You can use mouse and/or keyboardCons-Graphics (some people concider tilesets ugly)-Difficulty (it really is)-The amount of things you will have to read and learn (Steam guides help with this one)-You can get it for freeOverralPretty much the only solution for ""true"" roguelike with graphics 8/10			"

												An incredible game, better than most games which make usage of small figures without a constant means of animations...There is a massive amount of unlockable classes, dozens, yet you begin with over a dozen classes, there are several races you begin with, with several more unlockable... new unlockable campaigns, and additional items to start with via unlocking, by acheiving various forms of success in any life allows future adventuring lives to be more unique and rewarding!There is also so much Lore hidden around the game. Either from completing quests, slaying unique entities, finding documents, or reading wall and statue inscriptions one can discover all a manner of things about the world, its inhabitants, cultures, races, monsters, relics, and more!Finally, all the unique particle effects for the spells, and all the new unique effects on the HUD, add a bit of insight to a world you would otherwise rely solely on text and figurines to understand what is going on. Things turn darker when you are influenced by an effect that decreases sight range, things blur if your stunned, dazed, and such, the screen tinges a different color based on whether you are bleeding, frozen solid, standing in fire, poison muck, or acid... this is highly useful since you'll need to resolve effects, some of which you might not realize your under the effect of without of this.Also, the game is so VERY detailed that they have different difficulties for both realism and complexity. Want unlimited lives? Explorer style is best for you. Want a limited set of chances based upon your successes and failures? Try the standard experience. Care to put your life in the hands of fate? Choose Roguelike, for a single life, with the potential for another if you discover things like becoming a Lich or Reincarnating in that specific life!This is well well built. A masterpiece of a game...			"

												The lore of this game troubles me. Spoiler warning, I'm gonna discuss the lore. If you still don't know what most of this review will be about, I have some bad news for you.So TOME has a pretty lengthy backstory, somewhere around three to five pages per area and dozens of areas. It's a decent fiction novel when taken as a whole, well written at the very least. What makes me question it is the modern cultural and technological lens through which most of the factions are viewed. Virtually all races are modelled after some modern day oppressive government or terrorist organization. They're all busy to some degree with opressing or exterminating the other races, even outright destroying the world. And there's lots of stuff about aliens, weapons of mass destruction, virus outbreaks, mindcontrol gadgets.On paper it's actually kind of awesome, yet the spectre of this interesting idea never quite materializes. Being a writer myself, I'm trying to find the right lesson to learn, the right advice to take away from all this.About halfway through the game you'll meet the orcs, a sort of Al Qaida style hyperviolent desert people. They're about to start another war and conquor the world, and you foil their plans and kill them right back into obscurity. Then it turns out they were part of some other scheme and it all comes down to... something?In the expansion, the remaining orcs are spared and thrown into a ghetto. You play as an orc, break out of the ghetto, overthrow your oppressors and then confirm everyone's prejudice by being exactly as violent as everyone thinks you are. Huh. That almost went somewhere.My conclusion is that it's an issue of theme and philosophy. Combining medieval fantasy and modernity is bound to have some interesting results, but it's also bound to clash. There's no obligation to pick sides or distill a moral truth, that's the job of a political essayist, not a writer. But you have to tie it together somehow. In this regard I feel the everyman cypher protagonist is something of a missed oppertunity. Put someone unique there, an actual hero (or villain). It's incredibly stale to have the main character be unique among their species, the one hero who is different, but that's why writing isn't easy.Anyway the game is good, it's a roguelite, there's hordes of enemies, there's limited respawns, I'm sure some other review can explain it better.7/4 would project on the moon with a giant slideshow projector.

But still: 9 points for being the best RPG i know, thus being the best roguelike i know thus being one of the best games on steam.For this rediculous price (it´s actually free if you want to play it on it´s homepage) i have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue why anyone would not pick up this game, other than being scared by it´s graphics.

												I'll start by saying that I've never played any true roguelikes before, and was loosing interest in pretty much all games, until i decided to take a chance and try something new, and I'm glad I did. ToME has unbelievable deptch and character creation, customisation and development, and I've had a great time testing out all the initially unlocked classes and have spent every free moment in the last week playing this game, the talents are all varied and developed, and there are loads of different ways of playing each class. I haven't progressed more than a few hours on a single character so dying hasn't been too infuriating at any point, definitely gonna keep playing through this game and then pick up both expansion packs. 10/10 would recommend to any roguelike fans, or anyone whos never played a roguelike at all. This game is a masterpiece			"

												This is a game I have so much love for, I would really recommend it if you are into Rogue-like games. If you aren't sure you can get the game for free in it's page, you can play the whole game on the free ver. (You can unlock the full game features by donating or buying it) the achievements you get on it will save and they will move to steam if you purchase the game on it so don't worry about the progress.Give it a try!

												Pros- +The game is one of the most enoyable actual ""Rogue likes"" I've played.+Good range of class and race combinations allowing for a relatively deep customisation (uses still sprites but the sprites aren't lacking, they are both serious for the role player and humerous for the more light hearted run throughs)+Good sense of humour from both the game and the developer. (Ie / only a few nights ago the dev set out a bunch of random events including but not limited to handing out gold to turning you into a bunny with 20% crit chance.)+Lore is pretty damn Interesting+Its literally pennies for how much gameplay you can actually get.+Achievements! Achievements 1000+ Achievements for all you achievement junkies :P+Classes are and usually split into two obvious builds, sometimes more for the more.. creative players, and require some planning thought, example being a Spell sword, who focuses on casting and uses melee as an alt or who uses sword play and only uses magic to bolster his sword swings / damage.+Seems to be a lot of very varied items and gear all of which, especially items bearing prefixes and affixes can be incredibly useful and generally all can compliment some type fo character buildCons - Theres actually very few cons other than the few below, BUT the game is Niche, this won't fulfil every RPG ""roguelike"" fan.-Graphics are litlle basic (May or may not put people off, personally doesn't bother me as the game is far too good to sit and complain about how it looks too)-Have experienced a few lock ups on tabbing out during load screens (probably a dumb thing to do but Youtube ads don't skip themselves...)-Utterly Unreal amount of achievements may actually cause people to slog through the game not enjoying it.-RNG can really screw you over.-Game is incedibly difficult (for those who would rather face roll than think and believe they are the ultimate warrior/gamer)-Enemies can be very, very unfair if you get unlucky, which can be disheartening in rogue like perma death difficulty as there can be situations where your character may as well just drop his weapon and bend over.

												I've played over 450 hours of ToME thus far.  I'm not a great player - I tend to get overconfident and get in way over my head.  But ToME is fun.So what makes Tales of Maj'Eyal special?  Why do I keep going back to it year after year, giving it more of my time than almost every other game in my not insubstantial collection?  There's a grand diversity in the characters you can play, and their play styles are very different.  You have multiple campaigns, as well as the recently improved Infinite Dungeon.  The skill selection is great.  Lots of skills to choose from, each with multiple levels.  Races usually have their own skill progression tree, as well.  There are passive skills, sustained skills (that opponents can turn off sometimes), and active skills.  Each of the active skills has a cooldown.  Some items will give you access to active skills as well, or reduce a cooldown on a skill, or make a whole skill tree a little more effective.  Any active skill can be auto-triggered, if you like.  Most of the races have an instant skill to start off with that gives them some benefit, and you can just say ""Yeah, when someone closes in on me, fire off that skill"" and you don't have to worry about it anymore.  Which brings us to auto-explore.  Like DCSS, ToME has a great auto-explore, so when you're not min-maxing your character or finding awesome artifacts, you're making meaningful decisions.  In the end, those meaningful decisions almost always end in your demise.  As someone once said: ""Playing a roguelike is like being a kamikazi pilot: you start off knowing you're going to die.""  Rare is the explorer who does not meet some untimely end.  And that too is part of the charm of roguelikes: it's so very often quickly over, but every so often you luck out and live longer than you have any right to.  And you feel like such a bad♥♥♥♥♥  And then you die.  Again.			"

												This is definitely one of the best games I have played in recent years. If you have never played a ""roguelike"" style game before and you want to try such a game, this game is your best nominee for an entry to the genre. There are lots of different character classes and lots of talents to choose from. At first, only a handful of them are unlocked for you but it is so fun playing the game and unlocking the other features one by one and gaining cool achievements along the way. Beware, you will die a lot and forced to play from the start. But it is the nice part of it because you learn from your mistakes and try to play cautiously next time to avoid stupid deaths while learning subtle details about the gameworld and monsters. It is not the best game in the world, obviously, but if you like role playing games and just want to hack and slash, this game is a ""must try"" for you. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Oh wow, where to begin?This game is great. What it lacks in visuals is more than made up for in content. It's one of those games that you'll die a lot in, but each time you'll learn something new and think ""Alright, one more playthrough, I've got this figured out now"". Later, you realize that you've been playing for the past 12 hours, your eyes hurt, and you still have a lot more learning to do. ToME can be kind of intimidating at first glance. There's a million different spells, skills, and traits that you can pick through, and it's up to you to learn which ones to use and when. I suggest starting simple, find a skill or two to use that kills stuff, and slowly try to branch out from there so you don't get overwhelmed and quit. If you give this game a chance, you'll more than likely fall in love with it.There's a variety of different classes, many of which require you to complete a certain quest or objective with a starter class before they are unlocked. The game's difficulty scales fairly well, you're (probably) not going to die immediately upon starting a new campaign, and the first few quest chains aren't too difficult, which provides new players with some time to learn the basic mechanics of the game. In order to truly succeed in the game, however, significant attention will need to be put into resistances and learning which enemies do what kind of damage. Preparation and strategy are required, sprinting into battles is a good way to die, trust me, I know.The game is difficult, so be prepared. I have nearly 100 hours into the game and - sadly - still have not beaten the campaign. Despite this, I highly recommend the game. It's rewarding, fun, and has high replayability (look at the hours played of 95% of the reviewers). Do yourself a favor and buy ToME.One last thing, this game goes on sale a LOT. Typically for 50-75% off. If you still run a paper route and $6.99 is too steep for your blood, wait for one of these sales and say ""Goodbye"" to your free time.			"

												This is an amazing RL game, a lot of different races and classes you can unlock and customize. The gameplay is great for people who are new to RL games as it allows you to choose whether to play the game with one life, unlimited, or a certain amount. I still haven't beaten the game due to me trying out all the races and classes that i've unlocked, i reccomend trying all of the classes or using the random button when making a character as that helps you learn new class/race customizations. Though there is one big downfall for this game, in the game their is a chat that lets you talk to other people playing it. If you're new to RL or need help, do not go there. People in that chat do not welcome newcomers and some moderators in that chat are very toxic too. Anyways, i'd give the game a 9/10! Hope you have fun and comment if you want to ask me questions.

It has graphics. It has an intuitive interface. It has friendly people in an integrated chat system (which, I'll admit, surprised me the most.) I've been playing Pern since it was released all those years ago on Thangorodrim and I'll keep playing this, the best incarnation of all the Angband clones and, to my knowledge, the only one of them to move out of their parents' basement.Congratulations Dark God.

												Very deep yet easily accessable turnbased roguelike. With a butt-load of options, settings, mods, GUIs, this game is perfect for jumping into and easy to stay in. And with different races and classes to unlock, over a thousand items, armor, weapons, achievements, on top of the lore and stories that Maj' Eyal can tell. What more could you ask for?People Who'd Like This Game: RPG/Roguelike FansWhy?: Great interface that is fully customizable with hotbars and maps, deep character building and number padding, but not too much as to overwhelm.People Who'd Hate This Game: Simple-Minded RPG/Button Masher FansWhy?: Can be confusing to understand what you are looking at if you aren't a fan of RPG's, or would prefer being dropped into the action/powerfulness that you would be too bored/confused to do alone.

												first of all, if you are interested in this go to the main site and download it for FREE! the difference between this paid version and the free is miniscule and let me tell you why. You get custom tiles that look cool but really nothing more then just a cosmetic thing. Exploration mode which just gives you infinate lives while nice! it sorta (in my opinion) takes away what makes a roguelike fun and thats perma death. The items vault that lets you share a small amount of items between character, i wont lie is nice but again isnt game breaking what so ever You also get ONE class a stone warden defensive class that only dwarves can use, while pretty nice is just but one class compared to the 26 classes you can already unlock and use in the free versin.  Now about the game itself! This game has a beautiful UI with custom nice looking icons for every thing, a DETAILED and easy to understand leveling system with talent points you can spend on a mix of features unique to EVERY(26) CLASS, a more common tree avalible to other classes, and stat points which you gain every level and distribute as you see fit. There is also a large amount of magical equipment drops with a balenced but wide variety of stats and effects to keep things interesting with your lewt! The best thing i love about ToME is that unlike most other roguelikes there is a variety of places to explore from dungeons to sand caves or  crystal caverns and theives dens! There are many other locations spread throughout the game world for you to find and explore. Some of the places you explore may unlock additional classes/races! did i mention the unlocks? yeah theres a lot and there nice. So i hope you read and this and found something you like from my review and decide to give this wonderful game a try.			"

												Great rogue-like. One of it's greatest strengths is also one of it's greatest weaknesses in that the lengthy narrative campaign is static so if you die after sinking 10+ hours in to a character, you have to repeat most of the same content (albiet randomized) again. However this allows you to build up certain persitant upgrades and meta knowledge for future playthroughs.			"

												Very deep yet easily accessable turnbased roguelike. With a butt-load of options, settings, mods, GUIs, this game is perfect for jumping into and easy to stay in. And with different races and classes to unlock, over a thousand items, armor, weapons, achievements, on top of the lore and stories that Maj' Eyal can tell. What more could you ask for?People Who'd Like This Game: RPG/Roguelike FansWhy?: Great interface that is fully customizable with hotbars and maps, deep character building and number padding, but not too much as to overwhelm.People Who'd Hate This Game: Simple-Minded RPG/Button Masher FansWhy?: Can be confusing to understand what you are looking at if you aren't a fan of RPG's, or would prefer being dropped into the action/powerfulness that you would be too bored/confused to do alone.

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												oh my god i cant describe how revolutionary this game is. i believe the vast amount of roleplay servers has allowed me to become a greater person in real life. it's hard to consider real life real any more because im in a roleplay world more than the outside world. the community is just simply the most friendly ive ever experienced, far more than second life or runescape (classic of course). the only problem with my gaming sessions in garrys mod is that my gay parents eventually pull me out of the world and make me do boring chores in the outside world			"

												Is best game for stats.  Make big numbers and see a victory!  Hidden secret is that best number to have is ""number of turns you live"".  I turn on game, make a humans man.  I put baby box on space bar.  Come back and he die of old age!  Next time I make elf because time does not make them die.Now I am alive for nine million turns.  Truely best game for rewarding my canny sneaky cowardice.  Recommand if you like having biggest number.Plus, early game weapon of much note is a tree.  10 stars.In all seriousness, it's a damn fine rogue-like in the traditional, unambiguous meaning of the phrase.  It's hard, you'll die a lot, and you'll play the game again with a completely different kind of character.			"

												This is a roguelike done right.  And a free-to-play done right as well.The world in which the game takes place is deep and immersive, with a rich history you'll rarely see in any game, roguelike or otherwise.  Character creation is incredibly complex... but in a good way.  Same with the implementation of the different classes' talents / skills.  The game somehow manages all this depth and complexity while still being approachable to the less hardcore roguelike fans.  The interface is fairly intuitive, and there's a solid tutorial to help players new to the genre to get a general idea how to play.There are difficulty levels, which is already pretty unusual for a roguelike, but even better than that, three different game modes.  The masochists (myself included) can have permadeath while casual players can get into the game with Exploration mode, letting them die any number of times without any harsh penalties.  There's even an Adventure setting which gives players up to 7 lives (gained when reaching certain levels) allowing in-between players a chance to experience the intense thrill that only a permadeath-style game can offer, without over-punishing a small mistake.The game is even more amazing in that it is 100% free.  You can download it for free.  You can even play with the source code if you are so inclined.  The game engine powering ToME is a separate package you can use to build your own games.  And yet it isn't supported by in-game ads (unless you count the very minimal starting-screen ads strictly for ToME DLC) or pay-to-win mechanics.  The entire game's revenue is based on players either buying DLC (which is absolutely not required to thoroughly enjoy the game) and donations (which is effectively what you're doing if you buy on steam).  Donators get access to some special content, and it's good stuff to be sure, but it's not required to have a ton of fun.I feel like I need to buy this an extra time or two just to support the amazing product and the one (ones?) responsible for it.I can't go into depth about game specifics; that would take me weeks to write.  Just trust me: it's an exceptional game with some really amazing features, and you can try it yourself for free if you aren't convinced.(The free version is probably not on Steam, so go to the game's website if you're too broke to pony up the $7 for it)			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is for those of us who cannot say no to a challenge. The combat mechanics is very intricate and there are thousands of combinations. There are many classes and races to choose from. Each class is sculpted in such a way that no one class will feel the same as the other. There's also an amazing and rich lore behind the game that you find as you explore its many dungeons. If you are into roguelikes or just want a challenge, then this is definitely one game you won't want to miss!			"

												One of the Better games of this type on Steam. It's not pretty but you can get other tilesets for it and the Steam Workshop is full of good mod's to tweak the gameplay. Speaking of the gameplay,It's deep! the amount of race's,class,skills,item's etc. (some are un-locked after playing game) are just huge, It has a story!  You can get it for free on website but the small price you pay on Steam is worth the items you get and your putting some loot in DarkGod's hands. Over all I'm happy that I picked this up, I't has more replay to it than AAA games like Skyrim.9/10 Good Game at a Crazy low Price.			"

												One of the best Roguelikes I've ever played.  Great story, wonderful customization, beautiful graphics, and deep, powerful lore.  You can be anything from a greatsword swining Berserker, to a Wrymling who can summon the power of Dragons, a psychic, a time mage, and much more.  There is so much customization and attention to detail, that Maj'Eyal is truly one of those games where words don't do it justice.  You have to experience its majesty for yourself.			"

Tales of Maj'EyalRating: 6 / 10Dived into this for about 2 hours, and it drops you in a rogue-like sprite-based fantasy world with quests, monsters, loot and a huge amount of achievements to be scored. Got through the first few screens and solved a few quests but still no achievement. It plays and feels like a standard game, nothing really special but I suppose I only scratched the surface because the potential is there. Expect no quick rewards but a lot of depth and width in options and the rewards you get from digging in.For this price you can have a lot of hours full of exploration and fun.			"

												it fails both as a roguelike and (at least I think thats what the developers were trying to do) a ""mainstream"" roguelikethe user interface is obnoxious at best with a font that hurts my eyes. it really could have been simplified without all the fancy crap sprinkled around for no good reason. whats wrong with helvetica, if you are to not go with the IBM font?not to mention the format they chose to stick with is merely another failure added to the pile of roguelikes that adopted the semi-linear progression. it simply doesnt work and looks dumb, thats why procedural generation has been the hallmark of roguelikes since the first game - basically forever. even dungeons of dredmor is better.while I have never been fully able to rationalize ""fairness"" in roguelikes I have a hunch that this game has garbage difficulty progression. it seems to be mostly set in stone and no amount of new levels seem to change the proportions of enemies that will simply steamroll certain builds. while other roguelikes are significantly harder, sometimes you will just encounter a playthrough that provides you with a fair footing against new adversaries. this further undermines maj'eyal's replayability and its f!cking boring.theres heaps of more interesting roguelikes to be found on roguebasinalthough I do have to say that the in-game chat is a very nice touch.

												Two problems with this game. One, there's a bug that keeps causing my game to crash randomly and fixing it isn't easy. It's frustrating and tedious and the community isn't all that helpful in fixing it. Two, the gameplay is a bit slow and clunky and the graphics can be a little off-putting. Despite those things, the gameplay seems pretty damn unique, fun, well fleshed out, and it feels like there's a LOT of variety. If you have a ton of patience to read complicated stats and paragraphs of text and are willing to play a little bit slowly through a game to get good at it, then this game's for you. It's definitely not for the casual / faint of heart RPG'er, but you can definitely see where it would become massively rewarding and skill-based once you get good at the game. The content seems absolutely massive and I look forward to diving back in once I can figure out the bug ordeal.			"

												For all of the positive reviews that this game has, I expected it to be a lot more polished than it is. If you told me that this game was in Beta, I would have belived it. It's not the old-school graphics, it's the clunky User Interface. Menus cover up each other and several buttons don't work when you click them. The font is often too small to read, and some of the menus I still haven't figured out what their purpose is. Sometimes it feels like you are fighting the UI, more than the monsters of Maj'Eyal.  I have yet to play a roguelike that I thought was fair, This one didn't really come close. I like the deep customization and unlockable classes and races. Where the game fails centers around it's claim of ""no grinding  required"". This is the game's downfall as you clear out an area and the monsters don't respawn. You move on to the next area only to find the monsters are too hard and kill you instantly. You are stuck and can't continue with the character becuase there are no ways to get stronger without a likely death. You have to start the game over or throw your body at monsters that are a lot stronger than your character. This is hardest on the classes that I think are really fun to play like rogues and mages. You are just not powerful enough to make it through the early areas and you can't grind to level up. The game doesn't compensate to allow classes that start off weak to be able to make it through the beginning of the game. If this was fixed, I would reccomend this game even with the clunky UI.Final Reccomendation: Download it from the website and try it for free before purchase.			"

Avoid at all costs.Completely imbalanced game which has a feeling of well-thought due to insane amount of skills.But in reality it's not even near ""well-thought"" tag.Basically, you are forced to play a few overpowered options if you want to win in roguelike mode without cheating and as a result there are not too much variety in gameplay.Roguelike mode is implemented in a worst possible way as well and is completely luck based.You can get a few ""Blood of Life"" potions during gameplay which makes possible to revive your character after death in roguelike. Or you can get zero such potions and die in ""death roll"" situation you cannot avoid no matter how good you play and manage death risks. Because no matter what you'll do, you can be instantly killed by a enemy you didn't even see in a dungeon which was ""easy walk"" before you ordered you character to move and ""death message"" appeared.

												I am pretty sure this game is a very good rogue-like game. And I sure know there is a lot of content. Tons of customization in your character and probably many quests (have not been able to get that far myself). A great bang for the buck no doubt about it.BUT, where is its soul? Where is the drive to continue playing? I sure miss it. It seems to be a very good exploration game, but combat is, at its best, dull as hell. Either you steam roll over your enemies, or they destroy you. There is no in between, no tactics involved. Basically, a left click fest.What are the effects during combat? Why can't I move sometimes? Why is it so difficult to understand what is going on (meaning what effects are affecting your character and why)?I am sure it is a good game, but I can't recommend it.In any case, I sure will give it another try just to see whether I missed something obvious.

												Another grindfest*I was hoping for a game that offered some interesting choices and different paths to victory, but was very disappointed with TOME.  My 6 hours was spent handily defeating everything in an area until things got too hard, then backing out to another stage and doing the same.  I got the feeling I could do that for 60 hours, then win the game.If you like lore and you like loot, this game has tons.  But for me, the gameplay just didn't sell it.(A commenter points out it's not technically grinding since cleared areas remain cleared.  I stand by my statement, because it the gameplay *feels* very grindy.  Even though you're in a different area, you're just grinding slightly different monsters to build up to a point where you can grind the *next* tier of dungeons)			"

												I gave it a shot, I really gave it a shot.  I figured that a game with such a high rating must have something going for it that I wasn't seeing and that I needed to keep giving it ""just a bit more time"".I think I got about 3-4 hours in before I realized that no amount of ""more time"" would ever reveal to me what others are seeing in this game.For me I found it boring, frustrating and mostly luck-based. I really never felt challenged as a player or felt that I was required to truly evaluate what my next move was going to be.  It seemed to be: Either face-roll whatever was in front of me OR kite enemies to a choke-point and then do the obvious attack/skill/whatever.  Continue until you die from circumstances beyond your control.It presents as a deep strategy game but I can honestly say I felt no strategy beyond absolute basics was ever required for the time I played.There appears to be a lot of customization in the characters/classes/skills/etc but when it all comes out in terms of gameplay it felt quite shallow.  How can a game feel so shallow when there is so much apparent ""depth"" to the character customization?  I have no idea, but this game found the formula IMO.My other big complaint is the UI (user interface) which I found using to be a greater challenge than playing the actual game.Why won't my character move every 2nd click?  How do I close this window?  Why does this window close when I click OFF it, and this other window requires me to click ON it to close?  Why is there rollover text that needs scrolling, yet when I move the mouse over to scroll it different rollover replaces it before I get there?  Thank goodness I quit drinking because I would have gone rage city while I was still living in the bottle.The UI- and I want to make it clear I am not talking about the graphics which are a different story - is very bad, very difficult to use, and feels dashed together haphazardly with little regard to how users need and expect information to be presented.  I praise the dev for ATTEMPTING to include font/UI scaling options which more games need. However, adjusting any of the setting made the visual presentation quite atrocious and broke the UI in non-trivial ways.  Resolution settings turned out to be a joke too... anything other than full-screen native resolution made the layout of the UI go berserk.I don't care that much about graphics, I don't care that much for story, I don't care too much about deep customization.  What I care about is good gameplay, solid craftsmanship, and clean & intuitive interface - I did not find any of those here.			"

												There are two things in Tales of Maj'Eyal, that made me stop playing this game, and not invest money in more expansions:1) Permanent socketing. Items can be imbued with gems, which add to the item's stats. Gems can be found and bought, and you can also find more powerful artifact gems. However, all item imbuing is permanent. The result was never using the good gems for imbuing good items, while anxiously wondering whether and when I should. Instead of a bonus, every found artifact became a reminder about potentially shooting myself in the foot. ""Wanna imbue me? You know, it's permanent if you do. A better gem might be just around the corner. Better wait...but is it? You're constantly gimping yourself, you know...""2) Extremely limited item transfer space. AFAIU, you'll get transfer space for one item for every 2 euros you've paid for the game. With the base game at 7 euros, that'd result in a massive quantity of 3 items you can transfer. However, you can find tens - or even hundreds of artifacts in one playthrough. Also, the transfer space can be reached in later game only, never allowing you the possibility of starting fresh characters with good quality equipment. The permanent socketing -issue raises its head in here as well, since different character classes require different items. ""Used that nice artifact gem in the sword of your now-overleveled fighter? So bad, you can't transfer it to your new mage's staff now.""To conclude, if these issues were fixed, I'd gladly put more money in this game.			"

												The game has an overall great retro appeal, and the roguelike progression is well crafted, allowing players to choose the level of deadliness in the game. Unfortunately, it is really buggy. The game often crashes for no reason, and the occurrence of crashes is so often it makes the game nigh unplayable at times. If they fix this issue, I would love to change my review.			"

												I am a die hard fan of the original ADOM (Ancient Domains of Mystery),  the ORIGINAL roguelike as well as a player of another lesser known ASCII roguelike game as well as several others. Tales of Maj'Eyal or TOME is clone of ADOM. The keybinding are the same, classes are the same and fans of the original will find many more similarities. If I didn't enjoying play or rather enjoying dying in the original game, I probably would enjoy this game more. My general thoughts about the game (trying to keep it balanced)I enjoyed the different classes. Making decisions to improve my character. You always feel like you are improving. However your characters skills may improve, overall the game felt incredibly stale and boring. Who cares about the items? the weapons? the books? This is what I turn my attention to next: looting system and gameplay.In TOME, I pick up a few weapons to kill a few more enemies more quickly as I mindlessly and easily kill them. I really didn't get any satisfaction from looting.  This is because TOME is just sooo much easier than the original as well as TOME doesn't give you the chance to just pick up a weapon and try it. In ADOM, you can dig at the walls, getting some rocks (if your axepick doesn't break) where you can use to throw at the invading enemies. This is totally eliminated in TOME. You need a talent to even use a bow or sling? Come on! This meant for my playthrough I just had many millions of mindless, predictably leveled and simple enemies to grind my way through. Great for fans of WOW who love the grind and level up your character, but boring for everyone else. In ADOM, you are just one slime mold, hard armoured enemy, or river from losing your cherished weapon. In TOME, who cares? Your weapon will never get damaged. In ADOM, if you pick up a special wand of teleportation with 2 charges, it could easy save your life in a tough pinch. Without that special item, you could easily die. If you carefully zap that wand when you have no other escape, it could save your life if your luck is with you. If luck is against you, you could still die and unlike TOME with almost infinite resaves (roguelike my♥♥♥♥♥) there is no teleporting back in the game once you died. If you used that wand too early, you might not have it later when you REALLY need it. Even a decision like using a wand was just sooo much more important in ADOM. In TOME, who cares? You quickly get the tp spell on a 9 turn cooldown. In comparison, many games I didn't even run into the wand even once. So when you got the loot in ADOM, it really meant something. In TOME, looting was just a tedious chore. Let me explain more about the difference between TOME (the clone) and the original by way of a story. In ADOM, I remember being excited about finding every single item. Often high powered stuff would drop that was far above your level. If you got that loot, you were pretty much golden (until it rusted, broke, was stolen by a thief, obliterated by spells, or burned up). Then when your prized weapon invariably was destroyed, you realized that you only had 7 rocks and two loaves of bread before starvation or death. Then after defeating a kobold, you realize that he dropped a book containing powerful magic. You hear something being killed in the level, so you open a door,  lock it and begin to read the book. You feel more hunger and as the hunger continues to get stronger, you finish the book, and learn the magic. You then remember that you carefully dropped some food and some extra weapons on some stairs a few levels above. As you use your new powerful magic to destroy the enemies coming for you, you begin to feel more and more hungry (first see yellow notification for hunger, then an orange notification). As I'm describing this, I slipping a bit into the character of the game. The graphics were non-existent, just letter characters for each enemy but the many choices you could make in the game made you feel like you were in the game. Getting back to the story, as our intrepid hero continues slowly towards the stairs, and the notifications continue to flash more dire, you realize that your hero is not going to make it. You look in your inventory. You notice a seed and a kobold corpse. You quickly eat the seed. You take one more step, staving off death for one more step. You are only a few steps from death. You look in the inventory and now you see a rotting kobold corpse. You realize that you are dead. You eat the kobold corpse, become paralyzed and stunned. After unsuccessfully trying to move, you suddenly die in two turns, still close to the stairs and the weapon and food drop. After heroically surviving the loss of your prized possession, your hero dies from starvation so close to his goal. This is what I loved about ADOM, getting really high level loot, getting attacked by surprising high level enemies, almost dying, surviving before finally dying. I have lost many many characters in ADOM. It was really interesting trying to discover the code for the game. I tried my best, but like Sid Meier's Pirates, the game was next to impossible to finish. TOME has many elements that I loved about the original. Discovering the Infinite Dungeon, Troll's Cave, Gladiator Tournament all felt cool to me once again. I still really enjoy the premise behind TOME. I think I'll probably eventually end up playing more of this game. Maybe if I can create some overpowered raccoons/companions to follow me around, I'll feel like less of a letdown. I had a lot of happy memories playing ADOM. Throwing massive stones throw doorways to break the doors down into very much needed wood that I could use to make arrows was a lot of fun. Even creating loyal zombies to follow me around as a necromancer was a lot of fun. Fighting powerful enemies that could stun you, blind you, or do many dastardly things to you was a lot of fun. If I can dramatically ramp up the difficulty, TOME might do it for me. I only don't recommend it because as a die hard fan, I feel they could have done so much more.  "

												Seems like no thought has been given to user interface or usability at all.  HUD & menus are illegibly tiny.  Controls aren't immediately clear. Got a disappointing sense that the game would have a lot of choice for character levelling... while having very little to make it clear what the effects are. Maybe don't tell me I can buy a skill to add acid to my special attacks before I've ever seen what my attacks are...  It looks like I'll be faced with endless choices that are unclear...As a D&D fan and a Diablo 2 & Torchlight 2 fan I'm pretty positive about character choice and levelling.  But that stuff has got to make sense or feel worthwhile. After navigating menus and character screens for 10 min, I finally saw the main game graphics.I knew it wouldn't be pretty, but the videos make it look like maybe it makes sense.  I uninstalled 2 min later.			"

												I really want to like this game, I do. I was a fan of the old ADOM game and this is a port of a similar game, but the problem is that it suffers from number-crunch-itus, old UI and selection tools, and general design philosphies that hold over from the days when coding desicion-making logic took precidence above usability. The port did not fix these issue. I find myself resenting this game, as it seems to punish the user for variables that are outside of the user's control. This punishment hangs over your shoulder in every dungeon around every corner your turn, like an abusive friendship that you hope you can improve with time, but never have the tools to adress.			"

												I'm quite fond of Roguelikes but I stopped playing and never picked it up, it just felt too convoluted. It is obviously a very elaborate game but that's perhaps the problem: my momma told me to be a simple kind of man.I couldn't quite get over the graphics either. I've played the original Rogue and I enjoyed that (greatly) but this game is just plain ugly for its time.Wasn't too impressed by the story telling either. Found the characters to be very anachronistic in their writing and personality. But don't believe what I say! Check out all the positive reviews, obviously there is something here that I'm not seeing.			"

												The UI / gameplay aren't as crisp and polished as I've come to expect in a roguelike -- an example, changing the ""resolution"" changes window size and nothing else, including the size of menus larger than your chosen resolution.  I think that once I pierce the learning curve there will be a good turnbased strategy game in here, but with nethack's semirandom difficulty curve, and having to unlock character types.This game has the potential to become a lot of things, but it feels like early access to me.If you thought dungeons of dredmore was too mainstream, polished, and silly, you could give this a go?  It seems to have a very active community and mod team.			"

												As much as I want to enjoy this game, I can't.  I've been playing this game since before it was on steam and had hoped that they would have fixed a lot of things, but they haven't.  Now I find myself hating having put it on my steam collection.My experience with this game has been singular.  I waste time creating a character and spawn in a room full of monsters, half of which are level 2 while I am level one.  9 times out of 10, it has spawned me right next to these creatures, so within a round or two of starting the game, my character is dead and in a situation that they CANNOT get out of.  Kill the character off, make a new one, continue this cycle ad nauseum.  The tutorial tells you outright that the character is OP for the tutorial and your character in the game will be 'weaker,' but what they fail to tell you is the monsters in the tutorial are weaker than you'll be facing in the actual game as well.  Inventory management is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and the random dungeon generation frequently makes walls with 'holes' in them (diagonally placed) so trying to take a corner to limit avenues of attack tends to result in getting attacked through the wall by something on the other side you didn't even know was there.The game is interesting.  It should be fun as it is presented.  It is not.			"

												I never thought graphics mattered to me as a gamer until I played Tales of Maj'Eyal.To be fair I only put in a little more than two hours and maybe I'm just not the target demographic for this game but really though, this didn't feel like a video game at all to me. I never actually felt like I was doing anything that was happening in this game. I was just seeing tiles move around and text appear on screen.The tradeoff with a a game like this is supposed to be the depth of customization, interactivity, and story, etc. But none of that stuff really stood out to me when I was making my character and playing the opening quests.If your goal is to play a super simplistic RPG where there's a depth of customization and interactivity then my advice would be not to play a game like this. But instead join a tabletop RPG group. That is the deepest level of customization and interactivity you can get to and it also involves hanging out with real people and drinking beer, so that makes it even better than this game.			"

												I wish this was a lot better than it is. Turns out I hate the entire idea of a roguelike game. I tried to look beyond that and give it a shot. Still not for me.I got into this game only because its the top achievement game on steam and I liked the idea of supporting a one man dev team (because this game is actually free elsewhere). Vast majority of the achievements have never been earned and are basically impossible or luck based. Its free for a reason. About the moment I got camped by level 20 mobs in a level 1 zone and couldnt progress I realized the dev has no idea what they are doing. Even as a ""hard"" game thats just stupid. Literally couldnt get out of the starting zone because of 6-10 mobs chasing me. I'm supposed to do this with one life? Even on infinite play I hated every minute of it.There is no skill in being stomped at level 1, Im all for challenging boss fights and such. I never made it that far lol.			"

												You could spend time playing this game, but ultimately unless you're looking for a rogue-like and have run out of games to play this isn't going to do anything for you. The games controls aren't intuitive, the available options for upgrading give you no reasonable way to determine a proper path without spending an hour reading, the graphics are poorly done, and the game itself is fairly boring. Playing as a bulwark and starting off with an ability that just refilled my health continuously to the point where I could be surrounded by monsters on the hardest difficulty setting available wasn't a good sign, even in the beginning. This game may have a lot of depth to it, but it is hidden under a lot of layers of mud.			"

And normaly you have max 3 lives, after this, your character is deleted. There is a mod hardcore with 1 life only and the mod infinite life but even the infinite life is useless. There is nothing to do in the game that's ♥♥♥♥ign ridiculous. Like, if u make a dward you end up lv 7 and the next zone after this is lv 12 wtf. You can fight white/normal mobs but as soon as u cross a rare or unique one it ♥♥♥♥ing 1 shot you no stop, you ahve to die 1000 times moving 1 square at a time trying to find the exit.The interface is very basic, some talent are useless (like we can dig to open ways but there is no secret rooms to find). You have to explore the world to unlock new class/race/cosmetics but you don'T want to do this. What you want to do is rage as loud as you can till you decide to go uninstall that ♥♥♥♥ing piece of crap useless wasting your time.			"

												Apparently 'Rogue-like' has been corrupted to mean ""randomly generate unbeatable unexcapable bosses twice or more the dungeon level, until the player has no more resurrects left"".Some have taken issue with my concept of rogue-like because they played a much harder rogue-like and this is easy when compared to 'that game'.  To that I say, if you must use the No True Scotsman fallacy to defend your game from critique, you've already failed.   Escape options in this game are largely restricted to teleports; due to the level disparity that prompts a need for an escape, nothing less then escape in a single turn is fast enough. Unfortunately, the teleports are random and unreliable until late game, when they are finally targetable.  If you like a game where drinking a potion could kill you and there is no way to detect it is posion, you may find this game palatable. If you like a game where just the act of entering a dungeon or changing a level may cause your character to slip and break their neck (die), you may find this game palatable.Conversely, if you believe that no matter how hard a game is, the game should provide you the tools to handle risks like these and only punish you for not using those tools, then you will probably find this game to be 'fake hard'.  It randomly hits you with bosses that eyeroll at your escape attempt, giggle at your damage, ignore your debuff attempts and crush you.			"

												If you like Rogue style games like Nethack, you will love this game. It is rock hard and there are so many unique classes, some of which are very simple and some of which take some real mastery. I had the free version when it was out and now had to buy it to support the developers. It can be a bit tough to learn what areas that you can go to and which you should stay away from in the beginning, but eventually you will get the hang of it. There are also some helpful community guides to get you started. Best game I ever spent so little money on.			"

												I started playing this game prior to it getting on steam. I have to say this is one of the BEST games I have ever had the experience to play. If you enjoy rogue-like type games look no further. I ended up donating $20 prior to it releasing on steam and think that for it's current price at $7 is an absolute steal! I've had this game for about 2 years and always find myself coming back to it every few months.The developer/creator (Darkgod) is constantly working on it and improving it and is VERY generous in terms of what he gives us in the game.

												Holy hell, I can't recommend this game enough. It's a roguelike game, which means that it has a lot of features people will dislike. It's turnbased strategy, limited lives (although I play in perma-death mode), randomly generated content, lots of dungeon crawling. If you're a fan of the non-combat mechanics of Binding of Isaac (the constant restarting, exploration, not sure what you'll find in every new level), you'll LOVE this game. If you dislike other roguelikes but like the concept, this game is still worth giving a shot, because it's not as complex, is extremely well-made, and gives you a tutorial that truly teaches you how to play this game effectively. There's a TON of other features and using addons doesn't automatically break the game and, in fact, still allows you to gain achievements and make progress towards character unlocks (which doesn't matter if you've taken the addon that bypasses blocked content, like I have). There's a ton more I can geek out about, but consider this: I've put at least 100 hours into this game (including its non-Steam free version off of http://te4.org) in two weeks. In other words, I've played this almost constantly during my time away from work, save for a few League games.TL;DR: BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥NOW DAMMIT.			"

												Great game that differs itself from the other roguelikes. While it may not be a ""procedurally generated"" map, and there isn't anything that has a chance of being good or bad (ex: quaff potion, turns out to be a fire potion killing you) except for some abilities that teleport you randomly within a certain tile range (which you can get control of later on anyways). Without those, why should I still play it you ask? For one, this game is incredibly hard (which is a good thing). Every mistake adds up, and you have to think about how you approach enemies depending on your character, which brings me to my favorite part. There are tons of classes and races to choose from, each being unique in their own way. Classes are more rpg oriented, each having unique multiple attacks and tactics to use during the battles.TL;DR:Great game, you should play it. While there is the free version on their website, this one adds a few more options and an extra class, and helps support the creator, who is a great guy (he actually listens~)			"

												In a nutshell, Tales of Maj'Eyal is a turn-based old-school-minded roguelike that's been in development for over a decade (in various incarnations) and which lets you save the world from a horde of orcs, demons, and god-slaying aliens by playing as characters as varied as a hate-fueled skeleton who kills things by flipping them the bird and an albino ewok who likes to punch dragons and get high on nature. Or, if you want to get REALLY crazy, I guess you can play as an elven archer.If you don't care so much about things like ""animation"" and you love keeping track of way too many numbers for your character, well, then this game is more for you than for me. And I have over 600 hours in it. This game is ridiculous and it is destroying my life.			"

												If you're a fan of old-school, roguelike RPG's then you can't go wrong with this. Maddeningly addictive, brutally difficult and with a whole host of unlockable and interesting 'DnD' style classes, each greatly varying in playstyle.By the looks of it, there's potentially a lot of gameplay here too outside of the typical “die, replay new game” flow common with roguelikes. So far I’ve not managed to get a character past level 14 without having them killed and then auto-deleted, and that’s after sinking a good 19 hours into the game. Each time a character has died however, I’ve usually found myself instantly firing up a new game, stubbornly adamant that I’ll get further this time or with a different class (I say “instantly”, there’s always that brief period of time spent just staring at the screen after a death thinking “Shiiiit! I knew I should have been more careful….Shiiiiiiiit!”).Classes, game modes and special perks can be earned and unlocked for current and future playthroughs by completing quests or accessing certain areas, helping keep your interest in the game after a heavy loss.All in all, totally worth £6 I’d say, provided you’re prepared from some serious jimmy rustling somewhere down the line (to the likes Dark Souls has never seen)!

												This game, much like the roguelike ADOM, is a story driven game with setpiece and semi-random zones.  If you have played roguelikes in the past, dont let the trailers give you the wrong impression of its interface or themes.  The game is actually quite good.A few technical details first.  The game is available for free on the creator's website.  Buying the game on steam unlocks some donator benefits such as a specific dotator only character class and item transfer between characters.  The game also has its own login, this is to use the site's statistics tracking features, cloud saves (IIRC), and also lets you access an official IRC channel from within the game client itself.  You do not need to login to play the game.  The game performs very well, no complaints.  The game has a great deal of accessibility features, such as a very functional tileset, mouse controls, hud rescaling, and some automation as well.  Overall, very accessible.In terms of game design, I have a few things to comment on.  I very much enjoy roguelikes that have a storyline element such as this one, because it gives a good element of cohesion to the game with goals and progression.  This one actually has a number of class or race specific scenarios that help add to this as well.The game's skill progression system is skill-tree based, with each class having at least two different themed trees with several branches along with more generic ones to give you a few options on how you want to play your character.  For example, a necromancer might have both minion summoning and debuff curses with two trees each to pick between.  Many skills intuitively synergize or benefit each other, and the play also has the ability to acquire out-of-class skills a few times per game for even more flexibility.  The last few skill points can be unspent while in towns if you dislike a recent skill choice, and skills also show the effect of adding an additional skillpoint before you spend them, as well as what character stats influence the variables of those skills.  I find this skill tree system more accesible than a train/abuse stat system present in many other roguelikes, and while the transparency is not perfect it is VERY welcome.The game's combat, as in all perma-death roguelikes, is focused on limiting situations in which you experience risk.  As in all roguelikes this means things like bottlenecking enemies into more controlled environments and crown control, but more notably lies in escape skills for this game.  Being able to leave a situation you will not be able to survive is very crucial in this game, as you almost always cannot simly heal through or face-tank some enemies.  You will be fighting a lot of enemies in this game and the game is quite long, but the game gives you both difficulty and permadeath options so that you may play the game in a method that you enjoy.  The default setting for permadeath gives you a number of lives, and you can accrue a limited number of additional lives at certain milestones in the game, thus letting you maintain risk without letting a single careless mistake end a heavy investment of game hours.The game's replayability more or less lies in two things.  First, many zones have an alternate version of their randomly maps which have varied enemies and difficulty from their originals.  These can be surprising to discover after your first playthrough.  The second is in trying out different race / class combinations, of which there are quite a few with a good variety of options.There's quite a bit I could talk about, but more or less I'd reccomend this game.  It can be a pretty heavy time investment, as most traditional-style roguelikes can be, but its a pretty darn good one for a modern era!			"

												If you're into this kind of game, trust me when I say its everything and more. It IS complicated, but very in depth and fun.The latest update did a lot to polish the more advanced deeper aspects of the game, and reworked the two classes that were not really that good, thus any character is pretty playable now.Right now it's on sale for 1.75 and youd be a fool not to jump in now.The Developer is ACTIVE and has been for years, he activly listens and helps the community and patches the game as well as releases expansion packs very often. At the moment of this review I do not own the expansion packs because I am not far enough to need them but i'm actually picking them up right now (because of the sale).			"

There is no grinding and each location has its own flavour and story. Also the game is very replayable and by solving quests you can unlock extra races, classes or features which you can use in other games.In contrast with other roguelikes I've played, this one provides surprisingly good graphics and controls.The game is continuously updated, each update bringing new content.  A must buy for any roguelike fan.P.S. It reminded me of Valhalla, an old DOS game I used to play. Perhaps alchemy could be included in a future release.			"

												I still have fond memories of Omega and Nethack and Moria and Angband and Cthangband and Pangband. And this one is better than all of them.Plus there's music and sprites (if you want them) and achievements and randomish online events and unlockable races and classes to give it a sense of progression.I can't say enough how great this thing is.

												I think its one of the best RPG games I ever played. The character class/race gives unique strategy, development + within you have to specialize. One of actually two games, where I wrote some reverse engineering statistical analysis program to help me with decisions, based on factors I choose to optimize gameplay. Great replay value. PC + keyboard is a way for demanding entertainment! Plus the thing I like the best, first 5-10 characters die before you reach lvl 20, next die before lvl 30, eventhough its single player you really go through learning curve to beat/discover the game mechanics, which are really balanced.

												In my opinion it's the best rouge-like ever. 1) It doesn't look as bad as you think it would do, altough there is an ASCII mode of graphics.2) It can be run on anything, even on toasters and concrete blocks. 3) It has a huge selection and variety of classes and races to choose from.4) The looting system and the inventory system are well done and it feels good to loot stuff. 5) It has a nice learning curve, not a cliff as it is in most of the rouge-like games.And the list goes on and on. I could write a whole essay why this game is a masterpiece, but I won't since I don't want to spoil the fun. You should definitely buy it.			"

												A wonderful roguelike! The food clock and challenge of identifying potions and scrolls has been replaced with a focus on tactical combat and powers triggered by a hot bar on the bottom of the screen. The game forces you to get into tough battles and have to really think about your actions to progress.The classes (there are plenty of them) are a varied and interesting. The skill trees are intricate and forgiving by allowing you to respec the most recent points spent. There seem to be a good variety of builds of each type of class.So far I've only made it to the mid-game with one of the fighter/mage hybrids. I was sent on quests, entered a handful of dungeons and had a really good time.So far, as of December 2013, this is by far the best roguelike available on Steam. The only games for me that come close to this are NetHack, ADOM (coming to Steam soon) and Brogue (free). A big thumbs up. "

Unlike others, this one will allow you to change the difficulty level during character creation, so both new players and veterans won't feel forced to choose one or the other. This game also features a great deal of races and classes, most of which you have to unlock through gameplay, increasing greatly its replayability. The best thing about this roguelike, without a doubt is the lore, as it is really rich in detail and quite interesting.Fans of roguelikes, buy this game, you won't regret it.			"

												Interesting and engaging story, Gripping roguelike action, where you always feel like you're invincible, but there's a voice in the back of your head reminding you that you thought that every other time and at any moment you're about to die if you're not prepared for everything. The story sequences don't vary that much between playthroughs, but the random encounters are just as big a part of the world and insist on keeping it interesting and keeping you on your toes.The game is one of the major roguelikes, with a pedigree going all the way back to the beginning of the genre. It's also the flagship of the T-Engine4 and part of an ongoing modding scene.ToME is available online for free, but I've reviewed it irrespective of its price.

												One of the best rogue-likes out there.  The use of a reliable overworld/quest/progression structure keeps the game more engaging and varied than most, and the fact that most character options are unlocked in a cool way keeps me coming back.  Years of experimentation with game mechanics, item generation, and in-game lore has made a really unique world that streamlines a bunch of the more stressful elements of roguelikes (one-use items, for example) into more fun and friendly systems.I still have never made it more than halfway through the campaign before using up all my extra lives.

												Thoroughly enjoying this game so far. First off, if you don't want to pay for it you can download the free, fully-featured version directly from their site te4.org (it's not F2P, it's open-source). Basically the game is like Nethack - a ton of randomly generated dungeons and artifacts, with a more complex battle system and better graphics. If you're not into the graphics you can opt for ascii graphics, as I have in past games.It has in-game chat (so you are instantly linked with everyone else who is playing the game at that moment), an active community, and it is constantly being updated and improved. Try it so we can share stories and advise each other on how to get out of jams! It's turn based so you can pick it up and set it down anytime you want.			"

At the moment of this review I do not own the expansion packs because I am not far enough to need them but i'm actually picking them up right now (because of the sale).			"

There is no grinding and each location has its own flavour and story. Also the game is very replayable and by solving quests you can unlock extra races, classes or features which you can use in other games.In contrast with other roguelikes I've played, this one provides surprisingly good graphics and controls.The game is continuously updated, each update bringing new content.  A must buy for any roguelike fan.P.S. It reminded me of Valhalla, an old DOS game I used to play. Perhaps alchemy could be included in a future release.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is an extremely difficult, yet rewarding roguelike. It doesn't matter if you're only a few minutes in, or a few hours in--one misplaced attack or brash move can mean the end of your character, I constantly find myself back at the character creation screen, rolling a new character to try and see how far I can get... it's pretty difficult if you don't understand the mechanics of turn-based roguelikes (I'm fairly new to the genre). What draws me most to this game, honestly, is the depth of customization. Insane amounts of gear, unique skill trees to each talent archetype [20+ different categories (each 5 deep)], and the ultimate consequence of perma-death keep me playing this game. While I'm not really a fan of lore, I can definitely appreciate how much effort the developers put into creating a real atmosphere and background for the game. The tone, to me, is dark, dank... dramatic, and dire; just reading the class descriptions gives one a real sense of purpose for each character. If you're reading this during the weekend deal of March, 2013 - get this game. Even if not, $6.99 is a steal regardless, provided you're a fan of this genre. If you're the action-y type, this game probably isn't for you. If you're a tactician, and like having total control over damn-near every aspect of your character and his fate, then ToME is for you.

												Ah, an old favorite of mine. It's good that it's finally come to Steam. The easiest way to describe Tales of Maj'Eyal would be to say that it's a roguelike in the classical sense done right, but for every feature that serves only as a refinement of the genre, there are twenty genuinely original ideas that help this game become so much more than meets the eye. Like any game in the genre, you won't enjoy it at first. It'll phase between confusing and boring for a while, but when you get the hang of it and things pick up, you'll forget there ever was a world outside of Maj'Eyal.			"

												This is a great roguelike. It is more accessible to inexperienced players than most roguelikes. It has several difficulty settings, and characters can gain extra lives as they gain experience. In addition, you can always reallocate the last four talent points you have spent. As a result, players can be successful by experimenting in-game rather than finding the optimal build online. That's not to say the game is not difficult. Expect to die many times before winning. However, there are so many races and classes to try that the game never feels stale. Tired of going toe-to-toe with swarms of monsters as a sword-and-shield wielding Bulwark? Try altering the flow of time as a Paradox mage. A large number of classes, races, and talent categories are available to be unlocked as you play as well. Your character sheets will be uploaded to te4.org if you are logged in in-game, and you can search the repository for other players' characters. This is a great way to get some idea of how to play a class well if you don't want to go in completely blind.Classes aren't particularly well-balanced, but you can be successful with any of them with enough experience playing. The difficulty can also feel a rather inconsistent throughout the game. Most enemies will be trivial to defeat, but then you might be rapidly taken down by a rare monster in a couple turns. Despite some short-comings, this is still an excellent game. If you're not convinced it is worth buying on Steam, it is available for free from the developer's web site minus some donator benefits and the convenience of being on Steam. The game is actively being worked on; I can't wait to see what new features and abilities are introduced in the future.			"

												This game is a roguelike with a modern UI (ascii tileset available if you prefer) that gets rid of all the annoying aspects of roguelikes and leaves you free to do your best until you die or beat the game (though as of this review I have not beaten it so I don't know if gameplay ends or continues at that point).  Some examples of things that have been annoying, but in this game are not: you can 'auto-explore' to make sure you haven't missed anything on a floor of a dungeon.   You can also use auto-explore to go from floor entrance to floor exit and vice-versa when navigating any floors you might have already cleared.  It can be played entirely using just the mouse (keystrokes are still available for most actions and mapped to keys by default but you can remap it all to whatever you want if you like).  You also unlock items that make inventory management easier, which you then will start with from 'birth' on future playthroughs once acquired (example: an item that you get early on during first playthrough which automatically picks up items in any tile that you run over, and anything auto picked up like this isn't counted against your weight allowance; you can take any item out and keep it in regular inventory)  You can use a ""tag"" feature to flag any item with whatever keyword(s) you type in, and the game will not sell/drop the item.  There are no cursed items.  All items are automatically identified once picked up.  You can ""sell"" items anywhere/anytime due to item spoken of above so ""town runs"" are not necessary for inventory management purposes.  There are HELPFUL tooltips for everything that you hover the mouse over.There is a very well-done tutorial (accessible during character creation) which explains most aspects of the games' combat/magic system.  There is still a lot of detail left for you to explore/examine/ignore at your leisure/peril, but you're given a good gameplay explanation via the tutorial.  I feel it is worth mentioning and applauding, because unlike other roguelikes I could just start this one up and with the exception of 'dungeon order' (see end of review) I have not felt the need to seek help about gameplay from the internet yet.You start the game with a couple of race choices, and a few more class choices (rough mix of melee and magic).  Through gameplay you unlock additional races and classes to choose from in future games.    There is a very high variety of loot, that can give you bonus abilities that are activatable or are used when you hit an enemy, or when you land a critical hit on an enemy (and even more than that that I haven't used yet, I've mostly played the 'melee' side of class choices).   You get various ability/skill points per level to assign to 'class' and 'general' skill trees, and a couple stat points per level to assign to your stats like strength, willpower, magic, constitution, cunning, dexterity as well.   Abilties in the skill trees have level and skill point requirements before they can be used, but if you are the min/max type, what is unlocked/available to put points into depends on your stat points from base points and equipment modifies ""at the time you kill the enemy that levels you up"".  This means you can plan ahead and stack your strength skill at level up time by wearing a bunch of equipment with +str on it, if you are playing a mage class but want to put points into a strength ability without sacrificing permanent points, to a degree.Dungeons don't respawn; therefore, ""grinding"" isn't a gameplay consideration.  Dungeons are randomized in layout/monster placement but the monster types within each dungeon are the same every playthrough.  The world map/overview seems to be the same each playthrough but it's a small part of the overall gameplay and after a few playthroughs it's nice to know where the dungeons are each time.Overall this is a very fun roguelike game that has great replay value due to skill/class/race combinations and the enormous variety of loot drops.  I've added some gameplay tips for dungeon order if you buy or are playing the game, below (credit not mine).---Based on the suggestion of someone else I've done the dungeons (after the tutorial and starting racial area dungeon) in roughly this order:Trollmire 1-3, 4 if you are feeling strong for the final troll bossNorgos, then Trollmire 4 if not done yetHeart of the GloomKor'pulArenaScintillating CavesRhalorenLumberjack VillageAssassin LordMazeSandworm LairRuined Dungeon/Golem GraveyardOld Forest + NurDaikaraUrkisDreadfell			"

												This is what happens when you take roguelikes and add some modern UI conveniences, difficulty levels, and an option for a forgiving variety of permadeath. You can get it for free online, but I recommend picking it up on Steam because frankly it's worth more than 7 bucks.			"

												I think its one of the best RPG games I ever played. The character class/race gives unique strategy, development + within you have to specialize. One of actually two games, where I wrote some reverse engineering statistical analysis program to help me with decisions, based on factors I choose to optimize gameplay. Great replay value. PC + keyboard is a way for demanding entertainment! Plus the thing I like the best, first 5-10 characters die before you reach lvl 20, next die before lvl 30, eventhough its single player you really go through learning curve to beat/discover the game mechanics, which are really balanced.

												ToME is what roguelikes should aspire to be. It's enormously complete, with tons of content, creative and an absolute bundle of fun. Although the graphics may seem primitive, the enormous, randomly generated gameworld and quests are easily going to give you a run for your money. The progression system is fair, and allows you to learn the game before giving you access to more complex, tactically challenging classes. Easily one of my favorite releases this year.			"

I was never any good considering the nature of roguelikes and their notorious difficulty but I did manage to get lucky and get to a point where I could access previous ""lives"" equipment and such. Overall, if you either want to see what a good roguelike is or are new to the genre; get this game immediately! You won't regret it.Also, I'm not sure how much longer the release sale will be but even then, it's still worth the price of admission!President Skroob - Leader of Spaceballs			"

ToME is deep and completely packed with content, and without some of the typical roguelike mechanics such as hunger, has a much more fast paced and exciting form of tactical gameplay. I've probably logged hundreds of hours into this game over the past two years or so; at the price requested, it's a steal.			"

												Take a roguelike and a modern game, put them together in a blender, and what do you get? ToME: Classic turn-based fantasy mixed with modern features such as highly impressive graphical effects, achievements, content unlocking, etc.While it doesn't go beyond the usual set of boring fantasy races, it DOES have a massive selection of classes that act in extremely different ways to each other. Even the default fighter (called a Bulwark) isn't even close to the usual ""bump until it dies"" fighter of other roguelikes.Even if you're new to the genre, ToME can be a good way to get yourself in with optional lower difficulties. If you're an old hand, the variety of classes and the optional higher difficulties can still give you a challenge.Even though the game is free on te4.org, $8 is a complete steal for a game with this much replay value.

Gameplay is quite deep, with each class enjoying different styles and tactics, as well as the flexibility for various builds and playstyles within a given class.  The classes themselves are unique, and all in all ToME gives a unique RPG experience that's reminiscent of rogue-likes but with a breadth and depth all its own and quite unlike anything else I've come across in the genre.

Don't Judge Books by their Covers!I'll admit, I picked this game up for cheap and didn't expect much from it. It looked like an unpromising Indy game with little to offer in the gaming world of high end graphics and twitchy shooters.  What I got was an amazing game that includes a great amount of depth, customization, unlockable, and difficulty. I have played for a decent amount of time now, and I have only ever gotten to level 11. Expect to die a lot, far more than in most standard games today. The game is at no lack of classic rouge like difficulty, although for people who aren’t out to become a professional masochist there are settings to allow a small amount of re-spawns or unlimited re-spawns. But I stand by the notion that the way to play this game is 1 and done. Might be Unsuitable for SomeBe warned that the game won't be fun for some people. If you dislike games like D&D or RPGS with lots of stats, percent’s, and numbers in general, then this game might not be for you. Also, if you like graphics prepare to be disappointed, this game severely lacks in the visual area, but is stylized enough that it doesn't strain the eyes like other games. In Total This game is great, but maybe not for full price, if you have the money to pay full price for this game you might be better off somewhere else like FTL. But on sale this game is a steal and one I’m glad I bought. Definitely a game I will continue to play long after AAA games lose their shine.			"

												Enjoy it on the whole, but it can be punishing to new players.  The major hole is information about where to quest/level after you leave the starter dungeon. There's very little guidance in game, and online guides seem to be somewhat unreliable.Using one guide, I cleared the Maze fairly easily, then entered the Old Forest which the guide rated as easier and got smoked twice, including by a boss 8-10 levels higher than what the guide suggested it would be and my own level.  Escort quests are also highly influenced by RNG, which given the value of the rewards means there's a huge difference in outcome depending significantly on luck. "

This game is one of the most addictive things ive ever played.I find myself constantly restarting saying things like ""this time... this time ill put some points into stealth and take that troll by suprise"" or ""maybe ill try that cursed character again"".It helps that it has a simmilar look and feel to the Spiderweb Software games which i adore to no end.This is the kind of game you can sink as much time as you please into and feel equally rewarded either way, wether it's 5 minutes or 5 hours it's a load of fun every time. With the addition of the modding community this game is potentially endless.Also finally a game that has meaningful acheivments, almost all of the acheivments in the game will unlock something new for you to play with.(Dont forget to chuckle when you see someone die at level 1 to a worm mass).

It seems if you like hard or easy rpg games, this game accomadates you easily.The further you achieve with a character before it dies, will unlock further stuff for your next character. For instance: I killed a certain boss character, and it gave me a transmorgrification box for the rest of my plays. Another example is that when I reached level 10 (i think), it unlocked a new character class for my next characters.It had me playing for hours, and still wanting to come back and play some more.

												It's a weird combination of Roguelike and Diablo. Rather than running around an endless dungeon with a handful of different branches, this one is mostly made up of dozens of shallow branches to keep things fresh. The game doesn't have as much as other roguelikes in terms of procedurally generated levels and interesting archetexture, but the classes and races are considerably more diverse in their playstyles. As long as DCSS keeps removing the fun from their own game, this one is probably the best roguelike on the market right now that isn't dead development wise. Also download it for free on their site. The pricetag here is pretty much considered a donation. 85-90% of the game is free to everyone, donators and buyers just get a little more icing for their cake.			"

												This game is incredibly well done. There are few things to complain about although I will adress them. The art style is easy to hate. I cannot come to enjoy it. The music is also usually quite bland throughout the game so far. The sound effects in addition are generally annoying. Te game however is very in depth as far as classes and races etc. The varied types of charactors you can make have a large spectrum. However I would like to see a further increase to charactor lore. Perhaps a combination of Elder scrolls daggerfalls history your charactor recieves with a bit of wizardry 8s charactor system. It should be noted that this game is certainly not for everyone. The niche people that it attracts however will find it extremly entertaining.			"

Another zone!I've been playing this game since before it was released on Steam and can only say it's been getting better and better.A definite recommendation for people who like:- Mountains of loot.- A (potentially) steep learning curve, depending partly on your race/class/skill choices and partly on the randomized foes which the game throws your way.- Random events on certain holidays or just... random events really.- Developer interaction. As stated by some of the other helpfull comments, DarkGod tends to hang out in the global chat from time to time. He also may or may not press his 'SURPRISE' button and spawn a heap of difficult monsters on your path.- Experimentation. There are many ways in which you can tackle this game and the workshop contains even more classes/races. Some mods might not be on the workshop (yet) but can be found on the TOME4 website.			"

												Very fun game. I'm hooked on it. It shows that designing a good RPG shouldn't require a huge studio with tons of money. This game may not be fancy or breathtaking graphically but it nails the lements which are important to me in a good RPG. Namely very deep character customization and an interesting world. I've never been a big fan of permadeath in games but I'm trying to embrace it here. It really adds something to a game like this when one mistake could kill your character and make you start over and the difficulty is such that dying is usually the result of making an identifiable mistake or going into a dungeon underleveled. Of course there are optioons to play it with many lives but I strongly recommend giving the roguelike mode a try.Over-all this game is one of the best I've played in a while. Very addictive and great value for the few dollars I paid. "

												This game is extraordinarily addictive and well-made. It is a Roguelike, and as such revels in procedural generation, a difficulty curve with occasionally brutal unfairness, and permadeath (which is optional but encouraged). There are a huge number of unique classes that all feel different and special. Each subclass has access to an enourmous unique pool of skill branches and very few branches seem useless.If you can enjoy the roguelike flavor at all, you can love this game. This game is going to be a favorite of mine for a long time.			"

												Must... put.... down... mouse... long enough to sleep, eat.This is by far one of the most addictiove games I have played in a log time. And it's hard, very hard.Okay, so its a roguelike. But it has options to make it less unforgiving, up to a mode where you can just play en die and respawn untill you have enough. So, the casual player is catered to. Then there's a mode where you have limited lives - you can respawn, but only a few times. And of course the real roguelike - one life. Die, you're out of luck.It's huge. I have been playing for hours and hours and so far have only made it to the 'second half' of the game twice. I am estimating that running a single game end-to-end will take you at least 4-6 hours. Though, I moght be a slowpoke - perhaps better, more experienced players can do it in a few hours less.It's got possibilities. Like, there are so many ways to develop a character. So far I have been fiddling around with one class to see what get's me farther and farther into the game and that is working. You play, you die. Think, why did I die? Adapt in the next character.It has a very smart way of lulling you into a false sense of security by allowing you to kill most critters on your path, then hit you from behind with some nasty rare radom boss.There is mods out the various orifices too - enou8gh to adapt is to a format you like better.Oh, I'd also like to add that there is a massive fanbase on the formums where the (I do believe it's one guy?) developer DarkGod hangs out too - and he actually posts, listens and helps out when you are in trouble.Trust me - if you are into roguelikes or like fiddling around for aeons with character builds, this is something you want.If you are not the masochistic type, it has ways of lettign you in gently and be much more forgiving.

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a great roguelike.  I've been playing TOME since it was created (The original free version) and following DarkGod and his work, TOME has evolved into a very beginner friendly game, allowing for the hardcore player to build a character using 'roguelike' mode, or allowing beginners to use exploration or adventure mode to give unlimited lives, or a set number of lives per run.  This gives the player more flexibility to play the game how they want to play it and experience the lore.  The game starts you off with a modest number of Race/Class combos and you can unlock more as you progress by completing dungeons and quests.  I'd recommend this game for anyone that is not phased by turn-based tactical gameplay.			"

												Damn this game, damn it.Stop concentrating for a moment and you're dead.Get cocky, you're dead.Err slightly, you're dead.One step too far, you're dead :).Yes, the game is punishing, but that makes the rewards all the richer.Personally i'd put gameplay above graphics 100% of the time and this game fits that bill for sure, but don't be fooled into thinking that only adequate graphics means poor gameplay. In this case, it does not. Far from it. You really really have to think about how/where to progress otherwise that bright light at the end of the tunnel races forward and envelops you. Again :).The only tip i'd give to people is to check, upon entering a certain area, what your charactor thinks about it before going even one step further. If your charactor is crapping his/her self then leave! You get a one-liner when you enter that tells you.I've played quite a few hours offline and keep coming back for more.Oh, and it'll probably run on that old windows95 era hardware you've got in the loft :).Have fun and expect your swearing vocabulary to increase drastically!

												One of those games that proves the case that graphics are but a small part of what makes a game good. This game looks like cardboard cut-out game pieces laid on a game board, it's not that pretty but it makes up for it in oh-so good gameplay, character developement & I even enjoy the music (which I usually pay no attention to at all). I haven't played too much of the game yet but I was surprised with over 1300 achievements in this game, I figured I'd be unlocking them left and right. Unfortunately, I've only unlocked 3 thus far, not really ego boosting but an interesting fact. The game took me a few play throughs (it's rouge-like, meaning you will likely die...a lot) to get the mechanics down. My first character was a Dwarf Bulwark Warrior (sword + board style) I didn't last very long, had no idea how and/or when to use my abilities, how to acquire new items, but as I played more, it came piece by piece. I'm sure I still have many things to learn, but I look forward to my time doing it because this game is quite enjoyable. It's not an expensive game and it's really worth a look if you enjoy creating characters, trying new things and exploring.			"

												I'm in a love/hate relationship with this game. I suppose that's the mark of an excellently crafted roguelike. Often when I die I'll want to exclaim how that was such bull puckey, that the game is unbalanced and it was totally unfair. That there wasn't any lesson I could have learned from dying that way. Yet somehow, I find I'm slowly getting an intuition about how to play the game. I play so that each time, I can get just a little bit further. That's the thing about roguelikes. They aren't about learning to play the game, and then playing it. You can't be said to know how to play the game until you've won.For a game I've never gotten past the first third despite having played it for over 70 hours, I can't really claim that the sameyness keeps me from playing. I don't feel stuck or feel the need to consult strategy guides; the process of learning in ToME is rewarding. It'd be awesome if levels had more variety and the worldmap was randomized, but I don't think that would make it more replayable.			"

If you don't mind all of the above, then it's pretty nice game you can enjoy.			"

												(Ignore my playtime, I'd estimate I have at least 400 hours on the non-steam version)One of the best combat-focused RPGs ever. Actually it's more of a roguelike, but it has a story and some other more RPGish elements. Also some rudimentary but fitting graphics (not ASCII). I've yet to make it past level 35 (normally you'll end up 45-50 to finish, though I've never seen the ending) It's very challenging, but very fair and very intuitive too. It has a great tutorial that explains the fairly complex gameplay well, and has tooltips for practically everything, and just a great interface all around. Frankly it has one of the best interfaces I've seen in any game. It also has a built in chat in-game which is helpful so you can ask questions without having to go to the forums. Players ask questions and share item finds through a link system but the game also automatically posts a global message whenever someone dies or reaches one of the main quest goals. It's a nice touch that lets you feel like you're part of a community as you play alone (this is SP only). It's very active too - this game has really grown in popularity since its Steam release.It's hard to explain why Tome4 is so fun, but it's a combination of really satisfying turn based combat, ""loot drop"", and an enormous variety of monsters to slay, weapons to find, and classes, skills and spells to choose from. Combine that with permadeath (though the ""standard"" mode gives you about 7 lives over 50 levels spread out, even with that though you're unlikely to make it out of even the beginning dungeons your first few outings) which I think makes any gaming experience much more edge-of-your seat and it's just one of the best games I've ever played. The class design is really one of the high points though. ""Solipsists"" that can invade an enemy's dreams and attack their mind directly (basically it throws you into a battle in said enemy's subconscious), chronomancers that can manipulate the flow of time (among other things you can split a time thread and then choose what result you want after playing each thread separately), shadow blades that can phase through walls and animate their own shadows to do their killing for them. A lot of very creative stuff. At time of this review there are 32 classes in the default, un-modded game. Yes, you read that right.There's also a total absence of grinding and potion hoarding and the atmosphere is well done with lots of interesting, well written lore tidbits lying around that you can find. If you enjoy tactical turn based games or RPGs, or just something that's really difficult it's definitely worth at least checking out.Worth mentioning too that the one man dev team is a fanatic who releases game updates constantly. The community as a whole is probably one the nicest and most helpful I've seen. "

You will probably die several times still on lvl 1 at the begining as you learn the game and even when you think you mastered it, getting to lvl 20 or more will be a challenge (lvl cap is 50). That´s on normal difficulty!Good luck trying to survive on this. My advice is: do always have a way out/to escape from the mobs. One of them will always get to hit u on ur weak spot (for every build u make) and if u are not well prepared to atk on its weak spot, u´ll have to run!!! RUN FORREST!!!  "

												It's a weird combination of Roguelike and Diablo. Rather than running around an endless dungeon with a handful of different branches, this one is mostly made up of dozens of shallow branches to keep things fresh. The game doesn't have as much as other roguelikes in terms of procedurally generated levels and interesting archetexture, but the classes and races are considerably more diverse in their playstyles. As long as DCSS keeps removing the fun from their own game, this one is probably the best roguelike on the market right now that isn't dead development wise. Also download it for free on their site. The pricetag here is pretty much considered a donation. 85-90% of the game is free to everyone, donators and buyers just get a little more icing for their cake.			"

There's a huge amount of classes and 7 races to choose from and each of the classes has several playstyles depending on what skills you learn, your equipment and your race. Get this game if you like DCSS, Elona, Dungeons of Dredmor or Sword Of The Stars.			"

												After making a powerful Psionic Dwarf, I journeyed into the high mountains, slaughtering an entire tribe of storm giants along the way. Upon finding the Giants' cheiftan, we clashed in a massive struggle, neither gaining much advantage. Frozen, battered, bloody, and desparate to end it, I delivered a final headbutt (thanks to my iron helm) to the Giant and cracked his skull, killing him instantly. On the next turn, a huge boulder hurtled at me from behind an outcropping, flung by a survivor of the battle. I died on the spot, surrounded by a dead tribe of the slain.11/10 - A GLORIOUS end to a heroic tale. Would gladly do it again and again.BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This Fracking game is infuriating.  I was all for the old throwback style.  The first game i ever played was Castle of the Winds on DoS.  The gameplay in this game is pretty much the same.  It is super fun and really interesting to try out the different classes.  I would say this game is not for everone though.  You only have so many lives before you get to trash your toon and start over from scratch.  I haven't been able to make it past lvl 15 without final dying and quitting.  There is an option to play with unlimited lives but you don't unlock classes or get achievments, so whats the point really?  I would be all for this game if it just game more lives or made things slightly easier.			"

												This game is all the best parts of turn-based RPGs mixed with the nostalgia of the old sprite-based top-down roguelikes of old. I have been playing it pretty constantly for a couple days. It trends towards the hard side of difficulty (even on Normal) but it only serves to encourage me to try more stuff like the classes and class abilities you unlock for later characters.Simply put, this will occupy my time for the foreseeable future!

												Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is a roguelike game that has been around in various forms for several years but until the more recent versions might have been a little too oldschool style for many modern gamers. I'm going to try to be unbiased in reviewing this game but it might be tough since I started playing when it was called Pernband.Graphics: 3/5 The tiles in this game are very well done and for the most part, everything is pretty easy to identify. In some areas it may be hard to see a monster next to an obstacle but this may be by design. It also has ASCII mode for old school roguelike nerds like myself.Sound: 3/5 Not horrible but not great. The music mostly fits the areas but some of the sound effects just sound wrong to me.Difficulty: 5/5 Like most roguelikes, this game is not supposed to be easy. ToME does have adjustable difficulty levels to appeal to a broader audience. You can start with a set number of lives or go typical roguelike style permadeath. You can adjust your experience from casual gaming to pulling your hair out.Gameplay 5/5: ToME is different than most roguelikes in that it has a somewhat open and explorable world as opposed to a single dungeon and maybe a town. The player starts in an area that depends on the characters race. These areas range from simple to brutal. The story is decent and there are plenty of other quests to occupy your time. This game is controlled by keyboard and/or mouse. This makes it easy for an experienced RL player or a novice to jump right in after the brief tutorial. The level generation is done well enough to make each playthrough feel unique and the battles require just the right amount of strategy to keep the game interesting. There are various unlocks that range from things you will do in a normal game to tedious quests.Overall: 4/5 If you are an oldschool rogueliker, then you are probably already familiar with some version of ToME. If you are newer to the genre and want to play a difficult dungeon crawler with some exploration then this game is worth looking at. "

												This game is weird, a good weird, the sort where you can call on aid from a future version of yourself, and where the demons have a space platform in orbit over the world. And that's just scratching the surface, there are a ton of different classes that can each play in very different ways, from killing people with the power of hatred to triple weilding swords by holding the third with your mind, to a summoner who can generate energy swords, and so on. My only real complaint with the game is that I haven't had time to play more of it.			"

												I like my RPGs like I like my coffee. Nice and deep, complex, with many different options with which to slay my enemies in any singular class, wait, what was I talking about again?Tales of Maj'Eyal encompasses everything I love about roguelikes, everything I like about MMOs, and everything I LOVE about RPGs.It has the typical roguelike grid-locked movement and combat system, plus projectiles have a fly speed, which means that you can dodge projectiles by sidestepping if they're slow enough that you can catch them midair. Every being has a global speed rating, too, so a slow mage with 75% global speed will often be double-turn-ed on by enemies often and won't be able to dodge many projectiles, whereas a rogue with 127% global speed will often be able to act twice in a ""turn"" and sidestep most projectiles! The speed system really does make such a big difference. Additionally, just like in roguelikes, if your character bites the dust they're gone... However unlike roguelikes you have three difficulty settings: Roguelike, Adventure and ...Endless, I believe? Whatever, the point is... Roguelike is roguelike: If your character dies, they kick the bucket for good. In Endless, you get to ressurrect every single time. However, Adventure is interesting. In Adventure, you work through lives--as you level and achieve things, you gain extra lives... but they're finite. So once you kick the bucket, the nameless cosmic tentacle-entity that keeps reviving you like a dunce for somehow loses interest and lets you fall into the void.It borrows a few cool mechanics from MMOs too, namely the randomized loot system and many skill trees. Unlike MMOs, however, it ops for having many, MANY skill trees that are 100% linear with four steps, divided into two categories: Class trees, and Generic trees. Class trees are native to your class--a Rogue gets Trapitude, an Alchemist gets Golemancy, so on, so forth. Generic trees, on the other hand, you qualify for; being a Cunning-based class with high Cunning gives you access to the Survival tree; being a Wilder grants you access to the Wild Gift tree, so on so forth. On levelups you gain a Class point and a Generic point, as well as several Stat Points and, on particular levels, Category points. A Category point lets you unlock locked skill trees, or upgrade the potency of one you already had! Like I said: Deep and complex. Like coffee, I suppose?And of course, from RPGs, it borrows the everything else. A vast world rich in story, with cool sidequests and enemy design and... this isn't RPG-native. what am i... i need to go sit down.yes cool story, cool sidequests, cool enemies, someone pass me the coffee, wait i dont even drink coffee(also, I recommend you grab the workshop addon Remove Class/Race Locks, which allows you to play as classes you've not unlocked yet... because the unlock restrictions are, quite frankly, ♥♥♥♥ing obtuse, and you get a piddly pool of races and classes to pick from otherwise)			"

												A very solid roguelike. It's been a staple of any roguelike fans for several years and is great to see it brought to Steam where it has really made the most of unlockable/achievements and workshop to make it even easier to get some of the many great mods for it.It has several notable changes from other roguelikes, foremost it's abilities system use a variety of different resources and are mostly about managing cooldowns. There's no health/mana pot chugging here which takes some of the tedium away from stacking potions to thinking about which abilities to use when. Also, the storyline and overworld is static, while individual level layout and most npcs are randomized. This has it's own plus and minuses. Each area has it's own lore and strategy which planning for is part of the game and you wouldn't be able to do as much for completely randomized dungeons. On the other hand, if you are like me and like to rush to your death and try as many classes as possible, replaying the same quests and areas can start getting a little boring. However the game has a lot of different content and several starting areas to help alleviate the tedium of replaying the same starting areas over and over for each character.Really a must have for any roguelike fan, it does a lot of the traditional elements very well while bringing a lot of unique flavor and strategy of its own.

												I'm in a love/hate relationship with this game. I suppose that's the mark of an excellently crafted roguelike. Often when I die I'll want to exclaim how that was such bull puckey, that the game is unbalanced and it was totally unfair. That there wasn't any lesson I could have learned from dying that way. Yet somehow, I find I'm slowly getting an intuition about how to play the game. I play so that each time, I can get just a little bit further. That's the thing about roguelikes. They aren't about learning to play the game, and then playing it. You can't be said to know how to play the game until you've won.For a game I've never gotten past the first third despite having played it for over 70 hours, I can't really claim that the sameyness keeps me from playing. I don't feel stuck or feel the need to consult strategy guides; the process of learning in ToME is rewarding. It'd be awesome if levels had more variety and the worldmap was randomized, but I don't think that would make it more replayable.			"

												I have played this game long before it came out on steam and it has only been improved with time.  The creator ""DarkGod"" is constantly fixing issues and adding content.  I have had to delete the game in order not to get wrapped up for hours at a time.  Just seeing the desktop icon is like a beacon heralding tales of past victories and unbelievable random situations that may never happen again on another playthrough.  This game is well-suited to first time roguelike players as well as posing a challenge for seasoned vets.Side note:  This game has been free for years through the developer's website and the option to donate was vailable.  This is one of those rare games where you WANT to donate to the creator because they deserve it and the game yields more hours of enjoyment than most.			"

It has a much more varied world, a very complex leveling and progression system, and a multitude of races and classes to play as. The best way I can describe this would be as a D&D Roguelike (though it isn't D&D, it has that insane level choices and progression). The game has been out for several years, though it is new to steam, and the Devs are still releasing free content updates to this day.

												Perfect mix of roguelike combat with RPG customization when it comes to items and skills. Each class has an origin story and you unlock further classes in the game as you encounter various events in the world. It's a bit different than traditional roguelikes as you're not descening one specific dungeon for a huge number of levels, but rather you play on an overworld map that has hundreds of different areas to explore.Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a turn-based experience custom-tailored to your preferences.

												(Ignore my playtime, I'd estimate I have at least 400 hours on the non-steam version)One of the best combat-focused RPGs ever. Actually it's more of a roguelike, but it has a story and some other more RPGish elements. Also some rudimentary but fitting graphics (not ASCII). I've yet to make it past level 35 (normally you'll end up 45-50 to finish, though I've never seen the ending) It's very challenging, but very fair and very intuitive too. It has a great tutorial that explains the fairly complex gameplay well, and has tooltips for practically everything, and just a great interface all around. Frankly it has one of the best interfaces I've seen in any game. It also has a built in chat in-game which is helpful so you can ask questions without having to go to the forums. Players ask questions and share item finds through a link system but the game also automatically posts a global message whenever someone dies or reaches one of the main quest goals. It's a nice touch that lets you feel like you're part of a community as you play alone (this is SP only). It's very active too - this game has really grown in popularity since its Steam release.It's hard to explain why Tome4 is so fun, but it's a combination of really satisfying turn based combat, ""loot drop"", and an enormous variety of monsters to slay, weapons to find, and classes, skills and spells to choose from. Combine that with permadeath (though the ""standard"" mode gives you about 7 lives over 50 levels spread out, even with that though you're unlikely to make it out of even the beginning dungeons your first few outings) which I think makes any gaming experience much more edge-of-your seat and it's just one of the best games I've ever played. The class design is really one of the high points though. ""Solipsists"" that can invade an enemy's dreams and attack their mind directly (basically it throws you into a battle in said enemy's subconscious), chronomancers that can manipulate the flow of time (among other things you can split a time thread and then choose what result you want after playing each thread separately), shadow blades that can phase through walls and animate their own shadows to do their killing for them. A lot of very creative stuff. At time of this review there are 32 classes in the default, un-modded game. Yes, you read that right.There's also a total absence of grinding and potion hoarding and the atmosphere is well done with lots of interesting, well written lore tidbits lying around that you can find. If you enjoy tactical turn based games or RPGs, or just something that's really difficult it's definitely worth at least checking out.Worth mentioning too that the one man dev team is a fanatic who releases game updates constantly. The community as a whole is probably one the nicest and most helpful I've seen. "

Although the graphics may seem primitive, the enormous, randomly generated gameworld and quests are easily going to give you a run for your money.

												The thing about this game, apart from the fact that it's awesome, is that it can appeal to any skill level and ease you into its depth, unlike many other rogue-likes out there.  Perhaps it's just me, but I barely had to look anything up.  Everything is well laid out and there are plenty of tool tips to explain everything.  The UI is fantastic and the game even runs on my netbook.  There are also difficulty settings to grant either permadeath or a more forgiving ""lives"" system that you gain extra lives as you level up, or even no death at all (but no achievements either).  Overall, I'm blown away so far and can easily see myself spending dozens if not hundreds of hours playing every single class... And the fact that you slowly unlock classes as you play is brilliant.  Now I know why this won rogue-like of the year a few times in a row.  Buy it because these games need the support!			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a fantastic roguelike. As a roguelike its simple to learn and also have complexity. A skill system akin to Diablo 2 allows unique character builds within classes. Skills have cooldowns, this works very well in the turn based structure especially combined with effects that effect cooldown time. Inventory management is simple to use and relatively limited item slots create thoughtful decisions. As a long term player of roguelikes I highly recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal to beginners and roguelike veterans alike.			"

												I love this game!  ToME is probably my most-played game of the last year or so, and for good reason.  It is challenging and rewards sound strategy.  The mythology is rich and ever-growing, and the community that has sprung up around the game is the sort of environment that fosters cooperation and creativity.  Thank you, DarkGod, for making this game so rewarding!			"

												Best Roguelike since Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.Stone Soup set the bar and Tales of Maj'Eyal has been the ONLY one to surpass it in my opinion.I am extremely impressed with the level of character customization. Most RPG's give you ""choice,"" but if you don't ""choose"" one of three builds, you die. In Maj'Eyal I feel like I can actually build a unique and powerful character.So yes, as someone who is very disappointed in the state of today's Roguelikes, I am happy to think of all the hours I'll be putting into this one.

												This game is all the best parts of turn-based RPGs mixed with the nostalgia of the old sprite-based top-down roguelikes of old. I have been playing it pretty constantly for a couple days. It trends towards the hard side of difficulty (even on Normal) but it only serves to encourage me to try more stuff like the classes and class abilities you unlock for later characters.Simply put, this will occupy my time for the foreseeable future!

												This Fracking game is infuriating.  I was all for the old throwback style.  The first game i ever played was Castle of the Winds on DoS.  The gameplay in this game is pretty much the same.  It is super fun and really interesting to try out the different classes.  I would say this game is not for everone though.  You only have so many lives before you get to trash your toon and start over from scratch.  I haven't been able to make it past lvl 15 without final dying and quitting.  There is an option to play with unlimited lives but you don't unlock classes or get achievments, so whats the point really?  I would be all for this game if it just game more lives or made things slightly easier.			"

												To get straight to the point, ToME is easily the best roguelike I've ever played. It has depth, variety, multiple difficulty settings, and has just the right balance between skill and luck. If you learn the game and know it well, you can handle even terrible situations with good play...but there's still never a time where you feel perfectly safe. This is still a roguelike after all, getting OHKOd from outside of your sight range by an overpowered rare monster is always on the table.Pros: Classes with unique and interesting skillsets. And a LOT of them.Interesting races, also with uniqueness.Large and skilled modding community, always writing new addons for the game.A dev that listens to feedback!Cons:This game is long, and you'll want to play it multiple times if you get into it. Huge timesink. No matter how many bugs DarkGod manages to get out of the code, there are always more. Some of them can end a run. "

												One of the classic rogue-like games. It did start as a mod of (Z)Angband and was called PernAngband first (after the Dragonriders of Pern novels) and later renamed into Troubles of Middle Earth (ToME). The code has since been rewritten completely and the game has grown and matured in that time.

												This game is extraordinarily addictive and well-made. It is a Roguelike, and as such revels in procedural generation, a difficulty curve with occasionally brutal unfairness, and permadeath (which is optional but encouraged). There are a huge number of unique classes that all feel different and special. Each subclass has access to an enourmous unique pool of skill branches and very few branches seem useless.If you can enjoy the roguelike flavor at all, you can love this game. This game is going to be a favorite of mine for a long time.			"

I have had to delete the game in order not to get wrapped up for hours at a time.  Just seeing the desktop icon is like a beacon heralding tales of past victories and unbelievable random situations that may never happen again on another playthrough.  This game is well-suited to first time roguelike players as well as posing a challenge for seasoned vets.Side note:  This game has been free for years through the developer's website and the option to donate was vailable.

												The single best paid roguelike I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It's incredibly addicting, it offers a variety of unlockable content (races, classes, sub-classes, skill trees, even questlines), it caters to different playing styles, it comes with a nice tileset (and the option to 'downgrade' the visuals to ascii), a great soundtrack, an overworld with towns and shops, an intriguing storyline and lore and full mouse support. The combat system is skill and cooldown based so it might even be appealing for RL beginners that played modern RPGs before. Keep in mind that you can download this game for free on the dev's website - although buying it on Steam will grant you all the bonuses that a voluntary donator would get.			"

												Verdict: Ok game, for what it tries to be.ToME is all about character-building and fantasy combat. It delivers well enough on the first account, with interesting choises and hard priorities. The combat soon becomes repetitive, but it's ok until it gets booring.ToME does not deliver an enganging story, personalities or anything of interest beyond combat and character-building. Nor does it attempt to.			"

												Absolutely great game, really brings alot to offer for a turn-based Rogue-like adventure.Several of my favorite features include the ability to unlock different races/classes, depth and diversity of artifacts, and the satisfaction of clearing another dungeon dispite the boss and other traps held in store. These make playthroughs similar enough to not have to read every ability twice before even starting the character, yet different enough that finding a new artifact that you never have seen before in 50+ playthoughs gives great joy.

												The only negative review for this game is get Dungeons Of Dredmore. A good choice for an alternate, I recommend you get that game also. I've been told this game is open source and you can get it for free also, but after playing it I would have just donated that amount anyway. This is a good solid game that looks like a mix between Ragnarok(also freeware but you might need dosbox to play) and Din's curse. This and ragnarok are two of the most true to form roguelikes I can think of as most have you go level to level with creatures at the same equivilent level to fight. in TOME you can blunder into a dungeon that is way to hard for your level or have just a random monster(s) in a vault that is way beyond your means. The only real complaint I might have at this point is sometime you can get killed by a creature offscreen and can do nothing about it(like Xcom). Of course I just take this as meaning I have to get better!! buy it and good luck, you'll need it!!!!			"

The difference between the free version on their website and steam is: Custom TilesA video being worth a thousands words, check it out there:Donators Custom TilesBasically this will allow you to choose a custom tile for all your characters, so much more fun! Also donator's characters with custom tiles will show up on the character's vault!Custom Tiles and Exploration ModeExploration mode is basically a game mode where you get an infinite number of lives, for those that want to see the story unfold faster.Items VaultFor each 2€ of donations you gain one slot in the online Items Vault. This allows a character to send items to the vault and an other one to grab it from there. This feature can be accessed through the Fortress ingame.Stone Warden classDonators get to enjoy a special class: Stone Wardens. Only dwarves can be Stone Wardens, they are a melee class that dual wields shields and is both proficient in arcane and nature. While most of the world thinks those two forces are opposite, the dwarves have found a way to merge them. "

												I can't recommend this game enough. If you have any interest at all in roguelikes or just RPG's, you must give it a try. The UI is excellent and easy to use, with a handy ingame chat. Graphics are simple but nice to look at, especially compared to other roguelikes. There is an insane amount of replay value here between the different races, classes, random loot and skills found in each playthrough, and most of all the different builds possible with each class. You unlock new classes and races by playing, as well as some other things that carry over to new characters, so even when you inevitably die you have something to show for it. The game is frequently updated with new content and features. The game is mostly free to play, but if you like it please give the devs some support by purchasing it.			"

It has a much more varied world, a very complex leveling and progression system, and a multitude of races and classes to play as. The best way I can describe this would be as a D&D Roguelike (though it isn't D&D, it has that insane level choices and progression). The game has been out for several years, though it is new to steam, and the Devs are still releasing free content updates to this day.

												A wonderful roguelike! The food clock and challenge of identifying potions and scrolls has been replaced with a focus on tactical combat and powers triggered by a hot bar on the bottom of the screen. The game forces you to get into tough battles and have to really think about your actions to progress.The classes (there are plenty of them) are a varied and interesting. The skill trees are intricate and forgiving by allowing you to respec the most recent points spent. There seem to be a good variety of builds of each type of class.So far I've only made it to the mid-game with one of the fighter/mage hybrids. I was sent on quests, entered a handful of dungeons and had a really good time.So far, as of December 2013, this is by far the best roguelike available on Steam. The only games for me that come close to this are NetHack, ADOM (coming to Steam soon) and Brogue (free). A big thumbs up. "

Unlike others, this one will allow you to change the difficulty level during character creation, so both new players and veterans won't feel forced to choose one or the other. This game also features a great deal of races and classes, most of which you have to unlock through gameplay, increasing greatly its replayability. The best thing about this roguelike, without a doubt is the lore, as it is really rich in detail and quite interesting.Fans of roguelikes, buy this game, you won't regret it.			"

												I reluctantly recommend this game due to its sheer addictiveness. I did not want to get addicted to it, but it sucks you in. One more character, one more level. It makes you want to understand it, to learn, to improve... and then you lose another character you've spent half a day on, and start a new one. I am not proud of the time I've been spending on this game, but it's like digital crack.			"

												I waited a while before reviewing this game. I didn't want the ""starting"" excitement to overwhelm me.After having played this game with several characters, I can say that every playthrough, I get more and more excited about this game. For me, this game is difficult and hardcore, I am not that experienced with rpg's but this game makes me want to be and every playthrough, I feel like I have learned new things.For the first time, I carefully think about choices I make, what should I level up, how should I handle this enemy. For the first time, I take my time for every turn (usually with this kind of games, I rush through my turns as if it was real-time). The game makes me want to use my skills and intelligence and for me, this is a first-timer.The funny thing is, I had this game marked as ""Not Interested"" originally, but came here by reading a review under another -not so good- game. That other game had much better graphics, but I don't care about graphics. On the other hand, because I had mostly been dissapointed by roguelikes with low-quality graphics (although TOME actually has relative good graphics for its genre) I had never looked at this game in detail. It was after that other review and seeing that people have actually spent a whole year in playtime on this game that I got interested.That's sad... because this game is REALLY worth it. And it certainly is worth the price. I bought it at -30% and now I feel like they could easily charge 3x the price (and even more) and it would still be worth it. This game needs a commercial boost :-)I am really enjoying this game, dying all the time and stuff like that. I prefer adventure-mode because I can die several times before it is game over, but I still don't want to die (like you could play through in exploration mode) so it still makes me try to play it roguelike (which is too hard for me at this time).I also like how this game builds up unlocks: especially for me, being not that experienced, I like that in the beginning not all character types can be played and must be unlocked. It makes me build up my knowledge about the game and probably only when I am ready to learn about new types of character, they will be unlocked.I wonder if I will stop buying other games on steam now for the next year because if I look at other people playing this game (2500 hours of playtime), it seems like I will never get bored with this game and will never need another game :-).I think I can safely say that this game is for all kinds of RPG players: the beginners and the very experienced.Buy it! Buy it now! :-)Edit: I forgot to mention: it has a very very very good community. In game, you have chatrooms and when you have a question, you can ask it there and there's almost always someone who answers.			"

												Damn this game, damn it.Stop concentrating for a moment and you're dead.Get cocky, you're dead.Err slightly, you're dead.One step too far, you're dead :).Yes, the game is punishing, but that makes the rewards all the richer.Personally i'd put gameplay above graphics 100% of the time and this game fits that bill for sure, but don't be fooled into thinking that only adequate graphics means poor gameplay. In this case, it does not. Far from it. You really really have to think about how/where to progress otherwise that bright light at the end of the tunnel races forward and envelops you. Again :).The only tip i'd give to people is to check, upon entering a certain area, what your charactor thinks about it before going even one step further. If your charactor is crapping his/her self then leave! You get a one-liner when you enter that tells you.I've played quite a few hours offline and keep coming back for more.Oh, and it'll probably run on that old windows95 era hardware you've got in the loft :).Have fun and expect your swearing vocabulary to increase drastically!

												I highly recommend this!A throw back to the 90s, excellently executed, this game is a real gem.Pros:- Excellent character building with interesting stats and skills. - Combat is fun.- The quests are enjoyable, involved, but not overly so.- Tons of innovative features that remove elements of RPGs that would typically be boring. e.g. Autoexplore: Lets you effortlessly find anything you missed in an area.- Lots of classes and characters to unlock with each playthrough, which keeps things fresh oh and also some special items carry through to your next character.Cons?- This game is nothing to look at.- The tutorial was a tad boring, but only lasts all of 5 mins, it's to the point, well worth getting through to enjoy a great game.

												This is an incredible roguelike game with a lot of variety. The dungeons have different sets of enemies and features, providing different tactical challenges. There are also a lot of different classes to play, and each class can be built in multiple ways, offering a lot of replayability. An autosearch key takes out a lot of the tedium.I switched my keys to follow the classic no numberpad layout from Nethack, and it works great for me.			"

												One of those games that proves the case that graphics are but a small part of what makes a game good. This game looks like cardboard cut-out game pieces laid on a game board, it's not that pretty but it makes up for it in oh-so good gameplay, character developement & I even enjoy the music (which I usually pay no attention to at all). I haven't played too much of the game yet but I was surprised with over 1300 achievements in this game, I figured I'd be unlocking them left and right. Unfortunately, I've only unlocked 3 thus far, not really ego boosting but an interesting fact. The game took me a few play throughs (it's rouge-like, meaning you will likely die...a lot) to get the mechanics down. My first character was a Dwarf Bulwark Warrior (sword + board style) I didn't last very long, had no idea how and/or when to use my abilities, how to acquire new items, but as I played more, it came piece by piece. I'm sure I still have many things to learn, but I look forward to my time doing it because this game is quite enjoyable. It's not an expensive game and it's really worth a look if you enjoy creating characters, trying new things and exploring.			"

If you play games for gameplay and not to look at them and drool thoughtlessly on your keyboard through pretty quick time events pick this up immidiatly.  Best use of $7 in a looooong time.Update as of 10/20/14:  This game is still incredibly and still recieves free updates.  This is really ToME4 so it will be updated for the foreseable future.

												Not a bad game, but the difficulty is all over the place, the sign of a quite poorly balanced game in my opinion. The rng is just out of this world in this game, but I guess that's kinda to be expected from a ""roguelike"" such as this. It's good fun if you don't mind dying all the time just to ""learn"" things and then get screwed over by random rare encounters(and bosses can be random as well). I've only played this game on the roguelike setting, so I can't really comment on the easier difficulties but I'm sure they're not too bad since you can afford dying playing them. I really haven't played that game that much, not sure what it clocks in on currently. Would I recommend this game? yes and no. I do like the game but the rng and difficulty swings really annoys me. However It's a small game, I love the graphic style, it's quite simplistic and it can be fun to die at times. But be warned, it is a hard game and yes it will frustrate the hell out of you at times.			"

Posted: October 18, 2015
												This game is more than just a SOLID roguelike -- it's also a pretty damn close to being a cRPG because of the turn-based combat, immersive story elements, and character-building.  The popular user-defined steam tags for this game are 100% spot on.Don't let the game title or graphics put you off. I think the title is too silly for a game this good.Don't listen to people who say this game is too hard -- there's multiple difficulty levels and modes -- one of the modes makes it just like Diablo 1 in terms of difficulty (exploration mode).Exploration mode -- there's no fail state (think of the Diablo series).  It literally can't be too hard in this mode.Adventure mode  -- The perfect compromise.  You start with one life, and get a handful more as you level.  Death still sucks, but it's not too bad.  When you die, the game is telling you to Get Good -- It's not just because you didn't pray to RNGesus enough.  I think the game is balance tuned to this mode for normal human beings.Roguelike -- One life.  It's Ironman mode in a game balanced for multiple lives -- without the ability to grind in increase survivability (think Diablo).  So, you need a _very deep_ understanding of the game mechanics to succeed in this mode.  Like, looking at the code deep -- or at least benefiting from the knowledge of others who have, in some way.  Not that the game is totally unfair.  It's pretty damn fair.  But there are things in this game that will most likely result in your death if you're unprepared, and there's no way to know to prepare for them without having encountered it before.  In many cases, you do get very good hints about this through the ingame Lore/Story bits you find -- but not always.  That's my impression, anyways.  The above modes are on top of additional difficulty settings, so it's rather fine-tunable (I started playing on Normal-Adventurer, and I'm still playing in that mode at 100 hours /played -- and I haven't beaten the game yet).High points as I think of them:Gameplay is amazing.  Itemization is top-notch.  Class ability balance is pretty damn good -- most games I feel like I'm beta testing class balance, but not here.There's an actual story, and there are immersive pieces of lore that you find that are well-written.Extremely moddable, but not in a ""bad"" way like some games where you'd need to spend 100's of hours modding before you start playing (I'm looking at you, Fallout 3 and Skyrim.  Morrowind would be in the same boat, but it gets a pass from me because that game has style).Loving the Z key.Escort missions are brilliant.The Devs removed the grind for consumables -- which is one of the major departures from classic rogue games.The Rogue class is fun as hell for me.You can tell that the Devs are true gamers -- what is optimal is also often enough the most fun way to play.  I get the impression that this is not merely serendipitous.After/If you beat the game, you can take your character into a true infinite dungeon to see how far you get.  That sounds pretty awesome, even though I haven't done it yet.Helpful ingame chat (you can link items into it, and there's an ingame browser).The only downside is the graphics.  They could be better, and with how moddable the game is, I'm actually pretty surprised it's not already.  There's a certain amount of charm to them, but it's not like Fallout 1 level charm -- but then again the only game that comes close to that (or exceeds in some aspects) is Diablo 2, so I'm being a bit unfair.  There is a DLC for like $1 that does improve the UI graphics some, and I think it's worth getting.I could improve the graphics substantially and release it as a mod, but I'm too busy playing -- it's that good.  Mayber everyone feels the same way.Get this game because it's great.  Get the DLCs to support the DevsI'd rate this 9.9/10 if the price was irrelevant.  At its current price, it's an honest 11/10 ((before you say anything: YES I know).TLDR: It's great.  This game deserves to be more popular than it already is.  The Devs deserve your money.			"

												You make a basic character and class from the limited selection available to you. 2/3rds of the other possibilites are locked, but you hope you will eventually acquire them with time and diligence. You start your playthrough on the easiest difficulty. You die a lot, but you slowly learn the ropes.You start over, this time with a more refined build. You begin to learn the dungeon order. You move faster and die less. The challenge is gone, and you move up to the next difficulty. It's a different game. You lose within an hour. You try again. This time you don't even get through the first level. You re-learn the game, and slowly improve. Your build is more refined. You become more cautious, more perceptive, and you start to make real progress. After numerous do overs and deaths, you finally surpass your prior characters. You're in uncharted territory. Your first bout with the final bosses ends in seconds with your champion in pieces with your honor. And so you start again. You progress, you die, you repeat. You start over a lot, but each character gets further than the last. Finally, after many gruelling hours, you have beaten the bosses and won! Your palms are sweatng, your knees feel weak, and you feel so elated you could fly. You move up to the next difficulty. You lose within moments. You re-learn the game, and you do it all again. You beat the bosses on this difficulty. You know the ins and outs of this characer so well you could write an encyclopedia. So you start a totally new character, with some of the new races and classes you have unlocked. You start on the easiest difficulty and lose within seconds. So you do it all over again.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is simply an amazing game.  It does an excellent job of providing everything that makes a roguelike great in a format that is extremely accessible both for hardcore fans of the genre as well as more casual players looking to get their feet wet.  The sheer amount of content in this game is incredible.  The storyline and lore are deep and enjoyable while the gameplay, particularly the combat, remain consistently engaging.Tales of Maj'Eyal does a good job of easing a new player into the world and game mechanics by restricting the initial race and class offerings and expands outward with a number of persistent unlockables including new races, classes, and items that will become available to your future characters as you progress forward through additional sessions.  The distinct classes (particularly with different race pairings) provide tremendously distinct play styles that will keep you on your toes and force you to adjust your gameplay to find success.To sum this up simply:  This game is outstanding, anyone with even the most remote interest would do well to pick it up, it won't let you down (and in all likelihood will keep you playing and having fun for an exceptionally long time to come).

												A very solid roguelike. It's been a staple of any roguelike fans for several years and is great to see it brought to Steam where it has really made the most of unlockable/achievements and workshop to make it even easier to get some of the many great mods for it.It has several notable changes from other roguelikes, foremost it's abilities system use a variety of different resources and are mostly about managing cooldowns. There's no health/mana pot chugging here which takes some of the tedium away from stacking potions to thinking about which abilities to use when. Also, the storyline and overworld is static, while individual level layout and most npcs are randomized. This has it's own plus and minuses. Each area has it's own lore and strategy which planning for is part of the game and you wouldn't be able to do as much for completely randomized dungeons. On the other hand, if you are like me and like to rush to your death and try as many classes as possible, replaying the same quests and areas can start getting a little boring. However the game has a lot of different content and several starting areas to help alleviate the tedium of replaying the same starting areas over and over for each character.Really a must have for any roguelike fan, it does a lot of the traditional elements very well while bringing a lot of unique flavor and strategy of its own.

												Absolutely yes! One of the best roguelikes i've ever played, and I've played many of them. Every character feels unique since they can be deeply customized. Part of its awesomeness stems from getting rid of those unfair deaths (lack of food, poisoned food, cursed items, out of depth monsters, undetectable deadly traps,etc) that are so frequent in other rogues (i'm looking at you stone soup), making every death your fault. steam doesn't properly track game time during offline mode, but i've played it for no less than 75 hours. I could spend the rest of my sunday trying to put into words how fascinating this game is, but unfortunately I've other issues to attend.			"

												Seriously, just the best Roguelike outside of Omega (go find Omega if you don't mind ASCII graphics and want a true old school Rogue experience).  If you have any interest at all in what defines a TRUE Roguelike experience (not the latest indie ""hey we have procedural levels and perma death, we're totally Roguelike!"" fad), this is a must have.

												I like my RPGs like I like my coffee. Nice and deep, complex, with many different options with which to slay my enemies in any singular class, wait, what was I talking about again?Tales of Maj'Eyal encompasses everything I love about roguelikes, everything I like about MMOs, and everything I LOVE about RPGs.It has the typical roguelike grid-locked movement and combat system, plus projectiles have a fly speed, which means that you can dodge projectiles by sidestepping if they're slow enough that you can catch them midair. Every being has a global speed rating, too, so a slow mage with 75% global speed will often be double-turn-ed on by enemies often and won't be able to dodge many projectiles, whereas a rogue with 127% global speed will often be able to act twice in a ""turn"" and sidestep most projectiles! The speed system really does make such a big difference. Additionally, just like in roguelikes, if your character bites the dust they're gone... However unlike roguelikes you have three difficulty settings: Roguelike, Adventure and ...Endless, I believe? Whatever, the point is... Roguelike is roguelike: If your character dies, they kick the bucket for good. In Endless, you get to ressurrect every single time. However, Adventure is interesting. In Adventure, you work through lives--as you level and achieve things, you gain extra lives... but they're finite. So once you kick the bucket, the nameless cosmic tentacle-entity that keeps reviving you like a dunce for somehow loses interest and lets you fall into the void.It borrows a few cool mechanics from MMOs too, namely the randomized loot system and many skill trees. Unlike MMOs, however, it ops for having many, MANY skill trees that are 100% linear with four steps, divided into two categories: Class trees, and Generic trees. Class trees are native to your class--a Rogue gets Trapitude, an Alchemist gets Golemancy, so on, so forth. Generic trees, on the other hand, you qualify for; being a Cunning-based class with high Cunning gives you access to the Survival tree; being a Wilder grants you access to the Wild Gift tree, so on so forth. On levelups you gain a Class point and a Generic point, as well as several Stat Points and, on particular levels, Category points. A Category point lets you unlock locked skill trees, or upgrade the potency of one you already had! Like I said: Deep and complex. Like coffee, I suppose?And of course, from RPGs, it borrows the everything else. A vast world rich in story, with cool sidequests and enemy design and... this isn't RPG-native. what am i... i need to go sit down.yes cool story, cool sidequests, cool enemies, someone pass me the coffee, wait i dont even drink coffee(also, I recommend you grab the workshop addon Remove Class/Race Locks, which allows you to play as classes you've not unlocked yet... because the unlock restrictions are, quite frankly, ♥♥♥♥ing obtuse, and you get a piddly pool of races and classes to pick from otherwise)			"

												This game is the most rewarding roguelike I've played in quite some time.  It combines many beautifully nostalgic concepts from rpgs from the good old days.  Talents and ""feats"" and stats will all be very familiar to the bearded rpg appreciators and  can be picked up quickly by any newcomers that might happen upon this game.  All the traits and talents and character stats all have very in-depth write-ups when you mousover them, and since the game is true to the turn-based concept, you can truly play at your own pace.This game comes closest to the feel of that old game I spent so many hours on back in the days of ""shareware"", Castle of the Winds.  I personally have been looking for a game that brought that wholesome turn-based, warm, fuzzy feeling in my gutty wuts for the better part of two decades, and it would seem that I have found exactly that.There is some kind of patch/crack/thing that can unlock all the races and classes without having to earn them properly, but I haven't implemented it yet after however many hours I've played, and I don't think I'd enjoy the game more without having to earn the unlocks.  Get the DLC.I can't recommend this game highly enough.  Pour in the hours.  Keep em coming.  Drink deep.  This is a gem.			"

												Absolutely great game, really brings alot to offer for a turn-based Rogue-like adventure.Several of my favorite features include the ability to unlock different races/classes, depth and diversity of artifacts, and the satisfaction of clearing another dungeon dispite the boss and other traps held in store. These make playthroughs similar enough to not have to read every ability twice before even starting the character, yet different enough that finding a new artifact that you never have seen before in 50+ playthoughs gives great joy.

It is rock hard and there are so many unique classes, some of which are very simple and some of which take some real mastery. I had the free version when it was out and now had to buy it to support the developers. It can be a bit tough to learn what areas that you can go to and which you should stay away from in the beginning, but eventually you will get the hang of it. There are also some helpful community guides to get you started. Best game I ever spent so little money on.			"

												At first I thought this was just another odd indie RPG, but than I played it more an more and before I knew it 3 hours had passed...  ToME is an amazing game if you are into Rogue-likes as I am.  I love being able to pick a Race along with my Class and this game has MANY to choose from and the fun part about it is that there is a lot to unlock!  Dungeons are generated randomly and that means monsters too!  I have died about 3 or 4 times with a single character and not had the same dungeon setup once.  It really keeps it interesting AND challenging.  The only bad thing I can really say is that the graphics are VERY simple.  This is quickly becomming one of my favorite RPG's ever!			"

												To get straight to the point, ToME is easily the best roguelike I've ever played. It has depth, variety, multiple difficulty settings, and has just the right balance between skill and luck. If you learn the game and know it well, you can handle even terrible situations with good play...but there's still never a time where you feel perfectly safe. This is still a roguelike after all, getting OHKOd from outside of your sight range by an overpowered rare monster is always on the table.Pros: Classes with unique and interesting skillsets. And a LOT of them.Interesting races, also with uniqueness.Large and skilled modding community, always writing new addons for the game.A dev that listens to feedback!Cons:This game is long, and you'll want to play it multiple times if you get into it. Huge timesink. No matter how many bugs DarkGod manages to get out of the code, there are always more. Some of them can end a run. "

I picked it up on sale for $149 and I am grateful for that. Its a real deal but if you miss the sale that is going on then the $6.99 is still worth the game. I recommend this game to old school pc gamers cause this is right up their alley. It is a fun and intersting game and I think other people should play it as well.			"

Every class in unique in it's playstyle, every race adds a little something to that playstyle, the weapons and armour have enough stats for you to look at almost every peice you pick up to see if it is better than what you are wearing.

												I love Rogue-like games. I played ADOM way back in 2000 to death (took me around a month of almost continuous gaming  with constant reference to games guides to finish it once).TOME has many that endear rogue-like to people: a tough difficulty level, a range of classes, a range of races, a customisable tree, a high complexity.It also brings with it some features that the internet world likes: regular updation (even long after Version 1), a very dedicated creator, modding and a very active community.There are also some very interesting connected features in the game.Notes:1.The graphics are not mind-blowing (though much better than the regular rogue-likes like Nethack, and the old ADOM). This is a game where your imagination is paramount. If you are very focused on graphics, then do not buy this.2.Steam does not show hours on this since I bought it from the original website, and got a Steam key much later when it got listed here.			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a descent of Angband and a great blend of classic rogue-like with modern UI, gameplay mechanics, and a lot of personality.  If you're into clearing dungeons, collecting loot, and leveling up, TOME is one of your best options, specifically if you don't mind complicated mechanics, tactically paced combat, and dying a lot.  The game has tons of replay value, and each playthrough can go from just a few to 40+ hours.  One of the key differences in this and other available recent 'roguelikes' is that this has a fleshed-out world and each playthrough keeps character progression interesting.  This is definitely worth picking up.			"

												If you're a fan of old-school, roguelike RPG's then you can't go wrong with this. Maddeningly addictive, brutally difficult and with a whole host of unlockable and interesting 'DnD' style classes, each greatly varying in playstyle.By the looks of it, there's potentially a lot of gameplay here too outside of the typical “die, replay new game” flow common with roguelikes. So far I’ve not managed to get a character past level 14 without having them killed and then auto-deleted, and that’s after sinking a good 19 hours into the game. Each time a character has died however, I’ve usually found myself instantly firing up a new game, stubbornly adamant that I’ll get further this time or with a different class (I say “instantly”, there’s always that brief period of time spent just staring at the screen after a death thinking “Shiiiit! I knew I should have been more careful….Shiiiiiiiit!”).Classes, game modes and special perks can be earned and unlocked for current and future playthroughs by completing quests or accessing certain areas, helping keep your interest in the game after a heavy loss.All in all, totally worth £6 I’d say, provided you’re prepared from some serious jimmy rustling somewhere down the line (to the likes Dark Souls has never seen)!

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is an amazing roguelike with a very nice tileset. You choose from a variety of races and a variety of classes, and even more can be unlocked of each. Depending on your race and/or class, you'll start out in a specific Zone(or dungeon if you'd like). Once you finish that Zone, or before, you can return the World Map, in which you can explore it looking for more dungeons, or look for towns in which you can purchase items or find quests.This isn't like The Elder Scrolls, where most of the game is scaled to your level or ability, each Zone has a certain difficulty, and until you're more familiar with how difficult each one is, it's better to follow the quest log. It's true that with very careful and skillful management of your spells and/techniques that you can finish a Zone that's a bit higher than you level, but there's a limit that's very quickly reached.Each of the Zones layouts are randomly generated, though they always have the same theme(forest, cave, dungeon, etc.). However, the World Map is mostly static, meaning it doesn't shift too much between games. There are 4 main towns in the beginning for instance, 3 of them having 2 beginner Zones right next to them. These 4, and their Zones, are always in the same spot. While there are a couple more Zones that are found in the same spot, the location of all the other Zones(mostly the 'side' ones) shifts around the map between gamesFor the actual skills you use, they're divided up into 2 categories: Class and Generic. Class skills are like they sound: each Class has many skill trees with for skills in each, and it's up to you how you want to level them, though some trees have a level requirement. Then there's Generic. This category is mostly the same between Classes, however some Classes add an extra Generic tree or 2. Many Races also have extra Generic trees, though Races with buffs or extra trees are of course balanced in other ways.Each Race has different bonuses and penalties to their stats, health, and experience rate, along with their Race Specific Generic Trees. So obviously some Races will be better suited to certain play styles. While some races and classes cannot be used together for Story/lore reasons, all class/race combinations are viable throughout the game, though you may need to play a bit smarter in some cases. One last thing about races: While they all have bonuses and penalties, the 'Cornac Human' is the exception in that it has no bonuses, no extra Generic Trees, and no penalties of any sort, and I recommend that if you want to try a new class but don't know what to expect, the 'Cornac Human' is a good default choice. Oh wait, Cornacs start with 1 category point, as some categories need to be unlocked with a point before you can start investing in it's skills, You can also just use the Category Point to give yourself an extra Infusion/Rune Slot, I'll talk more of this later.As for items, they are Armor, Weapons, Jewellery, Tools, and Infusions/Runes. All items except Infusions/Runes are randomly generated for the most part, the exception being Legendary/Unique items, which are always the same, but have very unique bonuses and sometimes penalties. They sometimes even give you a skill(with a cooldown), though Tools always give a skill while they are worn.Infusions/Runes are items which will pretty much let you 'equip' a skill, such as Healing, Regen, etc. You only have so many slots though. All classes and races, no matter the combination, start with 3 slots. When you get a Category point every 5 levels(or first if you're a Cornac), you can opt to use it to give you an extra slot. If you try to use an Infusion/Rune when all slots are filled, you'll be asked if you want to replace a currently equipped Infusion/Rune. If you do so, you do NOT get it back.I'll cut the review short here, else I'll waffle all day. I definitely recommend this game for any roguelike and/or RPG fan. Please keep in mind that there is a free version on their site. This version is the paid version, in which it gives you an item vault(that must be reached through a semi-difficult dungeon) with a few slots to transfer items or store them between characters. The paid version also has an extra class to play with, along with an extra mode. The extra class I won't name as it changes. The most recently added class is for the paid version only. When a new one is added, the previous one becomes free. The extra game mode is 'Exploration', which is the same as normal, but gives you unlimited lives.Please note that the DLC listed below is not a part of the free version, though they can also be purchased on their and played in the DRM free version.

I have about 800 hours into this game (500-600 of which were before I decided to purchase it on steam) and it generally doesn't get old at all. In my opinion, it is overall the best roguelike on the market by a pretty big margain. Also has the least toxic community in a game I've seen for a long time, to the point where people buy DLC for strangers in chat on occasion. If you like roguelikes, buy this game RIGHT NOW.

												I waited a while before reviewing this game. I didn't want the ""starting"" excitement to overwhelm me.After having played this game with several characters, I can say that every playthrough, I get more and more excited about this game. For me, this game is difficult and hardcore, I am not that experienced with rpg's but this game makes me want to be and every playthrough, I feel like I have learned new things.For the first time, I carefully think about choices I make, what should I level up, how should I handle this enemy. For the first time, I take my time for every turn (usually with this kind of games, I rush through my turns as if it was real-time). The game makes me want to use my skills and intelligence and for me, this is a first-timer.The funny thing is, I had this game marked as ""Not Interested"" originally, but came here by reading a review under another -not so good- game. That other game had much better graphics, but I don't care about graphics. On the other hand, because I had mostly been dissapointed by roguelikes with low-quality graphics (although TOME actually has relative good graphics for its genre) I had never looked at this game in detail. It was after that other review and seeing that people have actually spent a whole year in playtime on this game that I got interested.That's sad... because this game is REALLY worth it. And it certainly is worth the price. I bought it at -30% and now I feel like they could easily charge 3x the price (and even more) and it would still be worth it. This game needs a commercial boost :-)I am really enjoying this game, dying all the time and stuff like that. I prefer adventure-mode because I can die several times before it is game over, but I still don't want to die (like you could play through in exploration mode) so it still makes me try to play it roguelike (which is too hard for me at this time).I also like how this game builds up unlocks: especially for me, being not that experienced, I like that in the beginning not all character types can be played and must be unlocked. It makes me build up my knowledge about the game and probably only when I am ready to learn about new types of character, they will be unlocked.I wonder if I will stop buying other games on steam now for the next year because if I look at other people playing this game (2500 hours of playtime), it seems like I will never get bored with this game and will never need another game :-).I think I can safely say that this game is for all kinds of RPG players: the beginners and the very experienced.Buy it! Buy it now! :-)Edit: I forgot to mention: it has a very very very good community. In game, you have chatrooms and when you have a question, you can ask it there and there's almost always someone who answers.			"

												For those who value content over graphics, this is a fun game.  Very difficult, depending on your luck with item drops.  It can be a bit repetetive once you get in the grove of your character or if you die a lot and have to do the same zones over and over again.			"

Quick NoteThis game is free and open source, buying the game on steam only unlocks the donor features.  You can download the game at http://te4.org/ for free if you're not sure if this is the game for you.The ReviewThis is the definitive roguelike.  Darkgod has been working on this game for over 16 years, and it shows.  The graphics may not be fantastic, but the gameplay is more than enjoyable.  The unlocks are very difficult for newer players so it is extremely rewarding when you get one.  I would reccomend this game to anybody that enjoys roguelikes, specifically those that follow the genre closely.			"

												This game may look lacking but it actually contains a lot of content. The fighting and enemy encounters are very fun, requiring strategy and tactics if you want to survive. The quests/missions are good at getting you to explore the world and the lore that you can find in-game is very interesting. I bought this game when it was on sale for about $2 but i still would have paid the full price for it.			"

												This game is incredibly well done. There are few things to complain about although I will adress them. The art style is easy to hate. I cannot come to enjoy it. The music is also usually quite bland throughout the game so far. The sound effects in addition are generally annoying. Te game however is very in depth as far as classes and races etc. The varied types of charactors you can make have a large spectrum. However I would like to see a further increase to charactor lore. Perhaps a combination of Elder scrolls daggerfalls history your charactor recieves with a bit of wizardry 8s charactor system. It should be noted that this game is certainly not for everyone. The niche people that it attracts however will find it extremly entertaining.			"

												I am no fan of rogue like games, but this one, which I bought by chance, really got my attention (currently 30+ hours of gameplay).I just warn you that this game, if you play the way it is meant, is hard as hell. You will probably die several times still on lvl 1 at the begining as you learn the game and even when you think you mastered it, getting to lvl 20 or more will be a challenge (lvl cap is 50). That´s on normal difficulty!Good luck trying to survive on this. My advice is: do always have a way out/to escape from the mobs. One of them will always get to hit u on ur weak spot (for every build u make) and if u are not well prepared to atk on its weak spot, u´ll have to run!!! RUN FORREST!!!  "

Now think of every bit of lore from pretty much every RPG you've ever played or wanted to play. Now think of a quick-paced combat system that makes exploration the most important thing, the beauty.Now make that game cheap as all hell and playable on EVERY SYSTEM KNOWN TO EXISTENCE.ToME made my day.

												It's a weird combination of Roguelike and Diablo. Rather than running around an endless dungeon with a handful of different branches, this one is mostly made up of dozens of shallow branches to keep things fresh. The game doesn't have as much as other roguelikes in terms of procedurally generated levels and interesting archetexture, but the classes and races are considerably more diverse in their playstyles. As long as DCSS keeps removing the fun from their own game, this one is probably the best roguelike on the market right now that isn't dead development wise. Also download it for free on their site. The pricetag here is pretty much considered a donation. 85-90% of the game is free to everyone, donators and buyers just get a little more icing for their cake.			"

Amazingly in-depth and ever evolving, this game is proof that there is still room for innovation and growth within the ""traditional"" roguelike genre.

												I haven't played this game for a few years, back when it was still fully ascii. The new graphical tilesets for absolutely everything in game are fantastic and do a great job of creating a world, as well as the various people and monsters. Also a great selection of avatars for a unique feel to your own character. There are options for unlimited and limited respawn modes as well as the traditional single-life permadeath mode that older players are used to, as well as three different difficulty levels, so the game's as hard as you want it to be.If you're a fan of roguelikes, you can't go wrong with ToME.If you can still get it on sale, the DLC is worth it. The new Doombringer class is super fun. He can wade into groups of enemies while debuffing and burning them all and consuming said debuffs to gain shields and health. It's a total blast to play.			"

												Though the gameplay as well as the asthetics may appear simplistic, and they are... in its simplicity comes a very easy to get into experience; allowing for you to explore without losing interest in the world, characters and lore. Like a good game of D&D, there is so much to get caught up in... side quests galor :3The maps are randomly generated, but that does not mean you will be playing the what has been known to be the now typical proceduraly generated roguelikes that seem to flood steam early access. The difference in the generation is pretty minimal in most cases, so if you were to die... you can easily jump back in.The game is highly addictive, and as far as the gameplay speed/pacing goes... its pretty much left up to the player. If your clicking through the game at high speeds... the experience will still envelop you... but you will progress at an obnoxiously fast speed... probably dying a ton in the process; on the other hand, you can pace yourself... playing each situation with strategy; its essentially up to you.all in all, the game is extremely easy to get into. I have yet to experience any bugs or glitches. This game has become my no.1 addiction since I bought it.I definitely recommend this to anyone, casual and hardcore players alike.			"

												Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of roguelike content.ToME4 distinguishes itself from other roguelikes by having classes with massive skill lists to increase the number of tactical options in combat. Even the warrior classes typically spend more time deciding which skill to use rather than just hacking away.But the genre isn't for everyone. Lots of people will run into deaths that they felt were completely unfair and not recognize that there were things they should've done with their equipment setup hours earlier in the run. ToME is really bad at teaching people what they did wrong, I'll give it that.So, if you're new to the genre, I highly recommend you download the almost entirely feature complete free version from te4.org "

												By far one of the best roguelikes out there. Well over 300h and countless games and characters played, I still feel that I've barely scratched the surface of all that the game has to offer. The character building possibilities (plenty race/class combinations to choose from, and for each at the very least 2 viable different ways to play, usually more) seem endless, the lore is amazing, the sheer amount of non-useless loot will have you constantly hunting for more...Yes the graphics and animations are very old school but this you can see from the videos and pictures and if this is enough for you to rebuke the game, you will not read my review anyway. I care about gameplay and this game is so deep and well crafted in this regard that I cannot stop playing it. Besides I'm very happy that I can run this game on a potato. On top of this all, the developer DarkGod is great, listens to the community and regularly updates the game and the community is amazing, both very helpful on IRC and the Forum but also helping design new classes, weapons and skilltrees. For a game that brought me so many hours of fun, such a low price is truly a steal.			"

												      I have been playing this game since 2013 but I had bought it for steam last year when the Ashes DLC came out. This game has made me feel many things: Frustration, happiness, anger, fear and excitement.     It is very well made and few bugs remain in the base game. If you aren't sure you want to buy this game, it's free on its webpage. Try it there, get mad, have fun and then support our dark god.			"

												What first brought me to this game was the sheer variety of class selection. If you've ever played a fantasy character that fought in a particular way and you enjoyed it, chances are ToME has you covered. Spellcasters, melee fighters, melee spellcaster fighters, anti-spellcaster fighters, anti-spellcaster non-spell casters (Slimes, foreals though). Rogues, spell-casting rogues even, as well as ranged ones, and traps are pretty op. Bows, slings, guns. Telekenesis as a caster or because you think wielding weapons with your mind is a good time, I mean you can do that AND beat things up with the weapon in your own hands. Uh.. Yeah there's a lot to go, just try the game. I have around triple what Steam reports, I played it a year or so prior to it coming to Steam, but this game has been around a day or two, go look it up. TL;DR: So much class depth and variety, if that's your thing, have at it.			"

												Amazing-if-often-frustrating dungeon crawler:You will die.  A lot.  You'll quit.  And find yourself crawling back for more punishment.  You'll learn...  evolve...  progress...  Unkillable boss becomes hard to kill tyrant becomes minor road block along a path you know.  There is repetition, but with sufficient randomness to feel nostalgic rather than tedious.You'll unlock new styles, races, and classes.  You'll find aspects you enjoy, figure out how to master them, and learn coping and survival mechanisms for the diverse critters and situations.  You'll develop that spidey-sense that tells you ""hey, I'd better get out of here before I get in trouble, and regroup around a choke point"".I loved this.  I hated this.  I loved it.  I hated it.  I learned that I loved that I loved and hated it.  It's challenging but fair, with a helpful community and deep content.  If you don't require massive 3d immersive graphics, are patient enough to avoid throwing your keyboard, and are willing to devote hours to learning truly ""how to play"", this is a great, evolving product you won't regret your time spent on.

												Overall, I would give this game a 6 out of 10. On the positive side, this game is quite fun, and has lots of replayability. Classes are very unique, and there is a large variety of skills. I also appreciate the unlocking system for new classes/races. However, one of the major downfalls, in my opinion, is that I often run into enemies that can one-hit-kill me. Most reciently there was an instance of a ""normal"" (not elite, rare, or boss) enemy, lower than my level, that killed me, from full health, from 4 blocks away, and through my summon. So, the only way to not die and lose 20+ hours of gameplay is to... never get within 6 blocks of anyone for even a second? Also, it *kind of* deleted my character, even though I had used an item to get an extra life. The character won't show up anywhere, but when I try to create a new character with the same name, it says one exists. I believe the creators need to spend some time reworking enemy skills/powers and fix some major bugs before this game is considered complete.			"

												A great game with a LOT of diversity. You can play it with ASCII graphics or with the lovely stylized modern graphics. All of the classes are pretty unique and there are a lot of them.  If you like classic type turn based Rogue-likes then you will love this.   One of the best parts of this game is the community. There is chat in game and it is filled with helpful players and even developers that will repair your saves in the event that something messes up.While there are a lot of things put into this game for convience, like infinite use (with a cool down) ""Potions,"" this is by no means an easy game.

												Been playing this game ever since the first release, just recently bought the steam-package: TOME is the best turnbased, rogue-rpg you gonna find till today. This game shows perfectly how not the size of a dev-team, but dedication and love for the own product makes quality. Thankfully over the years TOME also offers top(!) content and you can spend hundrets of hours in this world easily. TOME offers a massive character progression: leveling up (each level) offers so much possibilities for each class to grow the way you like -> with active, passive and sustained abilites synergizing with each other and complementing gear and attribute growth.After your first step a hughe open world awaits you, quests over quests, dungeons, woods, ruins, towns filled with shops and npcs...the only thing deciding what to do when is your own risk-awerness,; death is meaningfull, but never unwarrented and just the beginning of a new try to get even further.TOME lacks technicaly on first glance: yes animations are few, the 2D-design is rather minimalistic, but once you play a while you will see that it works, it ""fits"" all together. armor/weapons shows on your character ´, skills have visual-representation and the world/npcs look in place.The music in TOME is just amazing, beeing traveling the vast overworld map, diggin through an eerie dungeon or wandering to old woods; each track is rich in athmosphere and tone and i could listen to most of em even when not actualy playing the game. 10/10 here, easily one of the best soundtracks i`ve ever heard in one of these games.short: you like rpgs, rogue-likes, turnbased-gameplay, rich chardevelopment and a world to get lost in -> must buy.

												While ToME is technically free if you go to the website (and I encourage you to check it out there to make sure it is a game you enjoy), I am glad I paid the Steam price. It essentially counts the same as if you are a donator on the official web site, giving you the same benefits they get.As for the game itself, it is a roguelike. That means randomly generated dungeons, items, monsters, etc... and permanent death. ToME actually has an optional mode where you get multiple lives also, in case you are new to roguelikes and want to ease into things. What ToME does that stands out from the rest is have a very interesting class and race system, which is very customizable to your taste. For example, as a Rogue you can choose to specialize in stealthy gameplay with devastating sneak attacks, deadly traps, or a brawling play style with dirty fighting techniques that give you the advantage when facing foes. The choice is yours, and in addition to stats, each race gives a pool of 4 unique abilities you can also choose to train up, making different race and class combinations play somewhat differently.Another feature of ToME that I don't normally see is an overworld system. After clearing your introduction dungeon you'll be thrust out into the open world, free to explore and attempt to clear dangerous forests, dungeons, and hideouts of foes. It makes the game feel large, like your adventures are part of the world of Maj'Eyal and not just isolated to a single deep dungeon.Finally, ToME is extremely mod-friendly. Don't want to unlock all the classes and races yourself? There is a mod for that. There are mods for new items, new classes, new dungeons, etc... You name it.I am not yet very far into the game, but I have no reservations recommending it, especially giving it a try for free on their website: http://te4.org.			"

												+: One of the best roguelikes on the market - easily top 3 alongside Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and ADOM for me personally. What makes TOME so great is the way it is designed allows it to be incredibly easy to get into for a beginner but still have enough depth and complexity for an advanced player, and unlike traditiational Roguelikes where you try to survive through one really big hard dungeon this has you survive through many mini-dungeons with an overworld map you can explore.+: Game mechanics are incredibly solid, stuff is for the most part well balanced and you can advance in the game well enough as any class really. It abandons the traditional roguelike mechanic of potion spam to heal and instead replaces it with a heal over time ability you can upgrade. There are no random deaths / mechanics that require you to have played the game already in order to know how to not die in this game either.+: Personally I think the game has one of the better loot systems for a roguelike, it's almost Action RPG-esque really.-: It's not really mentioned anywhere on the Steam page that this is normally a free game and the Steam version is just the donator version with Steam bonuses like Achievements & Workshop. By all means if you don't have the money for this game but are interested go download it on the official website. That said, I played the free version for a long time and finally donated when the Steam version came out since I wanted the steam benefits.-: If you don't play often you need to set Steam to not download updates automatically or else major updates can break your saves and you will lose progress. Rarely happens but it did happen to me and it does kind of suck.-: This is an incredibly minor con here but the graphics aren't as good as other modern roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. That said, if you really like roguelikes like I do graphics are probably one of the things you care about the least.			"

												i don't even know where to start with this game. i haven't played it in a few months because i put in 23 hours the first two days i had it and decided i should take a break. if that tells you anything.so i guess i should probably start with the gameplay. you'll spend most of your time in-game fighting one thing or another, and the combat feels fantastic. the game is played entirely at your own pace, so death can come in the blink of an eye, or at a miserable agonizing crawl. whatever the speed, death is inevitable and frequent. the difficulty options are nice however, and there's both a casual mode and a pretty solid tutorial to help ease you in. the ui is great and you don't really need to use hotkeys at all, though a few of them are nice to have. it's perfect if you like rogue-lites and want to try something a little more traditional without some of the more annoying aspects of roguelike.moving on to graphics and story. look, i know you've probably already looked at the screenshots and said, ""really?? ehhhhhhhh"" and that's fair. honestly though, they've really grown on me, and while a lot of it is ""generic fantasy"", so much of it isn't, and it subverts the genre in just the right places. the sprites and environments have had some nice work put into them, and despite looking like they're from 1996, they really bring a unique atmostphere to the game. the worldbuilding and music fit well with the visuals and add a lot to the immersion. the dialogue and found notes are all worth reading and give insight into the world, whether it's a small scrap of comic relief in a hectic dungeon or the detailed history of a faction bought from a bookseller. everything is  well-written (if a little... campy in places. not sure if that's the right word) and usually breaks up the pacing in the right places.what will keep me coming back to this game tho (most likely for years to come) are the amazing moments you just can't find anywhere else in gaming. this aspect of the game is reminiscent of skyrim in a lot of ways. despite any flaws the game might have, there is nothing like coming out of a cave in skyrim and knowing an entire world is out there for you to explore. ToME is the same. there is nothing like the feeling of slowly suffocating to death under sand and knowing there's no one to blame for yourself. there is nothing like discovering what lies beneath Lake Nur for the first time. it's a game that lets your imagination run wild in a way ""prettier"" games can't.tl;dr play this game. you'll probably get more hours out of the 10 bucks you pay for ToME + Ashes of Urh'Rok than you'll get out of the $120 you spent on the Witcher 3 and MGSV.

												One of the best roguelikes. All of the classes are fun to play. Offers mutliple game modes. ""Randomness"" is kept in check a bit, so when you die it's mostly your fault, which is a great thing.The only issue I see is that the game slows down a lot sometimes.

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is a very fun roguelike and is surprisingly easy to learn despite being part of a genre that is very harsh and unforgiving towards new players.I've always liked roguelikes, but I'm not a huge fan of Elona or Stone Soup mainly because it's a lot of statistics and looking at numbers and generally being confused until something oneshots you in 2 seconds and you have to start over again. While that depth is definitely part of Tales of Maj'Eyal, it's only very necessary for later levels when you're actually needing to manage every stat and balance everything to survive. That isn't to say the game is casual, as you can very easily die over, and over, and over... Actually my main block with the game currently is that I can't unlock any new classes because I can't get far enough without dying!The main things that pop out to me are the diversity of classes, the world map you can explore and find hidden secrets in, and the wide variety of different spells and tactics you can employ to fight your enemies. You can be an archer and shoot from afar (infinite ammo with reloading- carrying stacks of arrows be damned!), be a trapper and set tons of traps while stealthing around, become several different types of mages and magic casters and much much more.The graphics are ok, honestly the weak point of the game to me. I feel like people could get easily turned off by the trailer as the graphics look like some old PC freeware game- but I think they're bearable once you're in game, and I think it's cool how your character changes depending on what armour you're wearing. The music is also kind of sleep inducing, although I like the silly snarls some enemies make.Overall 8.9/10			"

												I am thoroughly impressed with Tales of Maj’Eyal. The graphics are simple tile based graphics, but what it lacks graphically it certainly makes up for in depth. If you are looking for amazing graphics look somewhere else. If you are looking for an RPG that concentrates on character development and tactical combat this game is exceptional. Each race and class is customizable by placing points how you like among skills, powes, and stats at creation and upon leveling. The combat is turn based and utilizes skills and powers very well. You will find lore throughout the game that  reveals the world and back story as you progress. There are 1369 achievements. You can play with one life, a few lives, even infinite lives. This is the closest I’ve seen a video game come to re-creating a tabletop experience. I can see myself  dedicating many hours to playing this game. I highly recommend Tales of Maj’Eyal.			"

												This game is not to be taken lightly. It's super hard and takes a while to learn even the basic mechanics. However even without using Walkthroughs or instructions anyone CAN and WILL learn how this game works. Don't let the simplistic graphics fool you, this game is hard and addictive. It does require alot of reading and inventory management though. Charaters really feel l;ike your own and if he/she is killed when you start getting some good gear you actually feel your heart sink a little. Death is punushing, but never feels unfair. I give this game 9/10 it's amazing and I definetly recomend picking it up. If you're still unsure just wait for a sale. But at it's current price it's more than worth the money.			"

												If you're a fan of old-school, roguelike RPG's then you can't go wrong with this. Maddeningly addictive, brutally difficult and with a whole host of unlockable and interesting 'DnD' style classes, each greatly varying in playstyle.By the looks of it, there's potentially a lot of gameplay here too outside of the typical “die, replay new game” flow common with roguelikes. So far I’ve not managed to get a character past level 14 without having them killed and then auto-deleted, and that’s after sinking a good 19 hours into the game. Each time a character has died however, I’ve usually found myself instantly firing up a new game, stubbornly adamant that I’ll get further this time or with a different class (I say “instantly”, there’s always that brief period of time spent just staring at the screen after a death thinking “Shiiiit! I knew I should have been more careful….Shiiiiiiiit!”).Classes, game modes and special perks can be earned and unlocked for current and future playthroughs by completing quests or accessing certain areas, helping keep your interest in the game after a heavy loss.All in all, totally worth £6 I’d say, provided you’re prepared from some serious jimmy rustling somewhere down the line (to the likes Dark Souls has never seen)!

However, I am in love with the characterization and the way the game plays. Its a pretty old school type of rpg and there is nothing wrong with a game witht his kind of style. I picked it up on sale for $149 and I am grateful for that. Its a real deal but if you miss the sale that is going on then the $6.99 is still worth the game. I recommend this game to old school pc gamers cause this is right up their alley. It is a fun and intersting game and I think other people should play it as well.			"

												There is something truely amazing about this game, from the amount of character creation to the in depth story and lore found throughout the game. Every class in unique in it's playstyle, every race adds a little something to that playstyle, the weapons and armour have enough stats for you to look at almost every peice you pick up to see if it is better than what you are wearing. I have to say that this gives you the most meaningful character progression that I've ever seen in any game.

												Though the gameplay as well as the asthetics may appear simplistic, and they are... in its simplicity comes a very easy to get into experience; allowing for you to explore without losing interest in the world, characters and lore. Like a good game of D&D, there is so much to get caught up in... side quests galor :3The maps are randomly generated, but that does not mean you will be playing the what has been known to be the now typical proceduraly generated roguelikes that seem to flood steam early access. The difference in the generation is pretty minimal in most cases, so if you were to die... you can easily jump back in.The game is highly addictive, and as far as the gameplay speed/pacing goes... its pretty much left up to the player. If your clicking through the game at high speeds... the experience will still envelop you... but you will progress at an obnoxiously fast speed... probably dying a ton in the process; on the other hand, you can pace yourself... playing each situation with strategy; its essentially up to you.all in all, the game is extremely easy to get into. I have yet to experience any bugs or glitches. This game has become my no.1 addiction since I bought it.I definitely recommend this to anyone, casual and hardcore players alike.			"

												If I was asked to explain why I play TOME so much, I wouldn't be able to use any of my reasons to convince someone to purchase it.This game is one of the best RPGs out there, period. This is offset, of course, by the fact that it's about as forgiving and accessible as a brick wall. With spikes on it. And it's somehow firing a steam gun at you.This is a game that almost kneecaps itself at every turn, in my opinion, only just barely getting good quality out of an idea that could have easily left this game yet another greyed out title on my library.It's a massive game, sporting over a thousand bloody achievements, but you'll be suffering from roughly twelve types of PTSD by the time you get through the first batch of dungeons and actually start the story.There's a massive amount of variety between god knows how many classes that are available, but they'll all probably die the same way.There's a never ending slew of new sights to see and enemies to fight, but every one of them will probably either lead you to or be followed by a gruesome death.This all being because, as the game so proudly states, it's a roguelike. And as a roguelike it's just about the worst made game I've ever played. Don't take that the wrong way, the game is great, but it's roguelike elements sell it short in places. To justify this, before I am impaled by a billion pitch forks, I'll remind you of FTL, faster than light. By all accounts, a great game. But FTLs biggest shortcoming was its final boss, which required near perfect planning and exceptional luck to beat, and when you lost, as it was whenever you lost, you were sent back to the start of this fairly long game.FTLs permanent death did no poor job of making you value your ship, and the game was just short enough to make it tolerable. This mentality has been taken in TOME and turned up to seven billion. You could complete a run of FTL in the time it takes you to get through the first batch of dungeons in this game, and the threat of losing it all doesn't get any smaller as you go on.Well, that's not entirely true. The default difficulty for TOME gives you a handful of lives to play around with, you can of course turn it up to true roguelike, but I'm fairly sure that was meant as a joke. However, the lives system does not take away from the fact that you, unless you're amazing at this game, are going to die from something out of your control at least once. And by ""at least"" I mean if you have the blood of a leprechaun in your veins and are blessed with uncanny luck. The rest of us are going to be suffering a lot more than thatThat brings me neatly onto the most glaring turn off from this game. It's villain. You see, this villain, is not a character that you meet, nor is it a magical force, nor a force of nature. It is a concept, and it is always with you, breathing down your neck, plotting its next attack, ready to steal yet another life away from you without warning, nor mercy. This villain, is the RNG.For you will spend your time in this game preparing for when next the RNG will strike. You will hesitate as you assign level up points to consider ""Will this help me survive when the RNG strikes?"", you will creep around each and every corner, terrified that around it, the RNG will be lying in wait, ready to put all your talents on cooldown, poison you, and chop off half your health all in a single turn. The RNG is your worst, and only enemy, for the enemies that are not affected by it, you shall slaughter in the thousands, you will be prepared for each and every boss that you encounter, through hours of rigorous training, but you can never be fully ready for the minions of the RNG.In all seriousness, I cannot remember the last time I died in this game to a boss that I fought poorly, or a talent that I used carelessly. I have, however, lost count of how many times I have died to elite wolves with steamguns, to gelatanious cubes with lightning magic, to the boss of the level spawning literally a square away from the level entrance. The game is difficult, but when the RNG bears its teeth in the worst possible way, there isn't much you can do except backpedal to the level entrance and go level some more in a different dungeon, and that's if the poison doesn't get you, because it is always poison.In short, purchase this game, that's an order. But expect to be a different man/woman/other by the time you've completed it, mainly because your hair will have gone white and you may have aged a few years. It's not impossible, and I'm slowly learning the ways of this horrifyingly difficult world, but I expect to be doing so for a while. "

It is a rogue like, which seems to be trending these days, but unlike other roguelikes, you can turn it into an rpg with no penalty for dying, or turn up with difficulty and allow no deaths. Be prepared to spend first few runs learning the feel of the game, determining what is good/bad, and most importantly what playstyle is going to be most effective with whatever build you go for. Cursed Cornac ftw!			"

												Tales of Maj'Eyal is considered by many roguelike enthusiasts to be one of the best games in the genre. Not only has it won several awards over the years for its in-depth gameplay mechanics, but the base game is totally free (non Steam version) as well.The difference between this roguelike and many of the other classic ones (NetHack, ADOM, DCSS, Brogue, Angband etc) is the use of an unlock/progression system. This progression system is similar to what you'd see in many modern roguelites (Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon, Crypt of the Necrodancer etc) where you unlock new races, classes, abilities and lore as you play or do specific tasks.The game has a very active and friendly player base and modding community, they will always help you out if you ask for help or suggestions if you're stuck or have support problems with the game.Personally ToME is a game I've played for close to 1700 hours (both on Steam and the DRM-free version). I highly recommend if for all roguelike and turn-based RPG fans.			"

												One of the most entertaining and well done rogue-likes I've played in a long time. The UI is understandable, there's tooltips for pretty much everything - In essence everything missing from a lot of rogue-likes. And that is just the shinies - The game itself is very deep as well. There's a very well made 'story' mode (it is HARD the first 100 times you try :)) and you will quickly unlock the regular rogue-like endless dungeon (which can also be accessed by a story-mode character once you've completed the story).There's tons of races and classes, a lot of which needs to be unlocked from playing the story - They classes play very differently, with huge scope for customization, so almost endless replayability.I could go on - This is probably one of my most played games of all time - If you have ANY love for rogue-likes - Or looking to try one that is easy to get into - this is the game for you.

												You will die. You will probably die a lot. With that said, the game is honestly quite fun and almost entirely fair. Fairness in a Roguelike is, of course, a bit subjective, but you will very rarely run into dead before you know what hit you situations. For those of you who aren't into the ""One Life to Live"" concept of Roguelikes, there is a mode that lets you have extra lives at set points so that dire badger isn't the end of your career.The classes are varied and each have their unique flair, transparency in mobs is pretty great even though there'll still be a learning curve here or there and it has a ridiculous amount of achievements for those who thrive on that.

												One of the most competent, well developed games I've had the pleasure to play. It has a well realised world, huge class depth and variety (with a bounty of class/race unlocks), and a punishing dungeon system that rarely makes you shake your head at the game design instead of your own mistakes. Permadeath in such a world is a rewarding experience. It challenges the player to be better, learn and achieve what at first seemed beyond reach. The RPG elements adds a breath of fresh air to the roguelike genre, allowing both cookie cutter and more exploratory builds to achieve hard won, weary glory.A special mention should go to the lore and world building. No large, tired, trope laden exposition exists here. Instead the world is littered with lore and item lore that slowly builds up a far greater picture through multiple playthroughs of a living, damaged world.			"

												What first brought me to this game was the sheer variety of class selection. If you've ever played a fantasy character that fought in a particular way and you enjoyed it, chances are ToME has you covered. Spellcasters, melee fighters, melee spellcaster fighters, anti-spellcaster fighters, anti-spellcaster non-spell casters (Slimes, foreals though). Rogues, spell-casting rogues even, as well as ranged ones, and traps are pretty op. Bows, slings, guns. Telekenesis as a caster or because you think wielding weapons with your mind is a good time, I mean you can do that AND beat things up with the weapon in your own hands. Uh.. Yeah there's a lot to go, just try the game. I have around triple what Steam reports, I played it a year or so prior to it coming to Steam, but this game has been around a day or two, go look it up. TL;DR: So much class depth and variety, if that's your thing, have at it.			"

												I bought this game on a whim during the Steam winter sale. I wasn't even sure if I liked Roguelikes, let alone whether or not I'd like this game. However, it has completely shattered my expectations in a good way. I love the looting, the fighting, the tactics, the world it builds, and the history is hints at through books and other sources in the game. It's a very fun game that you can play in short bursts due to its turn-based nature, or you can sit and play for hours without even realizing that it's now dark outside. This is a game that I can see myself playing for years to come, and I'm very happy with this purchase. At this price tag, you can't go wrong for hours and hours of actual fun. Pick this one up if you like turn-based games, or roguelikes. You won't regret it.			"

												Absolute favorite roguelike. I could play this game forever and be content. There's an incredible amount of gameplay, and incentive to go through the game multiple times due to unlockable races and classes, powers, etc. My favorite class is the Oozemancer, which is an interesting twist on a sort of druid/mage that focuses on nature/poison type magic. It's still in active development too, and has been for a long time. You can see character and player stats on the te4.org webpage too. AND there's a neat way to transfer items between characters, in case you're the type of person that likes to collect one of everything you can throw them on a storage-type character and dispense them to others as needed.If you're curious about this game's roots, check out ToME 2.3.5, which was an entirely different version of the game listed on Steam, but with a Tolkien theme (Tales of Middle Earth) and in ASCII. The 2.3.x branch is still under development, but not as active as this one. It's worth checking out also.			"

You've got a clear goal, clear progression, and you will get better the more you play. The varied randomized items are great, and the uniques are fun and powerful. There's also the amazing character vault on the main website, which everyone should check out. It's nice to know your character will be cemented in ToME history, and may even help others in their win.			"

												If I was asked to explain why I play TOME so much, I wouldn't be able to use any of my reasons to convince someone to purchase it.This game is one of the best RPGs out there, period. This is offset, of course, by the fact that it's about as forgiving and accessible as a brick wall. With spikes on it. And it's somehow firing a steam gun at you.This is a game that almost kneecaps itself at every turn, in my opinion, only just barely getting good quality out of an idea that could have easily left this game yet another greyed out title on my library.It's a massive game, sporting over a thousand bloody achievements, but you'll be suffering from roughly twelve types of PTSD by the time you get through the first batch of dungeons and actually start the story.There's a massive amount of variety between god knows how many classes that are available, but they'll all probably die the same way.There's a never ending slew of new sights to see and enemies to fight, but every one of them will probably either lead you to or be followed by a gruesome death.This all being because, as the game so proudly states, it's a roguelike. And as a roguelike it's just about the worst made game I've ever played. Don't take that the wrong way, the game is great, but it's roguelike elements sell it short in places. To justify this, before I am impaled by a billion pitch forks, I'll remind you of FTL, faster than light. By all accounts, a great game. But FTLs biggest shortcoming was its final boss, which required near perfect planning and exceptional luck to beat, and when you lost, as it was whenever you lost, you were sent back to the start of this fairly long game.FTLs permanent death did no poor job of making you value your ship, and the game was just short enough to make it tolerable. This mentality has been taken in TOME and turned up to seven billion. You could complete a run of FTL in the time it takes you to get through the first batch of dungeons in this game, and the threat of losing it all doesn't get any smaller as you go on.Well, that's not entirely true. The default difficulty for TOME gives you a handful of lives to play around with, you can of course turn it up to true roguelike, but I'm fairly sure that was meant as a joke. However, the lives system does not take away from the fact that you, unless you're amazing at this game, are going to die from something out of your control at least once. And by ""at least"" I mean if you have the blood of a leprechaun in your veins and are blessed with uncanny luck. The rest of us are going to be suffering a lot more than thatThat brings me neatly onto the most glaring turn off from this game. It's villain. You see, this villain, is not a character that you meet, nor is it a magical force, nor a force of nature. It is a concept, and it is always with you, breathing down your neck, plotting its next attack, ready to steal yet another life away from you without warning, nor mercy. This villain, is the RNG.For you will spend your time in this game preparing for when next the RNG will strike. You will hesitate as you assign level up points to consider ""Will this help me survive when the RNG strikes?"", you will creep around each and every corner, terrified that around it, the RNG will be lying in wait, ready to put all your talents on cooldown, poison you, and chop off half your health all in a single turn. The RNG is your worst, and only enemy, for the enemies that are not affected by it, you shall slaughter in the thousands, you will be prepared for each and every boss that you encounter, through hours of rigorous training, but you can never be fully ready for the minions of the RNG.In all seriousness, I cannot remember the last time I died in this game to a boss that I fought poorly, or a talent that I used carelessly. I have, however, lost count of how many times I have died to elite wolves with steamguns, to gelatanious cubes with lightning magic, to the boss of the level spawning literally a square away from the level entrance. The game is difficult, but when the RNG bears its teeth in the worst possible way, there isn't much you can do except backpedal to the level entrance and go level some more in a different dungeon, and that's if the poison doesn't get you, because it is always poison.In short, purchase this game, that's an order. But expect to be a different man/woman/other by the time you've completed it, mainly because your hair will have gone white and you may have aged a few years. It's not impossible, and I'm slowly learning the ways of this horrifyingly difficult world, but I expect to be doing so for a while. "

												I got a lot more than I bargained for with Tales of Maj'Eyal. I wasn't expecting much because of the low price point and odd graphics, but I've spent hundreds of hours in the game since I bought it (and all of that was before I installed my Steam copy).Every character class has widely varied and interesting abilities, which makes them feel unique and fun. Warriors and rogues don't have quite as much to do as mages, but they aren't just ""easy mode"" like with some games, and the way their abilities behave makes the tactical battles as dramatic and fascinating as if they had magical powers.Practically every enemy has interesting abilities of its own, and even small ones can be dangerous if you aren't careful. The AI is simple, but effective. You can't just kite your way through fights. Small mistakes can escalate danger quickly, and death is rough (if you're playing on Adventure or Roguelike difficulties, at least), but when I die, it's usually my fault, and I can do better next time.Loot is plentiful, but easily managed, since you have an inventory item that stores new pick-ups, and sells off junk at the end of each area (at no loss, even). It takes a little while to figure out what items are good for your character, but once you know, inventory management is a breeze.The story is mainly told through notes you pick up, and the lore is pretty deep and interesting. I'm there for the combat, though, so I'm glad subsequent playthroughs aren't bogged down by having to wait through dialogue and story scenes.The game is very thoughtfully crafted, and I greatly appreciate the effort that was clearly put into it. I can see myself playing this game for thousands of hours and still enjoying the heck out of it.			"

												This is a surprisingly good roguelike. There are loads of things (classes, races, skills, cosmetic options etc.) to unlock simply by playing the game, loads of very different classes which al have different ways of playing. The game is difficult, but you can choose whether it's classic roguelike (permadeath), if you start with multiple lives, or if you can continue as often as you'd like. Additionally, you get a warning if you enter an area which is way too difficult or easy for your current level. However, there's always the chance of a nasty surprise if you decide to open a sealed off door.. There is a lot of really strong loot to find and secrets to discover. Not everything happens in every run, so you have to keep your eyes open. Ultimately, I'd highly recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal as well as its DLC. It's a hidden gem which you can spend loads of time on without running out of stuff to do.			"
