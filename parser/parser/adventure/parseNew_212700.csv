												Party of Sin unfortunately doesn't quite hit the ""Action platformer adventure"" mark.The game is a speed challenge, and if that's your thing then I guess you could enjoy it, but otherwise I suggest picking another game.I bought it expecting what is advertised - an action platformer adventure - but the ""action"" parts can be summed up as single-button mashing, the platformer sections are incredibly weak and the ""adventure"" part... Well, I finished the game in less than four hours, so it's more like a short trip than a full adventure.The game has some ""fun"" modes which you can buy for upgrade points (which you earn in the missions) such as invulnerability, super speed and big-head mode. Those are fine, except the controls are not responsive enough for the super-speed, and it's crystal-clear the speed challenges were all designed with the super-speed active in mind.In conclusion: the game is fun, but short, and the speed challenge does not carry it. If you are looking for an action platformer, give it a miss.			"

												I have to be honest, I only played a little of this game.Enough to play around with all the Sins (and unlock the Steam Trading cards, of course).But seriously, this game disappointed me. I'd actually like it a lot more if it looked and felt better.I think the story is cool and I like this take on the ""7 Deadly Sins"".However, the graphics and gameplay are clunky and sometimes less responsive than they should be.I know how easy it is to misjudge jumping from the edge of a platform and that really began to annoy me.The screenshots look a lot better than the game does.I think the setting, backgrounds etc look good but the characters look terrible.There isn't even an animation when they turn around to face another direction.I'm not voting this down because it's a bad game. I'm voting it down because I think it has so much more potential and they didn't capture that in this release. I hope it gets a big upgrade and then I'd love to play it properly.			"

												Can't recommend this.  It plays kinda like a poor man's Trine.Combat and movement feel rather awkward and stiff.  Limited melee range with only 1 of your characters having a ranged attack. Not a whole lot of feedback for hitting/getting hit.  Enemies bouncing on your head for 3-4 seconds or visa versa.The two boss battles I've gone through have been about avoiding 1 hit kills.  The first one, who's only attack knocked you into the lava below or the second one who's two attacks caused knockback if you were close enough or instantly killed you if you were under it.7 Characters is a tad bit too much.  Having to remember their keybinds combined with needing to quickly switch between 2-4 characters for puzzles and some characters only being useful for a few seconds throughout an entire level leads to a lot of confusion.Better off just replaying Trine or something.

												This game is a tricky one to review - I love the core ideas of the game, but not the execution in many ways. You control the 7 deadly sins in a 2D platformer most similar to Trine. In fact, you can argue that a lot of this game is inspired from Trine. Switching between heroes, combat, puzzles (sometimes usiing physics), and even the floaty controls are all reminiscent of Trine.First of, I adore the concept of the game. All seven of the deadly sins look and feel like what they are representing and each of the powers of the sins fits in well, the perhaps the exception of Envy, who supermans it up and shoots a freaking laser from her eyes. I was not aware that was a thing with Envy. However, you can tell what each character represents well and, on top of that, the game introduces you to them one by one and allows you to use their powers.I see this game as three different parts: the platforming part, the combat part, and the puzzle part. As a platformer, this game is decent. Its not terrible, but there are far better platforming games to play rather than this one. Honestly, its rather basic with not much experimentation. Nothing broken, but nothing amazing as well.The combat part is really rough. Although each of the sins have a visually different basic attack, they all feel too similar to make in impact. In fact, I am not sure if there even was a difference. Combat is also affected by the sins; unique powers, but too often combat was too frantic to make meaningful options. I could use Sloth to slow them down, switch to Lust to charm the other, and dash in using Pride... or I can use Gluttony to one shot them and regain health, melee another while healing all the damage, and one shot the other. Why bother switching sins when Gluttony is so much better. This is the biggest issue with the game, unless I am forced to switch, I generally stuck to Gluttony for combat and Greed, with his huge hookshot, to platform and start fights. The rest waited their turn for their needed role in the puzzles spread throughout.Which, by the way, is by far the best aspect of the game. The puzzles are well designed and tricky and had elements from across the board. Sometimes you ran across a physics puzzle, sometimes a simple mirror-reflection puzzle, sometimes a timing and precision puzzle. This is where the game shined, the sins need to work in tandem and that gave me the most satisfaction when playing.As I said, this game is hard to review since this game is all over the place, however, given its price and inclusion in indie bundles, I will give it a recommendation. Play it if it is in your library, you can easily beat it in a play session or two.			"

												Party of Sin is a side scrolling puzzler with a heap of fighting involved, much along the lines of the original Prince of Persia. The difference here being that Party of Sin doesn’t just contain the single playable character, but instead allows you to control characters representing the seven deadly sins – Greed, Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth, Lust, Pride and Envy.Each of the Sinful characters has two abilities – a fighting move and a special move that is required to complete the puzzles. Each of the Sins are introduced individually early on in the game, giving you an indication on how each performs.The puzzles are the strong suit of Party of Sin. Early on, you are given the basics of each of the Sins and their abilities and the puzzles are straightforward, requiring the gamer to simply use the power of each Sin in turn. But as the game progresses, you are required to add the abilities of multiple characters in order to solve the problems. Each of the Sins can also have their abilities upgraded. These upgrades cost Apples which can be collected through the levels. Unfortunately, the fighting section of the game is the weak point. The combat controls are simple, but the fighting is way too easy. From a visual standpoint, the game had me reminiscing of the classic Golden Axe, albeit with improved resolutions. The backgrounds in the early are rather dull, with loads of bricked landscapes, but later on are more colourful and a bit nicer to look at. Party of Sin tries to be a decent title, but it just lacks a bit of polish. Actually, it lacks a lot of polish. With upgraded visuals and better controls and some adjustments to the dull combat system, the game could have been really good. Overall 5/10.			"

												I should have listened to the mixed reviews.It plays like trine but instead of balancing 3 characters you juggle seven.If I'm going to play a platformer the controls must be crips and precise and the combat must be engaging and dynamic. Instead I'm presented with levels that challenge me as far as switching to the appropriate character. What a headache.			"

												The game is another of the side-scrolling dime-a-dozen platformer variety, where you swap out between multiple characters. In this case, the characters are the Seven Deadly Sins, with a very loose story making them relevant. There isn't anything that this game does that hasn't been done a million times before. Some puzzles require fast-swapping characters, so memorizing button commands is essential, as bringing up the character change wheel takes to long to allow you to switch in time to perform the necessary action. The button commands for swapping to various Sins don't go in order or correspond to the number of the sin, so this is more trial and error, and you'll find yourself memorizing certain buttons for segments of thirty seconds or so. This becomes tedious and repettitive, and there are many boss fights where one Sin will outshine the others, or where you'll need to swap Sins mid-battle. If you die at any point during a boss fight due to a botched jump or from one of the boss's attacks that has an incorrect hitbox, you have to start over from the beginning of the fight.			"

												I rarely post reviews, but this game has the honor of being the first one I would call ""exceptionally bad"".It could be a result of my high expectations, though, as the main idea clearly had a lot of potential.However, that potential lied in the possibility for creative character abilities, but each character has only two moves; melee and special. These are supposed to be the Seven Mortal Sins - and all wrath can do is headbutt and punch. Upgrade him and he gets some short-range boomerangs. So this became less a game of 7 inherently different characters and more of one character with 7 abilities who can punch people.The graphics are below par.I bought for the plot, and it wasn't there.And the greatest sin throughout the game lies in the controls; having to quickly switch between seven different characters is dreadful yet required for the puzzles.Perhaps it was released too early.Perhaps funding was cut.But the only thing about this game which did not disappoint was the trading card value on the community market.Perhaps then you can get some of your money back.

												The poorest man's Trine. If were any poorer, you wouldn't be able to pay attention. The platforming is as boring as it gets, combat (somehow) even more so. The graphics are poor and the cut scenes are drawn according to the ""highest"" standart of web comics. Sound bites from the characters are poor, boring and repetative, especially when you factor in the constant need to switch them. Goes double for some of the more obnoxious puzzles. Also, purgatory is, for some reason, a land of conveyor belts, gears and boxes. It's as puzzling a decision as buying this game.			"

												Surpringly good since I expected to farm cards and delete this game from my hard drive forever, but I played a couple levels, then one more... and felt like I wanted to finish the game. Graphics are nothing special, fights are not very exciting, but it's a fun puzzle platformers. It's a low-budget game, but it's rather well done.There is a decent challenge but never too difficult or frustrating (I will admit having used a youtube video once, near the end). The concept is similar to Trine, but you have 7 characters instead of 3, you have to alternate between each of them to use their special power to solve the puzzle and move to the next one. There are many (easy) fights to bring some action, but it's really the puzzles that make the game. Don't pay full price for this, get it in a bundle and you might enjoy around 5 hours of moderate fun if you like this kind of game. 6.5/10			"

												Its so similar to Trine that i can't stop comparing it with Trine while playing and Trine is much better game for sure.One of the few differences is that Party of Sin has 7 characters while Trine has 3. Each character symbolizes a capital sin but the relationship between the character and the sin is so weak that i would have forgotten it if their names were not the name of the sin like Gluttony, Pride etc. Trine characters are more simple and polished. Gameplay of Trine is much stable and graphics are better than Party of Sin. I can't compare the story as i haven't completed Party of Sin but considering the beginning i'm not expecting much.Don't waste your time with Party of Sin, play Trine insted!			"

												After playing just about an hour and a half before and after work, I can remark that Party of Sin is a largely enjoyable venture. It provides its antiheros (the seven deadly sins) with suitable interesting powers that work off each other well, it combines those in combat satisfyingly, and it breaks up the brawling with a few simple puzzles that apply the powers and skills of all the sins. The story is also pretty good, scrambling up elements of Christian dogma with a few new ideas to give everyone a sense of purpose.It could definitely use polish. When the game's first boss is a lava narwhal, it's creative as hell but it feels like they're not recognizing how enjoyable the mythology and world building are for a game like this.The controls, generally speaking, are tight, and I could see people having a lot of fun speed-running the crap out of this. They've already sort of set it up for exactly that, though blustering through isn't my style.The one thing I wish is that we could rebind the keys. I never leave the jump key on space bar- I move it over to my mouse's side buttons as a holdover from the days I used a laptop to play Minecraft.			"

												Party of Sin is a puzzle platformer in which you play as the seven deadly sins battling demons to break out of hell.  You can play single-player or 2-4 player local co-op.Cool idea, poor execution.  The game is a little too fast-paced for me (some of the puzzles I encountered gave only a very short window of time to perform a convoluted combination of maneuvers), some of the the enemies are way too overpowered (you're dead in 2 shots in almost entirely melee combat), and I found the bosses frustrating.

												This is a pretty interesting little puzzle platformer.  Basically the idea is that you have several characters that represent one of the seven deadly sins (sloth, greed, lust, wrath, pride, envy, and gluttony) and each one has a special power or two that will help you get past certain obstacles.Greed for example has a grappling hook made to connect to various hook areas in the level, and he can also use this to grab powerups and pull down enemies who are flying.  Pride has this ♥♥♥♥♥in armor, and sword and can do a charge move that allows him to horizontally extend his jumps.  Gluttony can eat enemies for extra healing (though it doesn't happen instantly, you have to digest them a bit first or it just vomits them back out).You can only play as one at any given time, but you can switch between characters freely as many times as you want during a level, and there are various shortcuts to making these choices (told to you as you play).  To top it all off, apparently there's a co-op play mode where you can each play a different character, though you presumably can switch between any character at any time (so long as it's not already in use).This is one case for sure that I'd recommend using a controller vs trying to use keyboard and mouse.  While you CAN play with the keyboard, it feels awkward and there IS combat to worry about. I assume you could just spend the time to ""get good"" with mouse and keyboard, but it's not going to grant you any real advantages over the controller here.  The story is mostly forgettable and only really exists to explain WHY you're playing as the seven deadly sins.  It's the most unnecessary exposition since ""Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president?"".  Maybe it'll get better later but for the most part, watch it once, cringe, and then play and forget it exists.I haven't seen anything that complicated or challenging, but I've only played through the first few levels.  Maybe the story and challenge will improve as time goes on?  Still though, it's a fun game and worth the purchase if you're looking for a nice little platformer to play.			"

												So THIS game seemed promising! A Lost Vikings style adventure platformer where you can switch between the Seven Deadly Sins, all with unique abilities!? Yes please!And then I played it....why does Sloth have a boomerang teddy bear? Why does Greed have a grappling hook? Why does Lust destroy perfume bottles to make platforms? I mean really, guys. If you're going to use subject matter like the Seven Deadly Sins, you could at least try and make it the *least* bit thematically interesting or mildly cool. It sounds like someone was trying to make a Naruto game and at the last minute lost the license, so went with the Old Testament instead(since that's royalty free).  With mouse+keyboard, it feels glitchy and buggy - super slow to turn and hit boxes are all wonky.  The idea was great, but they just failed in the execution - play Trine instead.			"

												Very underated game.  People compare it to trine because of the idea of having multiple characters with different abilities to solve puzzles, but having played them both back to back (trine first, then this game) this game has a very unique feel to it.Pros:-7 characters to use and it is easy to switch seamlessly between them, every character is assigned a shortcut key, it will take some time to learn them all but once you do switching between all 7 becomes seamless, there is also a character wheel you can use while you get used to the shortcuts.-each character has different combat abilites, while the combat is not deep, I did enjoy it more than trine.  In trine I always found I would just hang back with the archer and shoot everyone, this game gives you more variety in how you handle combat and in later levels it forces you to use all your characters in battles.  -very inventive puzzles, this is not a physics based game, and while some of the puzzles are cookie cutter a good deal of them are brilliantly done.  You will spend a few minutes trying to figure out what to do and then you will actually have to execute your plan, quickly in many cases since many of the puzzles are timed.  Except for one puzzle at the very end of the game, I enjoyed the puzzles in this game tremendouslyCons:-bosses are simple learn pattern, attack, rinse repeat kind of affairs.  I did enjoy the last boss battle, but the other bosses were pretty simple and a bit repetitive.Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game, it does lack a certain level of polish but if your into puzzle platformers with a nice mix of action thrown in you could do a lot worse than this game.

												Good game, fun and simple. Just too simple, and way too expensive for such an easy game. A great idea, but the gameplay does not add up to the value of the money needed to buy. Lower the price, then we'll talk.			"

												Playing this game about 2 hours, this game is great. The story about 7 deadly sins run away from hell and take revange really interesting. game play just good with abit awkward control with mouse. What can i say this game just as good as another 2D adventure game and fun to play. i don't know everyone else rate this game as a bad game, maybe just because the weird control. But trust me this game didn't that bad even though the price really expensive from this kind of game. Well, i got this game on sale so its worth it.			"

												Recommended is perhaps a bit strong but I had fun with this. It is a Trine-like puzzle platformer and if you're a fan of that sub-genre then there is some value here but don't expect it to match up to Trine's level of polish. This is very much amateur hour by comparison. Parts of it are definitely misguided. Particularly the boss battles which just aren't fun, interesting or exciting. The combat is also hilariously unbalanced. Envy has a beam attack that you can fire constantly and can shred anything at range and Gluttony has a move that swallows an enemy whole and recharges his health while digesting it which basically makes him a tank that wanders about the battle field almost impervious to most normal attacks occasionally swallowing people. Everyone else is basically useless outside of the puzzles and (later in the game) for breaking the colour coded enemy shields. The basic problem is that character roster is too bloated. If they'd dropped one of the powers and given two each to three characters then it would have been a better game. They'd have had to drop the seven deadly sins thing of course but honestly, I'd struggling to see that as a bad thing. Like most high concept ideas it turns out to be nothing more than a paper thin conceit once stretched out to fit over a complete creative work.			"

												NO!  Stop.  This is garbage.  The drawings are elementary level at best, like disproportionate crayon scribble, with many characters rendered simply as shadows.  The main pro(an)tagonist of the angels isn't even rendered.  The story is preposterous.  Gameplay feels about like Diddy Kong.  This game angers me.  I want the sins, the angels, the devil.. all of them to die.  What a party?!			"

												Party Of Sin is an adventure game. In this game there are a lot of characters: Envy, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth and Wrath. The game is not interesting to me, because it is like a game of strategy in every mision must be replaced after a couple of times characters. In the end, the game I don't like.			"

												Haven't tried it in co-op yet, but the single player experience has been enjoyable thus far.  Switching between sins on the fly is fun and means you can approach combat in a variety of different ways; for example, I quite like to pull flying angels down with Greed's hook, and then swallow them with Gluttony.Puzzle segments are interspersed with combat segments, which break up the levels nicely and provide something for fans of both.  The difficulty curves pretty nicely too, although some of the bosses seem a lot more difficult than the rest of the game.Overall, a good offering for fans of action or puzzle platformers.			"

												Highly reccomended. Puzzles start off easy then go right to the hair tearing until you remember ""Oh wait....i can just use THIS sin!"". word of warning, some of the boss battles are irritating. one hit kills irritating. also those who don't want to pick this up because they don't want religion shoved down their throats (myself included) trust me, the game doesn't get preachy. you can pretty much swap out the theme for anything so don't worry. also reccomend grabbing a couple of xbox controllers and plug it in for some old school 2-4 player co-op.

												I really enjoyed playing this game. I like the graphics, the story and the hero-changing-playstyle. There is only one big bug which keeps me from entering the 4th level.Everytime I start it, the game crashes after like 10 seconds. I have no idea what causes this crash. There is a hint in the discussion forum which advises to change the Windows regional settings to English (I am German) but that didn't help in my case. I already searched for other fixes but didn't find any besides that one.I also had some crashes after finishing the first level and in between the next two ones but I could just restart the game and then everything went fine. Up to the 4th level ...So for me the game is unplayable and I don't think there will be a fix in the future because of little activity around this game in the near past. If you have a hint how to repair the game (reinstalling doesn't help) then please tell me, I feel really bad about not recommending it :(			"

												This game had so much potential but as I am completely unable to change the controls and even after trying how they are, this game is unplayable and I am leaving disappointed.   If the option to be able to change the controls from the 'god awful' WASD scheme to a custom setting, I would truly love this game.But at this time, I am pleading a pass and I wish I could have asked for a refund instead of idling for the cards for the game.  I would gladly give the .35 that I earned from the card sales to be able to pass on this game.For a cheat...press the following by using the keys in the order I am giving you here.(UP, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT....back to the story and ask for a refund.)   ...yep, thats about right.

I played all the way through the game with 3 friends, and we had a blast. The game is like Trine, but straight up broken. The game is really bad, but in the comical way that will leave you and your friends laughing for days. If you are looking to have a ball with some friends, definitely pick up this title, and make sure not to take it seriously. "

												Surprisingly modest indie puzzle platformer for the $6 I paid. While the game lacks polish/story is fairly nonexistent/the gameplay leaves much to desired, Party of Sin does not disappoint; Trine players will feel at home. Mechanics are easy to understand and well explained. Seems like coop is only local?			"
