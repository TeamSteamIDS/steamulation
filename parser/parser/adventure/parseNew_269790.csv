												DreadOut is an Indonesian survival-horror game that takes inspiration from the Fatal Frame franchise, and pulls a lot from Indonesian myths and folklore.You play as a non-talkative protagonist known as Linda, who with a few friends is on a car trip. They stumble upon a weird deserted city that isn't marked on their map... The friends go to investigate the town, and soon get wrapped up in some severe hauntings from the strange ghost that start coming out when night falls.The game has a low-budget, and it shows. Graphically everything looks outdated, with low-res textures, odd character animations, and the like. There's also no real-time shadows. The game also has a few bugs. I didn't encounter anything game-breaking, but a few 'look through the wall with the camera', 'get stuck on an object for a moment', 'that character is levitating,' type of bugs, However, something I found interesting was that they didn't copy and paste many models. There were a lot of posters around town, and each one was legitimately different. Same with pictures, and just small details all about.Outside of a few chairs or piles of garbage, most of the models were unique to each other, and I was surprised the developers didn't take many shortcuts.Mentioning this, something I noticed about the game is that there were a lot of secrets and original assets used for things that most players would probably not even end up finding or seeing. There's more I have to say on the topic, but I'll get back to this in a bit.The game has legitimately great atmosphere. There are some fantastic scares, the feeling of unnerve that is caused by the game. It has an atmosphere to it that most horror games these days are missing from the days of old, sort of a combination of dread and excitement for what's going to come next. The atmosphere and scares are more akin to something like Fatal Frame or Kuon than Amnesia or Outlast, I should mention. Recommended at night and in darkness, with headphones.This is backed by fantastic audio design. The music is great, the sounds are great. Voicing is okay, a bit cheesy but enjoyably so. However, with the music, how it is and how it's used in the game, is really effective, and also I can mention unique. The music is very different than any other horror game I have played, but very effective. And how the music transitions with events going on is very well-done. The audio is also unnerving, and sometimes hearing a weird sound, even without knowing its source or even without it leading to anything, raised the tension. It sometimes gets hard to tell if a sound you just heard is part of the music, or something in the environment, but I say this as a good thing.And the game does not lie on its laurels. By this I mean a lot happens, and the game never throws the same thing at you twice. I was honestly surprised by the number of ghosts there are in this game, there were a lot more than I was anticipating. Some great enemy variety, and you fight each ghost really only once or twice, there was not a single ghost I think the game threw at you a third time. And the 'events' that happen, like scares or atmospheric additions, were all incredibly varied too. This definitely helped to raise the intrigue as you never knew what might be coming next, and some of what happens really goes into the unexpected.Combat is similar to Fatal Frame, but a bit more simplistic. There isn't a charge rate like Fatal Frame, or a point system, but the closer enemies are, the more you damage them when you take a shot. And if you attack them right before they attack you, you deliver additional damage.Even the puzzles are well done and intelligent. Figuring out what to do is fun, and they do a good job at laying out clues to what you need to do to help piece it all together. They have clever hints and details, while not being extremely obvious either. However, it should be mentioned that those with less patience and less of a desire to figure out cryptic clues may not like how they're handled. But if you loved puzzles from horror games in the 90s (which have been notably absent in recent years), then you'll likely be quite happy to see some return to form here.One of the game's biggest draws is some absolutely memorable moments. Several of the ghost encounters are absolutely fantastically handled and designed, the pacing of the game is wonderful for the most part (though may some end up stuck in the school for a while), and there's good variety with all of it. Some of the moments, such as the sit-down with Ira or the whole Mansion location, are absolutely stellar, and strike me as quality horror moments, something that has been missing from so many horror games, the sort of intrigue, weirdness, and execution that leads these moment to be gripping and chilling.What they have here is fantastic, it legitimately is one of the best classic-styled survival-horror games to release in the last few years, and I think genre enthusiast who like certain elements of horror games that have been absent since the days of old will really appreciate the game. It's well-paced, well-executed, and well realized. It's low-budget, but those who enjoy the genre likely won't be bothered by this, some absolutely fantastic horror games over the years have been decidedly low-budget. The developers only had $26k to make the game, but they have managed to with that make a very confident horror game, and honestly some of the most fun I've had in a horror game in a while.The weird thing is the secrets I mentioned earlier. There are complete sections of the game you could miss if you don't do some exploration. There are ghosts you won't fight unless you go off the beaten path. A tip to the wise is when it turns night-time and before you enter the school, don't enter the school like the game suggests and instead head back towards the town you just came from. There are different types of ghosts if you head backwards at this point that you'll never encounter in the main game. And little hidden areas and easter eggs to uncover all about. So on that front, there is some really cool optional content to explore in the game.There's also a few cool unlockables. Once you complete the game, you unlock additional outfits, all of which are actually pretty well designed, and can be used on a second and later playthrough.There's also a few side areas you can explore right now that don't really lead to anything, which I can only guess are there right now for the possible future Free Roam Mode (a lot of buildings and side-areas off the beaten-path are currently inaccessible or kind of barren right now, and I assume will be open in the free-roam mode the developers are working on). I want DreadOut to succeed. I really liked what was here, I'd even go as far to say this is the best attempt at making a 'classic' style horror game to release in the last few years, really having an understanding of those gripping elements that made those games enjoyable (a deeper level of meaning and not just superficially being classic styled with fixed camera angles and tank controls). The whole game will probably take someone 4 - 9 hours, depending on how much they explore and find hidden areas and how long they take on puzzles.DreadOut is completely worth experiencing. It's tense, sometimes terrifying, has the right amount of weirdness to it, some absolutely stellar moments, and is actually a lot of fun. Its low budget shows, especially in the graphics department, but through clever design, good execution, and variety at hand, manages to be a fun and memorable experience.			"

												Most of what I said below still applies, but after seeing how short the game was, how awkward the game's overall control scheme is, and how confusing and nonexistent the plot/character development is, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have a diverse taste in survival horror games or who aren't enormous Fatal Frame buffs.. My voice over friends being on this project made my first impression a bit biased, and as a longtime gamer I feel like this game was coded somewhat poorly and doesn't hold up well. Just kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth.---------------------Solid game. The first enemy I saw (about 15 minutes in) literally had me breathless and scared for my life, and most horror games these days don't do it for me.The interesting thing is, I'm a voice-actor, and all my voice-acting friends provide voices for the main cast of characters. They're all experienced professionals and they give the game a believable atmosphere, with crystal-clear audio quality not commonly found in indie games.The only cons I can say so far are the really low-resolution textures (mostly in daylight outside, which is a brief experience) and the very jerky/clunky character animations make you realize just how indie/low-budget the game is. Some characters seem to moonwalk a little bit while the cutscene animations are really jerky and twitchy. It lends itself REALLY well to the scary parts when enemies are twitching and convulsing, but when two girls are playing patty-cake in the beginning it looks super bizarre for some reason.If you ever get stuck like I did (the game throws you in with literally ZERO tutorials) there's a 'How to Play' section at the title screen. It shows you the first enemy you deal with, and it can't be defeated, and it suggests that you need an item to defeat it. I think that's kinda cool, since tutorials ruin the atmosphere and it feels better to search for the answer.			"

												I haven't felt compelled to write a review in a while, but I think this game deserves one considering how quickly I've seen some people write it off. (I include myself in that category)After completing Act 2, I think this is a rather charming game with some really solid ideas, if finicky execution. The ghost design is excellent, and there are some truly impressive individual sections. One that stands out in particular is an actual dialogue sequence with one of the ghosts.The game is weighed down in some spots by awkward pacing, poor conveyance and goofy NPC interactions. If you can muscle through those, you'll find a pretty solid indie horror game with a creative style that sets it apart from the standard first-person ""roam through dark hallways"" genericity of many of its peers.It's quirky, it's fun, and surprisingly frightening. The final boss fight is a trippy, delightful end that wraps up the game very well.DreadOut has its flaws, but overall this is one of the few modern horror games I would call ""unique."" It's worth checking out solely for some of the cool sections in the second half of Act 2. Recommended!			"

												Although it may not be one of the most graphically appealing survival horror games, it's certainly worth checking out if it's for the right price.Aspects of DreadOut Worth Praising● Unique Mythology. The concept of using Indonesian folklore in a survival horror game is a unique one and exclusive to DreadOut.● Easy Achievements. Most of the achievements involve you taking a picture or whitnessing something.Aspects of DreadOut Worth Criticizing● Extremely Low Resolution Textures & Pop-In. This game showcases some the of worst textures in recent memory with some textures being worse than in games released 10 years prior! Regardless of your hardware specifications you're going to experience vegetation pop-in.● Settings Don't Update When Selected. You can't get past the first screen inwhich you select the language you desire your subtitles to be in unless you restart the game. You also can't change the resolution to a non-native resolution unless you restart your system while your desktop is in that desired resolution.● Pre-Rendered Cutscene Outfit Issue. Regardless of what outfit you're wearing from the Soundtrack & Manga downloadable content, some cutscenes will feature Linda in her default school outfit.			"

												Anyone who has played and enjoyed ""old-school"" survival horror, such as the Fatal Frame/Project Zero games or the first four installments of the Silent Hill series, will probably find something to like about this game. DreadOut borrows A LOT of elements from these two series, from the overall atmosphere of the enivronments to the use of a flashlight and an otherwise mundane, non-threatening object as a means of combat.Graphically, it's good. It's not stupendous, but it's certainly not horrible either. They're about on  par with what you would see in some the better PS2 games, and I mean that in a good way. The ghost designs are well done, especially the larger ones. They all look menacing and the fact that you have to photograph them to drive them off just makes them that much more unnerving. Unfortunately, some of them you may miss if you just press on through the game without doing some exploration outside of the school. The sound design is very well executed, from the ghost sounds to the overall ambience of the evironments. Since the game shrouds you in darkness and limits your field of vision when you do have your light on, sound is you're only indication of what is lurking around you before the visual cues appear. The music also enhances the atmosphere. There was one specific point in the game where the music was so eeire and off-putting that I was hesitant to press on any further. The voice acting is well done, at least the English is. I haven't played with Indonesian audio yet but I'd imagine the lip syncing may be better. The silent protagonist was also a good choice. It's better than listening to someone talk to themselves for the entire length of the game. The overall design of the game shows that a lot of thought was put into making it interesting without it being too cliched. The design of the school seems mazelike and unless you're paying attention to the signs above the classroom doors, it's easy to feel somewhat lost and like you're walking in circles. The puzzles are inventive, requiring you to use the camera to inspect the environment to find the solution rather than just finding a key lying around. The puzzles remind me of the kind you would come across in the early days of Silent Hill.Of course, there are a few gripes. Some of the textures look a little flat in spots. It's particularly noticable in the areas of the game that take place in the daytime. And if you don't take the time to really explore the environments, the game can seem rather short. There's a little replay value, if only to get the achievements, but not much. I was also somewhat irked by the fact that in the demo you could see the environment on the phone screen as you wandered around, even when you weren't in camera view. This isn't in the full game and it's a bit of a bummer. The phone screen is blank until you enter camera view. I know it's minor and it doesn't really affect gameplay, but I thought it was a nice touch and would have been worked into the mechanics somehow. For example: as you're looking around the environment you may notice something pass across the phone's screen that you don't see in normal view, prompting you to go into camera view for closer inspection.  Like I said, nothing major. More a personal opinion.All in all, it's a well executed game and fans of classic console-style survival horror will enjoy this. I just hope the next act will be released in a timely manner.			"

												First of all, I've got to admit that I appreciate what the devs are trying to do, especially seeing all these bland, boring post-amnesia and post-slender horror games. DreadOut is not just a collection of jumpscares and definitely not a ""get-out-from-the-creepy-labyrinth-while-a-monster-is-chasing-you"" kind of thing. It has a story to tell, puzzles to solve, a bunch of different monsters with backstories, it offers some variety and even something that reminds a battle system, so it's more like ""big"" horror games of the past decade. Too bad that the experience itself felt frustrating for me. The ""battle system"" where you need to take photos of monsters is messy (although you get used to it after a while), there are glitches here and there, monster designs are not scary (moreover, I couldn't help but laugh in some ""scary"" scenes), puzzles sometimes feel too cryptic, Act 2 has a totally different pacing than Act 1 and... I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I wasn't  scared at all, had only one or two moments when I felt somehow creepy. Despite of all this, the game has interesting ideas in both gameplay and story - and I totally loved the talk scene from the Act 2, DreadOut at its best. I wish there were more moments like that. I guess the reason for most of the problems is lack of experience of the devs, they're small indie team after all. Overall, honestly, I don't know if I can recommend this game or not, I have really mixed feelings about it. If some interesting ideas, great OST (totally going to buy it) and badass ending are enough for you to bear frustrating gameplay elements, you can buy it, it's most likely that you won't regret your decision. But I'll give it ""Yes"" because it tries to do something different in the genre.Hope my post was useful; it’s my first time writing a proper game review in English.			"

												The game itself feels like a stripped down Fatal Frame with a whole bunch of Indonesian ghost lore.If you wanna skip the lengthy part of my review and go straight to the pros and cons, you can find them below.But first things first: the story.You play as the Indonesian high school student Linda and you're just coming back from a trip with your school class. Your teacher drives down a road until she notices a blocked off bridge leading to an abandoned village. You don't know how you came here but you all decide to investigate. After investigating the village you find yourself in the school located there. Something terrible happens and you're trapped. Alone. Your main objective: get the hell out of this place!Linda herself has special abilities which make her sense and see supernatural beings that are nearby as well as items of interest.To stay with the story, it isn't too bad actually. The game is comprised of three acts, act 0, act 1 and act 2. Act 0 acts as a foreshadowing to act 1 and act 2 is the continuation of act 1, released almost over a year after the initial game release.  The story centers around a big chunk of supernatural beings from Indonesian folklore and has many twists to it. Also there are two endings to be achieved. Personally, I got one of the endings and it wasn't bad at all. Also, after act 1 the game gets much less cliché, effectively making everything more enjoyable.But... what about the gameplay? Well, here are the basics:You can run, walk, interact with a lot of doors and items and use your IrisPhone (harhar) to take photos. The camera is the key mechanic of the game. Taking photos is used to defeat ghosts and solve puzzles, the camera vision is also used to uncover hidden passages, invisible ghosts and progress through the game.Then there's the dying mechanic. And by that I mean: you can not ""die"". You may fail, but you will never get a ""game over"" screen. Once a ghost defeats you, you will end up at Limbo. From there you may head to a bright light and you'll be given a chance to go at it again.Also you may collect some items along the way. Even though there is an inventory, there is no combining of items to solve puzzles in any way. Which is kind of a shame, the game had some potential there.Since this is a horror game, the horror oughtta be there, right?Well, it is. As soon as it is nighttime, ghosts start to show up. When encountering some of them for the first time, they can be pretty scary. Through act 0 you will only encounter two of the many ghosts in the game - one of which is a heavy one. You can only sense it and see it through your camera, so when you need to get someplace fast but know there is a ghost breathing down your neck, you're kinda on edge. Act 1 features much more ghosts and if you're not prepared or know how to fight them or successfully get away from them you will get scared a lot. But after a while in act 1, you will know how to deal with those entities and then defeating them kinda loses its scaryness. So the horror doesn't last long. Until act 2, that is.For act 2 brings out a much wider variety of ghost mechanics that will put you on edge if you're playing it for the first time because you will get into situations where you just don't know what to do about them.But the horror doesn't only lie in the ghosts themselves. Act 2 does a lot with its surroundings. I won't spoiler anything though, but let me tell you this much: mirrors are the worst. Aside from that the game does underline its horror a lot with sounds and music, sudden turns of events and a couple of very well-placed jumpscares.It is quite rare that I appreciate jumpscares but the jumpscares in this game are just perfect. You'll never expect them, they will always catch you off guard and they aren't just cheap screamers with overly loud sound. They're good.So overall, the horror in this game will wear off quite quickly during act 1, but that only leads you into a false sense of security because act 2 is just so much different.But speaking of music, the soundtrack of this game features some really nice themes that are doing their job well. Some of them aren't for the horror of the game. These tracks just sound good.Back to the ghosts: A nice thing about this game is that every supernatural being you will encounter actually is a thing from Indonesian lore people in the real world believe in. That's a nice little detail. I adore that.Of course, not everything is good about the game. But this isn't about plot holes, boring combat or anything.The main issue I am going to adress here are the horrendous loading times and the performance which sometimes goes BAD. Also the texture resolution is still hilariously awful and doesn't justify the loading times one tiny bit. Seriously, I thought I forgot some options in the options menu but nope, the textures are just blurry and I can't do anything about it.On occassion this game's performance sucks♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, you're running around, moving your camera and BAM! you look in the opposite direction because the game was frozen for half a second and turned you around. Really annoying at night when you can't see sh*t. And the loading times are just awful. I don't even understand why they are so god damn awful. It's nothing on my end, that's for sure.On the technical side of things, I didn't get any crashes whatsoever. Just some bugs sometimes. On occasion the world won't load fully so you'll se the surroundings pop in one by one. And then there's starting from act 1 or act 2 which sometimes causes game breaking glitches. A restart usually fixes this however.Well, what else about the game?It has got some little details to it that I want to point out here before switching to the pros and cons.If you beat the game once you will be able to go to the back of the car in act 1 and choose between a selection of different outfits for Linda once you start a new game. Some traditional outfits as well as some casual outfits.This game has some pretty nice effects, especially when interacting with some of the ghosts (one in particular that shows up in act 2) up close.And the game has boob physics. Yay...?Also, there's a ton of eastereggs to find. Some are related to the developers, some are related to other horror games and some are just silly little things to brighten up your day.Oh and the English translation is sometimes... hilarious. Yeah. Hilarious. Let's leave it at that.So, off to the pros and cons.Pros:+ A semi-open world for you to explore, find hidden items, secrets and eastereggs+ A variety of different settings, you didn't honestly think all the spookyscariness will be in that school, did you?+ The supernatural beings are all reminiscent of Indonesian folklore+ Solid horror that will keep you on edge upon getting to act 2 because it changes up things dramatically+ Very good sounds and music+ Story's not all bad and got a lot of unexpected turns, some stuff can be foreseen though+ Good English voiceover, good animation quality, nice character design+ Impressive jumpscares+ Big ghost variety+ Runs well most of the time, no crashes+ Boob physics+ Female protagonist (that's always a plus)Cons:- You cannot die- The texture quality on the environment tends to be sub standard- Sometimes your framerate drops to 0 for half a second, effectively annoying the hell out of you- The horror in act 1 wears off quickly- Once you know how to deal with most enemies, killing them gets quite trivial (act 2 fixes a lot of this though)- Some achievements fail to work a lot of times- There's only two acts, wish there were more-+ Dat English translation thoWould I recommend this game? Yes.The horror's pretty decent and at the current price I'd call it commendable.Also it's nice to play an Indonesian horror game for a change.			"

												If you are a horror game fan, you should buy this game. you won't be disappointed!In game, you are Linda, an Indonesian school girl. After car accident, you and your friend are lost in haunted town. You must resolve some puzzle, defeat a lot of ghost by using your smartphone and camera, find the way out of the town.+ Good presentation, This game is from an indie development, So we shouldn't require a great graphics in this game. Graphics is not excelent and nice, But it is not too bad. The positive point is about gameplay and sounds.+ Very good sounds and music, Good voice acting, Music is very scary+ Story's not all bad and got a lot of unexpected turns, some stuff can be foreseen though+ Nice character design, Nice Ghost design, Ghosts are very scary+ Runs well, no crashes+ Female protagonist+ This game support Boob Physics+ Linda is cute- Performance is not stable. Sometimes your framerate drops to 0 for half a second, while u're running or looking around. This issue often happen in a school in act 1- Combat is too simple- Bad animation quality- Poor eniviroment graphics- You can't dieThe horror's pretty decent and it is commendableThank to Digital Happiness for making this game. it is my favorite horror game!

												I've been following this game for a very long while now and i've even played the non-steam demo last year they had for download. I have to say the game is really creepy and it offers a very good scary environment. Any fans of Fatal Frame will feel right at home with this game with a warm welcome feeling to new survival horror, because this game uses a similar atmosphere with a smartphone camera as your only defense against the ghosts. As a fan of survival horror games and Fatal Frame I recommend giving it a try. They have the demo on steam and the original demo i played last year.			"

												A survival horror game in which the protagonist, on a field trip that took a wrong turn in Mentalville, discovers an abandoned village and school with her classmates and increasingly ineffective teacher.Cue classmate getting possessed, everyone getting locked into the abandoned school and separated, and you have your game story. Effectively scary, but sadly, suffering from some performance issues and the like, there's still a fair bit about this game to like.Enjoy!Kouen & Lasharus rate this game 7.1 / 10Video Review Below:

												I went in with a head full of high hopes.  Unfortunately, the few decent ideas this game has are ruined by completely miserable gameplay and design.  Expect bugs, enemies that will stunlock you to death, a system that punishes the player for dying by making them wait arbitrary, incrementally-increasing amounts of time to respawn, obtuse, illogical puzzles, poor voice acting and translation work, dated graphics, stiff, absurd character animation, directionless pixel hunting, paths that continue infinitely instead of dead-ending...About that death system?  When your character dies, you get to engage in the delightful minigame of running in a straight line towards a respawn point.  The first time you die, the jog takes about 15 seconds.  With each death the run becomes longer and longer.  As soon as you die, the game autosaves and checkpoints you, so there's no way of avoiding this sequence.  By the time I quit out to write this review, I counted the tedious errand taking upwards of a minute.  The developers brag about this mechanic in the in-game manual.I don't like this game.  It's a shame, because there's some genuinely cool imagery and a handful of good scares, but the experience of playing it is nothing but frustrating.  Put your money towards one of the many other more polished and enjoyable horror games on Steam.			"

												This is a fantastic example of the horror genre being done properly in a video game. I didn't know much about it going in, only that you played as a girl with a camera who fought ghosts, so I set the bar low thinking it might just be a bad Fatal Frame knockoff but it's very original despite the parallels. First let's talk about some horror tropes and how the game handles them because a lot of games screw this up...Jump scares are here but they're not the ONLY thing that's here. There's is a lot of tension, build up, anticipation, not knowing what you're going to find around the next corner, etc. In other words, there is a strong focus on the psychological aspects of horror and the game doesn't just rely on jump scares. There is also plenty of times where the tension builds up to... nothing. Yes, even nothing is important in horror. If the audience learns that tense moments always lead to a horrific payoff then the tension melts away due to familiarity. It just becomes systematic. Here they mix it up often enough that you never know exactly what to expect and that keeps you on edge.Darkness is another trope often done wrong but this game handles it in a fairly unique manner. You do have a flashlight and it is better to use the flashlight than not use it but the flashlight itself isn't the best way to light your surroundings. When you bring up your smartphone camera, the world gains an even lighting that makes it easier to see things. Being in camera mode is slow, however, so there's a good balance between moving quickly in low light and switching to your camera to see better. The game also avoids two horror game DON'Ts: flashlight cone of light and batteries. The flashlight has a fairly wide arc of light (although the engine sometimes renders things in darkness that should be lit, this is an engine issue and not a design issue) instead of a narrow cone which is great and it doesn't require batteries/fuel which is fantastic. That's just the beginning, though, because later you get an SLR camera which has a completely different lighting mechanic. Instead of a flashlight you have the camera's flash. The flash lights up the world VERY well but only briefly and when you bring up the camera you're left in the dark until you take a picture instead of having the even lighting of the smartphone. This is a whole new dynamic and you have both the camera and the smartphone so you can switch between them as you like which gives the player choices and different ways to explore the world.Now, onto combat/puzzle mechanics. These almost entirely revolve around the camera. Many ghosts you can just take pictures of when the camera shows static but sometimes you need to work out a pattern or a discover a weak point in order to be able to kill a ghost before it kills you. Puzzles are also mostly about taking pictures of the right things or noticing differences in the world between the world as you see it normally and how you see it behind the camera's viewfinder. While it seems very simplistic, the game keeps everything fresh throughout. Each ghost and puzzle is going to have it's own little twist. There were a few fights and puzzles in the game that I was really impressed with and I don't want to spoil.As for the story, the game does a great job of giving you the backstory through little newspaper clippings and whatnot while giving you the present day story though cutscenes. There are some aspects that probably could have been fleshed out a little better but overall you'll know what's going on by the end. At first it seems like a normal little haunted town but there is a bigger central plot that comes into play near the end so I can't say any more about it.As for criticisms, I have plenty. This is an indie game on a budget so it does have some flaws but overall the great experience overshadows all the flaws. The one flaw I have the biggest complaint about is Limbo. When you die you end up in Limbo and you have to run into the light to get back into the game. Normally this running section gets longer and longer the more times you die and it gets REALLY annoying. There are items you can collect to shorten Limbo, however. IMO, the shorter length should be the standard. The first time I played I missed an item so I wasted many, many minutes running in Limbo during boss fights where I died frequently and I feel that was just a big waste of my time. (Edit: Turns out there is an option in the game for ""Fixed Limbo Length"". Wish I'd known about that earlier. Turn it on to save yourself some grief!)There are also some little quibbles like the low res textures (some are like N64 quality, I know this is indie but sheesh), some audio levels being unbalanced (sometimes a BGM would kick in quite loudly for what I had my volume set to), a few glitches here and there (nothing game-breaking) and some of the ghosts can have particular quirks that make it hard to fight them (one ghost I needed to aim the camera slightly high or I couldn't get static to take a picture and I was completely frustrated before figuring that out) but none of them are enough to detract from this great gaming experience. I highly recommend it even at the full $15 price tag. Pick it up if you enjoy horror games.			"

 SKOR: 8 dari 10 Gue menulis ini berdasarkan pengalaman yang gue rasakan bermain game ini selama 1.4 jam. review ini bisa saja berubah seiring semakin seringnya gue bermain dimasa depan. EDIT:Gue udah memainkan game ini sampai ACT 1 selesai dan WOWWWW... gue mendapatkan perasaan yang sama ketika bermain selesai bermain Bioshock Infinite, The Walking Dead Telltale Game, SC Blacklist, rasanya tuh... SEDIH + I WANT MORE. Gue bener bener menantikan ACT 2 Linda beserta kawan kawannya! Gameplay


YouTube™ Video: DreadOut | #MalamMinggu - Eps. 23 

			Views: 55,059		

			Hai semua nama gue Ewing dan .... EPISODE SELANJUTNYA: http://goo.gl/HgTvnC PLAYLIST: http://goo.gl/DP1Eoy Mau main DREADOUT?		

 Kesan Pertama WOW! Ekspektasi gue sangat tinggi dengan game ini, secara Digital Happiness udah meluangkan banyak waktu, tenaga, dan energi untuk game DreadOut dan.... EKSPEKTASI GUE 80% dikabulkan. Mungkin 10 menit pertama dalam game agak sedikit membosankan, tapi bersabarlah... 10 menit berikutnya, bakalan terus horror. lalu 10 menit berikutnya lagi horrornya makin SAKIT. Gue gak bisa bilang apa aja yang bakalan lo lihat, tapi tim Digital Happiness bener bener terbukti mengeluarkan buanyak sekali usaha untuk menampilkan hantu hantu ala Indonesia.  Grafik Butuh high texture! Entah ini PC gue yang lemot atau settingnya default ke medium, tapi tekstur item yang ada didalam game resolusinya masih kurang memuaskan. Kalau lo suka banget dengan detail detail disetiap benda, mungkin agak sedikt kecewa. Walau pun begitu, atmosfir dan suasana horrornya bener bener kerasa banget. Abaikan benda benda kecil seperti alat tulis dsb, coba liat sekitar lo! Ruang kelas yang begitu gelap, kumuh, dan lembab. bangunan yang udah berlumut, hancur, dan kusam. restoran yang diserbu tikus, poster acak acakan, dan jendelanya pecah. Walau pun itemnya kurang detail, tapi atmosfirnya bisa membuat lo sulit bernafas. Gameplay NO TUTORIAL. Yup, begitu lo masuk, lo musti belajar sendiri. Walau pun ada semacam guide kecil, tapi rasanya kurang aja gitu kalau kita sebagai gamer gak dikasih tutorial sebelum bermain. Selain itu, semuanya buat gue cukup sempurna. Gerakan karakter Linda tidak kaku, kameranya cukup sensitif, dan mode FPS nya cukup menarik. Gue udah banyak bermain game, terutama game horror.. segala macam kontrol yang ada didalam game ini cukup flawless. Sampai sejauh ini cuman ini yang bisa gue tulis, AKAN DIPERBAHARUI LAGI.EDIT:Gue dapat info katanya ACT 2 bakalan ada nanti, masih TBA. Berita lainnya adalah nanti bakalan ada mode Free Roam gitu, semacam Slender kah? Gue masih belum dapat info yang lebih lanjut. Tapi dari sumber yang gue baca, Free Roam ini merupakan DLC. Storyline suatu genk anak SMA yang berencana untuk pergi ke suatu tempat menemukan dirinya tersesat disebuah pintu masuk kota mati. Linda, Ira, Bu Guru Siska, dan 3 orang temannya memutuskan untuk masuk ke kota tanpa nama tersebut untuk mencari petunjuk jalan. Terror dimulai ketika salah satu muridnya menghilang didalam gedung sekolah yang tua. Linda pun menjelajahi sekolah tersebut sambil mencari cerita dibalik kota yang mati ini.Gue berani kasih skor 8 dari 10.Kenapa? untuk sementara, gue enjoy banget dengan game ini. horror levelnya cukup tinggi. gue sempat berteriak kaya anak kecil yang ga dibeliin es krim sama mamah nya pas ada hantu. ini bener bener game horror yang semua orang pasti suka. lo pengen menikmati kegelapan? lo pengen dikagetin? lo pengen didongein kisah hantu Indonesia? LO BAKALAN DAPAT ITU SEMUA. Tapi satu hal yang sedikit dikecewakan adalah low texture dan no tutorial. Tapi gak apa kok, untuk harga $15 bener bener pantas banget untuk dibeli.			"

												I personally enjoyed this game, although it was short (Probably because it was only act 1). It had good aspects to it. -The atmosphere was very creepy-The sounds and music in this game make you feel uneasy-The ghost in the upper right wing scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me-Feels like a mix of silent hill and fatal frameThe not so good stuff about it:-Graphics are meh-Story is also pretty meh (so far)Final Rating: 9/10 would throw headphones again (Thanks Upper Right wing ghost)Can't wait for part 2!

												DreadOut is a third-person Puzzle/Survival Horror game by Digital Happiness. In it you take on the role of Indonesian teenager Linda, who was on a school trip when not-so-suddenly her group becomes trapped in an old, creepy, abandoned town.Sounds familiar? Surely it’s the starting point of many a game, but the kind of horror DreadOut brings out is one of my favorites. You see, here you’re not hiding from invincible monsters, you’re not running away, and you’re not (really) fighting the ghosts (technically speaking). If you’ve ever played Fatal Frame, you’ll be quite familiar with the play style and ambiance of DreadOut, for Linda is armed only with a camera, and that is all she has to fight off the apparitions and, yes, solve puzzles. DreadOut is comprised of three different acts (0, 1 and 2), each a bit different than the previous one - act 0 serving as a sort of glimpse as to what to expect, Act 1 setting the pacing, and Act 2 completely changing the pacing you’d gotten used to; all acts follow the same storyline; and while in essence the story might not be out of this world in originality (despite the twists and turns taken and the stories within stories), and while the ghost design might not be anything too different (even if they’re unique to Indonesian lore), the game gets plenty of cookie points for being in a different setting and full of ghost (and thus, cultural) lore. Controls in the game are fairly simple: You run (stamina dictates you need a break every so often), you walk, you interact with doors and objects, pick items up, and use your phone’s camera to snap photos, solve puzzles, and defeat ghosts. And also to illuminate really dark areas, too. Linda has a ‘sense’ which helps her find all these things, when a blue vignette appears you’re near a puzzle, item or secret, while if it’s red, it means there’s an enemy near.Although the graphics and textures are a tad dated and will not give an AAA game a run for its money, they’re still fairly decent, and the characters are attractive enough to look at that you won’t be put off by their faces every time they turn around. Despite this, the general ambiance is quite good, and succeeds in making you forget that it’s a game and giving you that creepy feeling every survival-horror abandoned town and building should have. The voice overs are pretty good too, something I was pleasantly surprised with. The music is really good - it’s not always creepy, but it’s still good, and in the parts where it is creepy, it succeeds at it. The game also makes use of silence and sound bites to make you on edge, like playing soft, creepy laughter or crying when you least expect it, managing to create something that truly has you on the edge of your seat.This is the kind of horror I like, the type that’s more psychological and situational than just jump scares and loud noises, and while DreadOut does have a few jump scares, they’re not quite as obnoxious as the ones utilized in most horror games.If you’ve never played Fatal frame before, this is how the “fighting” aspect works: All “fighting” is done through the camera. You point it at the evil spirit and snap a few shots, which damages it, and it eventually disappears (unless it’s invincible… then it’ll just leave you alone for a little while). DreadOut has added to this where you don’t just have to snap, but some of the tougher spirits actually have specific weak spots for you to find. I do love this style of gameplay, but I found the ghosts to be a little less scary than the ambiance of the place, and a bit more annoying. It seemed like it took too many shots just to get rid of one simple ghost, so once the initial scare wore off, defeating them was more of a chore. The slightly cramped spaces also made for tricky fights sometimes, becoming particularly annoying during boss fights, making it hard to find their weak spots. At least in Fatal frame when they rushed at you, you had a last-chance shot that made more damage than the others, and a bit more time to run around and find a comfortable spot to snap from. Not so much in DreadOut, where there’s no last-chance shot and less space to run around before the ghost charges at you again. This might work for a more hardcore gamer, for me it didn’t work quite so well.I feel like the potential in these type of camera-only games isn’t on the fights themselves, and thus they should be easy enough the get past without infuriating you, which doesn’t mean they can’t require some kind of tactics. This, more than anything, is what made it less enjoyable for me than I had anticipated. I will say, however, that every fight was different from the last, so the originality put on it was really nice to see. When you die in DreadOut you don’t fail. It’s not game over and start over… when you die you enter “limbo”; a dark area with a light ahead of you. You run towards the light, and start back at the spot you were at. Usually with the ghost right besides you, and barely enough time to get your bearings between the animation and lifting the camera before it charges. This is both a cool concept and kind of annoying, as every time you die the length you have to run to reach the light is longer. You can make the length you have to run fixed in settings, though, which I took advantage of.The puzzles are rather difficult. Sometimes it takes a lot of random snapping of photos and pondering to figure out what to do… which is actually rather good, except when there’s ghosts around making you nervous. Sometimes they were a little too puzzling though, where I would find the blue vignette and walk around and snap shots at everything in the hopes something would yield a result, and couldn’t find what it wanted me to do at all.If there was one big thing I didn’t like about this game, I would have to say it was the lack of a save-when-you-want feature. The game auto-saves at several parts and does so as well when you exit, which is wonderful and useful for the average gamer, but -and while I appreciate such things- I would also have liked to save at a point I decide without having to leave my game to do so. I also found the save on exit not working all the time, as twice I had to re-do a (short, but still annoying) section when I went back to my game.There were a few minor bugs through my playthrough; the game would sometimes lag a bit (at random times, not because it was particularly loading anything) and the camera would sometimes “snap” back at a weird angle (I feel it might have been because of the lag, but it seemed like it did it at random times too), but none of them were game-breaking bugs.And speaking of loading, the loading times could certainly be improved on, as they get a bit too long.The game has a few items to collect through your play and several documents (besides every ghost encounter filling your ghost lore book with interesting tidbits and stories), as well as some easter eggs; you can also unlock some outfits to wear during replays. There’s also two endings to this hidden gem, which was quite nice.All things considered, you can tell that despite the dated graphics, the developers have put a lot of thought and care into the game, and you really have to appreciate that. I think this is a solid horror game that does the horror part very good, but falls just a little bit short at the gameplay aspect - at least for my personal taste. Overall I’d highly recommend it, particularly if you’re a fan of Fatal Frame or similar styled games, or if you like horror games but are tired of jump scares.			"

												In terms of graphics or production values, I actually thought DreadOut kind of hit the mark well - no game with AAA graphics has ever really managed to feel tense or unnerving - it's that realm where graphics are hard to recognize or drab in which you can really feel unsure even about walking down a simple dark hallway.As it is, what puts me off of this game is the complication in figuring out what you're meant to do at times. Being lost and needing to explore is actually very favorable in my opinion - I HATE when a game becomes a simple matter of tracing objective markers. But for a long time, I was going several play sessions not figuring out what I needed to try next in the game, as after a certain point the entire school is available to you, with no hints as to where to go next.A couple of recommendations for the developers that might be pretty simple ways of improving parts of the experience:- When a ghost is first encountered, update the Ghostpedia right away. Also, provide a simple button prompt (ie, Tab, or the Y button) to go directly to that ghost's page. If someone's clueless as to the method of defeating it or strategies, that might give them some encouragment. (And after it's beaten, that's useless) To give players some breathing room, have the ghost start out with some ""taunt"" animation that takes several seconds in which the player can realize the cutscene's over, etc.- When the player has reached some new area in which there's something they need before leaving, don't let them leave until they have it; for instance, lock them in the left wing of the school until they take the puzzle picture from the crumbled balcony (at this point, I started re-exploring the whole school not sure where to go). This could be accomplished several ways. A) A demonic wall appears behind them and vanishes after they have the item (not great, as players won't think to check the wall again) or B) Have a simple one-way gate like a longer drop, and a normal locked door to escape, from which they need to obtain a key from the same spot. (For instance, maybe after taking the picture, the cat could be holding a key)- An alternative for my previous problem might be more focus on the Journal. I did follow the game's loading screen tips of looking at it when I didn't know what to do, but there were definitely points in which the top item (There is a locked cupboard, it could be useful) didn't take me anywhere useful, as I had only one guess where the key was, and no guess how to retrieve it. Maybe the top item could be highlighted, to show that that's what you should currently do as other objectives may not be available. For more detail, it could progress like this::: With that ghost out of the way, the left wing's second story can now be explored.:: There are strange markings visible in the lobby from the second story.:: There's something strange about this picture...For a first game by a country that does not often do game development, it's a great effort. If you see this on sale under $5 and you enjoy horror games, I'd say go for it. But, currently it's not a lot to offer and can be kind of frustrating with its lack of player-information.(I will try to remember to update this when the second act comes out)			"

												I'm going to be as honest as possible about this game without coming across totally scathing, but this game is just not up to par. I would even say that it's not really a passing grade.Let me start with what is good. The sound was amazing. Music and musical changes as well as ambient noises make for a great deal of atmosphere and scare-factor in these games; clearly the developers and designers of this game realized that. The models used for the creatures and ghosts also struck me as unsettling and scary.The price is also affordable which is a bonus.But I guess that's it.Graphics were sub-par. I can foregive this however and would encourage you to look past graphics when making a purchase in the horror genre. I think too much emphasis on graphics can actually ruin a well designed game.But this game didn't strike me as well designed. My first frustration was centered around the inarticulate communication of what is seemingly the first real puzzle. A help screen can be accesssed in the games menu and when all else fails, the main character also keeps a journal that can be referenced at any time. Presumably, to help with solving puzzles. As you might have guessed this was not the case with the first puzzle. You are left to wander the halls aimlessly looking for anything to help you. The only clue from the journal? I need something sharp. The rest of the puzzles mechanics are just ""dropped"" on you with the anticipation that you'll piece together what the developers were driving at. I can appreciate this approach to puzzle/horror games (Riven and Myst were both fun and did similar things) but I became frustrated with the pig/key puzzle and its abstruse and very obscure ""picture of what could look like bad graphics on the ceiling"" solution.After spending so much time pacing the hallways to figure out this puzzle, the fright of the game had become entirely deflated. With my frustration now outweighing the atmosphere, I carried on with the puzzle in to a room where I need something sharp. The first item I see of notable worth in the room? A pair of scissors. I don't just get the scissors though. I need to go over to a crib (for what reasons I'll never understand since I'm not looking for a crib) and trigger a boss fight. Okay. Bosses are usually another side of a game that can be fun and interesting.Nope. The pairing of cloogy controls and a constrained space (you fight in an enclosed room) are the only reasons this fight can be considered ""challenging"". The space was a good idea. The controls were not.You spend a great deal of game-time in third person following the main character with a pretty typical control scheme. Moving the mouse moves the camera while you use the keyboard to interact (E) and move (WSAD). The flashlight on your phone is turned off/on with (F) while the right mouse button puts you in ""first person"" mode where you look through the camera of the phone to snap a picture with the left mouse button. Doing so to a ghost deals damage to them. You cannot move quickly while taking these pictures. Why? Because screw you. That's why.Those controls are reasonable. But it leaves you impared when attempting to swap between third and first person modes and quickly line-up a snap-shot of anything.And guess what this fight demands of you? You guessed it. So here you are, in a tight space, moving from third to first person, which in turn slows you down or speeds you up, attempting to take pictures of a ghost that is phasing in and out of existence around you. All that was truly needed was a bit more indication of where this ghost was going to appear next or maybe slightly more space, but there is no way to ""quickly"" look behind you and check all angles. You  have to run in short circles in the middle of the room whipping the camera around just enough to line up a snap-shot and hope you don't get so much as nicked by the boss, because then you'll be locked out of recovery and defeated.What's so bad about being defeated? Well, when defeated (killed) you are sent to a spirit world. Your task here? Wait for your character to pick her sorry butt up off the ground then run a soul-crushing distance (about 20 or so seconds) back to the light and re-enter the frustrating game that sent you here to begin with. Every time you are defeated. Wait for her to get up ~sigh~ Run for a mind-numbing 20 seconds to the light ~sigh~ Try again.Look. I know many are not  going to take well to my review. Haters gonna hate. But more of my time was spent running to the light, wandering hallways aimlessly, and doubting my purchase than was spent enjoying the game. I never finished the first boss. Like many other games that frustrate me, I will likely return and complete the game; a kind of ""due diligence"" on my part. I did so with the original Red Faction game as well (also a terrible game).  But I ultimately don't recommend this title. It lacks both polish and necessary (not even good... just necessary) design elements.			"

												Nice game!The game reminds a lot to the good old horror games.Graphically is very weak, but have enough quality to be scary and perfectly enjoyable.The puzzles are great and sometimes very hard to solve.Unfortunately, the game is too SHORT. I am not sure whether the Act 2 will have the same length or will be longer. In case of having the same length, it's a very bad point. The game only have a couple of hours so with Act 2 would be 4 or 5 as much. I hope the developers takes this into consideration at time to release the Act 2 since the Act 1 is too short. Also looking forward for the free roaming mode. It may be interesting but still, the game needs a longer story asides of this extra mode.Right now, the game is kinda ""expensive"" due the short duration but if you are a lover of horror and survival games then is worth it.

												ACT ONEDreadOut is very different from the horror games that has been released the last couple of years, the game itself reminds me of Fatal Frame and Siren Blood Curse (PS3), they are both very good games. Now this game comes around taking a bit of everything and creates a very nice horror game. The graphics are not that great, the texture quality on Linda and the other characters are fine, but the ground, cars and even the walls seems like something from the Playstation 2 era, but graphics are not all. The game itself is very enjoyable, the horror is made just right and the game is made with creepy in mind instead of cheap jump scares everywhere. You still think the school is creepy even when you know there is nothing in that room or you already walked around there without anything happening and sometimes you can hear stuff going on even when you can't see it or near it. You can even play act one more than once, cause I even discovered that it's not worth rushing though, you can search the city at night and find stuff here and there.With act one with less than two hours long, I still think this is worth the money. This game and games like OutLast is here to change horror to where it belongs.Plot:           6/10Horror:       8/10Gameplay:  7/10Sound:       8/10----------------Overall:      7/10			"

												Dreadout is a horror game about some indonesian highschool students lost in some abandoned city fill with ghost and other creature that will hunt the player. But ! You have something to counter that, a magical phone that will make the ghost disappears when you took their photos. Yep, just like in Fatal Frame.Act 1 Review:The thing is, i really want to give this game a good review but at this current state, i can't. First thing first, i don't want to talk about the graphics because its not that good, its mediocre at its best. The texture didn't have the amount of detail that 2014 games used to have (yes, even in indie games quality), that is coming from a person that didn't really care about graphics. Now the gameplay, its very boring, you barely encounter any ghost at all and there's only 3 of them that you can actually fight. The other ghosts ? Its only part of some cheap jumpscare or puzzle that you most solve. For a game that advertise their main feature is the magical phone camera. Its a huge letdown in game design that you only use it a few times, even though Its actually really fun to defeat the ghost using the camera.The puzzle is not really easy and no, its not because its challenging or anything, its because the game didn't tell me or guide me what so ever, how can i know i suppose to get up there to that dead end just to get the clue that let me advanced the story ? The game suppose to give a small bit a clue to help the players.Act 2 Review:I guess i could finally kinda recommend this game, in this act they certainly improved a lot of aspect in the game which make the game better.First of all, the puzzle is a lot better than the act 1, the ""puzzle"" sense that the main character get when they stumbled upon a puzzle is easier to be noticed. Its still hard, and you still have to think to solve it, but it doesn't require luck to even stumble upon some of the puzzle like in the previous act. The ghost encounter has been improved a lot. There's more aggresive ghost that will try to kill you and you have to use your camera to kill them, and each ghost has there own weakness which makes every encounter with them is a puzzle itself. There is less passive ghost in the game, but every ghost that you encounter has a purpose instead of just kinda standing around doing nothing or just be there to jumpscare you, some of them is part of the puzzle that will help you advance the story, and some them has some hidden story that you can collect.The plot that this game is going for is very interesting and kinda unique. A lot of people might hate the story, but i really like it. I can't tell you anything about the story apart from that you will have to think in the end. Like, What just happen ? What the hell is the story ? Who is her ?? and that kind of stuff.But, the ending really feels like a sequel bait, which is not nice in a game. I just hope that the developer did well enough to actually make a sequel to this game.Really fun but really short and apart from few jumpscare that are kinda scary. Its not that scary, not like the horror that Silent Hill or Outlast could give you. But i think that some people might finds it scary. I still didn't think its worth a full price if you want a memorable and scary experience. But i still recommend it, just keep your horror expectation lower and you will enjoy it.			"

												as an Indonesian, i found that act 1 is not that scary. i've seen worse before in real life lol.but the act 2, that was just released a few days ago, is really freakin scary.the developer managed to built the haunting atmosphere with ethnical music, clothes and myth properties. somehow it succeeded scaring me intensely (try playing it with headphone guys). also the survival aspects make it even better, geared with only phone's flashlight and SLR camera.the sound is the best part here, sometimes you can hear strange voices come out of a sudden. the puzzles are also pretty nice.so overall+ great atmosphere+ the side missions are decent+ love the puzzles+ the sound is the best aspect+ ghosts have detailed information- mediocre storyline- graphics are meh- performance issues (FPS dropped when dozens of tuyul appeared -_-)- too short, we want moarrrrrr!!!- the environment is too smallP.S. : linda is so hawt man, would bang 69/10			"

												OK here I go:Dreadout is the first Indonesian game I know that made it to Steam, so this is a matter of national pride, but I will try as much as I can to be objective with the review.Being a game that comes out of Indiegogo crowdfunding and done in Unity I know there are limitations that the studio cannot cross. Graphics wise it is on par with many PS2 games of the mid 2000s era, with very simple texturing method, animation is also a bit weird at times.On the positive side: Character design and AI is very well done. I haven't found any critical bugs that would ruin the gameplay. Ghost design is spot on when it goes for the creepiness factor. But what I would give 5/5 stars is the general atmosphere of the game. This game does not rely on cheap jumpscares but more of an unpleasant sense of presence, in that you know there are ghosts and supernatural beings out there to get you and you must get through them to proceed with the story (that is what Dread is supposed to mean I think). Sound effect and music is amazing. It feels like every single step that you make is bringing you closer to another ghost. Gameplay wise some of the ghosts are actually quite challenging to defeat.Other: If you are not familiar with Indonesian culture you will see many things that are culturally relevant to Indonesians which are subtle but noticeable (sort of an inside joke for me). Cannot wait for Act 2! and maybe more acts to come!			"

												DreadOut is a survival horror with a third person view - also use your smartphone in first person view to detect strange things around you.Setting is an Indonesian ghost town, it's original! Some ghosts stories used are from local legends.It features old-school puzzles and logics, no hints/in-game help, which is great for this kind of games!The ""fun"" is here with the encounters you make, sometimes they will stalk you and bring some good moments of stress!Act 1 is currently out, Act 2 is coming soon for free, plus a paid ""ghost chase in the town"" DLC will be available too.If you love survival horror games, give it a serious look!A free demo is already out too, it is like a prologue so even if you have the game play it!

												I would reccomend this game but one big warning that barely anyone seems to mention. YOU CANNOT LOAD YOUR SAVES! That, to me, is a huge deal since I can't always just sit down and play an entire game in one go. If they fix that, I'd probably give the game a good review.Some people say the graphics are ok, and I'm fine with them. The majority of the gameplay is ok - but some things could be tweaked. There are times if you're hit, you're going to lose because the enemy can constantly hit you and knock you down over and over again before you can even get up to move. The story isn't bad but I think it also could use with some fixing so people could understand a little more of what's going on, if they wanted it to be somewhat vague - that's fine then I suppose. If I could give this a neutral review I probably would. I wouldn't reccomend buying it at full price, when it's on sale is more acceptable.			"

Posted: August 2, 2014
												I'd like to start this review by congratulating the designers, who by and largely succeeded in making one of the most atmospheric, spooky and genuinely fascinating horror games of recent years.  I'd then like to move on to saying ♥♥♥♥ YOU, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING MOTHER-♥♥♥♥ERS, for creating such a ludicrously CHILDISH way of ""punishing"" the player for the seemingly unforgivable crime of...wait for it...DYING IN A VIDEO GAME.  What is this punishment, you ask?     Well, the first couple of times it's actually kind of groovy.  Your character awakens in a ""Limbo"" of sorts, lying on the floor of an otherwise featureless landscape surrounded by lit candles.  She finds her feet, and soon enough you figure you may as well run towards a coalescing light nearby.  Sure enough, you slowly emerge back into the land of the living, and may continue where you left off.  Sounds pretty nifty, huh?  TRY DOING IT MORE THAN TEN TIMES IN A SINGLE SITTING.  But wait, there's more!  The light...get this, you're gonna love this...the light MOVES FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY EVERY TIME YOU DIE, until it's eventually, like, a minute or more's running distance away.  In other words, not only are you rewarded with a two-minute wait before you can get back to trying to work out just how to get past that tricky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a boss bit, but you can't even walk away for those minutes like you would with a slow load screen, unless you have a pet monkey you can train to SIT THERE FOR TWO ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTES HOLDING THE ""SHIFT"" AND ""W"" KEYS DOWN!!!     I can tell that the people who made this game are by and largely very talented, but apparently they either don't give a damn about public opinion or they don't know how to do STEAM UPDATES.  Because given how many negative reviews I've seen complaining about this particularly ""striking"" and ""unique"" feature which they've foisted upon us, I for the life of me cannot understand why the designers haven't decided to do a patch to fix this INSANELY BAD IDEA.  Seriously, it's stupid, and insulting, and to add further insult you start getting on-screen comments like ""You might want to consider switching to casual gaming"" whilst running towards the light for the umpteenth time.  Oh yeah, TROLLING people who shelled out good money for your game...genius.     Let us seriously, SERIOUSLY hope that this nonsense is gone - or at least severely lessened - by the time that Act Two of an otherwise excellent game rears its head, 'cause honestly Digital Happiness, it's the only conceivable reason I can see why this game has such an appalling Metascore.  Apart from this highly significant flaw, and perhaps one or two puzzles/boss-battles which rely just a little TOO much on obscure solutions, this is top-rate horror gaming.  Oh, and a map wouldn't hurt either.  But honestly, the main criticism I have is the ""dying"" system (which you can't even circumnavigate by re-loading, thanks to you getting an auto-save the second said death occurs).     The people who make games this good deserve respect, but you know what?  So do the people who PLAY them.  Wake up, designers.  We're not all uber-gamers who devote our lives to spending 16 hours a day in front of the computer.  By all means make the games challenging, but please refrain from tactics which just make people wanna relinquish their support for your product (and FUTURE products) altogether.  I'm sure the ""Limbo"" idea was cute on paper, or in design meetings, but don't make the game-buying public your ♥♥♥♥ing guinea pigs.  Cheers. Verdict: 8.5/10 (subject to improve if the developers grow a conscience and ""do the right thing"").LONG OVERDUE UPDATE:  Okay, so I finally deigned to play the second and final Act of this game, after finally abandoning my wait for the devs to return the ""new"" 32-bit version to its former 64-bit glory (don't even ask...Google it if you gotta).  First up, in regards to my little rant above...yes, the devs did more-or-less address the infamous ""never-ending Limbo"" issue, not by removing it entirely, but by adding an option where you could set it at the initial, much shorter running distance.  This is obviously a lot less annoying, but still pushes one's patience by the fortieth time that it occurs.  So what do I now think of the game as a two-part whole?  Well, I gotta say, despite many reservations I still hold about it, I'm quite happy to raise my Verdict to a 9 (but no higher).  It still has a TONNE of problems, but nonetheless easily qualifies as one of the best third-person survival horror games to come down the turnpike in a LONG while.  Let's see if the newly-released Keepers of the Dark side-game improves upon the tremendous potential shown herein.Revised Verdict: 9/10.			"

												This game is not for everyone and I'll keep the review spoiler free.Simply put, the genre's are Horror and Supernatural, if that one even exists.You go around snapping photos of ghosts while trying to find your classmates and teacher to escape the haunted village. Now why would I say it's not for everone?-The story itself wouldn't make sense, especially the ending, if you aren't good with mythology or understanding what's going on. -Limbo, after death, can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to travel through if you die multiple times. To avoid this, go to the Experience Settings and then press the cute little button that fixes Limbo at a certain distance.-It is dark and maze-like. The first level, the school, is more of an open area you need to explore and find objects to continue with the story. Sometimes it can be very confusing and getting lost can be easy. Some parts are harder to complete than others but you could always cheat and look up a guide if you need one.-Some ghosts/monsters are unforgiving and can kill you many times before you figure out a strategy or way to survive.-Graphics aren't that bad but for people who want beautiful design, yeah probably not the game for you.Why is it good?-Various ghosts that have nice design and give a good and scary vibe.-Music. Music. Music, It fits perfectly, or at least well, in the game. Some of it is in a different language but it really doesn't matter much.-Each ghost gives you lore, in a journal you have, after beating it.-The Horror genre is very present and is heavily present throughout the game.-The scenery isn't bad, even with somewhat old graphics.-It's well worth your money on sale.-Of all the Horror indie games I've played throughout the years, this is one of my honorable mentions. It fills out it's role well and doesn't copy paste objects repeatedly or even repeat the same sounds a hundred times over (unless you sit there for an hour listening :P)-Easter Eggs like UFOs.-Sorta has Side Quests.Overall, if I were to rate this I would give it a 7/10. The story is actually really interesting if you can figure it out or read it from elsewhere. The DLC is decent I suppose. It's worth it on sale and the comic looks nice too. I'll write more if I get the time for that xD			"

												This game has many flaws: - the graphics are PS2 era quality, - the gameplay mechanics are painfully simple and lack any kind of depth, - the story is told in such a way so that people have to puzzle it together and interpret it, but it pretty much fails, since not enough story is presented, and what IS presented, is a mess,- Act 0 and Act 1 play like old school survival horror games but Act 2 is full of scripted (obviously experimental) sequences,- the voice acting is poor,- some of the achievements are broken...And despite all of this, it is still better than 95% of the indie horror garbage on Steam. While it is not particularly scary, it does create tension (which is very rare in horror games these days), it has bucketloads of atmosphere, and some of the ghosts and sequences are really well done. Overall, I hope the developer gets more funding and gains more experience, since there is a LOT of untapped potential here.<edit>Forgot to mention. The gameplay is heavily inspired by Fatal Frame / Project Zero series of games (taking photos of ghosts), however DreadOut  tries not to blindly mimic it. Unlike FF, DO has something I call ""monster ghosts"" as in ghosts not of people, but monsters, paranormal beings. Additionally, the story is nothing like FF. It is safe to say that DreadOut's developers managed to create their own identity unlike some well received indie horror games *cough* Lone Survivor *cough*.</edit>			"

												Dreadout is an old school survival horror inspired by Indonesian ghost tales and lore: its roots and the original ghosts they spawned are the game's strong point and provide some interesting encounters that are sadly often blemished by clunky combat and a few annoying bugs.PROS:-great soundtrack and sound design-original and truly disturbing ghosts-each ghost needs a different strategy to be beaten thus keeping you on edge-unsettling, creepy atmosphere mantained through the whole game-extra collectibles provide background to the storyCONS:-below average graphics even on High settings, textures are quite blurry-wooden animations-combat feels clunky due to the time it takes to bring the camera up and the slow first-person speed-boss battles alternate between easy and frustrating-little character depth-a few situations can be confusing due to not following the usual rules or not being properly hinted at (e.g. having to use the flash at a certain location, having to actually die at a certain point etc)-the whole story is never properly explained and, after the end, you're left wondering what exactly happened and why-despite being a year old and several patches there's still quite a few annoying bugs and while they're not gamebreaking they sure are annoying. I experienced achievements not unlocking properly, camera hits not registering on enemies and a couple scenes not playing properly: all those were solved by a checkpoint reload but the fact they're still in the game shows poor programming

Despite my grievances with it Dreadout is still a pretty decent, if not good, game: the various ghosts are all pretty interesting and, while more unsettling than truly scary, work pretty nicely in keeping you under pressure. The atmosphere is pretty strong and will make you feel uneasy and threatened most of the time.We never got Fatal Frame on PC so this can work as a poor man's substitute if the Cons list hasn't disheartened you too much: just wait for a 50% or more sale.

Could have used creepier, atmospheric music. the only thing annoy me in this game is probably the game over sequence.EDIT: Just saw some screenshots from the act 2, I may revise my comments of being not scared later on.

												As a big fan of the “Fatal Frame” series, I was really anxious to get my hands on “DreadOut”.  I mean, c’mon…fighting ghosts with nothing but a camera?  It may sound silly to the uninitiated, but those who have played “Fatal Frame” know better.  “DreadOut” is a more modern-day version of “Fatal Frame” where the player takes on the role of Linda, a high school student trapped in an old abandoned town.  Equipped only with a smart phone, she’ll (you’ll) be tasked with solving puzzles all the while fending off some really terrifying “creatures”.  Buying the game will grant you access to the first act, with DLC on the second act and a free roam mode to follow.  My biggest gripe is that Act One is only about one and a half to two hours long, once you know what you’re doing.  There’s only a handful of ghosts to boot.  Just as I was getting into the first act, it was over…I didn’t have this problem with “Outlast”, which took between five to ten hours to complete. I was able to confirm with the developer that the second act will be free, though the free roam DLC will have a price tag.  I was also able to confirm with the developer that the second act will contain more content than the first, so that helped to alleviate some of my concerns somewhat with regard to the price. Besides the “buy Act One now and hope Act Two is more meaty” feeling, I did run into a bug or two.  The game can also glitch out on occasion, forcing you to hard-quit and replay areas already beaten.  One of my save files got corrupted and I had to erase it altogether.  Still, “Dread Out” is an incredible and horrifying experience.  There is a demo available should you wish to try before you buy.  If you can’t get through the first minute of a “Slender” game without screaming like a little girl, then you may want to before dropping the dough.Full Review:http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/dreadout/Videos:

												5/10genre : survival horror in 3rd person mode (can switch to 1st person in-game)+ good presentation (if you play with normal high res textures), nice ghosts design, dark and creepy atmosphere and great sound+ gameplay is about exploring the haunted environment  and progressing the story by finding documents to read and beating ghosts with your smart-phone , in a fatal frame like way - some scarce puzzles to solve again using your smart-phone+ the puzzles are well thought and challenging+ it is indeed a traditional , old-school horror game and although it looks similar gameplay wise to fatal frame, it actually plays differently (i didn't notice any similarities to silent hill series like many people have mentioned though)- cliche story- you  become more frustrated (by the gameplay) than scared- i guess this will be resolved, but after the addition of episode 2 textures were downgraded for 64 bit systems and it shows- i don't like the level design, first an open space in the old town with very few things to see and do (mainly looking for some medals and beating your first ghost) , then an un-originally designed school interior with few things to do again- lots of bugs, some game breaking, since i lost my progress twice after a patch and had to restart from the beginning (won't do that again unless they fix the game entirely)- easy to get lost due to the poor level designwas hoping for more out of this game, maybe the greenlit game i was waiting for more than any other, but i was not that thrilled playing it. since i love horror games i still get some enjoyment out of it (still playing it) but in comparison to classics of the genre like silent hill and fatal frame it is way inferior. recommended to hardcore horror fans only but at its current state i won't recommend it generally as a good horror game to play.

												DreadOut is a game that's pretty much only held back by its budget. While on the surface it is just a Fatal Frame clone, the basis on Indonesian mythology makes things pretty interesting. Some of the ghosts you'll fight are huge, some are tiny, and some aren't even human; there's a lot of variety to them that makes encountering a new ghost more fun than in the Fatal Frame series. The only problem is that due to it being a small indie game, it's pretty short, and sometimes their ideas don't quite live up to their execution (like a large mansion area where almost all of the doors are just scenery), and sometimes the player camera can be a bit buggy, particularly with getting your phone's light to shine in the right direction sometimes in the school area. But even though it might not always live up to what it seems like the developers were trying to do, it's still a pretty solid horror game, and if you're a fan of Fatal Frame I would definitely recommend it.

												I absolutely love this game. It is full of tension and scares. The creators managed to clearly establish personality within the first few minutes. It is a challenging game with puzzles and scary ghosts - wth a ghostepedia to teach you some of the lore!You can see me review and play the first part here:

												I thought this would have been scarier. Its mostly just pop out scares. I do like some of the interesting info about the creatures once you look at their bio. The school is confusing at first because everything looks alike. Once you run around for awhile you kinda get it. Worth playing, its short..but i've played shorter. 7/10			"

												DreadOut is a low-budget survival horror debut made by studio Digital Happiness. The story revolves around a school trip that erroneously bumps into a ghost town which they have the urge to explore. I don't think there's more needed to say, overall it feels (with poor voice acting) like an average B movie. Just to keep the feel of location, besides many locked doors, you'll be actually finding notes with backstory of specific places.Backstory might help you getting more into the game, but what's the main feature of DreadOut, is the brilliant horror atmosphere. Scary sounds that you can't recognize, creepy environment with well designed ghosts, jumpscares and ubiquitous darkness is something the game does in a great way. But that applies to the horror segments, that has more or less boring walking around itself.All gameplay mechanisms are bound to smartphone of the protagonist, Linda. With your everlasting battery, you'll use your phone as a flashlight and a camera. Puzzles use camera flashes or peeking through it, as you might see different things through the camera. The everlasting battery for flashlight is compensated with the fact that you may not want to be using it all the time, there might be a situations where you'll rather decide to spend your time in the dark that may feel somehow safer.Level design has enough room for you to get lost; there are situations where you might not be sure what to do next. Developers tried to help you at least a little, as they added Linda's diary into the game where you can always check your current objective. There isn't any proper tutorial in the game but all controls and gameplay mechanics are explained in the ""how to play"" section of the menu. I don't think of horror game players as casuals, so I think it shouldn't be a problem for anybody interested.I tried to be positive with the game as far, but it's time to mention the bad things. DreadOut is not for everybody, I understand why it feels great for experienced horror game players, but I found the gameplay overall more boring that I'd originally expect. Making all the gameplay around walking and using camera seems to be a good idea, but personally it didn't feel much satisfying to me after about an hour. While the short game length can't even make it much repetitive, you still might lose a motivation to continue - the only ""magnet"" there is truly the atmosphere.Graphics are something that can make players ask themselves if they are really playing a game released in 2014. While the ghosts look great and characters look somehow fine, the environment around you, when not placed into darkness, looks really bad. Many objects and their textures reminded me of Counter-Strike 1.6 and basic 3D graphics modeling - For example, I haven't seen cars that would look like ""slightly better boxes with textures"" for a really long time. Oh, and you'll be able to see through some walls with third-person camera. Another nail in the coffin is the bad optimalisation that even with the poor graphics sucks up performance pretty badly. Don't expect getting high with your FPS counter.Conclusion:While DreadOut does a great things in terms of the horror atmosphere, the other factors are making the experience for worse, mostly. It's definitely not a game for everybody, and considering it doesn't offer even many hours of gameplay to those who don't want to unlock all achievements, I don't think it's worth recommending.Disclaimer: My copy of DreadOut was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.			"

												Overall, I really enjoyed DreadOut. There were quite a few moments that made me jump and scream. Some of the 'boss ghosts' were pretty frightening. Sadly, some of the boss mechanics come off as more obnoxious than scary (stunlocking/getting stuck).If you're willing to push through some hard to follow puzzles and some clunky handling, the game is pretty enjoyable.

												Great Premise, Terrible design. This game is been in a streak of bad horror games Ive been suckered into buying lately based on an awesome idea only to have it brutally murdered by terrible game design. Lets start at the top, the game looks and feels pretty cheap(which its mainly because its an indie studio) but the dialogue is just plain terrible. The game gives you  VERY shoddy direction( Im not asking you to hold my hand but when I have to go and google my way out of a problem because the objective literally has nothing to do with what you're doing then we have a major problem.), its very bland and has boss fights that makes you hate the game because they are just plain unfair, adding to the fact that everytime you die you get penalized by having to spirit walk for X amount of minutes that increases each time you die making it a lesson in fultility,frustraton and joylessness. Overall avoid this game like the plague, if a dev refuses to fix major problems dont give them your money.			"

												Definately worth playing through! At this current time only Act1 out of Act2 is available and Act2 will be released in the future as a free update if you have a copy of DreadOut in the first place. For what it's worth to me it reminded me a lot of the old Silent Hills like Silent Hill 2 especially. I fully enjoyed this game and had quite a few really good scares as it kept me on edge a lot of the time. I had to refer once or twice elsewhere as I got stuck; however the 1st Act was very enjoyable so I cannot wait for the 2nd Act to conclude the game. Good music, some interesting and unique opponents with only your camera ready on your smartphone as your only means of defence!. Once Act2 has been released and I have played it I will add to this review but so far it is a very good one considering there is still half of the game yet to go. Thumbs up xD			"

												This game isn't the worst horror game I've ever played...but it's not the best either. This game isn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. If you are considering buying this game because you think it looks like Fatal Frame, then you should read my review first. This game has less to do with encountering ghosts and more to do with solving difficult puzzles. Don't get me wrong...I love puzzles! I wouldn't have a problem with a few short puzzles in a horror game. It becomes a problem when I spend so much time trying to solve puzzles that I'm no longer being scared by the game. Instead, I end up being frustrated. Also, the game lacks balance. The first ghost you encounter is a violent giant pig that apparently CAN'T BE KILLED! Why is this the first creature I encounter? Why not start with a very basic enemy to help you get a hang of the controls? I don't know! Makes no sense. Also, the first boss you encounter is nearly impossible. You fight a ghost with scissors in a small space that requires you to have impossible reflexes in order to even have a chance at victory. At the end of the day, this game isn't fun or scarry, but frustrating. I'm hoping that the developers take all these things into consideration before they release Act 2.			"

												Dreadout truly is a survival horror. Borrowing from Indonesian folklore, it manages to create one of the most paralizying scary games in years. You play as Linda, a highschool student on a roadtrip with her classmates and teacher, Soon they find a road block and have to continue on foot, traversing a desolate town, and stopping at an abandoned school (cause horror game characters are suicidal and have a death wish).But before i fully praise the game, I have to warn EVERYONE about the issues this game has, which are several and MASSIVE.-Gamepad controls are♥♥♥♥♥and can't be rebinded, so you are better of playing with mouse and keyboard, butthe mouse has terrible acceleration that you will never get used to, making it frustrating, and indirectly scarier. All the character movement and actions are clumsier than your usual survival horror. It´ll get you mad at some points, and is not good to be too mad to even be scared.-Texture quality is on the VERY low end, and pop in is almost as scary as some ghosts, since they will appear right infront of your feet. -Models and graphics in general look worse tha the average ps2 title, is not a massive complain for me, but is very striking at first, and needs some time to get used to...-Story: Characters are dumb as hell, the story isnt even there, is just a platform to make you face these horrors, the end. On the bright side, the dialogue is so corny and bad, you will be glad that you spend most of the game completely alone.So now lets list what i consider great in this game.-Atmosphere: Lets just say, you are better off playing this game with brown pants, cause the simple act of walking is already a challenge when the enviroments looks so eerie and creepy. Also, the enviroments have this samey maze look. like older Silent HIll titles, where all rooms would look almost similar, making it difficult to draw an mental map, and raising the stress bar even higher. You´ll have a flashlight, which barely illuminates, and totally works.-Sound: Great use of sound effects and music, is hardly ever strartling, but always tense and haunting in the best posible sense, musical cues will evoke a feeling of dread that will follow you though most of the game. -Ghosts: won't even call them enemies, even if they are out to kill you, but they are so amazing, they deserve to be called for what they are...This game not only has some of the best ghosts i´ve seen in games, but has their actual lore, and they don't get the mob treatment, each ghost is unique, and doesnt repeat, meaning, you wont be facing hordes of them (in 1 fight you do), instead, encounters will be more self contained and memorable for this graceful design choice. I really loved the ghosts in this game, so much, that ater playing, i find myself researching about them, just to learn more about them.-Puzzles: Good and Bad. Bad at first cause they aren't you usual ""pull x levers in a certain order"" type of puzzles...They involve more what you see as a player, and make of the enviroment, is more about observation (almost like antichamber at times) than the more conventional puzzle solving (silent hill, RE, amnesia, etc).In an ocean of horror games, all presented as luxury ships (Evil Within, Alien Isolation, Soma, Outlast, etc), Dreadout is a rackety wooden boat, the difference, this crappy boat is the truly haunted one.Other than that, i´m really looking forward to future horror works from this studio (Digital Hapiness), a small indonesian indie dev that has really left an impression in the industy with their first work (this game).And still, i know the average consumer is too used to triple A graphcis and handholding(and being honest, better design in general), that is why I hesitate to recommend dreadout for full price, but it its on sale, you love horror, and can endure dodgy design, this is a game you will probably appreciate.

												I finally did all the Acts Dreadout had to offer so now I want to share my thoughts on what the game delivered, what it lacked & what could've been added. SPOILERS ARE COMING BEWAREAlright just to get the negatives out of the way the story is one of those hit & miss kinds (It's also very vague) because it isn't that interesting to me, there was no connection with the other NPCs in the game to care about, there are some bugs in Act 2 that sort of annoy me, Linda needs to attend more gym class because she runs too slow & I think that's all the cons that I can think of that ruin the game for me so now we'll go to the good part.The game really shines with the gameplay because it's focused on delivering ghosts that are talked about in indonesian culture & also heavily influenced by the Fatal Frame games (Maybe a bit of silent hill because of some of the ghosts) with some chilling music composed with all sorts of instruments to really give you some goosebumps while your hunting for ghosts with your cellphone & camera. Each ghost also has some lore behind them including some disturbing ones like the scissor phantom for example (Here's his story http://dreadout.wikia.com/wiki/Scissor_Phantom give it a read) & also the achievements have a few references (Also a few achievements with hashtags & pop culture) like for example the Attack On Titan achievement is a reference to the post apocalyptic anime that everyone craves about including me (Here's the IMDB page about the show http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/ in case I sparked some curiosity for people that never heard about it). The game is also set in an semi open world so there is a lot to explore but it's more difficult to adventure at night, the options menu is ok, the game can also be played with controller & if you really want a hardcore experience turn off all the hints in the options menu.The only thing I wish the game had was a better connection with the other NPCs but there's other suggestions you can add in this forum here http://steamcommunity.com/app/269790/discussions/0/558755530214691567/ because the devs are listening & I like game devs that respect their consumers but overall the game has been cleaned up from past issues so that's a plus. I think that's all I have to say about this game & if you have anything to say about this review leave feedback it helps me a lot.For a bonus I'll just leave some Indonesian ghost folklore https://archive.today/2TNjVhttps://archive.today/4VeRg "

 DreadOut  is a horror game playing in an indonesian setting. It is seperated in three acts: 0,1 and 2 where act 0 is equal to the demo of the game. Personally, I found playing Act 0 as first a bit irritating. Well, with act 1 the actual story is set in motion. A group of high school students and their teacher Miss Siska are (after taking a wrong turn) arriving at an empty village. You are playing as Linda Meilinda and you start exploring the village together with your friends until you arrive at an old school building, the home of several ghosts.As for the gameplay: Linda the main protagonist has the ability to fight the ghosts by taking pictures of them with her smart phone. Normally you play in an over the shoulder perspective which changes to first person perspective while using the phone. To help you, especially playing the first time, there are several hint indicators. A red vignette if enemies are nearby, blue if a pickable item is nearby, and a phone glitch if a ghost is in damaging range of your phone. Some of the ghosts are only visible through your phone, others are invincible or have special weak points so you always need to pay attention and can't get to relaxed. The atmosphere of Act 1 is eerie and really tense and you are always on your toes. The area is pretty large and you can loose directions easily. There is interesting stuff and ghosts to find. Starting with Act 2, after the school building, I felt the game got more linear which made it partially easier but it still has a wonderful tense atmosphere. From time to time there are some small jump scares but the game relies more on its atmosphere.For the Story: The Story of  DreadOut  is interesting but there is a good chance for you to ""miss"" it completely. Most of the stuff you need you, is shown during your playthrough (Cutscenes, Pictures on the wall, etc.). But it isn't explained to you at all so it can seem confusing. Especially for Act 2 I personally got lost inbetween. There is a greater picture and it is recommanded to play the game again a second time after making yourself a picture of the story. As achievement hunter you need to complete the game several times anyways.For the completion time: If you know what you have to do you can complete the whole game (including the optional area in the beginning of the game) in around two hours so that is pretty short. But the first time playing you will probably need around 5-6 hours. As an achievement hunter there is a lot to do: Finding easter eggs, hunting down all ghosts, getting the alternative ending and more.Although I criticize the ""narration"" style of the game, especially of Act 2 and also Act 0 I can only recommand this game. After completion I read a bit in the forum and read about story interpretations. After doing this you can appreciate the game much more. Maybe you are smart enough to figure out everything yourself. Even with the first time confusing story the game lives so much through its excellent atmosphere and tension. So buy the game, support the developers, complete the game and if you find the time complete it a second time. The game is worth your time.PS: If you have questions just post them here and I'll try to come back at them as fast as possible.PPS: I have ignored the graphical aspects of the game since I don't care for them to much. But some users reported glitches and other problems. Also the textures are somewhat dated. If you are not a ""graphic ♥♥♥♥♥"" it shouldn't bother you too much.			"

												DreadOut is a call back to the games of the past, it's a old formula revived and updated for the new generation.The first thing that stands this game apart from any games I've seen lately are the attention to detail in the environments. I spent my first playthrough scanning the landscape and checking each room, great care has been taken in the design of the levels and it's refreshing to have situations where you can get to a lonely dead end that serves little purpose other than to let you explore (but only sometimes are you alone). The controls work well for the game as well and didn't do anything to hinder the gameplay but the lack of a 180 degree turn is sorely missed in some encounters that need some tight turning but it still has tighter controls than Fatal Frame, another game DreadOut takes some ques from. The game also doesn't hold your hand, there's a handy ""How to Play"" in the menu that I recommend you get familiar with, and get use to using the camera to check things out!The sound is great as well, I haven't been entranced by atmospheric sound and music since the days of the first Silent Hill entries. Even if there's no immediate threat I found myself on edge just walking around due to the haunting sounds as I explored the game.I can highly recommend this game and look eagerly forward to the release of Act 2 and the subsequent Free Roam mode. Make sure you check out the demo as well, it's its own stand-alone level that you definately don't want to miss. At the time of this review I couldn't get the download to work through Steam but it should be working on release.But the game does have some negatives, the first is the length. It's only 2 hours (with figuring out puzzles the first time, I was stumped a couple of them for a good while) if you go in blind so right now there isn't much.. So, it's a negative but when the rest of the game comes out it should pad it more, since I'm more disappointed that there's less game for me to play right now. Second, Death is handled differently in this game, I'll try not to spoil anything but you always get a second chance with more time. There were some technical issues but they've already been fixed by the developer so I won't count those.Either way, it's great! Might not be too long (for now) but it's an amazing experience!And remember this when you get the game... when night falls stay outside for awhile before going indoors..			"

												Let's write a review on this. An ongoing one, editing it as I play it more and more.The game is an indie attempt to immitate Fatal Frame experience.It promises a horror experience and I can't describe how strict I am on this genre.I love horror and I can't find many games that can absorb me into their reality and also make me feel horror.So is it good? Let's see.The controls are not so good. The sprites are also not nice, only the main character is really sophisticated.Voice acting is bad. Seriously. What saves the game from being a disaster, is that most of the horror time, is not in those voice acting scenes. The sound has also some issues.It is obvious that the game has many flaws. Like the flowing water on the graveyard, in the begining of the game.The riddles are not well set and many players will probably have a hard time to solve the first one.I can't say that I was impressed during my play until after the candle riddle. It was really vanilla horror so far. Nothing was fitting well, not the gameplay, not the music, not the surrounding fx, not the sound fx, not the gameplay, neither the mechanics no nothing. I can't even figure out if there is a scenario. I just woke up somehere and that's how the game begins. Really? Oh well they might unravel some of the scenario later. And I was right, I reached the abandoned school. And it was there that I pooped bricks.No I am dead serious. For some reason, the music, the atmosphere, the graphics, the sound fx, the enemies, the gameplay mechanics, all of a sudden all the elements merge together very well, in a way that they make me feel threatened. I was constantly feeling that I was in a hostile place. And that is a success.Since a horror game MUST make you feel at LEAST once fear, I believe this game succeeds on being a horror worth playing, at least for me. Yes it isn't perfect, it's far from it, but it delivers when it comes to fear, because I am used to horror. I am not getting scared easily.  They managed to scare me, it is good enough for me.I also can see a good effort from the developers. So yes I recommend it, because it deserves a chance. Give it a chance and see if the game works for you.			"

												Not too horror as i expected it would be but pretty challenging when it comes to face the first boss which is also the toughest boss in the whole game, that goes same for collecting items and notes while you get lost and confused in rooms. A good game to play if you are up for a challenging game that is bound to leave you confused but yea not too scary.			"

												Digital Happiness return to Steam with their second game in their popular DreadOut series with Keepers of the Dark. This is not a sequel but rather a standalone horror game that takes place in the same universe as the original. Once again a developer has done a very thorough job in explaining their game in the Steam description so without attempting to repeat everything contained within it I’ll explain my own personal thoughts on the game.I feel it necessary to compliment Digital Happiness on an outstanding ‘how to play’ feature available from the main menu. It’s a great way to handle a tutorial so that players know the ins and outs of gameplay before they begin so that they can best savor the sensory experience that they are about to embark upon. For those who never played the original and are starting here, which it is entirely possible to do, this is a must read section.I agree with those who have made the claim that providing skills, abilities and experience points would have added much more variety to the game than what is present. It’s probably the biggest downfall of the game. The other, in my opinion, is the non-SLR camera perspective. I’m not a big fan of the behind the shoulder camera as I feel that it eliminates too much of the potential screen and as you can’t run while in camera mode you can’t get away from that perspective. That said the graphics of the game from an overall perspective are as they should be and help immerse the player into the atmospheric horror experience. However, the combat mechanics desperately need working on.The actual horror featured within the game is top notch. The jumpscares are well designed and the enemies are a refreshing take on the genre. However, I do have a minor bone to pick with the final boss. I felt that the developers didn’t make it as challenging or as ghastly as what the build up – which began in the original game for those that played it – should have been.The game has been Steamified with trading cards and ten achievements. This gives you something to aim for within the overall context of the game.It’s not the best horror game that I’ve had the opportunity to play this year but it is far from the worst. In all, DreadOut: Keepers of the Dark is a middle of the road game that will genuinely appeal to lovers of Asian mythology and certainly to those who have played and enjoyed the original. There is much to appreciate here but many important facets of the game will aggravate players as well. It is worth its modest asking price.For more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.			"

												Dreadout is a third person horror game developed by Digital Happiness and published by PT Digital Semantika Indonesia, which was released on Steam in mid-2014 after successfully being greenlit.The game play in Dreadout is almost identical to that of Fatal Frame. You play the role of Linda Meilinda, a young girl who is on a trip with her high school class mates. The game is played in third person. You will be using your characters smart phone and camera to fight the various kinds of ghosts you will encounter – you’ll also use them in a number of puzzles as well.  An interesting element I found in Dreadout is that you don’t actually “die”. When Linda does “die”, you’ll wake up in a dark place surrounded by candles and you run towards the light, typical eh.  When using aiming with your phone, the camera will change to first person and you’ll just be looking through the phone’s screen.  I was really left feeling let down by the graphics in Dreadout. All of the textures are horribly low quality; the polygons can actually be seen visually on most of the models too! Don’t even get me started on the janky animation of some of the characters in the game as well. I was almost on the floor laughing at one of the characters run cycle, it was just horrendous. I was playing the game on 1080p resolution as I was recording, but I tested it out on 4k, it even then still looked poor. Extremely disappointed here as it based on the Unity engine so I would have expected a real high quality looking game. There isn’t much to sale about the audio on this either; there is some generic “horror” music in the background that conveniently only turns on when something is about to happen. It is certainly not on the level as say Outlast or Amnesia with their top class sound effects. The voice acting is really awkwardly done as well, I can only assume it has been dubbed over in English because some of the lines really don’t feel natural, and the people who are saying the lines, are clearly not being paid enough, or just don’t want to be there. Dreadout is a fairly difficult game; there is no tutorial level or any sort of in game assistance, you are just left to work it out yourself. Whilst the game play is fairly simple to get to grasps with, the game does not explain how you are supposed to use your in game equipment to aid you; for instance you can use your phone to control candles by holding the viewer over them; something which is used in a puzzle, but there are no clues pointing to that. All of Dreadout’s levels are fairly sizeable; each of them has a decent number of Easter eggs and collectable items to find. Some of the collectables even unlock in game bosses for you to deal with for extra achievement points if that is your thing! The collectables are all hidden well across the level and will lead you down some interesting paths to find them. The level design is probably Dreadout’s most redeeming factor. I finished the game in just over two hours. There are three chapters to the game; the first one is really short and has no real story to it, but the last two contain the bulk of the plot and game play. The majority of people that have played the game don’t even normally play the first chapter since it glosses over most things anyway.  Other than achievement hunting, there is absolutely no reason to play this game more than once; the two hour play time is very short as well. I didn’t run into any bugs or glitches in the game per say, just the really bad graphics and poor sound effects. It can run at 4k resolutions and multiple graphic options aid you to get the settings just right for your rig. It seems the game did have a few annoying bugs when first released, such as option changes not being saved when quitting the game, but these have all been ironed out as of writing this review. Sadly this isn’t going to come out very favourably from me; yes the game play is OK, but it is fairly slow paced and unoriginal. Graphically this game is appalling and quite frankly, there are so many much better horror games in this genre out there at the moment; I am fully expecting people not to agree with this, given that it already has a “Very Positive” rating on Steam. This is one of the few games to include a demo, so if you are on the fence about picking it up or not, you may as well try the demo first.

												 ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍The best horror game i ever played. Well, this is the only horror game i've played in my life whatsoever lel.   ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍A bunch of students and their teacher are travelling for vacation. They discover a deserted city and decide to check what's going on there. They notice a school and take decision to get in. Here the nightmare begins. Ira becomes possessed and Linda gets separated from the group for some reason (i didn't get it). You play as one of the students, the only ""weapon"" you can use is a phone you can see and kill ghosts with. Now you need to find your mates and get out of the school and city, but that's not as easy as it sounds. ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍This pretty good Indonesian atmospheric game inspired by Fatal Frame will scare the dickens out of you. This creepy game with its excellent atmosphere won't let you relax for a moment, you had better play it using headphones and, of course, with no light. The lack of the game is graphics and performance. Even on highest settings the graphics leaves a lot to be desired but it is not a big deal, i'm ok with this. The problem is the poor performance, with such a graphics fps drops to 20 often enough and 10-15 occasionally. There are several puzzles in the game but they ain't difficult at all. PS: First of all, play the demo.PPS: After you finish the game listen to this song ""Mocca – Lucky Me"" you might heard in act 1. Don't know why, but this song causes some keen feelings after the game. PPPS: F*CK THOSE UPDATED OBJECTIVES!			"

												This is a good game , it got a good old school scare and pay full respect to it's source materials. However it's still a flawed game.When you ""died"" too many times in the game, you are sent to ""limbo"" and have to make your way out to continue the game however the amount of distance that you have to walk everytime you dies, increases. This is frustating as hell as I died alot of times because I was clueless on what to do or I didn't know the ghost weakness. I have to walk about 2minutes+ in the limbo everytime i die and the game became stale to me. How about removing this whole system and just replace it with a simple ""Continue?"" screen?The boss fight with the scissors ghost is another flawed boss fight, I am not saying the boss is hard to defeat but when the boss was about to die, the boss suddenly goes into full steroid mode and when the boss hit you once, you are practically dead. Yes, you can still escape but trust me, it's hard as hell. How about making the boss stop for every 5 seconds when it's on steroid mode? So you can catch your breath and get a proper angle/view to attack the boss. Honestly this is the part where I died too many times that I have to walk 2 minutes in the limbo and fight the boss again and die again. Other than that, I am waiting for ACT 2. Good game for an indonesian company ! 8/10 !Keep up the great work guys !			"

												My first ever steam review......Yay. This game is good, throw ""Fatal Frame"", also known as  ""Project Zero"", ""Resident evil 4"",and ""Siren Blood Curse"" in a blender. Then you have this game, you fight Ghost and Spook-i-dillos with a camera phone.P.S To get the costumes go to the Van's boot in the start of the game, when Linda is standing next to it, or in the ambulance in act II.The DLC music is in your Steam Library, then hit music.The DLC manga, just go to your Steam icon in desk top, the hit right click, go to open file location,then Steamapps, then double click common, the find ""DreadOut"", double click again, then Manga,and there you go.

												I'll start off with the one really big issue with the game, the textures look really outdated. This could pass as an older gamecube or original Xbox title, but for $15 this is a something that can be overlooked. Though initially it does seem like it will get in the way of immersion, once the game gets started and sets its dark tone, you'll be able to look passed it.The atmosphere in this game is done really well, the music and tone are perfect for what a horror title should be. This definitely brings back feelings of classic old school horror.The dialog and animations are a bit funny, but in the good way. Think kind of like the original resident evil way. Something I found charming really, the kind of bad that's really good and makes you enjoy the game!This is Digital Happiness' first real title, and it shows. That being said, they did a really good job as far as being able to provide a new horror game in to the mix. There's a lot of potential for this franchise to grow, and for only $15, it's worth a try, especially if you're in to the classic horror games.This is also the first Indonesian game to hit steam, and Indonesia is still growing as far as its games development market is concerned. When you take that in to account, they did pretty damn well with this game, and I hope they;re successful enough to continue making more games and being able to build on what they've learned with more funding and experience.

												I don't write many reviews but I thought i would with this game.  I think Dreadout is a nice well made and well spooked game.  A few jump scares, a lot of ghosts and a handy dandy way to illiminate them. The atmosphere is very creepy. Just what I expect from a horror game.  Some of the boss fights are a bit hard, but doable, some with a lot more difficulty than others.  The story is good.  The voice actors do a great job.  I would definatly recommend this game to any die hard horror game fan, or any one  that just wants a scary atmosphere and a little bit of battle.  Really good game.			"

												I'm not going to lie: DreadOut has quite a few rough spots. Graphics are a little plasticky and rendering is a little weird and doll-like. Controls can be a bit of a pain, as mouselook tends to be oversensitive. Loading a save game sometimes causes the game to get stuck, forcing you to start again. And with Limbo, unless you find special hidden items, you get thrown farther back from the light the more you die. The camera mechanics are implemented with a couple of issues, the biggest being that it takes at least 3 seconds of aiming before you can fire.However, don't let that detract you from playing, either. DreadOut is a fine homage to the Fatal Frame series. The atmosphere is genuinely frightening, the monsters freakish and terrifying, the music and sounds perfectly moody and foreboding, and the slight kitschy feeling of Southeast Asian horror movies washes over everything and brings out the folklore of Indonesia like no one else can. I would recommend it, but wait for a sale.			"

												Do you like Fatal Frame? Then you'll love this game. There are a few negatives, though:-Boss Ghosts (one in particular) are difficult to the point of near-unfairness.-There's one sequence you're randomly thrown into with no clear direction on what to do and how to escape while being chased. However, if you're caught and lose a life, you respawn with nothing chasing you anymore, just leaving you without a threat and the same lack of direction. Hint: Use your camera to find a hidden path.-Too short. It's being released in 'episodes' so there's far more to come, but the main game released so far and all it's secrets will only last about 2-3 hours.Despite the negatives that will no doubt be addressed later, this game is very much a fun Fatal Frame sister title and is one of the few indie horror games that I have found to be AAA-quality. Watch my playthrough below:

												DreadOut is a third person horror game where your only defence is your camera. Sound familiar? You play as the silent protagonist Linda on a school trip, only you've seemingly taken a wrong turn and ended up in an abandoned town. Eventually night falls and things go wrong, and you must search the town, solve puzzles, and fight off ghosts in order to find your classmates.Combat is similar to Fatal Frame. You use your smartphone's camera to take pictures of ghosts. However, you'll only damage them if you take a picture and the right time indicated by a glitch on the screen. When you die there is no game over screen, instead you go to ""limbo"" where you must run toward a light in order to continue. Each time you die, the space between you and the light gets bigger which can get quite tedious.Exploration is very rewarding in this game. You can blast through the story in a few hours if you wish but you'll be missing a lot of content if you do. There are many hidden ghosts to find and taking pictures of them reveals some of the folklore behind them.If you're a fan of the Fatal Frame series you will almost certainly enjoy this game. However, this game is much more than a Fatal Frame clone. The Indonesian setting and ghosts are very unique and the game has a wonderfully spooky atmosphere. While the graphics are very dated and there are quite a few bugs I'd still highly recommend this game to any horror fan.			"

Would highly recommend if ur looking for a scory mystery game with a supernatural element. Its worth a good 15 bucks at least and I'm saying this with confidence Only playing it about an hour or so I look forword to my next session with it.			"

												Dreadout is a great indie horror game that reminds me totally of Fatal Frame/Project Zero.I've never played a horror game which uses spooky Indonesian folklore until now!The visual is a little outdated but the story and animation makes up for it.There is a lot of creepy stuff in this game and the scarejumps man... I LOVE IT :)I don't recommend to play it with a controller because I died quite a lot due to the slow aiming.The puzzles are nice and not that hard. There are a lot of hints that will help you to solve the puzzles.Some puzzles are challenging but don't give up! Search for hints :)I manage to solve them all without a guide which is a big plus cause I don't like to get spoiled.The game is short but it offers a lot of secrets and 2 endings. The achievement are all unlockable so rest assured achievement hunters! Well, what can I say...I don't want to spoil more :P A MUST buy for all horror fans who loves the spooky part!			"

												Good game, would be better if there was full controller support. As it stands now, only half of the menus and actions have button icons to help you figure out how to navigate, and the mouse cursor keeps jumping onto the middle of the screen despite using a controller for this game.NOTE: There is an issue with the game engine. If you make any kind of custom setting in the video settings a lot of effects like normal maps, shadows, bloom, etc. will be disabled. You must only select a preset within the game. After that you can edit the config file located in ""~\%user name%\Documents\Steam Cloud\%steam name%\DreadOut\cloud\20140722011532\profile.cfg"".I recommend two additonal performance enhancements. This game takes a huge fps hit with the game's built-in antialiasing. Use antialiasing in your driver control panel instead. The Steam overlay also hurts the fps quite a bit too in this particular game, and will even run a modern video card (GTX 660) very hot with it enabled.What I did was use the game preset of Fantastic (highest preset), exit the game, set the aa to 0 in the .cfg file, disable Steam overlay on this title, forced aa in the driver control panel, and now it's a steady 60 fps and looks great.

												This game had potential but it felt broken. Not in a way that the game wouldn't run, but in a way that the whole thing just felt like a crumbled mess. Sure it had it's moments but there was just too many things that bothered me.1. There is absolutely zero character developement. There is zero character attatchment at all in fact. Some of the characters are even forgoten about later on in the game. When one of them dies it just feels like...well, nothing.2. If there's a story, you're gonna have to go back and look for it. If you just play the game then you will be left clueless on whats going on. Most of the story is hidden in notes you can find in some places if you look hard enough, but chances are you wont find all of them in your first playthrough. 3. The puzzles are way too easy. Each puzzle is basically point your camera and shoot pictures of everything. 4. The ghost designs in this game are really cool and well detailed (some more than others), but each one can easily be rid of by taking a few pictures of them. That aspect takes a lot of the horror elements out of the game.5. The scares can be good at times, but not often. Again, if it's a ghost you can just shoo it off with your cam. If it's not a ghost then its just a brief music intensity or loud noise.Overall, i think it could have been better. All it needed was some more gameplay elements and story.Edit: forgot to mention. It's crazy short with only two acts that can be finished in a few hours.			"

												Every since I saw some footage of the demo, I really, REALLY wanted to play this game. My laptop, however, was too old and broken to do so. Finally it was time for me to buy a new one. Dreadout was one of the first games I bought after.I really love the game so far. There are still some small glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking.I'm just going to list some pros and cons based on my impression of playing through the game 1,5 times.Pros:Intriguing settingScary atmosphereTerrifying ghostsNot completely liniarLore on Indonesian ghosts includedCons:Still some minor bugs and glitchesFairly shortControls can be somewhat clunkyLimbo becomes a chore after dying a few timesI'd like to eleborate on some glitches I have encountered.1) During the first part at the bridge, I went back to the main menu to increase graphic quality, however, when I loaded the game back up, I could not speak to anybody and I was stuck in front of the bridge.2) During the night portion, I went back towards the car and encountered the big guardian. I let myself be killed for him to appear in my Ghostpedia. However, when I came back from limbo I was in a void. I could only see the friend character. After a couple of seconds the school started to appear around me, starting the cutscene you would normally get when walking up to the school. Nothing game-breaking, but somewhat strange and looks ugly. 3) While I was fighting the ghost in the narrow hallway in the school the first time around, I shot a couple of pics of her face, trying to hit her in the back. After a while she just stood frozen. This made it very easy for me to hit her in the back, since she posed no threat. The rest of the game worked like a charm! I really can't wait to see what Chapter 2 might have in store for us. I do hope it will be (a lot) longer than the frst part, since not a lot of the story has been played out yet. Also, it would be great if the demo gaeplay could be added to the full game, since it acts as a prologue, and you can't have both the demo and the actual game in your library at the same time.Final verdict for Chapter 1: 7/10     Would recommend (especially now during the sale)			"

												Hell yes!  Been waiting for this game to come out; and, boy oh boy, did it deliver.  This game is creepy and it's difficult, even on the easy setting.  This game is also packed with a lot of extra features like different outfits and hidden ghost fights that you may not find the first time through. The only problem is the graphics are a little outdated, but that's a minor flaw in an otherwise awesome game.			"

												My opinion is based on act 1 which is the only act released atm (around 17.05.2014).First of all what I don't like.- Either I'm stupid or there is little to no logical explanation or hinting about what object you need to collect and why them specifically. You will get them relatively easy if you just go on explore areas, but if you go on just only on logic - kinda weird.- Little bit weird animation at placesWhat I like- Amazing atmosphere- Magnificent atmosphere!- Marvellous build up to everything!- Bunch of great details in the city (no idea what was the point of medals though)- Interesting ideas for ghosts- Night dome right!What hopefully will be patched- Maybe some notes/story bits will be added to sorta explain logic little bit more.- Gamepad controls are... weird. In the end I picked up KB and M.P.S. I really hope for sequel after act 2. Not necessary with same characters (we don't know how they end up yet), but maybe some story about this city or some specific persons in the city.			"

												I very much enjoyed playing Dreadout. Once you get past it's slightly outdated graphics, what you'll find is a horror experience worthy of being considered alongside the 'horror greats' such as Project Zero/Fatal Frame and Silent Hill 2/3.My main concern was the length of Part One. Didn't take me very long at all to complete, could probably speed run it in about 40 mins or so. I'm just hoping Part 2 is so much longer, because we have something good here, and as horror fans we owe it to ourselves to experience frights like this game on a much more regular basis!7/10- May go up once Part 2 is released!!

												The best Indie Horror game I have ever played,   No game is perfect, but dreadOut has an astonishing level 3d graphics and atmospheric horror.  For a first try at this genre, I am very satisfied by the experience,  I only wish it was longuer.  But Digital Hapinness will release Act 2 for free.  So I think for 14.99 USD, it will totally worth the price. :Pros : Decent 3d models for the characters.          Scary atmosphere          Indonesian ghosts          A cool fighying technic          No firearms and zombies          A decent female heroineCons : It's short           Almost no guidance           The Demo had slightly better graphics           The landscape textures feels a lilttle too much low resolution.

												Nowdays, I personally find horror games boring - it's always the same first person, stealth system, blood and guts spilling through the air. I just don't find it scary nor worth of my time.For people like me, who rather face the enemies, prefer old good survival horror, I think Dreadout is great. Sure it's not finished yet, first act is a bit short, it isn't graphically not plot-wise exactly shining, but it has good atmosphere, devs have put some real thought into enemies and the soundtrack is great. And alternate costumes are always a big plus.It isn't expensive, I would say it's worth of the money. Considering that there will be act 2 which will-hopefully- focus little bit on the plot that was left completely open.			"

												One of the best games in the horror genre. I would have to say by far, DreadOut, is one of my favorites of any game I have ever played. This is the only game that literally gave me chills, when I was fighting the scissor phantom an by far that is one of the hardest scenes I've ever had to beat. The environment A++ The fear A++ If you like Outlast, you will definitley like DreadOut. It is a must play for anyone who likes playing horror, thriller, psychological games. If you like to be scared at the things that go bump in the night go on and play. ENJOY!!!			"

												This is a pretty sweet horror game reminiscent of Fatal Frame on the PS2. It's got a great atmosphere and some really scary enemies. Only flaw so far is that some of the rooms have no purpose (which  doesn't feel right to me considering most other games in it's genre don't do that), regardless of this very minor flaw it's an excellent game and definitely worth your money. Pick it up if you're a fan of third person adventure horror games.			"

												Identical to Fatal Frame series which reminds me of PS2 era, only with better visual. The story itself focused around Linda, the silent protagonist of this game. When a group of highschool students lead by their (yummy milf) teacher on their trip goes wrong turn and suddenly found an empty ghost (silent-hill-lookalike) town that didnt shown in gps.The environment itself is eerie, typical of many town in West Java province of Indonesia (well the developer of this game came from Bandung, capital of West Java :P ). The music for this game also minimalist, some may say the graphic is quite dated and the voice talent kinda like reading on their script rather acting. But the story itself is pretty good. As predicted, she was seperated from her group, and she had to find them. Many of the ghost element taken from Indonesian urban legend. Also the opening song believed to be a spell for summoning spirits (if you sing it correctly along with some ritual)The game developer said this was Act 1 and Act 2 will be released for free as DLC.

												No habia jugado un buen juego de terror desde el 2013 con deadly premonition. Dreadout flaquea un poco en el apartado grafico pero aun asi, los escenarios y la ambientacion son escalofriantes. Hay harto screaming, asi que esten preparados :D (El juego te pide que descanses tras haber jugado por un rato xD)Gameplay:Defiendete solo con tu celular de espectros y fantasmas antes que sea demasiado tarde. Es recomendable jugar con control de xbox por comodidad y evitar en apretar un hotkey. Solo con tu camara de tu celular puedes ver a los espectros, sin embargo eres vulnerable si te aparecen por atras, asi que toma fotos rápido y ademas utiliza tu entorno como espejos.  Algunos jefes paracen duros de vencer como el peluquero o el postergeist, pero despues de ver sus movimientos sera posible derrotarlos. Un tip, traten de moverse y no quedarse parados enfocando con la camara todo el tiempo. Por otro lado,  la historia es de una leyenda de indonesia sobre ''la mujer de rojo'', asi que te mantendrá pegado para saber mas. El apartado sonoro es bueno, pero no a la altura de los silent hill o los antiguos resident evils. Pero sumando al entorno grafico, historia y espectros es un buen producto, aunque de poca duracion.Lo malo, el halo que tienes que alcanzar cada vez que revives tras morir. Quizas sea para que tu corazon vuelva a su ritmo normal xDEn lineas generales, para ser un juego indie, lo pasé muy bien y me dí mis buenos sustos que no lo habia tenido desde que jugué Amnesia the dark descent. Recomendaria este juego a los amantes de los juegos de terror y que aun gustan de los juegos tipo de la vieja escuela, con ritmo mas lento, buscar por algunos items y no ser Chuck Norris repartiendo ostiazos a diestra y siniestra.

												Only played it for 3+ hours, I've decided to write a review here.For a developer that being funded by indie backer at indiegogo, I believe that they're living up my expectations.Basically, what do you expect with funds only 29,000 USD? Being developed for a year, I believe those value didn't last long in the US. Calculate average salary per month for a programmer, they don't have enough money practically. Therefore, I try give my not-so-called-objectives review, given those handicap.Graphics : 7/10Arguably their main weak point. Although unity engine that being used by them have more capability, they simply didn't have enough manpower to polish the graphic. The character details is just like PS2 or XBOX era. Character animation also is not very ""amusing"", but playable.However, despite of the lack details in the character, they put much effort in surrounding details. Much of the details are handcrafted individually. They put effort to give Easter egg for their backer. Look for each poster and note, you'll find out that most of it are handcrafted. But you can feel that they use lighting and shadows to compromise with the lack of character details.Gameplay: 9/10For me, this is their main strong point. Remember Fatal Frame? Remember how the atmosphere they built in that? For me, Dreadout is giving the same, if not better, horror atmosphere than Fatal Frame. Try to play it in the middle of the night, with surround speakers and when you're alone ;)Maybe this game is rather hard for person that is not a hardcore gamers. This is due to the developer didn't gave much information in-game. You need to figure out by yourself, what you need to do. It's a good point to draw you closer to heroine experience. However, there's a lot of guide out there to guide you out from your frustration :)If you notice, the developer of this game give the opening cut-scene with ""Lingsir Wengi"" song. For locals like me, this is the song that ""told"" by many to draw evil spirit came. More than enough to give a goosebumps :(The only minus in gameplay is it only last few hours. You want it more after finished it.Music: 9/10Another strong point of this game. The OST is good. Googling the artist list and review the OST, they worth to be downloaded :)Final Verdict : 8.5/10They put a good atmosphere to overcame the graphic limitation. And good soundtrack also. Actually, I want to give them 10/10 due to being handicapped in development budget. But, even with that handicap, they deserve a good rating from me :)			"

												Will say shortly - This Game Amazed Me. 10/10EDIT (Act 2 released): Feelings are same, game really amazed me, it have really good atmosphere, interesting story and interesting way you can play it, it's done in classical style Horror games (understand and explore things by your way), but in modern way to do it. (yes exactly, here no one will tell you where to go, what to push, when to turn atc... here every single thing can be important, things that happen in the beginning can be used in the end part of the game and not as in modern games where every single thing showing you what to do, here you must remember, think and try everything).Dreadout is not an easy game, but it's easy in same time, here you need to think and explore things, sometimes you will lost, sometimes you can be confused in what to do, but most Puzzles have very easy way to complete them and exactly this is confusing, when you're not waiting that easiest way can be the right way. Dreadout is the game about girl Linda who fall in to unknown world, another world, where every thing can be hostile, from where no one comes alive. Linda knows nothing about this world, about its creatures, ghosts and people that are living there, she knows nothing about the rules of this world. So yes, player knows same that Linda know about it and you must find, explore and understand all this things with Linda and you must help her to find and explore right answers, tweaks, things and stories of the world about you and Linda know nothing and there is no one to tell you, no one to take your hand and say - ""Hey! There is the right answer!"". Yes, all this things you and Linda must understand and find by your own. You must find way out.Good sides for me:* Atmosphere.* Story.* Exploration.* Puzzles that are challenging.* That you must find right answers by yourself and not when game drags you like a kid.* Many ways to scare you and not focused on just one element.* Ghosts (enemies), each one have it's story and are made in quite unique and interesting way.* Dreadout is specific game, it can remind many classical horror games, but released in it's own way and have many specific elements that are interesting to explore.* Gameplay and way how you play it.* Game hardness, it's hard and easy same time, also sometimes confusing (in a good way), what makes you to search and find right decisions.* Limbo system, when you really don't want to die... Someone find it annoying, but for me it was part that makes me to afraid of death, when you will be punished for your fault.Bad sides for me:* Game needs Optimization, not a critically, but have performance problems.* Repetitive AI (enemies), on second turn you will know any move of the enemies what makes them easy for me.It's just my opinion, of course someone will and someone will not agree with me, I played many Horror games before (more classical style one), but just some of that games was really interesting for me to explore their world, and Dreadout now, is new one in my favorites list.I Recommend Dreadout if you love Atmospheric-Horror games where you must explore things by yourself, where no one is explaining you what and where to do and if you're tired of modern horror-puzzles when game explains you every single thing, here even story must be explored, you must finish the game to understand it, but it's not the fact that you will and for each player story can be different not because it have alter, but because of the experience you will get from it.And I Recommend it if you love Atmospheric games, if you love exploring and if you just love specific games, games that have Soul and games that are made with Love....Just think, it's not hard...Sorry for my bad English.

												I absolutely loved this game. It definitely reminded me of the older horror games, where it wasn't about the weapons and killing things, or about gore and cheap jump scares. Though, I'll admit there are plenty of those here. No, this reminds me of playing Silent Hill 2 or 3, and as many have mentioned where it got it's inspiration from, Fatal Frame. Yes, it's not a very long game, but it's split into two parts, the second of which hasn't been released yet. If you like Asian horror, try this. If that isn't your cup of tea, and you'd rather go in guns blazin'? Probably not your thing. I, however, had so much fun with this. I also respect that Digital Happiness seems to actually pay attention to the forums, instead of blowing off the players.			"

												So far I played this for a few minutes, you need to remember that this company is doing an indie game. Not AAA game. It's  a 1.3 GB game, thats why the textures are so low quality. And also this game can be done within less than 2 hours.As gameplay so far, I love the intro. It's so different from the title despite the meaning. I have yet to encounter anything scary but so far so good.I wish they did more for the battle system. Simplicity combat by spamming on the ghost just dont really give the feel of killing the ghost. They would have done researching on modern smartphones and maybe implement the camera effects like bokeh for slow motion or burst shot for multiple hits or face detection and so on. There is alot of potential as technology for smartphone camera progresses.As for the animation, good job to the team providing such humor. I wish we can see more of that during the game again.It's a bit too much for the price but do buy it now instead of waiting for the sales. This is a company that we should invest money to if you want something like Fatal Frame. Why? Fatal Frame are only going to be on WiiU now since Nintendo bought the damn company, making us mad for all we PS2  and PS3 owners.			"

												DreadOut is a survival horror game that brings a lot of nostalgia for those who play Fatal Frame for this game inspired by the game. There is no 'game over' in this game so you can think of as a good point but even so, do not think you can play carelessly. Tactical play will help you most throughout the game.A very short game for Act 1 so there isn't much to tell about the game itself, there is a no keyboard/mouse/stick configure, a PS2 game graphic, a bit buggy here and there, etc but all within consideration as this game is an indie game with an indie developer that you can not unfairly compare with other indie game developer with lots of staff and more experience.This game mechanism is actually pretty much easy to figure but with an awkward and rigid game mechanism to use, you may confuse a little bit. If you already played DreadOut demo before, then you'll probably don't need to read 'How to Play' section. But if you new to this game, I recommend to read 'How to Play' section before you play.A great atmosphere, the sounds will make you more immerse to the game. A good old 80's Indonesia horror story setting and Asian-Indonesian ghost folklore. Third person perspective game which I like most and very fit with this game. A great choice and placement of music. An annoying and scary ghost battle. A cute cat.^^ DreadOut so far success to represent Asian, particularly Indonesia ghost folklore. Mainly focus on adventure, exploration, item gathering and puzzle solving, DreadOut recommend player to explore and find many secret hidden within abandoned ghost town.In the end, DreadOut bring out a fresh air to survival horror game franchise. A game with Asian-Indonesian setting which you rarely see this day. DreadOut have a lot potential to develop and grow which we can all see together. A future Act 2 DLC will come as a free update. With those uniqueness, I think $14,99 is a good deal,			"

												Great design, horrifying atmosphere, scary sound, all of these could cover the lack of good UI and bad engine optimizations.You can easily stuck because of the lack of map/minimap or any indicator that shows the player where to go next.But nevertheless, this is a great game for you horror lovers, especially for all Indonesian.Beli yang asli ya gan, support the developer. Let's scream together.PS: You should play this using headphone, a closed ear type preferred.			"

												DreadOut is a very well designed horror game that draws inspiration from the Fatal Frame franchise. While the developers low budget clearly shows from the outdated graphics, average voice acting and the such - DreadOut manages to nail down the most important thing for a horror game, the atmosphere. Which is largely thanks to its great audio design, as well as from understanding that horror isn't just about seeing how many jump scares you can cram in to the game.Despite some frustrating game mechanics and the short length of the first episode (roughly 2 to 3 hours for a playthrough, although there are plenty of secrets / hidden content which gives the episode enough of replay value for at least couple of playthroughs), I would definitely recommend the game for fans of the genre.

												Its COULD be an AWESOME horror game, if it wouldn't be have some big problems.Pro:+ an REALLY AWESOME atmosphere+ Scary+ Graphics maybe arent ""perfect"" but it looks good+ again the atmosphere is awesomeBut now the points that destroy the most of the fun for me:- The puzzles are, SO, WORSE, the game left you totaly alone with it ( not really much hints, if anyway)- The game and its difficulty feels great until you get this moments, where you get knocked out over again.Could be a GREAT game, but if you ask me its still needs some work on it, specially the first chapter.If you want an horror game with great atmosphere, you should get it, but be warned of not such awesome puzzles, a often annyoing ghost fights.

												sebagai gamer dari Indonesia, gw mo bikin review nih game dalam bahasa Indonesia....pertama2 gw nyesel beli game ini, bukan karena kualitas atau kekurangan lainnya, tapi karena kesibukan dari pagi sampe sore gw baru bisa mainin game ini MALAM HARI...!!! (efek horor mencekam makin dalam).overall nih game membangkitkan kenangan masa sekolah dulu dimana game survival horor dan sejenisnya baru dirilis pertama kali (ketauan dah udah tua bgt)...Dari sekian banyak game survival horor yg gw mainin, Dreadout gw akui sebagai salah satu yang paling SERAM...!!!! kenapa karena suasana dan atmosfir hantunya sudah gw kenal sejak pertama kali gw kenal TV dan serasa nonton film2nya (alm) Suzanna... Untuk grafik gw ga bisa banyak komentar karena gw mainin game ini di laptop dengan spek seadaanya jd semua setting musti gw set paling rendah, tp dengan settingan rendah sekali pun game ini masih terlihat sangat OK dan responsif.Sound, ini yg bikin jantungan dan takut untuk berbalik badan apabila mulai mucul tanda2 penampakan (beneran takut balik badan saudara2 sebangsa dan setanah air).... dan yang disayangankan voice bahasa Indonesianya di hilangkan di final release game ini (moga2 developer mengeluarkan DLC free untuk update ini)story, walau tipical standard horor Indonesia, tapi setelah baca manga dari paket DLC game ini (gw beli juga dunk) jd makin serem bila mengetahui sejarah kota dan sekolah di dalam game ini.... oke rating gw untuk game ini 8.5 dari 10 (sisanya rasa takut gw gara2 cuma bisa main malem2).game ini sangat worthed untuk dimiliki, moga2 developer segera membuka toko merchandise di web nya banyak nih yg musti di koleksi.

												I wanted to like this game.  I'm not sure exactly WHY I wanted to, but I gave it multiple chances, tried to see some of its flaws as charm and just all around did what I could with it.  Ultimately though, it just couldn't keep my attention.Its positives are an interesting array of supernatural beasties drawing from Indonesian lore.  The game can be genuinely creepy at time.  It does a good job of capturing the horror feeling.The flaws all lie in execution.  The graphics are largely a blurry, low resolution mess.  Linda's model is okay although the screen shots on the store page are carefully selected to make the game look its best.  In reality, the game looks like a product for the Playstation 2.  Your fellow classmates look laughable.  The game's pacing feels off and you spend too long just trotting around.  But the worst felt like the controls which often had me over steer or snagged me during fights.  Some battles require you to quickly move around and it just wasn't reacting well.  Compounding this was a death system where each time you die, you have to run back out from limbo, jogging along a blue strip of light.  Unfortunately, each time you die that strip grows longer and it's frustrating to not only feel like you died a cheap death but to now be expected to just jog for 90 seconds before you can play again.Given better controls and a less punitive system for dying, I might have felt like completing this and been able to enjoy it for what it is.  But after my last jog back from the underworld, the game just felt like a waste of time.			"

												Played the Dreadout demo around a year ago, and thought the will have a great potential, and it proved me right. I thought Amnesia, Outlast, Zero (Fatal Frame) were scary enough but Dreadout gave me the creeps and goosebumps. The atmosphere of the game is superb, it doesn't take the visuals too seriously and this is a good thing; the ambience and immersion is amazing, you feel like something will be at the corner, may be there is, or may be not.This game is a blend that took elements from horror movies, games, legends and proved itself to be delivered as promised what is supposed to be.Although I am just an hour into the game and I don't think I am able to beat it anytime soon. Due to my progress, I could only make a partial rating due to incompleteness of the game and release.  With minor bugs and visual glitches, the atmosphere was nicely done and saved it flaws. Dreadout deserves a 9/10 at this moment, I will update this review by making more progress and until 2nd part out.   :)**Not trying to be offensive, but the billboards, posters and stuff are in Indonesian (not the interface language) and I can't read them!Did some research, and I think this is a Silent Hill reference: Welcome to ---------    (Used Google Translate ""Selamat Datang Di"") [clip2net.com]Update #01 (2014-05-16 1:48am)After beating the first boss, I kinda need a break from it. Poor objectives and not obvious level designs are giving me a headache. Died 7 times in the first boss fight, and if you ask me why, I would tell you that the boss fight design was just bad, if he hit you once, you get stunned, takes 2 seconds to bring up the camera, and then you get stunned again, basically if you get git, it's GG. And now my way out of limbo is so far away, I really have to say this games does need a little bit of polishing; a part which could taken me 15 minutes took me over an hour ro complete. Things and objectives are so badly designed in a way that you don't even know what you should do.. And the game even gave me a tip:  Winners don't do drugs. [clip2net.com](WTF!!?!?!?)			"

												I´ve always wanted to give it a try to the Fatal Frame series, but since they are not available for PC this game got my attention. I´ve been following it for almost a year and now that I have finished it twice I will give the most impartial review I can.This is a low budget game, but a good one. The story and the graphics are outdated but the gameplay is good, very challenging is some ocassions. The only downside of this game is that it is extremely short. In my first gameplay I completed the game in a little over 3 hours (thanks to a very challenging puzzle I coulnd´t figure out on my own), and on my second gameplay in under 2 hours (including exploration of the whole town during the nightime, just before entering the school).The game is incomplete though, the second part is supposed to come as a free update I don´t know when exactly. My completely honest conclusion is: 2 to 4 hours of gameplay is not worth $15,  but give it a try once is completed because it will probably be worth it.			"

												How fun is it to see ghosts through your camera? In this game, it's quite fun. Bwahahaha! It may not be a super polished AAA title, but the really creepy atmosphere, sound effects, and graphics, along with simple camera mechanics, definitely made it worth playing. There are some classic scenarios that I thought were presented well, like - what would you do if you still can't see the ghost through your camera, unless it's pointed at a mirror? During a few boss battles, timing the camera and moving around may seem awkward at first, but I got used to it. I used keyboard+mouse controls because it made it easier for me to track moving ghosts, so I can't vouch for controller support. I also loved the way this game hid some ghosts outside of the game's set paths. Dare to explore and you'll be in for some treats!			"

												2014 has been shaping up nicely for video games it seems, especially for indie titles with several games I either backed or seen in early development finally coming to fruition. One particular Indonesian title that has already gained a solid fanbase thanks to Youtubers like Pewdiepie, Raedwulf Gamer and Yogcast’s Kim; DreadOut developed by Digital Happiness, was discovered sometime early march 2013 where I instantly backed it and eagerly awaited its arrival.DreadOut draws its influence mainly from various Indonesian folklore and bears a striking resemblance to Tecmo’s borderline legendary Project Zero series (or Fatal Frame for you Americans out there); the tale follows high school girl Linda and a small group of her fellow classmates when on a field trip stumble across an abandoned village which of course they decide to explore their latest find and hilarity ensues, by hilarity I mean nightfall, and death.The game follows a very similar formula to Project Zero in that you explore the areas while looking for key items, solving puzzles and fending off against various ghosts and supernatural creatures via your smartphone with camera (which unlike my phone has amazing battery life). Much like in Project Zero, Linda’s camera is key to most of the mechanics of the game including combat and puzzle solving, though interestingly where DreadOut veers off the beaten path is that unlike her Japanese counterparts, Linda cannot naturally see these vengeful spirits. This actually adds a rather interesting depth of gameplay and indeed ups the ante, luckily Linda does react to nearby danger accompanied by a red vignette but until you view through your phone you are effectively blind to your unfriendly apparition.However taking snaps of your enemies feels rather poor compared to Zero, you don’t charge your attack and you simply take snaps when your phone’s screen starts to act up however since the game tells you to look for weak points you can never be sure if you’re actually doing anything until the buggers have left you alone. This is a small gripe admittedly and does not harm the overall game, along with combat the camera is needed for puzzle solving; similar to the ghosts, certain puzzles or hints are not visible to the naked eye. While it hasn’t been incorporated too much in Act 1, how it was implemented was well done and when you finally figured a certain section out made it all the more rewarding.Sadly though my biggest gripe with the game is the quality of the visuals, while Linda and her ghostly pals look very nice, the environments are very outdated for a game that had a demo back in early 2013 the visuals are somewhere or par with mid sixth gen graphics (PS2/Xbox/Gamecube). Textures are rather murky with several signs of very low res images used throughout and certain characters animate very awkwardly.Now while some complain that the game is rather short (which I somewhat agree with), the game is currently presented in two halves where only Act 1 is currently available with roughly 3 hours for a singular playthrough which will probably require a second run just to grab all collectables and achievements seeing as the game promotes a healthy approach to exploring (seeing as you can miss a fair bit of content if you go too far early on).But considering 3 hours for half a game is pretty standard, so long as Act 2 (which will be given free to anyone who purchases the game) has a similar or longer length DreadOut proves to be a must play for horror fans and if you’re desperate to fulfil your thirst for more DreadOut you can always play the demo which is actually a nicely sized prologue.Pros: 		Great atmosphere,Creative twist of already established game mechanics, Balanced gameplay, Promotes exploring off the beaten path,Morbid Play is in it :PCons: 		Rather average story,Visually outdated,Little to no punishment for ‘death’,A lot of empty spaces.Written by,WhistlerEnjoy the review?Please be sure to check out my other reviews at http://morbidplay.com/ "

												DreadOut is an Indonesian survival horror that will remind you in just about every possible way of the Fatal Frame series. The game is janky as hell, with awkward character models, stilted dialogue and unintuitive gameplay moments. That being said, the game oozes atmosphere and has genuinely terrifying enemies. There are, of course, jump scare aplenty, but frequently you will catch a ghost or creature out of the corner of your eye, simply leering at you from down a silent hallway. These moments bring about a sense of dread (ugh, pun not intended) that I haven't felt from a game in years. Overall, if you're prepared for a game that doesn't look the best, control the best, or play the best, but is functional and absolutely nightmarish, it's worth a look on the cheap. Also this happened for some reason:

												At the moment of writing this, this is an unfinished game. There is currently an estimated 1-2 hours of play.Unfortunately this game starts rather slowly, but once you get through the initial 30 minutes or so, you'll probably be warming up to the game. It's a unique play, taking place in Indonesia, featuring Indonesian culture and mythology very heavily. The 3rd person camera works well, combined with the 1st person option when photographing the spooky goings on.If you're a fan of the Fatal Frame series, or if you want to see a different type of ghost story, give this a go.

												Highly recommended to anyone that enjoys a good survival horror. The games has pretty itricate puzzles and bosses that make the experience anenjoyable one. As well as hidden items to increase your characters abilities and hidden bosses as well as easter eggs to be found. Can't wait for part two to arrive as I'm sure the rest of h Dreadout Community can't wait for either. I highly sujest purchasing this game. Happy playing adn don't forget to survive the Dread. ;)			"

												DreadOut was an interesting experience and as warning to players out there, an incomplete one. Writing a review of this game is a bit odd at this juncture for a couple of reasons: One being that DreadOut, at least the Steam version, has only recently made available to the Mac. This new version that was used to write this review so it might have a few kinks yet to work out. The second reason why reviewing DreadOut is a bit awkward is that the developer doesn’t really clearly announce the game as an episodic game. In fact, if a player wasn’t expecting it, the way the game currently ends with a lackluster “To be continued” might be a bit like a slap to the face. However, after a bit of digging, there are statements that the game is intended to receive “updates” in a similar fashion to episodic games sometime in the future.  Announcements of this are a bit skimpy on detail however and not really forthcoming enough to prepare player on when to expect anything, including basic patches and DLC releases. What this means that as of the release of this review, this game is fun and playable but by no means 100% complete. As it stands now, the experience only took this reviewer only four hours of play to casually stumble through without making any real effort.For those who no nothing about this game, the story centers around a high school girl named Linda who is on some kind of trip with four other classmates and her teacher when they discover that road they took was cut of from a destroyed bridge after a bit of reckless exploring by some of the more rebellious classmates a sort walk leads them of rough terrain to the other side of the bridge and into an abandoned town, then to the abandoned school…and crazy stuff happens leaving Linda alone in the dark with nothing but her cell phone and a bunch of ghosts.It’s creepy, yes, but mostly because of the sound design and the fact that Linda’s only real defense is her phone. If one mutes the sound, however the whole game seems a lot less intimidating and a bit sillier, more like the main character is in a haunted house rather than in any real danger. If Linda “dies”, for example, she just runs toward a light in this place called limbo and she wakes up where she fainted.  The ghosts come from Asian inspirations, but again without sound a lot of them seem almost goofy. Linda gets chased by a pig demon or has to take pictures of a creepy ghost with scissors to complete a puzzle, but both of these dangerous beings seem a bit laughable. The only real shocking event seemed to be the unending jump scare that was a whaling undefeatable ghost that would follow the player around while invisible if not viewed through Linda’s phone. Mechanically the game was hot and cold as well. The game seemed to react much slower than the player at times and were a few instances when Linda seemed to be defeated by stun lock (the animations taking any control from the player) more than anything else, but again on the flipside, this was counter balanced by the game’s atmosphere, sound and lighting. It was much easier to accept the any clunkyness in the controls when the player is under the impression that he or she is supposed to be playing as a normal, scared, slightly clumsy teenager, fumbling in the dark by the light of her cell phone. Switching between third and first person camera also adds to the sense of confusion and vulnerability rather than coming across as clunky or slow reacting. Only rarely did the faults in the slow reacting controls make themselves obvious when they encounter a situation where fast reflexes seemed to demand too much from the control scheme.Still, credit goes to where credit is due. DreadOut was entertaining and the game’s intro was interesting enough to make an audience to wonder what happens next, despite the shortcomings in the games length and content. Will it be worth waiting for? Only time will tell, but it certainly looks to lean toward a positive outcome.The review gave it thumbs up because it was easy to see the potential in DreadOut and what was playable was enjoyable, but how the story, sound and other content will shape up later is still up in the air.

												Gotta say there aren't many horror games that actually scare me, I just really enjoy games with very creepy atmospheres and gameplay. However this game is an exception. This game is legitimately freaky and especially creepy. I love the gameplay of needing to use your phone camera to fend off ghosts. It doesn't leave the player defenseless entirely but still leaves them open for getting caught. So far this game has been the most enjoyable horror game I've played and I must get back to it. I highly recommend it for horror game enthusiasts.			"

												First of all, congrats Digital Happiness for this game. First Indonesian serious PC game that goes international. Fantastic Work!Just spend an hour for the beginning of the game. Graphics is so-so, nothing fancy. Game Mechanics reminds me of Fatal Frame series, but with Mouse+Keyboard makes everything better. Dark environment+annoying sound makes me wanna hit the exit button...not because its bad, but because it scares me..Ghost is ugly, well if they are beautiful they wouldn't be a ghost wont they. I think I'll be waiting for Indonesian voice act before continue playing. As a fellow Indonesian, It's just feel weird to hear this game in english. "

												Exactly what I've been wanting: Anyone who is a big fan of the Fatal Frame games on the PS2 and Wii should get this game right away. This is the closest thing to a new Fatal Frame game that we have got in the past several years since the 4th one came out on the Wii (and never even left Japan). This game may be a lower budget game made by an indie team who are completely unrelated to the developers of Fatal Frame, but these guys obviously have talent and know what they're doing.If you need a horror fix and are deciding between this and Daylight, don't waste your time and money on that boring♥♥♥♥♥Daylight and get this instead. Dreadout is MUCH better than Daylight, and even ranks up there with Outlast and Amnesia in my opinion.I just hope Digital Happiness finishes the rest of the game soon. The Fatal Frame games were much longer.			"

												Underrated. The game itself is very short if you try to rush through the game but if you explore (hint: explore the town when it reaches night time), there's plenty of hidden stuff. The game is really oldschool, you're required to explore and interact with your environment with your camera to solve puzzles.The combat system is similar to fatal frame but much more simplistic. The game has a nice variety of enemies and bosses you either have to fight or run from. Also the characters animations are hilarious.			"

												At first I was unsure of the game originally, but after trucking through the game I have become rather found of it. I really just like the game as a whole, even with it's flaws. My biggest issue was the sort of lack of direction, and the camera was just absolutely horrid at times. It got pretty maddening at the part with the pig and switching between certain rooms.But other than it's few flaws, I still genuinely enjoyed the game. And I have already purchased the other game in hopes to enjoy that as well!			"

												Only played for about 2 hours and this game is totally worth it as a horror fan. If you like Silent Hill (either the games or the movie), you'll really like the atmosphere of this game. The story is really simple (Young Koreans leave for a trip and they end up in a mysterious ghost town) but it's still effective for this genre.As for the gameplay, it's innovative since you have a smartphone and have to look on the screen to see some ghosts/things. Most of the time, you'll have to explore a vast area to find ghosts/hints/items. It's still easy enough so you won't be stuck for hours to complete an objective.  It's 3rd person view so there is sometimes some camera problems but nothing frustrating.The graphics aren't great (reminds me of the PS2 era) but these aren't the most important thing in a horror game. As long as it's scary (and it is, really scary !), it's good.In conclusion, while it's on sale, buy it, it's totally worth it, especially if you love horror games and you want something different from all these First-Person horror games that were released lately.

												I have only one complaint about this game and that is it's short playtime. As it stands this game is roughly 2 - 3 hours long. However, there is promise of a second act in the future as free DLC, which is great since I am definitely looking to playing more of this game. Aside from length, everything about this game is great. Even the graphics, which are nothing to scream about, aren't so bad as to detract from the game. The atmosphere for a horror in this is perfect. The music, soundeffects, setting, etc. it all lends to a perfectly unnerving experience. While there are jumpscares, the doesn't actually rely on them to call itself a horror. While playing I wasn't afraid to open doors or look through my viewfinder because I was expecting some cheap thrill. It was simply because the game is creepy, the kind that makes you wary of walking around your house at night even when you're a burly grown man. The only other games I've played that have accomplished that were the Fatal Frame games. Even Silent Hill I find lacking in that regard, yet here is a $15 game that pulls it off spectacularly.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys being made to feel terrified of being alone in the dark. It should do the trick. Just don't go spoiling any of it by watching a walkthrough or anything. Afterall, exploration is the key to any adventure game.			"

												Challenging and fun.DreadOut brings the classic horror game type back. I enjoyed the game, still waiting for the 2nd act (They'll give the 2nd act for free). There are puzzles in there, good unexpected puzzles. Awesome.You will not meet usual ghosts in DreadOut, because DreadOut set on Indonesia, you will meet Indonesian urban ghosts there. From harmless to give you a crazy jumpscare, those ghosts are very unusual. Will give you more fun while you're playing with your (afraid of ghost) friends with you.DreadOut is using Unity engine (if I'm not wrong, anyway). Digital Happiness really make a good job at it.Overall, I give this game my thumbs up, Just one negative point from me: It's hard to find the next objective when the game didn't give a clue at all.8.5/10			"

												What I appreciate most about this game is that, while there's not very many enemies in the game, every enemy has a story behind it. In other games like Silent Hill or Fatal Frame, they populate the game with enemy ""Types"", so while you're mowing down legions of supernatural horrors, by the end you've only really fought a few truly unique enemies, and that skews the narrative somewhat. When you throw crowds of the same enemy at the player, the terror of the enemies lessen, and the satisfaction of the player is similarly neutered: That's okay for action games, but horror games should know better, in my opinion.In DreadOut, even ghosts that are the same ""type"" have different sizes, mannerisms, and appearances: One given enemy may be a lumbering hulk dragging a huge metal thing (that I didn't get a clear view of because AAAAAAH), and another one that died in the same manner, and even looks similar, will just be joyriding his ghost motorcycle around the village streets.. Every ghost has a reason to be there, a reason that they're haunting the village (and you by extension), and their uniqueness in the story provides a sort of silent narrative, not centering on Linda or the Red Woman, but on the town itself. It's a pretty cool bit of worldbuilding that's not only supported by the gameplay, but entirely born from it.Though... I do wish there were more environments to explore, or just more expansive environments. An addition of a basement to the school certainly wouldn't have gone amiss, Also, the whole game seems to be a little bit empty of things to do and places to explore: The replay value beyond the second or third playthrough just isn't there.Now that they've finished the game's engine during act one, perhaps act 2 will be an oppertunity for the developers to focus entirely on the story and environments, and maybe polish the visuals a bit. I'm seriously looking forward to it.			"

												Dreadout is a great freshman effort at crafting a new Indie 3rd person survival horror game. It is not a perfect or even a long game, even with the promised 2nd Act still in production, but what is there is pretty damn unsettling and creepy. You just wish there was more of it.Going in its favor is the great atmosphere of a small Indonesian village (which you only get to explore a tiny portion of) and a school. The Indonesian language shows up all over the school, lending it just enough familiarity and exotic flair for those of us who grew up on horror games set in the States. Adding to this are the ghosts you encounter, of which there are a small number. It isn't like Fatal Frame where you keep encountering 'filler' ghosts that respawn when you get stuck and are circling throughout a level.Much has been said of the frustrating bosses in this game, but whether they've tweaked them or nerfed them or I just got lucky, neither of them gave me too much trouble, although the last boss's strategy did get annoying, even with the hints you get upon dying from her to tell you what to do. Just how does a phone camera have the power to stop the undead? I dunno, but I'm glad it works for the most part. Sometimes you wish it took pictures faster so you could nail a ghost's weakspot, especially the one you do find in the school that wanders around on the second floor.The graphics range between impressive and late era PS2, which shouldn't be looked at as a flaw. I enjoyed them. The sound design works well and instills more of the creepy atmosphere.The voice work is miss and hit. It doesn't have any standout lines like ""A Jill sandwich"", but thankfully it's limited to the beginning when the students are all milling about. It's probably for the best that all the kids disappear; they undermine the horror more than help it.I hope Digital Happiness continues to make horror games and to refine their experiences. If you want to play this game, play the demo first; the demo is, oddly, a unique experience and works more like a free prologue to the game you buy. The demo's content isn't cut and paste from the main game and works better at instilling horror than the main game does. If you know what you're doing, the game will last around 2 hours, but there are a number of achievements to track down and collect which can help extend the game's life. It's no Fatal Frame but it earns high marks for trying. "

												Dread Out takes the main mechanic from the Fatal Frame series and modernize it. while short the game is seperated into two parts but dosn't lose any scares or any secrets.If you are the fan of old school Survival Horror this is the closest any developer has come to bring the genre back from the dead and moderize it. Highly recommended for any horror lover.			"

												Ok, so you may look at my playtime and say that's not a lot but if you played the game you would know it's (at this point in time) enough for about 3 runs. The game is not particularly long clocking anywhere from 2 and a half hours for a completely fresh run to under an hour for someone who knows what they're doing. So the game is short, but is it any good? Well it depends, it's a farley well crafted game, and while it's not going to be breaking any top of the line gaming rig, it doesn't look to bad for an indie game. However as i said it is rather short, and filled with very few enemies. considering it all occures in the confines of a school that's all and all about 2 halways on 2 seperate floors there's not a lot of places to put them but you can actualy finish the game only encountering about 5 actual enemies, 2 of wich are invincible and ether need to be beaten off with a stick/aggresivley photographed or outran and outmanwevered. All that being said if you let yourself get imersed you can find a suitabley creepy experience with a good number of scairs that aren't just enemies jumping out at you from obvious vents ( I'm looking at you Dead space ). If you're looking for a well crafted quick bit of horror go ahead and pick it up, with act 2 coming out as a free update in the near future this might just end up being a worthy sucessor to it's spiritual predecesor Fatal frame.

												Part two isn't out yet, so count this review only for part one. This is ""recipe horror."" It follows a structure that will be very familiar to horror game enthusiasts. That certainly isn't a bad thing. The atmosphere is really good. I mean stellar. They nailed the feeling they were going for. The graphics will remind you of your Playstation 2, but in this genre it matters little.The enemy character models/animations. Oh. my. god. They are fantastic. Typically with smaller productions like this one, you see corners cut, but not DreadOut. There is one exception: the enemy you end up spending the most time around is probably the least scary. His animations are a little stale. After your first encounter or two, he will lose his horror appeal.On the scary meter I give this a solid 7/10. You won't be thinking about this after you finish it, but I jumped out of my seat a few times. I got the game on sale; I would not purchase it for $15 until part two is out. But, if you consider it the price of a movie ticket, you will not be disappointed.If I said anything else about the game, I might ruin it for you (part one is not very long), so I'll leave it at that. Overall, I'm pleased. Excited for part two.			"

												On paper, it sounded like an incredible idea; reviving the spirit of Fatal Frame, and shifting the focus on Indonesian folklore. There's something beautiful about the legends and myths coming from Southeast Asia, and being able to experience that would have been a refreshing change of pace from the saturated crowd of J-Horror.Unfortunately, on paper is all it ever delivers.The game is largely unfinished, unpolished, and a mish-mash of different ideas that come together in a ferocious mess. There are moments of brilliance, but too few and far between. There's hardly any character development, there is hardly enough time to get to know these characters, and there is hardly enough sense put into the game to understand what the hell is going on. All of this culminates into a climax that's actually good, but feels hollow - it's like we skipped a few cutscenes and levels in-between and went straight for the final boss.The team is understandably small, but they've bitten off more than they can chew. There's signs of troubled development and broken promises. The game had potential and should have been longer. Splitting into 2 parts meant the game had been rushed.It's more of a proof of concept rather than a real game.The Demo for the game is actually better than the full game. Even the prologue sequence, which is supposedly identical to the Demo, is a step down, perhaps due to the new engine.It's a shame, really. I was one of the people who looked forward to the full release, and was ultimately let down, twice.			"

												Dreadout is one of the many impressive horror games out there ! It has its unique parts where u need to use the camera in order to see the enemy which just makes this game so much more intense. Half the time i just dont want to raise the camera in fright of what i may see before me , The jump scares are superb fantasticly worked out. The first episode was great and i cannot wait for the second to release. I have played many horror games and i would highly recommend this to any horror fan !

												DreadOut is a survival-horror game that focus heavily on puzzle solving, item hunting, and a few bosses fights if you meet the requirement items. Although graphic wise it isn't much to compare with other games with huge staff and budget, the mechanics are consistent enough and the dialogue and puzzles are decent.Since the game mechanics mostly based on Fatal Frame (with a modern twist) it treated the player like a veteran Fatal Frame player, and the game don't hold your hand in anyway (though I recomended reading the How-to-Play at the tittle screen for beginners and veteran player either way)The music in most cases are really well done, but a bit awkward in others. The animation of the NPCs are weird and clunky but you won't be bothered with it much since in the first act you won't be spending much time with them.Ghost and Boss fights are well done in a lot of aspects. Some are straightforward big-scary-strong monster and some are one-shot at their weak spot. The game makes you question what strategy you should use at each ghost encounter. If you are defeated by a ghost, don't worry. The game won't punishes you harshly for your mistakes but instead sends you to a limbo stage for you to think what mistakes you have made.At first sight, items you encountered may seems useless but if you gathered all of them, the buff, or power up, you get will eventually noticable. So, don't be afraid to explore!The game does well to deliver an intense atmosphere once you entered the ""Night-Stage"" combining music ambience and ghost passing through hallways at moments where you are most restless hearing strange noises.Although the first act was short (about 2-3 hours first playthrough), the second act is being develop to patch as future DLC (which cost absolutely nothing, don't worry)In summary, if you are looking for a fresh horror without western influances, and willing to sacrifice next-gen graphic, this is the game for you which only cost 15$. But if you couldn't handle the low-budget looks of the game, I suggest otherwise. But either way, you will be missing out on experiencing a new asian horror if you choose to not play this.			"

												DreadOut is a third person indie horror game.The game consists of 2 acts and also the content from the demo makes an appearance.The game starts off with the female protagonist Linda, her teacher and a number of her classmates finding themselves stranded in an abandoned town. The path leads directly through the town and to the school where the game truly starts.Linda moves around in the third person, but the only way to fight or sometimes even see ghosts, is by switching to the first-person camera mode. Combat in DreadOut is pretty similar to Fatal Frame. When ghosts get close enough, the image on your camera will distort and snapping pictures at that moment damages them.  You will also use your phone’s flashlight function to search through dark corners for clues.The visuals, while obviously not up to the level of a triple-A PC game, are not the best, but still okay for an indie game.The sound effects are good so far. The game is not really scary and the story is also not really brilliant. But fans of asian horror movies should give a try to DreadOut, it delivers a good atmosphere of the good old asian horror movies.Sounds 6/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Dread Out is a masterpiece of the lastest horror game. It gives a refreshing wind to the horror genre (the lastest horror genre is about alien, monster, mutant, and zombie). Grab it fast if you like horror game that stays true to the actual ghost! A fatal frame reborn game that every fatal frame fans must play!About the game :- The graphics itself isn't exteremely awesome. The model playable is good, but for the others isn't as good as the playable character (Linda). The scenery and the building is good enough. And if you're an Indonesian, you will find the texture and model scenery is somewhat amusing and funny.- The audio is *DAEBAK*. I'll give it a 9.5/10 for the spooky in game feelings (well, actually the lastest horror game is about audio things that grabs the spooky feelings, LOL)- The atmosphere is very good. From the audio and the setting, even in daytime it gives me quite surprise. If you want to know then imagine a town like Silent Hill 1 or 2, it's an abandoned town somewhere in high altitude areas in Indonesia (I believe). In the daytime it's misty and in the night it's (of course) dark.- (Lastly) The ghost. Like they discribe in the description, the game is based on Indonesian folklore and tale. So (of course) the ghost are from Indonesia, but they change it a bit, like how come Pocong hold a scythe and it's dragging itself on the ground?? It should be jumping all around.The thing I want most from this game :- If there is an update of this game, please make an option to choose the audio. Because when i played the demo years ago, the audio is in Indonesia. I want to play the game in Indonesian Audio and the text is in English. (well it's just my selfish reason, LOL)Overall i will give this game 9/10 for horror genre, and 8/10 for general genre.			"

												One of the better attempts as horror in recent memory. Plays a lot like Fatal Frame except with a more Indonesian setting. Really good monster designs, good pacing, and while I think the scary factor is gonna be hit or miss with some people as it relies on ambience with the occassional jump scare. The good thing is that it does not rely completly on jump scares like some of the other survival horror games out now. I feel as though this is a game that had all the right pieces but at some moments they were not executed at their best. I would like to see an act 3 or a sequel to this game in the future. I think with a little more refinement this could go from being a good game to a really great game.			"

												DreadOut is a decent indie horror game with interesting concepts. Gameplay can be very frustrating at times since objectives are often vague, but once you find what you're looking for, you'll be smacking yourself in the head at how stupid you are for not noticing it earlier. Combat is creative and each enemy is unique, often containing different weaknesses and traits. My biggest gripe is definitely the short length of the game (a single playthrough being around 3-5 hours, possibly more depending on how much you explore). Hopefully, part 2 will make the game more lengthy. Also, there were some really creepy scares in the demo that could have been added to the full game, or at least made similar. I liked the idea of Linda's friends becoming possessed. It really conveys a fear of whether or not you can trust anybody in the game. I'm looking forward to seeing all that this game has to offer in part 2.			"

												I'm a big fan of unnerving and eerie horror games and I don't think I've been scared like this game scares me. The ghosts can be absolutely terrifying if you decide to run around for clues/items and don't pay attention to the subtle signs of them nearby and can still make you jump even when you know they're right in front of you. The music for this fits the game perfectly and couldn't be any better. The only cons I've found so far is the long loading time and occasional frame skip when a new area is loading during the start of the game. Definitely worth the buy.			"

												Quite an excellent game. However, be prepared for a slow start to the game. The scares build up slowly, each ghost more frightening than the last. The first act is short, but still enjoyable. The seciond act will be free, so this brings hope to Dreadout enthusiasts. This game is undoubtedly one of the scariest games I have ever played. The ghosts are nothing more than horrid twisted viasges of their former selves, hellbent on shattering your mind, body and soul. My final verdict? Get it, its worth it.			"

												DreadOut is very remniscent of Fatal Frame in a very good way. This game has a very creepy atmosphere with decent graphics and hair-raising audio that leaves you wondering if something sinister is just around the corner. The first enemy you face will undoubtedly send chills down your spine. It is very easy to get immersed into this setting.Visuals = Decent, not too shabby considering it's an indie game.Audio = Definite strength here. The atmospheric music is creepy as hell. Voice acting is decent. Enemy sounds are quite chilling at times.Controls = Operates smoothly, fairly simple and easy to pick-up.Challenging Factor = Some enemies seem easy, however, there was one boss for me that felt a little ridiculous.If you like old school survival horror you'll defintely like this game. It's a good buy for the price, and if you don't believe that then just download the demo and see for yourself! The game currently only includes Act 1. However, Act 2 will be added (they say free of charge) at some point in the future.			"

												I've seen this game on a recorded stream and found it fun to watch. I thought it wouldn't scare me at all if I tried it myself but it totally freaked me out and successfully made me scarejump on the first manifestation of the ghost. That was funny ! I like this game. The fact I really enjoy the gameplay in this game is also without a single doubt related to my nostalgy of the birth of 3D in video game universe as Resident Evil was my first survival horror and still pretty much the only one I love. I remember that I did beat Code veronica and despite the amazing cutscenes wasn't that much exited to play it. All the next episodes took directions that totally repulsed me as obviously the mystery is always extremely exiting while the conclusions or revelations are most often extremely disapointing when they're just related to bio weapon sci-fi unfortunately. And I mean especially in the Resident Evl serie. This character here reminds me Claire Redfield with a bit of asian blood added and despite the horrible 3D like flat identical bushes and obvious fake trees I totally enjoy the atmospehere and undoublty overly simple gameplay. Whether in cinema or video games, mostly nothing so amazing can be expected of scenarios that mix zombies and mad sci-fi or if there are titles that I haven't tried and are really interesting, then may you generously grant me your lenience. The only problem when you love to explore every corners of spacious areas in this game is Linda definitly isn't an athlete like Lara Croft. Otherwise, I really enjoy this game.			"

												Just finished getting the last achievment, and thereby completed the game for the 4th time. And I have enjoyed every bit of it! I love the concept of using a camera/mirrors as the source of sight. By using the camera you can see ghosts, as well as entering first person pov. Sadly many ghosts can be seen without using the camera, which for me is kinda a let down. I think it adds realism to the game, that ghosts can only be seen through something like mirrors, reflections or a camera.The story is rather 'meh', but does a great job setting the atmosphere of horror. The gameplay itself is enjoyable. The collectables are not really of any interest really, as well as Linda's 'sprint' is miserable. There is not much mobility in the game, and most of the puzzles is near impossible to solve as there are NO clues how to solve them. As for the mobs; they are all unique: You will not run into the same mob after you've killed it once, which makes sence, since all people are unique too when alive. Since the only way of fighting them is by using the camera, it is a bit sad that not many mobs have special ways of fighting them. It is basically just snapping pics of them untill they die: I think there should be more unique fighting with more mobs having weakspots etc.With all of that said though, the game features a lot of great horror, unique mechanics and an enjoyable gameplay. There are not many games out there such as 'DreadOut', 'Fatal Frame' etc, so this game was definitely worth the play, I enjoyed it very much. I would love to see a 3rd Act. I'd give this game a 7/10			"

												I'm a big fan of unnerving and eerie horror games and I don't think I've been scared like this game scares me. The ghosts can be absolutely terrifying if you decide to run around for clues/items and don't pay attention to the subtle signs of them nearby and can still make you jump even when you know they're right in front of you. The music for this fits the game perfectly and couldn't be any better. The only cons I've found so far is the long loading time and occasional frame skip when a new area is loading during the start of the game. Definitely worth the buy.			"

												Quite an excellent game. However, be prepared for a slow start to the game. The scares build up slowly, each ghost more frightening than the last. The first act is short, but still enjoyable. The seciond act will be free, so this brings hope to Dreadout enthusiasts. This game is undoubtedly one of the scariest games I have ever played. The ghosts are nothing more than horrid twisted viasges of their former selves, hellbent on shattering your mind, body and soul. My final verdict? Get it, its worth it.			"

												This is what we've been waiting for, it took a long time but finally DreadOut is completed. Now the Demo and the final part are included, which is how it probably should have been in the first place, rather than the underwhelming first part. The final part more than makes up for the disappointment in the first when it released. The monsters and lore are interesting, the visuals are decent (though for some reason, it seems that shadows are nonexistant in this version, despite tweaking settings), and the scares are interesting and the atmosphere tense. Worth a play for those seeking a decent horror game that doesn't rely on jump scares.			"

												Dreadout is an Indonesian indie horror game, which focuses on Linda Melinda. Trapped in an abandoned town, and armed with her trusty Irisphone, she whips it out to exorcise ghosts with her trusty camera on her smartphone. If that sounds similar, it's because it's quite similar to the Fatal Frame series.Linda will encounter many types of ghosts, some visible normally, some only visible by the camera, and some only visible by the camera by certain means. To exorcise them, she needs to take a picture of them in the camera. Some ghosts can simply be exorcised by taking a picture of them normally, while some can only be done so by taking a picture of their weak points. Once exorcised, their entry will enter Linda's book of ghostbusting, in terms of their relative origins. And as the background of the game implies, most of the ghosts are based on Indonesian horror folklores.You can swap between third person or first person view. First person view is obviously for camera snapping, while third person is mainly used to navigate Linda across the town, or to reposition her effectively, as in first person view your movement is slower than usual. Ghosts will attack you physically and magically, and when she dies, she will enter a limbo realm, which she is allowed to return to the realm of the living.As there are very few games that are similar to the Fatal Frame series on PC, I must say, this game is pretty unique. Also, unlike many games, the hints in this game is extremely vague. If you are playing it for the first time or so, you may be clueless as to what to do next, since it doesn't tell you what to do completely. It's pretty interesting, yet frustrating at the same time. Also sometimes the ghosts actually gets bugged out, where even though they should be dead, yet they aren't. This will occur if you do something which is not exactly as the game dictate, for example, using the SLR camera instead of the Irisphone for a certain event. It's avoidable, but if you are playing it on your first playthrough, then it may happen.This game actually have quite a lot of jumpscares. It's shocking for the first few times, but when the ghost attack is so, it gets pretty annoying. I don't want to get screamed right in my monitor repeatedly. Also, as I mentioned earlier about the limbo realm, you can't actually die. She will never move on, but continue to return to the land of the living. The biggest issue about this game is that, it's short. On your first playthrough, it will take much longer, since you will be cautious of the environment and also get stuck due to the lack of hints. However, once you know how it goes, you can finish it really fast, within 2 hours or less. Even in one playthrough, you can get many achievements in one go, which is something achievement hunters will actually like.Overall, I say it's a decent indie horror game. There are not many horror games which uses a camera to exorcise ghost on the PC, so it's pretty unique. Horror fans will love this game. However, it's kinda short and jumpscares tend to get really annoying over time. I would suggest to get it during a sales though. Also get the Keepers of the Dark standalone DLC. It will explain the story a bit more better as the plot of that game occurs somewhere within this game storyline, though don't play it first, as you will really be clueless on what to do.			"

												This is the game where you can enjoy your experience on a good horror game that does not heavily rely on jumpscares. It's the game where you experience your nightmare in a trapped town filled with unique ghosts based on lore of the devs country, which is in Indonesia. A game which use camera as a game mechanics, which is based on Fatal Frame but totally different on the story and the ghosts. Also to note as well that this is the first Indonesian game to be released on Steam. Of course with less experience from the devs, there's bugs around but aside from that, the full experience was worth the journey. There's 3 act to play. Act 0, 1 and 2 with act 0 being a prologue. With one that really stands out to me is in act 2. The atmoshphere of horror is really build up in act 2 along with a plot twist ending. Act 2 turns out worth the wait when I bought the game with only act 1 as I have to wait almost a year. The ambience and the soundtracks really does bring the game to its potential good horror game. I think that's what makes this game really worth to buy aside the bugs if you can ignore it since this is an indie game.+ good fitting ambience+ cool soundtrack+ unique ghosts based on lore+ different ways to beat some ghosts+ Love Ira's scene (a stand-out point on the game)+ act 2 overall is good- act 1 not so good story-wise but love the secrets the devs put- useless umbrella (just for cutscene purpose and reference)- Bugs here and there (though put in mind its an indie game)+- the ending has good and bad. The bad is because it lefts us hanging. There's some thing  on the ending that can be resolved with hypothesis but some aren't. Which leads to the DLC that they gonna release, if the devs gonna add the continuation to the story or not.			"

Disclaimer: This review may contain spoilers.DreadOut is a game developed by Digital Happiness that immerses the player in dark, nightmarish, foreign town riddled with utterly terrifying paranormal entities. You play as Linda, a high-school girl with a keen insight for the supernatural. Equipped only with her trusty and durable cellphone, you must navigate through an abandoned school, a ghost town and a haunted mansion in search of your friends and an escape from this nightmare that started off as an intriguing school road trip. One of the aspects I really enjoyed about this game is its unique lore. You must use your smartphone to see, capture and kill the enemies of this town that are based on unique Indonesian folklore. Moreover, the puzzle-solving aspects of the game are also solved by using your camera to figure out hidden secrets through intricate perspectives and weird angles. 	The inclusion of Indonesian horror lore as the main scare factor of DreadOut serves as an effective strategy to instill a deep feeling of being stranger in a foreign country you know nothing about. Indonesian influence doesn’t stop at just the lore – the soundtrack of DreadOut is riddle with jarring, startling and disorienting tracks that truly create a terrifying atmosphere. This game exceeds in world building by creating an ominous and hypnotizing sound design crawls under your skin and has you at the edge of your seat. DreadOut manages to do so by combining flute-type instruments such as Tapanuli ogong, a 12-string guitar known as the Gambus and wooden percussion instruments such as the Kulintang.	The story is relatively short, but incredibly immersive. As Linda you piece together the reason you are in this hell by collecting posters, journal entries, and odd tokens that reveal some bits of information behind the town’s troubled past. Additionally, there are moments in the game where you interact with friends who have been possessed. Some choice-driven elements are thrown in through dialogue but these moments really shine due to their gruesome cinematics. You get to see characters that were introduced at the beginning as the stereotypical high-school bunch turn their bodies into abnormal contraptions or pursue you in demonic rage. All in all – DreadOut is A worthy entry into a promising franchise that manages to stand tall on its own merits while still paying homage to classics of the genre like Fatal Frame and Silent Hill.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group! It comes with a fun discord channel for horror fans to chill and game. Malkavian Madness "

												DreadOut is a survival horror game about a school girl, Linda, who gets lost in a ghost town while on a school trip. The emphasis is on ghosts. It's set in Indonesia and uses Indonesian folklore for the story, which helps set it apart. It has great atmosphere and is certainly spooky. However, it's a little short and the graphics are weak. That said, it is a $15 game and you can grab it for $5 on sale. It is certainly worth the price.			"

												Such wonderful game. Shame it's really short. The ghosts in this game are pretty creepy. There aren't many soundtracks in this game but the ones that play in certain areas/fights make the atmosphere even creepier. Story is good. Puzzles were very few though. Sure there are some bugs but that doesn't make this game bad or unplayable, as some people says here. The best thing is, the game won't give you any sorts of hints. You have to figure out the puzzles by yourself. Also, there aren't any cheap jumpscares that suddenly comes outta nowhere. Sadly the game is really underrated.If you love horror games with no hand holding, tension-building elements, more atmosphere than jumpscare, then get this.			"

												I really wanted to give this game a thumbs up, but it is too buggy to give it a good recommendation. The game mechanics are solid, and the setting and horror themes are fantastic. The creepy atmosphere is complimented by scattered jumpscares that really make you dread exploring the haunted environments. The use of the camera to solve puzzles is interesting, but a few of the puzzles seem illogical, and might force you to look up their solution in a walkthrough in order to progress through the game. Perhaps the most annoying bug is that you can sometimes be ""stun-locked"" by enemies. After being killed by an enemy, you respawn in the same exact spot, and if the enemy was standing very near you while attacking you, you will be unable to escape, and just die over and over. The only way to get out of the lock is to restart your game. The lack of polish and bug-fixing really doesn't justify the price of this game. If you can afford the price easily, I would reccommend giving it a try.			"

												First of all, yes, this game has it's bugs and glitches. But the atmosphere is amazing, and that definitely makes up for it.This game should be played in a dark room, preferably with a set of headphones on. The atmosphere, the strange creatures and it's creepiness is great all the way through. The story is kinda like Silent Hill.You follow a schoolgirl and a few friends and a teacher. On the road they suddenly stomp into a broken bridge. The bridge has never been there before. They start searching around to see if they can get through somehow. They find and search an old school to see if they can find any help with directions, since they seem lost (I guess). Of cause it ends with everyone getting seperated, You are playing the role as Linda in search of her friends.The voice acting is good, the animation however is kinda clunky and the story is fairly mediocore, though with a great twist at the end. The monsters are creative and scary.Gameplay was for me a little hard to get used to - I tried starting out with a controller, but after a while, felt mouse and keyboard was the better choice for this game. The game mechanics are quiet simple, you run and walk most of the time looking for clues, and once in a while you have to fight monsters. You fight the monsters by taking pictures of them with a smartphone camera and later on a SLR Camera. Taking their pictures makes the monsters go away.At times it can be a little hard to know where to go and what to do (mostly in act 1, school area), but it's possible to figure out. For people who can look past DreadOuts rough edges, bugs and glitches - I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of horror games. The sheer horror of facing these weird monsters, trying to find you friends and get out is great. Again, the atmosphere is amazing and is the selling point of this game.			"

												An exceptional game that takes its cues from PS2 horror games like Siren, Silent Hill 2, Fatal Frame and Kuon.  The Indonesian setting is fresh compared to the numerous games set in rural Japan or urban America, and the enemies, taken from Indonesian folklore, are new and unnerving.  A great successor to those games, much better than current Resident Evil, Slender or other contemporary ""horror"" games.The game does have its flaws.  Graphics are PS2 quality, which while fine for me, may turn off some used to current levels of visual fidelity.  I found combat very difficult and frustrating, and the cell phone is nowhere near as powerful as the camera obscura of Fatal Frame fame.  This game is ripe for a sequel, numerical or otherwise, that tweaks these ideas.  Despite these flaws, the game is solid.  I'm eagerly looking forward to Digital Happiness's next game, be it a sequel or a new IP.The highest praise I can give for this game is that for the first time in a long time, I quit the game not in frustration or fatigue, but out of fear.  I did not want to see what was next.8.5/10			"

												Good game for those who like ""old school' horror games.I played the first act and the second act. The first act was kinda short and just in one place.but the second act is a bit of surprise because it's longer than the first act, the puzzles were not that hard, a lot of new ghost, new places, and we're not alone in the second act.9/10 for the first act10/10 for the second actso..... 9.5/10 for me			"

Posted: August 22, 2014
												After playing this game for a total of twelve hours from large amount of exploration through ghost-hunting, achievement-hunting, decal-hunting, and document-hunting, I realize that there is much more to be said about this game. Hence, I have decided to delete my previous review of the game and rewrite the whole thing.I first got wind of the game by chance whilst looking through pages worth of games in greenlight district (pun intended), with the some games looking absolutely dreadful... until I saw DreadOut. Upon looking through the page, my first reaction was, ""Yes, please!"" to which, I subsequently found out about their IndieGoGo campaign, and threw my hard-earned cash at them.It has been a very long time since anyone used the classic horror formula of the highly praised Fatal Frame franchise. All we have been getting in the recent years are just a bunch of sad excuses for a horror game like Outlast, throwing bags of train tickets at people to Jump Scare Central. Look, I know that Outlast is highly praised by many that probably get a raging hard on whenever they hear the game's name, but the game does not create any sense of agency for me, to which, I will talk about it in the future.DreadOut by no means is a perfect game; the game is severely flawed in many different aspects because of its low budget, and one of the first actual PC games being released in Indonesia (as I was told by the developers that companies tend to lean more towards creating applications for mobile phones instead), and because of these two factors, I have cut this game more slacks than the chefs cut New York Strips in an American steak house.To begin with, the English voice acting is believable, albeit somewhat cheesey. I genuinely felt entertained even after listening to them for the eleventh time. Despite the short and scarce dialogues, I could hear the different personality and manner of speaking in all of the character, though I just hope that I could spend a little more time to get to know them better, as spending so little time with them made them feel more like a bunch of talking paper dolls rather than your friends.Though admittedly, the characters are pretty nicely designed.Speaking of looks, though, I have never been much for graphics. Sure, if a game looks photorealistic, it is definitely a plus, but I have never made it an absolute requirement, much unlike many of the graphic hounds that demand everything look like, if not better than, Battlefield 4, regardless of the game's budget and country of origin. The graphics overall are fine, with some noticeable resolution differences between the environment and the characters, though I suppose it is understandable, as most people are too busy staring at Linda's butt, rather than looking closely to the environment's decals. One thing I absolutely loved about the environment are the decals. I explored the whole game, from edge to edge, just to find all the little references and names on posters, books, and pictures, scattered all over the game. This is also the one thing I keep on hearing people compliment the game about. It was not the whole ""super elite ultimate graphics of doom"" that mattered, but rather the little bits and pieces the game the developers have carefully placed inside. Unless it is a pile of trash on the ground, those decorations rarely repeat itself, making it that much more interesting to stare at walls for several hours. Think about it, they actually made staring at walls and floors interesting!On one occasion, I even found my own name as the title of a book, which left a great big smile on my cheeks.The best part the game has to offer, in my personal opinion, has to be the diversity and lores of enemies, the music, and the atmosphere (to which the music greatly contributes to). I have always thought what it would be like to have eastern superstition and mythology transcribed into a game, and DigitalHappiness answered my questions in the first ten minutes I stepped into the school. All of the western horror games consists of zombies, ghouls, and ghosts, and over time, they can become very dull, like the declining fear factors zombies have to people now. Rather than sending me running upstairs and diving into my bed sheets like what Resident Evil 2 can still do to me, zombies are now more of a plaything for violent acts. The inclusion of oriental beliefs made the once dull experience brand new again, like smelling a fresh burp after chugging down twenty mints. You also rarely deal with the same enemies again in the game. If I were to include the demonstration into the mix, the maximum instance of a ghost appearing in summation is four, two of which, showed different behaviours and wielded different weapons.Now, I have just about exhausted the good side, now we must take a look at the bad part. The definite downside for me has to be the Scissor Phantom boss fight, and how illogical and ambiguous puzzles can be.We all know about the dreaded boss fight that made so many of us slam something accross our room (preferrably not the keyboard/controller) after bashing our head against it for a few times. If I were to describe what the boss fight was like, I would say it looks like the result of Nicolas Cage snorting a pound of coke in Wicker Man and then proceeds to smack everyone's head as he runs around shouting, ""Not the bees!"" The boss fight is (or at least was) a complete deathwish, and could take some five retries before you get the gist of it, and another five to luck out on the Scissor Phantom not spawning right on top of you. This also made the YOLO achievement as difficult to get as a solid brick of gold.I never really got what the meaning and purpose of the puzzle was until the result is about to be shown, namely the picture of a small key after finding the group of hanging shadows that decided they wanted a group selfie, and the hanging scissors in the secret room with the scissor phantom, who turns out to be the closet cross-dressing principal of the school. You have to come out of the closet sooner or later, Mr. Principal.Finally, there are a few points I would like to make for the new update before closing in the review.The Indonesian voice, despite the fact that I do not understand the language a single bit, sounded pretty good to my foreign ears. However, there are three things I have noticed. First, the movie clip in the very start with the DreadOut title showing up, you can hear Shelly speaking in English in the background. Secondly, I do not know whether there is an equivalent for the line, ""We clicked right away, didn't we?"" in Indonesian, but the part felt very odd due to the obvious seperation between Ira's movements and her dialogue. Lastly, both Shelly and Ira speak like they have their mouth only a few millimetres away from your ear. I am unsure how the voice actresses' voice was recorded, but the way they sounded just felt off. Miss Siska, Doni, and Yayan on the other hand, sounded quite fine.Lastly, this point may be addressed already, but I can see the foliage floating about in the fog as I walked towards the town.I had a great time playing DreadOut despite some of the frustration it has brought me, but unlike the frustration I Am Alive brought me, I kept on coming back for more, and made me want to explore and find everything I could. This is one of those rough gems that has the potential of brining the horror genre back on its feet to where it once was, and perhaps explore further into territory unknownst to us. If you prefer defacating your pants through jump scares and chase scenes, this will not be a game for you, but if you like to soil your pants your way through atmosphere, buy it.TL;DR:If you like to douse yourself in adrenaline through jump scares and gore, do not play this; if you do not care as much, buy it.

That being said the entire game is amazing, i found my hour and a half  to have flown by having fun exploring the world. 7/10 Im looking forward to part two, hopefully that will be a bit longer than part one.

I got a refund, was not impressed much by this but I think I would still recommend it to other people to try.			"

Atnosphere was amazing even with those graphics.Sound was nice as well altho it was annoing to hear the pig thing walk even tho I was on the other side of the school... well not walk but the key dangeling on his neck.Location was nicely desighned. Boss fight (last fight was intresting)Altho what frustrated me was the rebirth part when you got killed and you had to run toward the light... after extending the distance few times it was rather annoing thanks to the principal ghost thing.Definitly a great work I wish the game was longer and Im hoping that the demo is not like half of act 2 becose those visions at the end kidna did look like the demo segment			"

												I've been playing this on and off for the last few weeks. So far, my gameplay experience has been an experience reminiscent of when I played Resident Evil on the PS1 oh so many years ago. With the atmosphere set forth from DreadOut, there is nothing quite like playing this into the late night hours with all lights off in the room! I am currently playing through Act 1, and am enjoying it for the most part. From what I gather from the game thus far, you control a school girl named Linda through different acts of the game, fending off those pesky supernatural apparitions and the likes with the aid of your ever-so-trusty Smartphone (with incredibly long battery life to boot). Yes, there is more to the story than this, as others have mentioned it is reminiscent of the Fatal Frame series of games, as well as the aforementioned Resident Evil series in various aspects.Now onto the more technical aspects of DreadOut. While the graphics are not breathtakingly gorgeous, they fit the mood appropriately. The game offers the option to control Linda either with keyboard and mouse controls or gamepad. I have used a combination of the two for the most part, and have unfortunately had some issues using my Xbox 360-compatible controller. I seem to have issues dealing with moving Linda around, where the camera view of my character will just all of a sudden continually rotate around unless I intervene. Also, Linda seems to constantly be looking to the right whenever I move her around with my gamepad. And yes, I tried different controllers to see if that was the issue, with the same results. No issues occur if I utilize the mouse/keyboard combination, but I like to use a gamepad for this type of game. Even with this minor annoyance, it does not detract me from the overall enjoyment I am having with this game.I hope to complete this game within the next few weeks. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the horror genre. Just make sure you see your doctor first to make sure your heart is healthy enough to play this game :) Cheers!			"

												At first the controls and gameplay of the game were okay, but once I started encountering glitches where the ghosts and monsters would kill me through walls where I knew I was supposed to be safe it started to get really frustrating.  The final straw was during one of the first bosses you encounter.  Something about the camera angles and the controls made it really difficult to make any progress through that 'battle'.  Otherwise the story itself is very interesting and could have been better if it was more smoothly played out and intuitive.   The little extra bits of information about ghosts that you can collect were also pretty cool.  The gameplay just absolutely killed the game for me.			"

												What is DreadOut?DreadOut is a horror game that is heavily influnced by Fatal Frame, or else Project Zero. Instead of an old camera however you are equipped with a modern smartphone, the Irisphone. Your enemies are ghosts that are based on Indonesian mythology.Now then, let's talk about the story. You play as Linda, a high schooler that returns from a trip with her fellow school friends and teacher. You arrive at a broken bridge and while you try to think what you are going to do next, a troublemaker finds a way through the bushes and towards the village where the broken bridge leads to. Soon the whole group follows suit and you arrive at a school. You found nothing and no one along your way. The moment you enter the school, all hell breaks loose. Linda is seperated from her friends and now has to grit her teeth and get on with it in order to find her friends and escape from this place.The story is nothing too fancy, is actually kinda vague all the way, but it's a standard one and doesn't go to the exremes in experimenting new ideas. However, the Indonesian mythology of ghosts, their origins and story as well as the visual perception of the ghosts are spot on!The soundtrack of the game is also kinda vague, nothing too memorable, but the ambient sounds of your footsteps, the voices of the ghosts and so on add to the overall atmosphere of the game which is absolutely fantastic; you feel the immersion of the game, something very rare in horror games nowadays. Jumpscares are nice, but actually feeling dread, THAT is what horror fans such as myself are looking for! The voice acting is average at best unfortunately, something that destroyed the already bad character cast.The characters of the game are not memorable at all. The only one that they did absolute justice upon is Linda, the protagonist. Through her voiceless acting, her demeanor, her composure, her unwavering willpower, you come to see Linda in a new light, someone that you actively want to protect.The graphics are old and the game does indeed show that. They are not ugly per se, but they are indeed outdated, something that lowers the atmosphere score in my opinion. However, there are some details out there that are very nice when you spot them.The game revolves a lot around the camera, as most if not all of its puzzles are solved through it. Sometimes the controls are clunky but once you get used to them you shouldn't have too many issues! If however you are using a controller for Steam, ensure the button configuration doesn't change, especially if you switch from Big Mode and so forth.DreadOut is a game I personally loved and enjoyed till the end. There are some fun achievements as well, for those who actively seek them out like I do. It's not a groundbreaking experience by all means, but DreadOut taught me a couple of things. One, that you don't need a game to be overly complicated, it can be enjoyable if what you present you really worked on. And two, this kind of gameplay is not dead yet!A game for horror fans, a niche even in that and a game that anyone can play, even if they are squirmish!Here is the video review I did for my channel. Have a look! Don't forget to comment, like if you liked and subscribe to the channel for more content!

Other then that it's a good game to play and scare your friends with.			"

												I REALLY love this game. I have never been truly ""scared"" of a game, but this is the only game that has ever made me feel the tension of being ""watched.""People complain about the animation and graphics, but those remind me of the PS2 era which gives an interesting nostalgic feeling. Not everyone can relate to this one, but I was born and raised in South-East Asia which means that the ghosts and monsters here are very similar. But even if you don't relate to that interest, the monsters are still VERY diverse and interesting.The story is nice, and you do have to have some background knowledge of certain subjects to fully understand the story. Which to me, I think that's really neat because you need to comtemplate from in and out of game. The actual gameplay, controls, and battle are really nice as well because they're simple since the game is made mostly just for the puzzles and the story. The fights have made me feel challenged instead of frustrated, which is something REALLY important to me.I really do love this game and I reccomend it!			"

												I've been waiting to play the full Dreadout since the demo dropped and got me hooked on it. It was a true, non-bull horror game that made me excited for more. I'm glad to say that The full game was not a waste of time. BUT do i think it's a good game in it's whole? it's mixed. I don't find the game scary, but that's subjective. What you find scary will be completely different from what i find to be. That being said, DreadOut does a great job of building an atmosphere that sticks to you, makes you ask question and unsettles. It's story is a little generic, but handled appropriately, keeping it short. If you liked Fatal Frame, you'll enjoy how this game plays, it borrows a lot from that series, with a few additions as well. Visually the game is a mixed bag. It's lighting, monster design and environments are probably it's standout features, but on the technical side the game is a little short. A lot of bugs and glitches tend to dampen the atmosphere and get in the way, but they did not ruin the game for me. Also worth a mention is how short this game is. Act 1 clocks in at about an hour, and Act 2 can be 2-3, so buyer beware if you want to get your moneys worth.Personally i liked it, i had a good time with this, and if you dont mind a game that's buggy or short, i'd suggest taking a peek			"

												This Game has re-kindled my love for Horror games.One of the best things about this game is the fact that you play through the eyes of a young school girl who's lost in an abandoned town armed with only your smartphone and the ability to photograph Ghosts.  ( It's a little bit like the Fatal Frame series. )  Being a young girl with no weapons or crazy abilities adds to the deapth of the game, it gives you a sense of helplessness and adds to the tension when your alone in dark corridors with only the phone for light.  The characters controls are slow and clunky adding to the atmosphere as you find it very hard to run away.  The Game also has some great designs with regards to the enemies, I have never played a game where you encounter giant ghost pigs before!  There are a good number of puzzles that can seem confusing at first because the journal gives you very little objective based hints.  They have created a great suspense element with the game too as there isn't an anemy in every room, yet you still find yourself holding your smartphone before entering rooms in case there is anything lingering in the dark areas.  Oh and the Dramatic music changes can put you on edge and keep you looking over your shoulder for a while before finishing your current objective.For me this game is a 10/10 as it combines all the good elements of the old school Horror game.  If your into the Fatal Frame and Silent Hill games then this is a must have game for you.  I would advise playing in the dark, alone with a headset on to get the most out of the Helpless feeling the game gives you. "

I have much hope for this game and I can't wait for the rest of the episodes to come out. I really enjoyed the first two. Though this game does require alot of thinking, I got stumped quit a few times, it's definitley worth playing.			"

												This is a fun and genuinely scary horror game much like the classic ""Fatal Frame"" series.  While the game lacks the depth of those games it has a surprising amount of variety in the puzzles and enemy encounters.  While all enemies can be defeated with the camera it is a mini-puzzle figuring out exactly how to do so.  There are some real creepy scenes, some jump scares, and some very interesting game direction and set-piece moments.  While it is not a AAA title by far it is definitely worth a play-through by fans of the genre.			"

												This game is completely great but difficult. It doesnt really hold your hand to learn it nor tells you exatly what to do, which adds to the sense on mystery and exploration. The atmosphere and creepiness are first rate along with the playful sense of the horror. The school group is really well done and well characterized. Having come from a Western world background, in which European and Native American folklore have become fodder for cliches in modern culture,  the Indonesian ghosts are a welcome change. I could barely fathom most of them, but once they are explained, they are a very welcome change of pace.A word of warning, this game is scary. Another word of warning, the intro tutorial is really bad. The game would have been better served with the start of the school trip. If you make it through the intro involving the apartments and cemetary, then the actual game is first rate despite it's budget and graphical limitations. It's almost a throwback to the golden days of games like the first Silent Hill , Siren and, of course, Fatal Frame.Be prepared to get freaked out by things you can barely comprehend. As it should be.			"

												Short, interesting story, but very shallow in game lore.The game itself seems like a mix of PS2 classic's Fatal Frame and Silent Hill. It's an old engine, so the graphics are like this game was just ported from PS2, wich I might say can give a nice old school felling.Bugs are found everywhere, be in controls (I played with the Xbox 360 joystick) or in the animations. Sometimes the character simply slides until she stop in the right spot for the cutscene to begin. I also couldn't access the ghostpedia correctly only with the controller, had to use the mouse/keyboard.But, after all these cons I can recommend this game IF you can get it from a sale, for like more than 60%. It is good for people who liked the  PS2 games I mentioned and want to have some new experience with a different story/setting. And the story at the end got me wanting for more. Maybe a Dreadout 2 will be released sometime (I hope for '2' so they change the engine, because jesus christ, it's 2015).It's nice to spend some time and have some scary moments. Nothing more.I would say 7 out of 10.			"

The overall feeling is what makes this game really scary and uncomfortable to play. Definitely one of the better horror games.

As an example, the pig at the school got stuck in the doorway and refused to move, or go away even after using the camera a few times on it. I had to completely restart the game comepletely.

While it is an identical concept to the ""Fatal Frame"" series the mechanics run much smoother on the pc than Fatal Frame runs on the PlayStation. The 'scares' in this game as well as the gameplay in general is very reminiscent of older styles. If you like the newer and flashy horror games this probably isn't for you. The game was a bit short, hopefully the second part will be longer or at very least the free roam mode will make up for it?There were honestly a few parts that had me cussing at my computer in frustration but all around I enjoyed the game and plan to play it again.

												I loved this game. Not having access to a console (other than the wii for Mario games and excercise) and admiring others videos of Fatal Frame, dreaming of a port one day, this was an excellent & not too expensive replacement! With the same idea behind it, namely photographing ghosts as a means to fight them, having you confront them by looking at them rather than running away to the next checkpoint, or having the scary factor decrease by shooting physical monsters with guns. This Indonesia horror game delivers the atmosphere and scares. Although all the horror clichés are here; characters running away getting lost for the story to progress as we have to find them, getting mysteriously hindered in progress until we solve something/kill someone, creepy sounds, jumpscares etc, I found myself wanting to play the thing over again for all the achievements and secrets right as I finished it.This isn't a game for people who are bound by graphics though, because it is not a triple A title, and nor does it have to be. The scariest game I ever played was a completely free Half Life 1 mod: Cry of Fear. But for some, graphics are a must, and they can look elsewhere, or pretend they traveled back in time a few years perhaps.I am not put off by ""poor"" graphics, and so I can enjoy this to it's fullest! It has many nice sounds bits, secrets, achievements and scares to be experienced, and for survival horror fans I highly recommend it! Being Indonesian you get even more out of it I'm sure, as there are some references I don't get as a Swede. Plenty as a horror fan though!There's some tricky bits I actually had to look up while doing my first play through. Some parts actually demand you to be inactive rather than active for example (I've never experienced this before in a game), and some sections/bossfights makes you wonder if you're missing something. You are not told for example when some creature or ghost is invulnerable at a certain stage, or even forever, but I guess if you pay more attention to sound cues and visual cues you'd figure that out.There are apparently some gamestopping bugs and glitches (might have been solved by the latest update, I didn't risk it), I only saw a few graphical ones myself. Also, having a headset is vital to playing this. I'm not saying this as a recommendation, but actually a certain bossfight is impossible (or near) unless you have sound cues as to where the enemy will be coming from, as you are in a tight area, and risk being spammed with attacks before being able to run or shoot your camera (the enemy can be too close to you, hindering a photo working against him).Despite that one bossfight, I enjoyed this game immensly! If the developers decide to make more episodes of it, I'll be eager to play them!			"

												Dreadout is a great first game by Digital Happiness.  It borrows heavily from indonesian folklore, and the enemies are both interesting and spooky. The sound design and music is atmospheric and helps set the mood.  Gameplay is standard for horror games, consisting of solving simple puzzles and taking on ghosts and monsters. But there are a few downsides. The textures are of low quality, which is odd as most character models are pretty good.   The game is on the short side, I  beat it in about six hours including the time I spent wandering around trying to figure out what to do. But my biggest annoyance with the game is the story and the ending.  You would hope to figure out the mystery behind the hauntings but the ending explains so little you're left wanting to know more.  It does not help that the end suddenly brings a few things out of nowhere with no forshadowing ( That I could see at least)  It would be nice to see a sequel to this so we can find out what the whole thing is about, but Dreadout is a good game and you should get it if you're a fan of horor or folklore.

												Well they say they 'Fixed' the game starting on fresh install...no...they did not.It took me several trys before it started.That being said, I like the game. Has a good ""what's in the closet"" type feel to it.Although, this feels like something from Saturn & PS1 era. (love the Saturn by the way). And that is not a bad thing.Right to it then:PROS ---1) Really spooky2) Very smooth controls, Better with controller3) Visually satisfactory4) Sound is good audioCONS ---1) Could use a lil more 'shock' value2) Changing 'controller' setup won't work, or I couldn't figure it out.3) Visually dated4) The music loop is not seamless. Kinda takes away fromthe feel. And there is no adjusting music volume. No music     adjust is a big pet peev of mine. sorry.Overall ---It is worth the sale price right now on Steam, $5 i think, and I don't think you would be dissapointed but not blown away either. I will reccomend this game to most people except the picky gamer, that's their loss. lolThanx...LDK "

												Ok this game is not a first-person horror game like the other 1000 on Steam...Incredibly there is not even Slender Man!There is a story, not only going around collecting pages and surviving predictable jump scares!And even there is a combat system (well not so deep...) so you will not only going around hiding everywhere like any post-Amnesia games.Fans of the old survival horror what are you waiting to buy this game! Ok is full of bugs, techically is not the best, the combat is too simple and the story is super criptic...but is the most close call to the old survival horror on Steam right now.The story is short but never frustating, with complicated enigmas and different situations. A special mention to the enemies, very different, creepy and inspired by Indonesian folklore...included some interesting boss battle!These are the games to be supported in this moment if you are a real survival horror fan.(sorry for english)			"

												I enjoyed this game and enjoyed achievement hunting in it. While it is an identical concept to the ""Fatal Frame"" series the mechanics run much smoother on the pc than Fatal Frame runs on the PlayStation. The 'scares' in this game as well as the gameplay in general is very reminiscent of older styles. If you like the newer and flashy horror games this probably isn't for you. The game was a bit short, hopefully the second part will be longer or at very least the free roam mode will make up for it?There were honestly a few parts that had me cussing at my computer in frustration but all around I enjoyed the game and plan to play it again.

												DreadOut : Review Dreadout is Indonesian supernatural 3rd person indy horror game for (PC) developed by (Digital Happiness), if you played games like ""Silent Hill""  and ""Fatal Frame"" or watched other super natural horror film's like the ""Grudge"" or the ""Ring"" and ""Paranormal Activity"", then you will probably like this.The game can be played in most countries on steam. Dreadout is filled with intense jump-scare moment's it's just a typical straight-up horror. Dreadout reminds me allot of the original Silent Hill on the PS1 with the constant use of darkly-lit tightly spaced hall-ways and corridors but then again you could say that about most supernatural horror games.The main protagonist is a high school student called Linda her and a bunch of high schooler's and a teacher called ""Miss Siska"" managed stumble across a ghost town in the middle of nowhere when they stray from there school trip. It doesn't take long before Linda is left alone and her colleague go missing or get possessed.Linda's only defense and weapon in the game is ""Smartphone"" and ""SLR Camera"" which you will use to take snap-shots of the many (ghosts, demons and spirits) they seem to be very camera shy. The game strengths:The ghosts and and demon's really brings out the fear and dread in someone and it really is a great fright-fest of a game. I was  jumping out my skin everytime unspected ghosts or demon was creaping up on me and screaming when I was caught of guard, anything can happen because of this you will feel on edge.The execution again of the (ghosts and demons) was brilliantly done, I got the feeling I was in a film like the ""The Ring"" or ""The Grudge"" hell even ""Poltergeist"" I really enjoyed the eerie music too, it really set the tone perfectly really brought you into the horror ghost story and the atmosphere was also brilliant , I was second guessing if you saw something up ahead or not if something was a ghost or just part of the funtiture. Graphics and ControlsThe graphic's are pretty mediocre at best, and the control's seem ok but could of been implemented better like the ""analogue stick"" and the ""D-PAD"" (Ditgital Happiness); said this game is recommended for use with the (steam-controller) but I would think most people would probably be using (360 controller instead) like myself, it would of been nice the 360 scheme was implemented better so it would be easier to navigate the note book and the gallery.Frustrated moments playing Dread-outThe game at times especially for act one; I came across section where ""locker-key"" would not show-up nor could I take photo of certain picture puzzle's in the main hall which was annoying experience for me. I would be snapping away and nothing would happen when it was meant to! Not sure if this was general bug in the game or if it was poorly implemented, I had to restart the game to fix a bug! :(I feel bad for doing this because you should never have to restart a game due to a glitch.  anyway on my second play-through I managed to get the key and take the photo that was needed but it turn's out getting the locker-key I need to do the tasks in certain order because only then it appeared when it should of been there in the first place, well not entirely sure on this but that's what it felt like. Other Game bugs and glitchesAnother issue I had is with the 3 candles on the demo section it's never made clear what you need to do, I know games should be made to have fun and to be able to figure things out for yourself but this game pushed me to the point where everything is guess-work and more trial and error and allot of the time's I actually stumped on what to do!!! Especially when it came to figuring out the 3 candles. There I was thinking to myself after wondering around the same area for at-least hour. I think it's time to use YouTube to solve the problem.I find into today's gaming scene that having to youtube an area is very bad thing for a gamer to do and if this happens more than enough times, then you need to address something that is actually game breaking for the user who is playing it. I thought over-all there was lack of ""Clue's or Hints"" in order to help move forward in the game and what to do next but only when it came to the picture puzzles, at times it was more random guess than actually thought, went into solving the clues this was certainly noticeable on act 2 with the (Giant Indonesian hottie - section). I found myself in frustrating problems where I had no idea what to do eventually I had to YouTube that area again to find out how to progress. It turns out I needed to use the ""SLR Camera"" on the grass where the cat should show but the only problem is.... the cat never showed on my run I could only see the cat from a distance. Final wrap up and scoreI give this game a solid 8/10 the game might have flaws but it feels unique and I am fan of obscure games and specially horror and survival games. I will warn you the game does have allot of bugs and issues but this minor thing when you consider what else the game offers and look into Indonesian ghost stories because it's brilliant fright fest			"

												A well done Fatal frame clone (and yes It has jump scares, thank god! I forgot what those feel like). The fact that this game actually runs on my computer and RE:Rev 2 doesn't borders on absurd. Considering the Triple A production of Capcom and the more humble budget of Digital Happiness, I have to give my hat off to them right off the gate for having competent programers. However there are  some performances issues in act 1 which takes place in a small school I was playing the game at 15 fps which is odd considering Act 2 has open feilds and it ran at 60. The same thing happens with the cutscences, they run at 4 fps I don't understand why. The graphics are ugly I'm sorry but they are, However this game more than makes up for it with it's great atmosphere and it's rather eerie story telling. The puzzles are cryptic so I recommend having a guide  as their is very little conveince to the player excatly what they are suppose to be doing. It's a rough first game for DH But I'd be lying if I said I didn't want more of the series. If they can iron out the cinks, Dreadout would very easily stand on par with some of the horror games of the pass the fore mentioned Resident evil. I Iook forward to Dreadouts sequel. Digital happiness has been placed on my radar.			"

												I've only been playing this game for a short while and I'm not yet finished it, but so far it's got practically everything I would expect from a great supernatural horror.  Possession, mysterious floating figures, haunting laughter, some freaky spectral photography, and a wickedly haunting soundtrack are just a few things that make the game wonderfully frightening at times.  Combine that with the feeling of helplessness and vulnerability from only being armed with a cell phone as your only source of light and only weapon and this game has quite a few moments that will give you some serious goosebumps.I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a real supernatural horror and not just another developer's take on slenderman or another zombie survival game.EDIT:  I guess I was closer to the end than I thought!  This game contains Acts 0 & 1.  Together they are somewhat short, but here's looking forward to Act 2!			"

As soon as the game was released I garbed it up the same day aswell as the dlc. The dlc is just the soundtrack and some art/comics.   Side note my wife will ask me to turn off volume when Lingsir Wengi plays hehe superstitious.All and all, despite my bias, Dreadout is an awesome game, lots of Indonesian folklore, good scares decent graphics and soundtrack, cant wait until act two is released. makasih atas semua kerja dan terus membuat game2!

												From the transition from Act 1 to Act 2, this game legitimately impressed me. Act 1 was ok, and I was looking forward to act 2. What I wasnt looking forward to was how utterly superior the second Act would end up being.I thought at first there would be more than 2 acts, and that the story probebly would have dragged on. But no, instead I got an amazingly beautiful work of macabre that shows some seriously strong cinematic and gameplay ideas.This game is ♥♥♥♥ed up, and I love that. I think that the release of Act 2 showed to me that this developer is several leagues above what their innitial release demostrated. "

												I loved it, but it's definitely a ""despite its flaws"" kinda deal.NegativeThe difficulty of some of the puzzles is such that you occasionally have to remember environmental details (or take pictures and save them to your gallery) long before they become relevant, and thus likely having missed them. Other puzzles are simply so obscure it required me to consult a walkthrough quite often. These puzzles clearly make sense from the developer's point of view but a bit more playtester input could have been useful (or I'm just bad at these sorts of games). There's also still a fair share of bugs and translation errors that need to be fixed (and a character is named Doni in Act I but somehow becomes Donny in Act II). These things could be frustrating or throw you out of the experience so keep that in mind.PositiveI really loved main protagonist Linda Meilinda and despite them not being all that developed, I also came to care for her friends, making me emotionally invested in the outcome of the story. The somewhat weaker gameplay is compensated by how well-crafted all the scenes, presentation, atmosphere and character models are (relative to the game's budget and status as an indie game, of course). The game's story is rather confusing but this being a horror game, that ultimately helped in keeping the game in my mind trying to figure it all out. Act II even gives you a bit of player choice regarding the outcome of the story.			"

												I REALLY love this game. I have never been truly ""scared"" of a game, but this is the only game that has ever made me feel the tension of being ""watched.""People complain about the animation and graphics, but those remind me of the PS2 era which gives an interesting nostalgic feeling. Not everyone can relate to this one, but I was born and raised in South-East Asia which means that the ghosts and monsters here are very similar. But even if you don't relate to that interest, the monsters are still VERY diverse and interesting.The story is nice, and you do have to have some background knowledge of certain subjects to fully understand the story. Which to me, I think that's really neat because you need to comtemplate from in and out of game. The actual gameplay, controls, and battle are really nice as well because they're simple since the game is made mostly just for the puzzles and the story. The fights have made me feel challenged instead of frustrated, which is something REALLY important to me.I really do love this game and I reccomend it!			"

												The first time I played this game, I played alternately with a friend. I can honestly say that we both weren't happy playing it since we were quite terrified. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes atmospheric horror games. There are jumpscares in it, but they are not overdosed. The overall feeling is what makes this game really scary and uncomfortable to play. Definitely one of the better horror games. When I think of the time I played this for the first time, I think I've never been scared more by a game; and I played a range of horror games so far.			"

												Really well done, just a pain to try and play with a controller, oh well. Other than the issues with using a controller it's a lot of fun. It has a few points where it glitched out big time which made it super hard to continue. As an example, the pig at the school got stuck in the doorway and refused to move, or go away even after using the camera a few times on it. I had to completely restart the game comepletely. Other than that it's a pretty good game from what I've been able to play.			"

												As soon as I heard about this game, long before it was released, I was excited. I used to live in Indonesia, my family is Indonesian and most of the ghost and such I know!  As soon as the game was released I garbed it up the same day aswell as the dlc. The dlc is just the soundtrack and some art/comics.   Side note my wife will ask me to turn off volume when Lingsir Wengi plays hehe superstitious.All and all, despite my bias, Dreadout is an awesome game, lots of Indonesian folklore, good scares decent graphics and soundtrack, cant wait until act two is released. makasih atas semua kerja dan terus membuat game2!

												I've only been playing this game for a short while and I'm not yet finished it, but so far it's got practically everything I would expect from a great supernatural horror.  Possession, mysterious floating figures, haunting laughter, some freaky spectral photography, and a wickedly haunting soundtrack are just a few things that make the game wonderfully frightening at times.  Combine that with the feeling of helplessness and vulnerability from only being armed with a cell phone as your only source of light and only weapon and this game has quite a few moments that will give you some serious goosebumps.I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a real supernatural horror and not just another developer's take on slenderman or another zombie survival game.EDIT:  I guess I was closer to the end than I thought!  This game contains Acts 0 & 1.  Together they are somewhat short, but here's looking forward to Act 2!			"

												Despite needing to be polished up a bit (janky controls, dated graphics, boss fight mechanics that don't quite work) this is a game bringing back good creepy atmosphere in the horror genre.Jump scares which I am usually against leave you with feelings of uneasiness similar to the old Fatal Frame games. Can't wait to see what this independent developer can do in the future.TL;DR Rough around the edges but definitely fun for horror fans.			"

												Episode Two was released earlier this year, completing the experience and making me fall out of my chair more than once. Many of the ghosts have clever ways that they need to be defeated, and the punishment for taking a hit from them is getting your screen grabbed and having them scream in your face. Yeah fun stuff. Not just a jump scare fest, a psycological horror as well that reminds me of the Grudge movies and Fatal Frame games quite a bit. Definitely recommended, and make sure to play it late in the dark by urself and have your headphones on high.			"

												I loved this game. Not having access to a console (other than the wii for Mario games and excercise) and admiring others videos of Fatal Frame, dreaming of a port one day, this was an excellent & not too expensive replacement! With the same idea behind it, namely photographing ghosts as a means to fight them, having you confront them by looking at them rather than running away to the next checkpoint, or having the scary factor decrease by shooting physical monsters with guns. This Indonesia horror game delivers the atmosphere and scares. Although all the horror clichés are here; characters running away getting lost for the story to progress as we have to find them, getting mysteriously hindered in progress until we solve something/kill someone, creepy sounds, jumpscares etc, I found myself wanting to play the thing over again for all the achievements and secrets right as I finished it.This isn't a game for people who are bound by graphics though, because it is not a triple A title, and nor does it have to be. The scariest game I ever played was a completely free Half Life 1 mod: Cry of Fear. But for some, graphics are a must, and they can look elsewhere, or pretend they traveled back in time a few years perhaps.I am not put off by ""poor"" graphics, and so I can enjoy this to it's fullest! It has many nice sounds bits, secrets, achievements and scares to be experienced, and for survival horror fans I highly recommend it! Being Indonesian you get even more out of it I'm sure, as there are some references I don't get as a Swede. Plenty as a horror fan though!There's some tricky bits I actually had to look up while doing my first play through. Some parts actually demand you to be inactive rather than active for example (I've never experienced this before in a game), and some sections/bossfights makes you wonder if you're missing something. You are not told for example when some creature or ghost is invulnerable at a certain stage, or even forever, but I guess if you pay more attention to sound cues and visual cues you'd figure that out.There are apparently some gamestopping bugs and glitches (might have been solved by the latest update, I didn't risk it), I only saw a few graphical ones myself. Also, having a headset is vital to playing this. I'm not saying this as a recommendation, but actually a certain bossfight is impossible (or near) unless you have sound cues as to where the enemy will be coming from, as you are in a tight area, and risk being spammed with attacks before being able to run or shoot your camera (the enemy can be too close to you, hindering a photo working against him).Despite that one bossfight, I enjoyed this game immensly! If the developers decide to make more episodes of it, I'll be eager to play them!			"

												I've been waiting to play the full Dreadout since the demo dropped and got me hooked on it. It was a true, non-bull horror game that made me excited for more. I'm glad to say that The full game was not a waste of time. BUT do i think it's a good game in it's whole? it's mixed. I don't find the game scary, but that's subjective. What you find scary will be completely different from what i find to be. That being said, DreadOut does a great job of building an atmosphere that sticks to you, makes you ask question and unsettles. It's story is a little generic, but handled appropriately, keeping it short. If you liked Fatal Frame, you'll enjoy how this game plays, it borrows a lot from that series, with a few additions as well. Visually the game is a mixed bag. It's lighting, monster design and environments are probably it's standout features, but on the technical side the game is a little short. A lot of bugs and glitches tend to dampen the atmosphere and get in the way, but they did not ruin the game for me. Also worth a mention is how short this game is. Act 1 clocks in at about an hour, and Act 2 can be 2-3, so buyer beware if you want to get your moneys worth.Personally i liked it, i had a good time with this, and if you dont mind a game that's buggy or short, i'd suggest taking a peek			"

Posted: February 14, 2015
												Righty, felt that now would be the best time to write an actual review with the release of act 2 and stuff. Never really written a review before but i felt to give a try, why not? So before we go any further, if you dislike indie games, horror games, cameras, or anything relating to those things; proceed no further! This game is filled with every single 1 of those things. Now for the pros/cons:Pros:Fatal Frame inspired gameplayVery, Very Atmospheric and tense filledScary!Neither pro or con:Cheap jumpscares (besides the atmosphere which is done well, they throw in some cheap jumpscares to scare you, not something i enjoy in horror games but that is me, thankfully it is kept to a minimum)Weak game length (5 - 8 hours but could be a solid time)Cons:Story is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(Starts off good then falls apart in act 2)Gameplay can be repetitive (Horror games fix this with puzzle elements, this game has very little)Graphics are meh (for those that care about visuals)Characters aren't fleshed out wellIn-depth review starts here, shorten review near the bottom with my score.OVERVIEW: If you are expecting a top quality game, you will not find it here. However, this little gem is in a league of its own. Done by an indonesian company, Digital Happiness, this game takes elements from Fatal Frame, and silent hill and combines them to make Dreadout. You got the setting of Silent Hill and the gameplay of Fatal Frame, what more could you want!? Sounds so great and I have to say, the execution is solid and sound. While they were limited with what they have, they made more out of the little. When I first played this game, it was last year in like June when Act 1 was out on Steam. I bought it, played it and wanted more. I loved Fatal Frame and was happy to see another game use that same gameplay style.GAMEPLAY: In this game, you don't ""charge up"" your camera to do extra damage, you find weakspots on ghosts and aim for those to do more damage. Ghosts aren't pushed back when you attack them, they merely appear elsewhere and can attack in 2 ways: Physical or Mental. Unfortunately though, that is pretty much the extent of gameplay here. You use a camera to attack weakspots and not much else. Puzzles are kept to an absolute minimum meaning you won't be doing much besides running around from point A to point B and snapping a couple ghosts. Their are some bosses that are unique in their own way but felt half done honestly. The ""only"" difference you will feel between ghosts is the number of shots it takes to kill them. Some take a couple, some take a lot. The only unique ghost i saw in the game that differ itself from others is when you had to use the environment to find him or use mirrors. STORY: EDIT: I will hold on to my previous review here of the story but it seems the developers took a route with an abstract story. Piece together the pieces scattered about and understand the whole picture. That seems to be what they intended for instead of just throwing everything at you. A nice touch but until more is understood properly, my view of the story will not change.Another thing about horror games is the amount of files/documents you find to give you sense of backstory. In this game, that isn't possible. Their are FAR too few files to find in this game and most of them don't tell you exactly what happened at all before your arrival in town. I think I only found like 2 files that gave a hint to something about murder in the town but that is it. In Act 1, you get a decent amount of story that brings the characters into town and lose each other to Silent Hill. In Act 2, this is immediately forgotten and you have no clue what the heck is even going on. The story is no longer developed properly and the characters are completely forgotten (figuratively, not literally). GRAPHICS: Not something I really want to go much into because unless you love visuals, graphics are on the low end for me. However, I won't leave it out. I have a decent machine so I can easily max this game out. Graphics, currently, are on the weak side because they have to be downgraded for 32-bit machines. They are expecting to release HD textures for 64-bits so I cannot judge properly on the asthetics. ATMOSPHERE: Lastly, the thing that consitutes a good horror game is the type of atmosphere it delivers to its audience. I have to say, the atmosphere is spot on here. I felt very scared during the whole ride and couldn't help but be actually scared at some parts. The Silent Hill theme was good to give that sense of a ghost town as you walk through, not knowning what was going to happen. Unfortunately, that gets dropped for a night time travel for the rest of the game but that didn't bother me too much. I was walking slowly throughout the game, taking in my surroundings and watching my step. A couple characters gave that eerie feeling along the way like ""did she do it or WTF WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH HER!?"". Overall, the atmosphere is spot on, tension was everywhere, and the entire ride i didn't know what to expect, getting that wtf moment when everything got spooky. Overall rating: 6/10If you are looking for a game that delivers on atmosphere and a solid Fatal Frame type gameplay, by all means dive in. Its completely worth your time and money to be able to enjoy a solid Indie-developed horror game. I would highly recommend it over a lot of other AAA type out there (but if you had to choose between alien isolation and this, go with the former). You can tell the developers tried their best to make a solid horror game so for me, I hope they continue to deliver on other horror games of this type in the future. Otherwise, i recommend moving on. The story is weakly developed, very few puzzles and not much is developed beyond the atmosphere part.			"

												Ok, let's see ..This is one of those indie games that can really like, let's start first.Gameplay:One thing to note is that NOT using weapons (only in combat, very short), the game is pointing a camera and portray ghosts, and that's what it hurts them, for some it is boring but if you remember well, you're a young woman, with no ability to fight.Graphics:The graphics are very good, and are perfectly at 60 fps, just that sometimes some bugs may come and make this game fun terror, I think it's just a matter of you leave any patch to fix this.Controls:In this game you do not need a complex control, and works perfectly with control xbox 360, you only need to move, aim camera, flash, and interact, which works very well here.History:This game came in two parts, until a few days ago just came out a patch with part two, complementing the game well, this is not a long game, which can be completed very quickly, it has some puzzles which you go to suggest more than once, You're a young woman with her group of school, taking a trip, but something goes wrong and decide to explore a nearby town, the rest is very well developed. just that the game has some things that are not explained well, but everything else is perfectly realized.Achivements:To me this is what strikes me about this game, although in paragraph achievement count with a short description, this is not enough to know exactly what to do to get it, some have a great difficulty to guess how to get it out.This is a game to have a nice time, and above all understand its plot to perfection, that can happen to finish the game and did not understand anything of what happens, this is an indie game that really pleases people.

												No Spoilers!This is a game that I really enjoyed playing. I got it when only the first act was out and I feel kinda bad for that cause it ruined the first half when act two came out, but, act zero, and two made up for it and I'm glad for it. This would be close to a puzzle, 'fighting', horror game. Instead of a gun you get a camera with 'fighting' instances just like in the Fatal Frame games(taking photo's of the ghosts while their within a certain range). With puzzles along the way for progression.The puzzles is where this game can get difficult sometimes. I can honestly say I had to look up a few of the puzzles but the others I managed to figure out myself, which, once I figured it out, I felt like an idiot. Though some of the puzzles are easy a few can be difficult.The ghost varity is very nice, very rarly will you come across a ghost you will have to fight twice, except bosses and figuring out what to do with each ghost was fun, though it always comes down to taking a picture of them. The pacing itself was alright though there were a few occasions where it got a little fast or really slow and it left me a little confused. I'll leave it up to you to find those spots, if you can.There are a few bugs, where you might need to run back and forth a few times before the action comes up, but, with act 2 just releasing recently(from the time this is posted) I can forgive that to a degree. Other then that there were very few bugs on my playthrough of it.Graphically it isn't much to look at and you'll find some broken textures but they take advantage of that with good music, sounds, and a jumpscare now and again. The atmosphere was really good and act zero, one (the first time I played it) and two had me on edge a lot, but, would I call it scary? Well, that defines your version of scary but I love horror and it had me creeped out well over half the time.Like any horror game the amount of replayability it has is VERY low. Horror games in general have a very low rate in that to begin with and very, very few have more then three good and scary replays in it. The first time you play I can almost gurentee you'll get scared or really creeped out, after that, depends on how much of a scardy cat you are but I would say that by the third playthrough or more, it becomes more of a picture taking and a achievment hunter game. But that first playthrough is ALWAYS the best.Overall, a good game that is worth the money in my book and I look forward to playing it again in a year or so. I wont spoil the end but if they do try and make a second DreadOut, they will get no complaints from me!			"

												""DreadOut"" is a third person horror-game and was published in May 2014.I came to the conclusion that I can't recommend DreadOut - even though  the game features a very original story which is based on indonesian folklore and pretty unique mechanics, such as the use of a camera in first person to fend off the ghosts that haunt you during the game. The games story and implementation of ghosts is very well done, the ghosts design is disturbing (as it should be) the story is catchy enough to keep on playing and the concept of photographing ghosts to kill them (plus needing different tactics to kill some of the ghosts) is pretty interesting to me! Even the graphics are ""okay"", although certainly not on the level of 2014.  Yet the downsides overshadow those positive aspects of the game - if you'd ask me... There are 3 things in particular that annoyed me during the time I played DreadOut: First - The game didn't really scare, but instead startle me with an overabundance of jumpscares... I didn't get a feeling of constant dread while I played, and after a while those jumpscares just annoyed me instead of scaring me... The second thing that bothered me where the boss-fights... those really had the potential to be challenging, yet fair and rewarding as well, but to me they became constant struggles to ""not get stuck or stunlocked"" under a boss... The last thing which really felt unnecessary and not well-implemented was the ""gameover and respawning-process""... To inform you: If you die, which frequently happens, you'll respawn in a black field with a bright light in front of you to which you must walk. Upon every death the distance to said light becomes further and if you die a couple of times (like I did at some harder fights) this process becomes quite frustrating... The distance can be shortend by finding special objects and relics which are scattered throughout the game or by progressing in the story, but if you keep dying to a boss this becomes impossible and thus VERY frustrating...tl; dnr? Games background and story are good, most of the gameplay sadly isn't! Buy it on sale if you REALLY want to play it, but don't approach it with high expectations...			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It was atmospheric, scary, and had an interesting enough premise. It was very Fatal Frame like, but the controls were so broken that I could not get to game to run properly. Trying to use a controller broke the game completely. So, I switched to keyboard and mouse. It seemed to work at first, but the floating camera then began jumping angles and through walls. During boss fights, in which you have to use the phone camera to attack, the buttons to activate the camera would be unresponsive and not work.I really wanted to like this game. If you love horror, and feel like you can get it to work then I recommend it. However, I never rage quit a game and this one destroyed me.			"

												“Digital happiness has done right job what horror game should really be in recent years.”I’m pretty sure Dreadout is compared to Project Zero/Fatal Frame, but Dreadout shines in its own style. The story begins with a group of student trying to investigate an abandoned village. What I really like about Dreadout is how the atmosphere changes from daydream to nightmare.Dreadout presents thick and haunting atmospheres. It feels dark, mysterious, and creepy everytime you take step into each area with great ambient soundtracks. The whole story encourages player to think and find reference from dialogues and notes. There is not much connection between Linda and side characters which make storyline feels pretty decent. The solid part of Dreadout is gameplay as Linda can use her sense ability to discover item, puzzle, and incoming ghost. The way of game design and how you adapt your camera function to apply in each puzzle and ghost fight are genius and well executed. Most ghosts are both scary and fun to fight due to well-written script and how they behave to player in each encounter.The graphics and animation are decent and some textures are too blurry for presentation. Moreover, the game has some gameplay glitch and poor optimization for some users like dropped framerate in school area. But I’m sure it can be easily fixed in future patch.Dreadout surprises me in a lot of horror and gameplay aspects. It has variety and strong setup even the content is quite short. And the end holds me more questions, but for me it gives such a memorable experience which I hardly taste from other horror games in past few years.			"

												I'd dearly wish I could give this game a thumbs up and a good review, but I just can't. There's so much here that I'd love to like, but it's all spoilt by bad mechanics and the odd glitch here and there.First off, I'd like to say that I really like the atmosphere here. It's really quite spooky and well done. I like how there's ghosts that are secondary in that they are just there and will do you no harm etc. I also liked the characters in this game as well. I thought they were acted very well and all gell well together I thought.Looks are hit and miss, with some stuff looking pretty good, but others looking like sub PS2 quality with very low texture detail, so it's all a bit patchy looking. But there's nthing game breaking here and you'll quickly get used to it all.But it's the gameplay mechanics that really let this game down. I found it really hard to work out what I needed to do. I'm fine with games that don't hold your hand, but this game has some very obscure mechaincs in place, like finding a photo, then matching that photos position to find a key that opens a hidden area etc. Sounds simple enough, but I had to look a guide up a couple of times, just to see what I actually should be doing, otherwise, I'd just have been walking around in a big loop.There's also an issue with the actual photo fighting thing. There's a ghost where you need to ""shoot"" it's red patch on it's back. Despite haveing a camera FULL of shots of the ghosts weak spot, it took me ages to finally get one to ""take"" and kill the ghost.Another thing is the Limbo bit when you die. It can take ages to get back into the game from here (and I know you can fix this in the menu), but often, the game will respawn you directly into the ghost that killed you in the first place! A good example of this is the scissor ghost. I've lost count of the number of times I died almost instantly because I got respawned directly onto his attack. This is where I stopped playing.Such a shame as I dearly want to love this game, but I just can't. My advise? Pick it up in a flash sale (like I did) or download the demo first.			"

												I recommend this game if you're into games like Fatal Frame, which is exactly what this game is like, only with mythological creatures and spirits of Malaysia and Indonesia. I really enjoyed this game, despite some of the slow paced events and a few glitches here and there.What I liked about the game are the enemy concepts, and how creepy everything is. It's always interesting to see mythology from different countries, and how things can change when the camera's armed. I also really liked on the strategy inputs on how to defeat and see specific enemies. Pretty interesting idea(s).Now, I have read quite a bit of negative reviews on here, and what boggles me is the whole thing about ""graphics"". Games shouldn't be just about graphics, they're called 'video games' for a reason, not an animation or simulator. In my opinion, I find the graphics to be fantastic for an indie game. Believe me, I've seen indie games out there with way~ worse graphics than this. I would compare these graphics to be equivalent to an HD remake of a PS2 game on the PS3 and Xbox360. Of course, I'm not just talking about the graphics, I enjoyed the game itself through my own experience.What I didn't like about this game were how at times the cutscenes would drag on to the point where it confuses you on if you're able to control Linda again, or not.I also encountered a few glitches. One had to do with the camera mechanics, another had to do with lag, and the last had to do with disappearing walls at one point.For the camera mechanics, I would be clicking the button on taking it out and putting it away. At times, she wouldn't. And I wouldn't even click anything and she would put the camera away after taking it out.For lagging, it would lag whenever a lot of action occurred and when I ascend staircases, or turn a corner of a hallway. Even when I would have the camera out and there's a lot of action occurring, I would move slightly over to where the enemy is and Linda would be aiming either all the way behind, on the ground, or up in outer space.And for disappearing walls, it happened when I was in the Grand Hall. I just finished with the mirror puzzle and as I exited, the walls disappeared, confusing me on where I am. After making a full circle of the upper level, the walls reappeared.The other negative thing I should point out is the voice acting. It does need work.			"

												Being raised off of horror movies from a young age has made me extremely hard to spook; this game however, scared the hell out of me.There were many times within the game during a ghost fight, where my heart was pounding so quickly I could not press the right keys or did not think I would win.The controls are naturally a bit glitchy in the game, so this can be very frustrating to work with. It makes boss fights like 10 times harder. However, definitely a challenging game that is actually scary. And very interesting too---seeing as how most of the ghosts are of (i believe) Phillipine or Indonesian origin---so has alot of cultural folk ghost stories incorporated in the game.Definitely a game that I will want to re-visit and play again.

												I am not the most skilled at reviews but I can at least say that my experience with the game has been a good one, I don't regret the time and money spent on this and honestly, it's become my favorite horror game of all time.Yes the game has some issues, some that can completely fly by my and above my head but frustrate the living hell out of others, but again, I feel that this is a game made for people like me, it doesn't and never will please the masses but to people like me find joy in games like these because it's an experience that keeps us coming back for more.Definitely recommending the game + its DLC. The soundtrack is indeed nice and underated even, and if you like Mangas / comics well there's a high chance you'll find some entertainment in the Manga DLC.			"

												A very well done breathe of fresh air for the horror genre. I can't recommend DreadOut enough. If you like Silent HIll, or Fatal Frame, you should give this a try. As a matter of fact that's how I would describe it. Silent HIll meets Fatl Frame in a very well done horror adventure. It's not graphicly pleasing (even on ultra settings) but I play horror to be scared, not for graphics so it didn't bother me. I await the next game from team DreadOut with baited breathe. You guys knocked it out of the park with this one!			"

												DreadOut is a horror game set in Japan and featuring a girl student . Graphics and sound are acceptable, but lacks a guidance system for the puzzles. In fact, many objects or clues are not intuitive and often the player is forced to go through the same places several times without finding them. From the point of view of horror is not bad and the ghosts make their figure . Too bad for longevity, but the developers have said that they will release a free second chapter , hoping it will be even longer.My rating is 6.5 / 10			"

												one of the scariest games i've ever played, and that's coming from someone who is very rarely scared in games. this game had me scream out loud while playing it, and it was the first game to ever make me do so.the game is basically a better fatal frame but with far lower production value and presentation. it's never really an issue in my opinion though, most of it is very excusablewhat isn't excusable is how much the game's scare factor drops off in the second act. the first act is incredible and extremely tense. the second is just really boring and mostly hit and miss.i still recommend this game and its standalone dlc, keepers of the dark. but if you're only going to buy one, buy keepers of the dark			"

												Boring chore of a game.  Textures were constantly flickering, i ran into a couple bugs where i had to restart the game to continue.  The story was bland and i dont care enough to look up the meaning of it.   The puzzles were stupid and were made even worse since they were so wierdly cryptic and you're given no clues and some of them were so sensitive that i did what i needed to do muliple times but the game wouldnt recognize it.  I had to keep a walkthrough open just so i wouldnt spend an hour on something.2/10  Had high hopes going but sorely disappointed.			"

												one of the scariest games i've ever played, and that's coming from someone who is very rarely scared in games. this game had me scream out loud while playing it, and it was the first game to ever make me do so.the game is basically a better fatal frame but with far lower production value and presentation. it's never really an issue in my opinion though, most of it is very excusablewhat isn't excusable is how much the game's scare factor drops off in the second act. the first act is incredible and extremely tense. the second is just really boring and mostly hit and miss.i still recommend this game and its standalone dlc, keepers of the dark. but if you're only going to buy one, buy keepers of the dark			"

												Love horror games , always have and always will so if you do also then go buy this it is such a decent game and a good vibe like all the great horror games such as Fatal frame , silent hill , the suffering and the original Resident evil game . So if you like horror games check it out and if you like 3rd person act/adv horror then you must check it out . 


This scared the hell out of me , playing in the dark with my sony gold headsets cranked up and she apears .

Bagus banget, Digital Happiness!!overall, I love the 1st act!As a technical person (programmer, to be specific), I wanna write some things from DreadOut, technically speaking, of course:but before going into deep texts, here's my rig:OS: Windows 8.1 x64 build 9600CPU: Intel i7-4770K 3.5GHz (overclock to 4.1GHz)RAM: Corsair 2x4GB PC-12800 dual-channelGPU: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 650 2Gb OC VersionHDD: WD Caviar Blue 1TBDisplay: 1440x900 LCD (16:10 ratio)Details: http://valid.canardpc.com/a3ae4j--------------1. Loading...I don't really sure what's happening in the script, but when I saw that silly loading bar, my head spinning ""what kind of graphic quality this game offers? Why the loading speed is kinda slow? Will this game offers better graphic quality than 3D games such as Tomb Raider: Underworld (2008)?"" and other silly questions because of that silly loading bar.One thing I learned from this issue is that your team were preparing the entire scene at once than using dynamic approach CMIIW, I hope when you guys will do more performance benchmark when making the next act.I believe this issue is critical, because majority of user base in Indonesia doesn't have best PC available on the market, and if you trully care about your Indonesian fans, you should mark this one as critical.[h2]2. Performance[/h2]Perhaps this is Unity3D's fault, or god forbid, any other thing that causing this issue.In main menu, memory footprint on task manager shows average of 800MB for DreadOut, not far from any other app if they are running on my rig, it's absolutely normal.But, in the first 15 minutes of playing, I looked at the memory footprint once again, it shows average of 2048MB, this is something I can't accept. (I'm sorry for my engineer-specific judgement :p)I proceed with another benchmark, I decided to use Fraps to capture DreadOut's max, min, and average FPS.Here's the result:First try:Frame size: 1440x900Total Frames: 5237Time (ms): 85907Min: 0Max: 101Avg: 60.961Second try:Frame size: 1440x900Total Frames: 5349Time (ms): 90625Min: 40Max: 80Avg: 59.023The FPS benchmark result were pretty good though, but when memory footprint comes to judge I can't say much.--------------That's all I can say for now.Overall I love this game, the story, the gameplay (even though sometimes silly responses appears, like that scissor thing), and of course, LINDA!I can't say much about those departments :pI'll update this after the second act released.Cheers!Akafuri Studio[akafuri.com]atWamplo Indonesia[wamplo.com] "

												A lot of wandering down dark school hallways, opening each door hoping to find anything of use. Sometimes you find a locked door so you try to remember its location (every hallway is practically identical) in case one of the random rooms you open has a key in it that might go to that, or one of the other locked doors.

												Reviewed version of the game is 2.0. I'll update this probably if the game will be fixed (it won't be. Ever. Forget about it - it's overly incompetent game). Enjoy.Bought it with my last money, one more day without food gotta be worth it. It doesn't run. THE HORROR.Okay, got it working on my other PC hooked up to TV. Buried myself in the couch, turned on gamepad, ran Big Picture. Started the game. Stutters like hell. THE HORROR.Okay, quited Big Picture, ran again. Works without stuttering. Looks like PS2 game. Doesn't even have shadows (store page screenshots have them, so gotta be the horror). At least it runs! Yeah! Hop on the couch. Pick up my controller. Turn off the light. Get ready to shiт the couch. Controller support feels like rаpe. THE HORROR. Then the game crashed and took steam with it. Shaт the couch. 10/10 Best horror game ever.p.s.: Now the game supports only x32 Windows (the horror) and Mac/Linux. Plus a dosen of horrific(ly generic) constumes no one cares about. Still no proper controller support. Still the game ditches shadows if ANY setting is changed. Avoid it if you are not playing at work PC at your office.			"

												DreadOut is an episodic psychological survival horror game developed by Digital Happiness and it's available on Windows, OS X and Linux. Available demo here[dreadout.com], also the demo is available on Steam.The core gameplay involves fighting ghosts by using a camera to take their pictures, similar to the Fatal Frame series, which I never played because of being a console exclusive.There are quite a few game breaking bugs that have pushed me to finish this title so late. Still this is the Fatal Frame I never had and always wanted to play.I'm looking forward to getting DreadOut: Keepers of The Dark, which is a new standalone game, on the next Steam sale, or on GOG.com would be nice as well.

												This is not a game. It's a poorly coded, horribly animated cash grab. Do NOT buy this game. It doesn't take long, what is there is stupid, the animations look like they were done by a drunk college student... It's horrible. Save your money. You are better off finding a wall and slamming your head against it. You may see things doing that that are more impressive than this pile of trash.			"

												I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It has a lot of good visuals, plays like Fatal Frame, and the music score is excellently brooding. But there are a lot of issues with it, some small and others flat out hair tearingly frustrating. It takes a good concept and then screws it over with poor gameplay designs.The difficulty is all over the place. While some things are relatively easy, but a lot winds up being luck based in regards to encounters. One such fight (spoiler) agains the infamous Scissor Ghost is essentially all about dumb luck trying to evade an enemy in a tiny room that comes out of the walls with tank controls. In the wrong spot at the wrong time? Too bad, you get stunlocked to death. Respawn back in the room and he gets a free hit on you. They've had forever to fix this.There's not a lot of direction or explanation to anything as to what you're supposed to accomplish. You'll have to look into your Files section to get some idea, but little is organically explained within the context of gameplay outside of some otherwise nifty Silent Hill style notes that delve into background events. Characterization is more thin than I'd like. You get objects in the game, but it isn't clear if they're supposed to do anything or why you're collecting them.Controls are tank based... what can I say? Your character runs and turns slowly. She's slow about using her camera against speedy enemies. If you get hit, she recovers like a drunk on downers so enemies can just keep nailing you during your recovery animations. Otherwise, controls are very simplistic. Graphically, the game is like a late PS2 title. Not a bad thing, really, but it becomes clear more work was put into some things that others. The enemies all look very good and spooky, but human character animations can be choppy. I noticed at one point the heroine's hand clips into her own wrist when bending.But I WANT to like this title. It sets a great atmosphere even with inconsistent graphics and the way the dust plays across the camera is realistic to actual ghost hunting perspectives. The sound effects are top notch. Play this in the dark with headphones! It does feel like a genuine horror experience. But poor gameplay issues take away from the immersive quality. What should be challenging or scary winds up being nothing else than frustrating as you can get stuck in places with seemingly little to do but wander the same scenes again and again because you either can't figure out what you're supposed to do or it doesn't feel like there was anything you could rationally do... you get by on dumbluck. So it doesn't have that savor of challenge that a difficult title like Darksouls would. Is it worth $15? Debateable. It feels like some polish is needed throughout. It's not the worst title I've ever played, but it fails to live up to what it could be.As a final note, the DLC is pretty nice for this game. The comics are interesting and deliver some pretty good wtf moments as well as explains a few things. The music itself is quite sweet too... to access it once you've bought the DLC, check your steamapps!ACT 2 Comments...Act 2 was somewhat 'ehh' at first, but ramped up nicely. Things are more lively and story based in the 2nd part, with the end leaving more questions and possibilities. There are a LOT of boss fights in the 2nd part and the location is entirely different. I would in terms of challenge, the puzzles are often harder than the bosses were (there's only a few, but they make only vague amounts of sense), but generally nothing is 'scissor ghost' difficult. The 2nd is definitely darker and more surreal- expect much more direct ghost confrontations but less exploring. The linearity is a little disappointing, but the journey was more enjoyable as a whole. I'm not sure it's enough to say I recommend this title now, but it's not terrible. The experience of DreadOut is reasonably memorable with great imagery and in truth, I'd like to see more despite some qualms with the game. I'm going to say I'm neutral at this point with the recommendation. That said, if it's on sale, just go for it and play in the dark.			"

												first let me start with the positiv stuffif youre a fan of fatal frame or any survival horror games, you will get a kick out if this game!!the atmosphere is spot on!! i was terrified the intire experiance! the storry semend decent. and enjoyable. theres also times were you can stop the storry and walk away to look for stuff. witch gives the game some re-playability. the characters are semi likable, and the protagonist is mute as far as i know. the monsters are terafying especialy the ones that you can only see with youre phone. forcing you to face the ghost/ monsters head on, face to face, however there is a fewe pointy rocks in this mud. the the game works like the walking dead and its episode base. wich im okay with!! that gives it a movie thing going on. however the first episode is WAAAAY too short about an houre of gameplay two houres if you go treasure/ghost hunting and its taking FOR EVER!!! for them to realeas episode 2 comon I think its been half a year by now?!?! and theres not even a teaser for episode two im starting to lose my patence!!witch brings me to another thing....the ""combat"" i can tell this game wa for the game pad.. you cant even hide it..the controlls feel stiff youre ether too fast or too slow wen it comes to facing the ghost, and knowing were the ghost is is a pain due to it going through walls and telliporting randomly, now i know i know!! fatal frame did this! were the ghost will randomly teleport somewere! yes but you had room to look around instead of a narow coradore!...the enimies ..why? why? why make the verry first two enimes of the game hard to kill? why make the verry first enimy you meet indestructable? and why make the second ghost you meat A ♥♥♥♥♥ TO KILL? taking a photo of the ladys back was like pulling frickin teeth!! after the first three jumpskares i craped myself but after the tenth time of trying to get her back i kinda got more irritated than skared!! oh and the side ghosts? that you look for outside the school are simple to kill!! why?!! and this leads me to the boss...the scissor lady thing ..i know i know ""its a boss its sopose to test the player what youve learned up to that point and put it to the teast"" yeah but it seems unfair! and excrusiatingly hard! once the scisor lady starts cuting you! she never stops!!once she gets you you might as well sit back and wait for death cus she/he wount stop and she/he WILL kill you instaintly and the room is so small with limeted amount of time to find him/her. why not add some kind of struggle mode like wn the enimy grabs you you can push it away like fatal frame did!! you know the game that this game is based off of!!..sigh over all this is a realy good game its fun CHALLANGING, atmospheric and hella creepy!! with a fewe...quirks.. its a good game and i recomend it to any horror fan 7/10  "

												Dreadout is a game done in a ""Forgotten"" Style of the Survival horror genre, and before you all say, ""Um Cl0ps, there are alot of games done in First Person View with minimal lighting and so forth."" Let me explain, so in a society where the Survival Horror Franchise is booming without a hitch, it's full of games, literally hundreds to thousands (Not including all the ♥♥♥♥ing zombie games.......thats a topic for another day) anyways, Dreadout attempts and accomplishes the forgotten art of Mortality. Now what I mean is we all played games like Evil Within, or Alien Isolation, Slender, Five nights at Freddy's, Outlast, etc. But in those games you don't really feel a sense of mortality, everything is sort of pushed along and given to you, sure you die and attempt again but thats not what I mean, most of the new games it's all given to you, Alien Isolation you learn very early on about the hiding aspects, Outlast you learn right away what effects lighting has and conserving batteries, so theres that and then theres that ""Forgotten style"" I spoke of, let's go back in time to December 13th 2001, A game is released in Japan, and is still held as one of the most scariest series of games of all time, Fatal Frame. Fatal Frame puts you into your character and basically says ""Here is your ♥♥♥♥ing camera, heres how to work it, some♥♥♥♥♥♥is happening but you already knew that, escape, on your own because Im out the ♥♥♥♥ing door already because they don't pay me enough to deal with this♥♥♥♥♥♥"" (lol) so you play through with subtle clues and hints of whats going on in books/tomes that you find or some of the ghosts you come across, but in the end it's up to you to figure♥♥♥♥♥♥out and take course of action. You feel mortality because your a normal human being dealing with this scary F'ed up situation where sometimes if you do die it is game over, you tend to be more cautious and♥♥♥♥♥♥seems more creepy and scary, and builds up until one crazy scare lets you release that sweet serenity of a scream/yelp/cry for help. Now Dreadout is like a modern day call to Fatal Frame, sort of like if Fatal Frame decided to have a F'ed up affair with resident evil, had a baby and said ""do what you want but you only get to use a camera."" and then silent hill came by to form a threesome and gave the baby some new toys to play with. (Seriously it;s a game worth playing until the heads of Fatal Frame in Japan get their heads out of their asses and finally release another of their masterpieces here in North America, that would raise the bar for a new generation.)All in All let's face facts, it's not Fatal Frame........But, its not Duke Nukem Forever.This game manages to pull off what is was inspired by very well, there are some pros and cons just like any other games which are:Pros:+Sound Quality+Controls fairly Easy+Has a decent story, keeps you going+You are able to explore you areas fairly well+It has that mystique of not knowing whats next that every Survival horror genre game should have.+builds up its scares nicely+Let's you feel mortalCons:-Graphics aren't bad but don't expect brand new Far Cry 4 graphics-Its being released in ""Acts"" which isn't bad unless you are like me who just wants to keep going to see whats next.-Achievements sometimes don't work (but from what I hear they have been patching that so you should be good.)All in all this game is definitely worth it.  Category Score   Visual 8.5/10   Sound 9/10   Gameplay 9/10   Total 9/10  "

												it is short (and thats without act 2), has some glitches, the graphics arent up to date but the atmosphere is really good. school can be a scary place. equipped only with your phone, you have to find your way out of it and fight off the entites that haunt the place. with some decent puzzles (some required looking up on youtube because they werent that obvious) and exploring the derelict school, you will have a good time regardless.  but for full price, i think its too much. i got it when it was 50% off and this, i think, is a reasonable price, once act 2 is out, which is for free.edit:well, act 2 is out and it is still creepy. a bit boss fight heavy but few more locations than just the school. also a very nice spot that is more relaxing. that is until you lid all the candels. also it has several endings that requires several playthroughs.

												first let me start with the positiv stuffif youre a fan of fatal frame or any survival horror games, you will get a kick out if this game!!the atmosphere is spot on!! i was terrified the intire experiance! the storry semend decent. and enjoyable. theres also times were you can stop the storry and walk away to look for stuff. witch gives the game some re-playability. the characters are semi likable, and the protagonist is mute as far as i know. the monsters are terafying especialy the ones that you can only see with youre phone. forcing you to face the ghost/ monsters head on, face to face, however there is a fewe pointy rocks in this mud. the the game works like the walking dead and its episode base. wich im okay with!! that gives it a movie thing going on. however the first episode is WAAAAY too short about an houre of gameplay two houres if you go treasure/ghost hunting and its taking FOR EVER!!! for them to realeas episode 2 comon I think its been half a year by now?!?! and theres not even a teaser for episode two im starting to lose my patence!!witch brings me to another thing....the ""combat"" i can tell this game wa for the game pad.. you cant even hide it..the controlls feel stiff youre ether too fast or too slow wen it comes to facing the ghost, and knowing were the ghost is is a pain due to it going through walls and telliporting randomly, now i know i know!! fatal frame did this! were the ghost will randomly teleport somewere! yes but you had room to look around instead of a narow coradore!...the enimies ..why? why? why make the verry first two enimes of the game hard to kill? why make the verry first enimy you meet indestructable? and why make the second ghost you meat A ♥♥♥♥♥ TO KILL? taking a photo of the ladys back was like pulling frickin teeth!! after the first three jumpskares i craped myself but after the tenth time of trying to get her back i kinda got more irritated than skared!! oh and the side ghosts? that you look for outside the school are simple to kill!! why?!! and this leads me to the boss...the scissor lady thing ..i know i know ""its a boss its sopose to test the player what youve learned up to that point and put it to the teast"" yeah but it seems unfair! and excrusiatingly hard! once the scisor lady starts cuting you! she never stops!!once she gets you you might as well sit back and wait for death cus she/he wount stop and she/he WILL kill you instaintly and the room is so small with limeted amount of time to find him/her. why not add some kind of struggle mode like wn the enimy grabs you you can push it away like fatal frame did!! you know the game that this game is based off of!!..sigh over all this is a realy good game its fun CHALLANGING, atmospheric and hella creepy!! with a fewe...quirks.. its a good game and i recomend it to any horror fan 7/10  "

												Dreadout is a game done in a ""Forgotten"" Style of the Survival horror genre, and before you all say, ""Um Cl0ps, there are alot of games done in First Person View with minimal lighting and so forth."" Let me explain, so in a society where the Survival Horror Franchise is booming without a hitch, it's full of games, literally hundreds to thousands (Not including all the ♥♥♥♥ing zombie games.......thats a topic for another day) anyways, Dreadout attempts and accomplishes the forgotten art of Mortality. Now what I mean is we all played games like Evil Within, or Alien Isolation, Slender, Five nights at Freddy's, Outlast, etc. But in those games you don't really feel a sense of mortality, everything is sort of pushed along and given to you, sure you die and attempt again but thats not what I mean, most of the new games it's all given to you, Alien Isolation you learn very early on about the hiding aspects, Outlast you learn right away what effects lighting has and conserving batteries, so theres that and then theres that ""Forgotten style"" I spoke of, let's go back in time to December 13th 2001, A game is released in Japan, and is still held as one of the most scariest series of games of all time, Fatal Frame. Fatal Frame puts you into your character and basically says ""Here is your ♥♥♥♥ing camera, heres how to work it, some♥♥♥♥♥♥is happening but you already knew that, escape, on your own because Im out the ♥♥♥♥ing door already because they don't pay me enough to deal with this♥♥♥♥♥♥"" (lol) so you play through with subtle clues and hints of whats going on in books/tomes that you find or some of the ghosts you come across, but in the end it's up to you to figure♥♥♥♥♥♥out and take course of action. You feel mortality because your a normal human being dealing with this scary F'ed up situation where sometimes if you do die it is game over, you tend to be more cautious and♥♥♥♥♥♥seems more creepy and scary, and builds up until one crazy scare lets you release that sweet serenity of a scream/yelp/cry for help. Now Dreadout is like a modern day call to Fatal Frame, sort of like if Fatal Frame decided to have a F'ed up affair with resident evil, had a baby and said ""do what you want but you only get to use a camera."" and then silent hill came by to form a threesome and gave the baby some new toys to play with. (Seriously it;s a game worth playing until the heads of Fatal Frame in Japan get their heads out of their asses and finally release another of their masterpieces here in North America, that would raise the bar for a new generation.)All in All let's face facts, it's not Fatal Frame........But, its not Duke Nukem Forever.This game manages to pull off what is was inspired by very well, there are some pros and cons just like any other games which are:Pros:+Sound Quality+Controls fairly Easy+Has a decent story, keeps you going+You are able to explore you areas fairly well+It has that mystique of not knowing whats next that every Survival horror genre game should have.+builds up its scares nicely+Let's you feel mortalCons:-Graphics aren't bad but don't expect brand new Far Cry 4 graphics-Its being released in ""Acts"" which isn't bad unless you are like me who just wants to keep going to see whats next.-Achievements sometimes don't work (but from what I hear they have been patching that so you should be good.)All in all this game is definitely worth it.  Category Score   Visual 8.5/10   Sound 9/10   Gameplay 9/10   Total 9/10  "

												Brilliantly executed survival horror game.  Although the story is short, the atmosphere more than makes up for it.  Have not played a game that draws you in this much in a long while. It kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole experience and from time to time made genuinely scared.Would highly recommend this game. "

												After spending 2 hours running around in circles in the school, I finally realized I had absolutely no fun playing this game. The idea is interesting, the atmosphere is kinda right, but as for the rest :- awful textures (like, ps2-awful or something) (note : apparently, the game was first shipped with ""64 bits"" textures, supposedly much better, but which were removed for ""performance"" problems. I never saw them, and they were never reintroduced despite the initial ""promise"")- useless walking pace, meaning you'll have to be running all the time, except you can't run all the time as the character has to catch her breath from time to time- uninspired level design- average and not well presented puzzles (those that I saw, at least).- limbo (when you ""die"", you wake up in limbo, which requires you to walk towards a light to start playing again (at least 1 minute lost every time)- not tight enough controls (some of the fights require you to get behind your target, it's a hassle just to do that, and if you miss, chances are you'll get a stuck in a ""loop"" of you being knocked down repeatedly by your target, meaning you'll probably end up in limbo-oh-great-not-again ? see above)- camera control has a bad tendancy to ""double"" your input, meaning you'll raise it and then immediately lower it, especially when you try to activate it after running (which you do all the time, see above). As the camera is crucial for some events, guess what ? Back to limbo-you-gotta-be-kidding-me again (see above ... again :p)- absolutely no sense of fear after the first jump-scare (if you can even call it that)- minor, but from what I saw, your character doesn't talk, not even answering questions asked by her teammatesI finally gave up after 3 hours, totally bored. This game could have been good, maybe even great, but in the end, it brings absolutely no fun, just frustration, and as such, there's no way I can recommend it.			"

												On the whole I would recomend this game, it does have some solid scares and pulls off a creepy all alone atmosphere very well. However you simply can't get away from the fact that the game needs more polish especially in the animation department which get very janky and do take away from the game. I like the basis in Indonisian ghosts even though I can't pronounce them. The second act however is a bit of a low point for me as I found glitches, slow chase scenes that I think were supposed to be tense but weren't so ended up being frustrating and a boss battle I beat by tabbing out and looking up a walkthrough to see if what I was doing was correct. (Seriously I had tabbed out the game and was in the middle of reading a walkthrough when I beat the boss, how I have no idea.) I am assuming this is Digital Happiness's first game and if it is then well done, this is certainly a good game and worth a buy, on sale mind you.			"

												DreadOut is an episodic psychological survival horror game developed by Digital Happiness and it's available on Windows, OS X and Linux. Available demo here[dreadout.com], also the demo is available on Steam.The core gameplay involves fighting ghosts by using a camera to take their pictures, similar to the Fatal Frame series, which I never played because of being a console exclusive.There are quite a few game breaking bugs that have pushed me to finish this title so late. Still this is the Fatal Frame I never had and always wanted to play.I'm looking forward to getting DreadOut: Keepers of The Dark, which is a new standalone game, on the next Steam sale, or on GOG.com would be nice as well.

Though it's slow at parts it makes up for it in some the best moments in horror gaming. It says otherwise in big picture mode, you CAN play with game with the steam controller. I played the entire game with the with no hangups or hiccups. DreadOut is well suited for controller play.			"

												If you own a Mac, I would proceed with caution before attempting to purchase this.You may notice that my current number of hours spent on this game is about eight hours. The majority of that time has been spent, believe it or not, attempting to start up the game and play it. I have been able to play 'Act 0' (which is the demo level) without any issues but upon playing 'Act 1' the game will shut down. Sometimes I'm luckier than others and I'm able to progress for a couple of minutes, at others it will shut down before the credits start. I tried to use 'Crossover' and I got a little bit further than usual but even then the game quit unexpectedly.Needless to say, this is frustrating as I would like to play the game. I will edit this review when this is fixed but until then I can't recommend a purchase.			"

												manstab deh pokok'e ni game :Djust like fatal frame, to defeat a ghost all you need is to take a pict from those ghost, and to defeat a strong ghost, you need to find his weak point... you will find so much Asian Ghost, Especially Indonesian Ghost. do you know? Indonesian Ghost is the one of many the most scariest ghost in the world :D			"

												Ever since the first demo was released about 3 years ago from now I planned to ignore DreadOut completely. I was never a huge fan of Fatal Frame, but always had respect for that series trying to keep some of it's identity and some of the core of the classic survival horror concepts, instead of devolving into a simplistic jumpscare fest. Which DreadOut is. I suspected it after the demo. And now, after deciding to give it a try (I mean, they supported the game for so long and even made a standalone expansion, there HAS to be something?), I can say that with certainty.DreadOut, from the very beginning, until *almost* very end is the same kind of game most horror themed products on Unity engine, ever since SCP and Slender games got popular, is - a linear jumpscare fest of BOO in your face moments with loud screaming. It has the most basic of mechanics, quite clumsily taken from Fatal Frame, sometimes has ""puzzles"" and sometimes even has an item you need to take. So exciting! But most of the time it's very guided experience that holds exactly on one thing - on trying to be spoopy, because freaky ghost, baby. But butsin doesn't make you feel good here. Because it's barely a mechanic, unlike the complex system in Fatal Frame. It's here just to give an illusion of another mechanical layer and make sure you have first person view with limited visibility to do jump scares more effectively.The only good things the game has are, amazingly, in the very very end - there's one actually pretty interesting in concept (but boring in reality) boss fight, another good in concept, but more frustrating than hard boss fight and actually good with visuals and some concepts final boss fight, which is, however, terrible mechanically. It actually feels as if the developers finally realised how games could be made right as they were finishing it. Shame they didn't scrap the entire game and make a new one, though.Is DreadOut worth it? Well, if you're playing horror themed games just for spoops and video/streaming scarecam silliness, you will be able to get some enjoyment out of this. If you want anything more than have jumpscares at different intervals... Hell, if you want the game to perform and not glitch, you better look elseware. It's not like there's a shortage of horror themed games on PC lately.			"

												Ok I'll write a review:Gameplay: 3/10 Running simulator and collect stuff to open new areas and take picture of ghosts when the camera starts glitching to kill them, sometimes you have to aim at their weak spot. Glitch:The school is so confusing. I got stuck at the school because the game decided to remove the green key which unlocks the closet on the second floor; spent hours trying to figure out the solution and in the end I found out the game was broken because the key did not show for me and so I had to exit and jump to Act2. Graphics: 4/10 the characters models and some monsters looked good, but the level design looked like from Playstation2, seriously why is it so outdated?! Also, there where some graphical glitches.Sounds: 8/10 it was fine and the voice acting is good although sometimes a character speaks and you hear the sound coming from elsewhere.Story: I didn't even finish it, ran out of patience.Overall: 5/10 too much walking, bad graphics and repetitive gameplay. I loved Silent Hill by the way.My suggestions: This game needs puzzels  and more engaging story. It needs variations more weapons to choose from more consumables. Also, better hint system I dont' want to google stuff to find my way in the game.			"

												If you are curious about this game, put this in your wishlist untill the act 2 and/or wait till the game is finished then get it. The concept and ideas have potential however, the story had more plotholes like the bumpy roads you traverse onto in the first chapter. The immersion of this game was gone the moment I started looking for hints online. Ghosts are rare and one of them will give you too many cheap deaths. No game overs felt like theres no sense of accomplishment. The puzzles in the game felt like fillers to pad the gameplay out. There were a few instances were I had to reload my save file again because of the bugs and glitches ingame. Its unfortunate that many names are involved in this project for such a short game. Oh well, I m in it for the long haul so hopefully theres exposition in the later chapters/acts to follow in the future. My suggestion is NEVER PLAYTHROUGH THIS GAME BLIND!			"

												Overall, I enjoy the game.  The environmental artstyle during the daytime lacks polish according to what I expect from today's games, but it works.  With this game, it could have two modes.  The traditional ""survival horror"" mode, and then a story mode where the boss fights require less camera shots.  As it stands, I find the boss fights extremely challenging due to what seems to be a lack of responsiveness from raising the camera to take a picture.  I'm quite stuck at the scissors boss due to the lack of responsiveness of this.  It feels like I must stop, wait a fractional amount of time, then raise the camera, then take the picture, and by then ... it's pointless.  If you've played Resident Evil 4, then you'll understand when I say this boss fight reminds me of the blade armed cage fight in the castle, except no gun, and no where near as frustrating.  Difficulty settings could deal with how many photos you must take of a given monster, or if the camera targetting challenge is on or off.  Even with the downfalls of it, I like the idea, so I'll give it a thumbs up.  Just don't think I'll be playing it much unless I feel like really frustrating myself.			"

												Seems like a good idea for a game, but there are a lot of issues wtih this. There is a lot of frame rate drops while walking and running, you have to take about 30 pictures of boss ghosts to get to the next part. Some are invicible to kill. Got stuck after a very hard part which I beat and still had to re-do the hard part due to being stuck in a rock. I love to support non AAA games, but this one needs a lot of work before people pay money for this. Plus there is no waypoint so gameplay is very tough to know where to go.			"

												So its been a year since my first thumbs down review. Still have the same opinion of the game.Atmosphere: 10/10Graphics: Great for an indie game company. Dont expect AAA.Sound: Music/effects Good.Voice Acting: House of the Dead/10.Honest and Trustworthy Devs 0/10And thats the crux of my thumbs down. The game itself isnt bad, but they included a rebind keys option. Its selectable and you can rebind the controls in the game. There is no warning in the game or on the purchase page that this option DOES NOT WORK. It just breaks the game as any rebound control ceases to function. Burried deep in a suggestions to the devs thread on the forums they acknowledge it does not work and said they want to add that fuctionality but it is not a priority. Thats fine, but why is the option there then? Why isnt it greyed out, or a message saying not to do it yet. ANYTHING. You just rebind your controls and then wonder why the game doesnt work. To me, this openface lie makes me wish the refund policy was available when I bought the game. As a left handed person this option is very important to me and my game playing experience. The absence or warning that it doesnt work yet being present this would of been a 9/10 please buy and support cuz the atmosphere and style is amazing. But instead I see dishonest and lying company I want no part of or support for.Sadly im in the minority and will go completely un-noticed. If you care about developer integrity and a simple one line of code it would of been to grey out the option till its added everything would be fine. Instead :thumbsdown:			"

YouTube™ Video: DreadOut ✭ Act 1 ✭ 1 - Schoolgirl Spooks 

			Views: 88		

			So why exactly did they go into the spooky abandoned town? Their car isn't broken down... If you liked the vid, I do plenty of this, why not subscribe here to keep up to date?		

As of writing this, only “Act 1” is available, this is worth mentioning since on the steam store page there’s a little note saying “Act 2” will be a free update that comes “later”. Is it fair to review the game when not all the content is out? Then again, is it fair to charge for a game when what’s available amounts to barely anything?At first I got vibes of a teen slasher film; a group of students on a road trip (with their teacher for some reason?) with a funky sound track and not a care in the world. After a wrong turn they end up at an abandoned town and decide that the sensible idea is to leave the car behind and walk blindly through town, rather than just retreating from whence they came. Eventually they come across a school, and we all know kids love nothing better, so the boys rush inside, presumably to vandalise, but this is basically the last we see or hear of them. It suddenly becomes night and it occurs to everyone that the guys have been gone a while, maybe they should look for them. Upon entering everyone else disappears, and the doors are locked. Hope you like school; it’s all you’re going to see from this point on. While the game doesn’t really say as much, you’re presumably tasked with finding the rest of the suddenly missing field trip posse, though by the end of the act, no real progress is made on that front.The backstory of the town is explained through the traditional “find the letters” gimmick. However, note “the town”, all the backstory is about the town at large rather than the place you spend all your time in; the school. By the time you’re finished, you’re no wiser as to what was going on at the school than when you started, nor why any of these phantoms are residing there.Weirdly, once the night time portion starts, you can head back into town instead of going into the school, which reveals a UFO and a couple of other demons, just kind of… there. Sadly it feels like more effort is put into these “secrets” than fleshing out the main plot.Back in the school, you’ll be aimlessly wandering around looking for puzzles no one asked you to solve. For some reason a pig demon has the keys to the front door around his neck, and it all snowballs from there. It uses the Project Zero gimmick of taking a picture of a scene, only for the image to show to a different place where you go and pick up an item, except there’s nothing explaining why.If a ghost touches you, then our heroine becomes “stressed”, repeated touching causes her to collapse. Oddly rather than die you appear in “Limbo”, which is to say you wake up in darkness, surrounded by a ring of candles and an eerie source of light in the distance. Sometimes a voice whispers clues, which end up being a lot more useful than the ones Linda keeps in her journal. Sadly why limbo exists and why she’s experiencing it, or whether it’s just something that happens to everyone in this world is left completely unexplained.Basically, don’t come to this game for the story.The ghostly crew consists of a phantom pig, a yeti on crack, a businessman, a crossdressing teacher, a giant lady and a lady that likes to sing. After defeating a ghost, you get a little extract in your journal explaining what the ghost’s deal is, but it’s kind of irrelevant and doesn’t really do anything to tie them into the world or explain why they hang out at school.I was initially impressed with the reserved use of the phantoms, each is a particular character in the world rather than a random spawn, though what exactly that character is isn’t really defined. The second floor contains a ghost that disappears instead of dying, after defeating it, in one of the worst attempts at a jump scare I’ve seen in gaming, you’ll periodically get a image of it going “AAAARGH!” in front of your face briefly appear on screen. This wouldn’t be so bad were it not accompanied by a constant wailing that follows you around the second floor. This completely destroyed the atmosphere. It ended up being a deterrent to exploration since I just stopped going to the second floor until I was certain I’d exhausted every other option.You can fight the ghosts off via your camera phone, but you can’t actually defeat them, just make them retreat until they feel like attacking again. When you take the picture *something* seems to happen to them, like the pig monster gets smaller and the yeti vanishes, but ultimately it doesn’t seem to mean anything, they’ll happily come back. Also loading screen hints say the camera can be upgraded, but that doesn’t seem to be implemented. The game says that it’s the camera flash that’s defeating the ghosts, but that begs the question; why aren’t they affected by the flashlight?The game area essentially consists of; four corridors, a foyer, a boss room and a bunch of classrooms, most of which have nothing of interest in, just an array of misaligned desks, chairs and backpacks. Oh, and toilets, a prime place for a spook, right? Not here… In fact, there are very few rooms that contain anything of interest. It feels more like a haunted house; designed to mimic creepy films and rely on the fact you were scared of those, rather than providing any actual frights of its own.There are a few puzzles, but they don’t have any context, nor make much sense, ultimately the main puzzle of the game is; the pig demon has the front door keys, find a way of getting them. The game just doesn’t have enough content, story, locations, characters… anything.The idea of DreadOut isn’t entirely bad, neither is the execution, plenty of horror games have clunky controls, I can forgive that. I even enjoyed some of the time I spent with it. But it’s barely a game. It’s an assortment of horror elements, jumbled together with no reasoning behind it resulting in something that completely fails in its object to scare.Maybe Act 2 will fix that problem, but if it’s anything like the first, the only thing that’ll have me screaming is frustration at the lack of content.

 DreadOut Review  Story In act 1 the story in this game is wierd, you are trap in a village, must escape, and encounter ghost with no explanation why your camera can defeat a ghost. Like free indie game right?. We jump to act 2 . In here you can see the story grow, you see your friend, slove mystery of that place. I love how the story in act 2 give us so much information about that  place, beside act 1. Gameplay You know Fatal Frame? If you know, maybe you already know how the gameplay of this game. Simple. You use your camera (you have 2 camera: SLR and Phone) to capture ghost and then you defeat them. Some ghost can only defeat if you shoot they blind spot. Performance FPS in this game for me is good, no FPS drop. But, this game have so much bug and glitch, sometimes make me angry. And the graphics really bad, like game from ps2. Price The price is not fit with inside the game. You can get more awsome game with this price then game like this. Horror  The good thing is, this game have good atmosphere for horror game, and also support with good soundtrack too. The ghost in this game is uniqe, is not like Fatal Frame, they have wierd form.  Result This game is not finish yet, this game is still need patch for the bug, and bad performance, and i dont recommend to buy with full price, just wait to sale and they buy it. Score: 6 "

												As a veteran of Silent Hill and Fatal Frame, I really wanted to like this game.There are some genuinely fearful moments and interesting enemy designs.  But this game is more frustrating than fun.From the very first area Dreadout commits a deadly sin of horror games.  It gives you several keys and several doors, without any clue of which key goes into which door.  I wonder how much of the 8.9 hours I spent was actually playing the game, and not consulting a youtube playthrough to figure out what the hell to do next.  Whenever you die, you get put in a limbo stage where you have to walk into a blue light to continue.  It adds nothing to the gameplay, except frustration.Good effort from a first-time Indie developer, but there's room for improvement.  I don't regret the purchase, but only because I got it on discount.			"

												Pretty cool story,, some nice ghosts,, with lore and stuff behind it,, obviously asian myths or just asian inonesian, folklore stuff,,,,The game is cool but it is hard fior me to properly advice this to buy,,, Why??Because the game is full of bugs an errors,,,I had to start over 4 times..1. I got stuck between walls exiting and loading the save just maed me come back in the stuck position again and, reverting to the save.old didnt help either2. The game idnt progress anymore after the second boss ghost in the school early game,,, i literally killed it 6 times and the ghost would infinitely render itself ancing spasmic, or whatever,  (instea of triggering an new event) the game just kept repeating the animation,, reloading nor exiting an d placing back save.old worked,, but after killing it again the game just di the same an couldnt progress anymore.3. So the third time satrted over, i foun myself in abug very early,,, ,, there is a cat somewhere on a balcony at the start of the game ,, when i ran over it...... Lina couldnt move anywhere anymore,, i was literally STUCK on a fucn black cat,, guess what i dint even bother and restarted because that was like in the beginning of the game...  4. So the 4th time so far so good i just left the school and there doesnt seem to be a bug so far... however i oubt i can continue this one and finish it,, ill probably come across something at a point where i just have to start over... very sad...lets hope not though...Besieds those problems theyre are a couple of more crappy things..* Shadow textures bugging out,*Phone bug where linad ready's her camera then immediately switch it to hand position,, in rapid speed this alternates (only fix is pressing ALT + F4 and restarting the gaming loading your save.))* At the satrt of the game wether you set brightness to 100 or 0.5 or whatever else... when exiting the shed at the start the game wil automatically turn the screen almost BLACK!!! (only fix wqas exiting to title menu and reloading the save to restore normal brightness setting)* There are tons of these annoying features,, and the game is polished really extremely BD!..The story itself attracts me and ghosts are nicely done and such,, but all these mugs and problems with the gameplay makes it a slightly below average execution of what could have been a superior game when it was done by an AAA developer..Graphics are ated  6/10 (where some have high quality textures,, random stuff on the ground rendering at a 640x480 resolution while i play at 3840x2160 clearly point out that while optimized not every texture was updated to these resolutions..Sounds are (Okay)  some sound scary but other voice overs are really worse,,, then a cartoon .. pretty mediocre at least.Gameplay consist out of running , walking pressing action button, readying camera and taking pictures... so not much exciting there..  Atmosphere is a positive though and some events really can creep you out mostly as in jump scares but now and then also psychologicallyIt has some asian horror clichés though,, but on a low budget and low price,, this game is worth it for the story and atmosphere,,,  If you are looking for interesting gameplay,,, or a steady game without bugs,,,,, i cant advice to buy it,,,  i had to temper with the config file in windows,,,even to make it work.The re binding of gamepad keys is also very frustrating because it does not recognize all keys ,, it is af if it was an old style direct play gamepad support instead of the modern setting for gamepads.Overall theres more problems even,,,  Vsync does only work once you go into settings every time you start up the game you will have to disable it save settings,,, then go back in settings and rfe enable it and save them before it actually fixes the refresh to your monitor in my case 60 Hz..I have also had times starting it up in where some textures would randomly be purple....running 64 or 32 bit oesnt matter both can have this occurence ,, restarting the game fixes this again,, but beware i had my save game damaged once by this joke of optimization...There just are to many problems to wholeheartily advice this to anyone to buy,,,So if you are up for fidling with alot of bugs and settings to make it work,, and if you are in the mood to start over a couple of times if a bug or game progress will halt you can still have fun with the game..If you are not up with wrestling with bugs and poor optimization where on a GTX1080 suednlly framedrops to less then 40 FPS occur,,  then i suggest you skip it...Well you gotta choose yourself,,, anyway it is a superb atmosphere and story,,,  but extremely BAD executed,,,,  an this leaves a bitter taste in your mouth even at the price of 7 euro's whcih i bought it for in the sales...Soo if i ignore all bugs and look at the story atmosphere,, ill give it an 8/10If i take everything into account it is slightly below average and barely enough for a 4.5 / 10I would give it a yellow thumb to the side but steam only has green or red,, adn in the case of complete info i will have to make my thumb go caesar salad DOWN an red..!!! Might they ever fix these severe issues i can always change my min and make it green,,,,however i doubt they will fix them,,, it seems ol and long abandoned... a pretty mediocre development... an thats very sad because this game coul have bee so much more if the bugs and crappy execution wasnt there..***********UPDATE**************So i just finished it,,, i also bought keepers of the dark and will play that later,, the story has enough going on i want to know more,, but that said,,,, it could have been alot more in this first part,,,If this Team would have gotten a huge backup and tons of money they could have hired some bigger developers and more people to fix things overall,,There are gaps in the story i still have alot of questions unsolved,,,,,,  about some of the cast where you arrive with,, there is at least 1 person that doesnt get a clear description of what happened to HIM ,, yes its one of the boys,,,,I could guess what happened looking at a certainscene but,, theyre could have been more sied story aroun that...for example then just letting people guess....If you follow the linear story only you can probably finish it even faster then 6 hours,,, but there are some points where you can explore a little like in the town at the start ,, to find 2 or 3 ghosts and some random occurences,, you will miss out on otherwise,,,  1 tip is check out the wall at the TANK station !!! it is no spoiler,,and doesnt seem to have anything to do with the story itself at all,, and i wonder if this is a bug or if it was tehre intentionally,,,,  but some strange things can be seen there,,, and weird is that you coul miss that out if you enter the school for the story immediately in the start....   an i suspect there are even more of these ((hidden Things) that i didnt came across myself.. the same start area after getting dark holds 3 more secrets you miss when not exploring but entering the school immediately......I hope they will ever reconsier making a Re-Make ,, or a definitive edition with more polish and the 2 storys of this and Keepres of the adrk together,, and then with added extra's more free roaming area's and just a little better textures so that not only linda and character moels look cool in 3840x2160,,, but also randoms like cars cans,, walls, lamps, chairs and other things get upscaled to the same res instead of a lower resolution Yet again im not sure if i can advice it full price,, but i had my fair share of enjoyment for 7 euro in the sales ,,, an the story and ghost style ,is something ALOT of horror games miss nowadays,,,,  This is something speciall and i just hope theyll ever recreate it in a BTTER way,, or just lighten up some more about the story, side story characters aswell			"

												'Meh', that's the only thing i can think of when finishing this game...It has a spooky atmosphere and it stays interesting 'till the end but it's not a fun experience to go through...A lot of times i found myself to be stuck in a situation where it's totally unclear what you have to do or what you are looking for. I might be dumb but it didn't feel like i could've known better what to do in certain situations which resulted in me looking up stuff in a guide.I would've been stuck on one 'puzzle' forever if i hadn't looked it up because the thing i needed to do to activate an event i did before the game actually insisted on you to do it, i even got an achievement for it so i would've never thought to do it again so it triggers the solution to my puzzle... Meaning a lot of wasted time where nothing happened, that's what this game was most of the time. You have an enemy you defeat them and after that you look for what to do next with nothing happening in between. The 'puzzles' aren't hard at all they are just not well designed.Those things aside the story is... Well, i just finished the game and i still feel like i'm drawing a blank here, it's weird and i didn't really feel like things got explained were it just leaves this confusing feeling of 'and now what?'. Maybe the most important thing of all, is the game scary? I'd say no, the atmosphere is spooky and raised the hair on my arms from time to time but the other things just break that feeling, meaning enemy design and sometimes the music (it's really annoying in certain parts). So to round things up, i do not recommend this game, don't play it or watch a playthrough on YouTube (without commentary).			"

												if you want scary...this is it. If i had to poop, it would have been in my pants.  I couldnt even play the game without someone in the room with me and I dont scare easily.  I could just imagine this with a VR helmet.    reminded me a little bit of PT silent hills from ps4  with dated graphics and sort of clunky controls. The sounds were pretty cool and the voice acting was okay.   I dont recommend this if you are easily scared. I only got it because it looked like resident evil.  The story seems meh, and the gameplay was kinda of slow and tedius and you have to pay attentionm to little details. Long review short:Play this if youre constipated and need relief. Then delete it and play resident evil.			"

												I wanted so badly to love this game since it was on my wishlist for such a long time. I'm a big horror gaming fan so fatal frame and silent hill are big favorites of mine. I had high expectations for this, I'll admit. The atmosphere is SO wonderful, and the idea of it is so great. But the design is so miserable that it pulls away from everything that's supposed to make it great. The glitches and bugs made the game completely unplayable for me. I spent half an hour trying to take pictures of candles in act 0 just to progress and the only solution was completely starting over?! No thanks. I already had to youtube search solutions very early into it because there's just no context given. I love games that can teach a player how to play without just sticking a menu in front of them but.. this game really just throws you in there and in the fashion its done just doesn't work or allow you to learn how to play properly.  I'm going to watch a playthrough on youtube and just move on. :(			"

												I was excited at first to play this game when it came out for like a year ago or whatever... but when I started to play I found it very odd... It was not... the kind of game I expected it to be... The story over how I see it so far: apparently you play as a japanese school girl named Linda... that is riding with her school comrades to a place somewhere... I don't quite remember... but then instead they find a haunted abandoned ghost town... and they are going to investigate this town... and all they find is fog and an abandoned school very far up to the hill of the town... then they somehow get trapped in the school building... and have to find each other and get out of there... And there are ghosts and beasts that rest within the building and the town and gets their peace disturbed...The story is very interesting and it has a good concept too... but when you start this game at first you will get confused as f*** when you walk around like an idiot to find an exit or a solution somehow... but no... you have to deal with spooky phantom logic in this f***ing game... and Linda can scare away ghosts by taking a photo on them with her cellphone... which I found too easy and uninteresting... with the ""deal with your enemies""-system... Not like... run away and hide... or like try to fight them... plus the quality and graphics in this game is ugly and sloppy. it looks like the game was barely made for months or anything... But then I don't know better how to better the graphics and quality... but isn't that the game developer's job? To make the game look at least good enough for the year it is made? Well then i must say they need to get better with that skill of theirs... and I found it more annoying than scary with the jumpscares and ghosts that popped up every f***ing tenth second you walked in the school and the town... and a big♥♥♥♥♥boar that was walking around the school and charging at you when it saw you was not much of a big threat... and when you were outside there were pappers flying around in the air... and I was like... -""So... interesting..."" and the cutscenes were so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sloppy and quick that you could barely tell what the hell happened and you had to make up your own story to follow the main story... for the game... it reminded me of a ps2 game with cutscenes that could never catch the player's emotions...4/10 because the music is not bad and works for horror games...

												I liked where this game was going. I liked the mechanics. The graphics and sound are okay. The ghosts are nicely designed. The bugs aren't too annoying (except the one when you run through a doorway and it whips you 180 degrees so you're running back the way you came). I was even getting into the story.... then.... sigh....I got stuck. I hate to admit, but I went to the forums and guides for a quick hint. There's a ghost with a key. I have to ghostbust it with my phone camera to get the key. I did this over and over, and no key. A nicely written guide explains that BEFORE ghostbusting this spirit to get the key, first I have to find and take a picture of spooky scene X. Before I can find spooky scene X, I have to find and camera ghostbust spirit Y. I'm all for puzzles, but NOWHERE that I've looked is there any indication that you might have to do certain tasks in a certain order. I read about a horror game where I use a camera to ghostbust spirits. I didn't read anywhere that certain spirits won't get properly busted until you deal with some other stuff on the other side of the level. Had that information been presented to me earlier, in the game, I would probably have a better experience. But then....Like many other negative reviewers are saying, the spirit with the scissors at the end of (I believe) Act 1... it sucks. Take a picture, turn around, take a picture, turn around, take a picture, turn around, get stabbed, watch your character stand up very slowly, run towards the light, respawn. You know what, I'm okay with that repetition. What gets me is I turn around, the ghost is right there in my phone veiwfinder, and I can snap pics all I like, but it only affects the ghost if I take the pic exactly when my screen gets distorted? Ummm... why? The ghost is right there in front of me, and I can take a string of pictures and still get stabbed. Nope... may be the way it's designed, but feels like broken mechanics to me.You know what, one more thing, and now I'm just nitpicking. The company's logo at first game start. The put a D and an H on the screen for Digital Happiness, then these two dots show up and hop on top of the D. One of the dots falls off and has to hop back up. Yes, it's cute... the first 5 or 6 times. I haven't found a way to skip that little animation, so now when I see that logo start, it's ""Oh yeah, this crap again... sigh..."" Let us skip it!			"

												Very good horror and atmosphere, but unfortunately, it feels the developers of this game were so excited about the scares, they completely forgot Game Design 101. Seriously, this is one of the most unintuitive games I've ever played, to the point of being almost broken. When you have to literally consult a walkthrough to do pretty much anything in this game, you know the designers ♥♥♥♥ed up. Which baffles me, since I've seen this game on sale a billion times and yet they haven't fixed any of these problems. When I find out that a key to progress is completely invisible in the corner of some vague room, it makes my head spin. Starts off promising, but save your cash. These developers need to release a patch fixing all this♥♥♥♥♥♥before I can reccomend this to anyone. Which is unfortunate, because this game is genuinely creepy at times and I really wanted to finish it. Oh well.			"

Nope... may be the way it's designed, but feels like broken mechanics to me.You know what, one more thing, and now I'm just nitpicking. The company's logo at first game start. The put a D and an H on the screen for Digital Happiness, then these two dots show up and hop on top of the D. One of the dots falls off and has to hop back up. Yes, it's cute... the first 5 or 6 times. I haven't found a way to skip that little animation, so now when I see that logo start, it's ""Oh yeah, this crap again... sigh..."" Let us skip it!			"

												DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!-the game has no sense of direction.-the protagonist character has a wimpy running mechanic.-the ambiace makes it hard to know were with the demons are coming from.-it lacks the sence of direction, so most of the game you will be wondering around without a clue of what to do next.

												I've been waiting to get my hands on this game, and the reviews seemed fine enough to finally buy it. I've managed to get about one hour into the game, and my experience was this:- The game's graphics is inconsistent. Some parts - faces, petty details on leaves - are nice, but all in all this 2014 piece resembles something from the last decade.- The camera is horrible. The 3rd person view is inconvenient enough from the camera placing, but it glitches every time I've tried to move through a doorway, ending up in directions I did not want to look or be.- The monsters won't react to the attacks, they appear from nothing (I know it's also a feature, but I've died more times from monsters I couldn't even see, sense, or interact with in any way. THIS, however, is NOT part of the game.)- The dubbing and the voice acting is TERRIBLE. Not to mention the pacing of the dialogues, and the story itself.- Large/massive playspace is great. However, if I have to run for 30 minutes to get from A to B in a LINEAR game, just to spend 10 more minutes on badly-dubbed and scripted dialogues to get a loading screen, then it's just a waste of time.All in all, this game did not meet my long-built expectations. It could be a great Fatal Frame remake or copy, but it... Just isn't. I asked for a refund - for the very first time.			"

I will return to this game once I've regained my patience, so far I'm not impressed.  "

												Not much to say other than this game is the king of grinding. It's a shame too, great graphics for indie, and scary, but so much grinding to the point it isn't scary-The enemies you face are very scary. Unfortunately your ""Objective log"" tells you so little, you have no idea what your supposed to be doing. -There's a difference between being challenging & just plain unfair. The first boss you face is in a narro room (so you can't doge at all) against a fast enemy, and sometimes the game won't bring up your camera when you click, and sometimes the picture won't hurt the boss.-Die too many times, and the game taunts you, making the game agrivating as you play this empty walking simulator to come back to life, as if the game expects YOU to do better when there's little you can do about it.To conclude, all I can say is that I searched up how to kill the first boss and so many people were saying it's unfair. You either have to change your settings, randomly take pictures just t have a CHANCE to beat it. The ""puzzles"" aren't really puzzles as much as they are just ""Search every nook and cranny"" to figure out what you're supposed to be doing. It feels that the developers tried to make a ""challenging"" game for ""the best of gamers"" but they did so by making it luck that you solve puzzles, and beat bosses, rather than skill.			"

												I would love to recommed this game. To do that, however, I would have to consider it playable. The slow response time makes it not so. In most games, this wouldn't be a big deal. In this game, however, it is. This makes itself apparent to me during the scissor phantom battle. Beyond the first four hits, it becomes near impossible. The best I've been able to do in this situation is two more hits. At that point, if the ghost appears behind Linda, it might as well be over. Others have recommended quickly running across the room and photographing the ghost. Two issues have always prevented that. First, the game often fails to respond, meaning the camera never comes up at all. Second, the 'weak point' doesn't appear. I have no explanation for why that happens, it just basically doesn't work. At this point, I've given up. I've tried over and over, and at this point, I feel like it's not worth the money.			"

												[Disclaimer: played this offline for about 2 hrs; logged on to Steam and suffered through the obligatory 5min added online play to be able to post this review] I wasted precious $$ based on reviews on here that must've been posted by the developers; my review is to help prevent you from doing same. What you get is a jerky, low texture romp through a set of life- and joyless sceneries (no sandbox for sure, you are narrowly confined to eaxctly the path the devs want you to take). Yes, there's some 'scary' music and sound effects, but unfortunately, if you get stuck in a maze, it's the same sound effect on endless loop - the screaming woman repeating every 10 secs for the 10 min you aimlessly wander through what looks like classroom after classrom, all empty, all pointless, all pretty ugly looking in the flashlight perspective you are allowed; all worthless because - frankly - I had no clue how to get out of there, and why I should, and after 10 minutes, I really didn't care anymore. What's the point of this game? No clue. What are you supposed to do? I really don't know. I guess you are supposed to 'fight' by pointing you camera phone at the beast and taking its picture?? For real? I ended by just sitting myself in a corner and waiting for that random beast that roams those halls to kill off my character, mercifully, to end this incredibly annoying experience. On comes a flash screen that read ""you've been playing for a while, time to take a break"". Yeah. Played about a couple increasingly agonizing hours, felt like a day. And the next flash message read: ""thanks for buying a licensed copy of the game"". Boy. I wish I hadn't.			"

												Why, God? Why did you give us an indie Fatal Frame built on Indonesian lore and set in an abandoned town in the mountains and make it bad? Why did it fail to have interesting areas or a compelling story or enemies that weren't annoying as all hell? What did we do to deserve such intense disappointment?I seriously doubt He's going to answer those questions, so let's at least talk about how this happened. DreadOut is indeed an indie loveletter to the Fatal Frame series, a series that really should inspire more imitators. You play Linda, a strangely silent Inodnesian high school student on a trip with her teacher, best friend, and a few other people you will cease caring about almost immediately. They happen across an abandoned town up in the mountains, and like good little horror protagonists, wander into the school and get trapped. There's something off about Linda's BFF, and some early signs that the town was into weird rituals or whatever, but there's no big hook like Silent Hills or Fatal Frames have. You're just trying to get out of the school, so ostensibly the only great revelation in your future is where the janitor's keyring ended up.The ghosts in your way aren't going to hold your attention either, and that's a real shame considering how rare and interesting Indonesian horror is. The first three you'll meet are a giant invincible pig, a bleached version of Sadako from The Ring, and a harmless businessman with a super wobbly head. Albino girl's the only one you can fight, and even as the first real enemy she's annoying as hell. Linda battles by taking pics with her cellphone camera, and to beat this one you have to photograph her four times until she disappears, find her again within like 3 seconds, and photograph the gaping wound in her back. She can, of course, phase through walls, so even if you know what you're doing it can take forever. Also, I played for an hour and she was the only defeatable enemy I encountered. Really, game?There are moments of brilliance to the atmosphere, but they're lost amidst a sea of tedium. Most of the classrooms in the spooky school are empty or look pretty normal. There are two that have the chairs set in odd ways, and one of those gets a cool audio cue that gave me a little shiver. One thing really hurting the exploration is the aura you get signalling an item. When you get within like 20 feet of something you can examine, the edges of your screen turn blue, and get bluer as you get closer. There are no exceptions to this, so there's no reason not to charge down the halls and through the rooms at full speed until you get that cue. You also won't be finding healing items, weapons, ammo, or anything of interest other than plot items and files.That's really the heart of DreadOut's problem, there's just not enough to do. Not enough ghosts, not enough items, not enough points of interest, not enough reasons to push forward. It's a depressingly thin game that has all the foundations of a great horror experience, just with nothing built upon them. Well, that's not entirely true. The game is ugly as hell. Everything is in muddy drabs, textures are stretched beyond recognition, and environmental details are rendered with 90s polygon budgets. If they were trying to fully imitate the PS2 classics, they got pretty close with the graphics, at least. It also has the ignoble distinction of being the only game where the How to Play menu option is essential, because there is no tutorial and literally nothing about how the game works is explained anywhere in the actual gameplay.I wish there was a single reason to recommend DreadOut, but there isn't. No part of it is fleshed out into anything worth your time. You might as well just play the demo, which suffers the same problems but is short and mysterious enough to minimize them, and then assume the full game got lost in development hell. In a way, I guess it did.			"

												Sorry, but I quit. This feels like playing tabletop Call of Cthulu with a pissy DM.You were doing everything right. Things were quiet, voice acting was fairly good, things were weird and there was an air of danger....And then it took a nosedive. The game creates a nice, creepy atmosphere and the use of mythical creatures and spirits is nice....but so far those are the only possitive points I've found. The sound is......alright, if sometimes more grating than tense.I understand that combat, of any sort, should be a last possible option in any survival horror game. It's not scary if you can just shoot an enemy or whack them with something heavy until they resemble a fine red mist. I get that. However, you need other options if that is the case. Either running away, or at least enough of a combat mechanic not to die every time something scary pops out.Now, I'm not saying the basic enemies are difficult or anything. Not that I have much experience beyond what you meet in the school. Though even with those, hit detection feels buggy. My problem is the boss in the school. It's been quite a while since I've encountered such an amazingly unfair fight.First of all, it relies on quickly bringing up your camera. This would be fine, if Linda understood the concept of urgency. If you're moving even a tiny bit, she won't raise the damn phone when you hit the button. Or it might be because she has to face the direction the camera is in, which is also terrible as a mechanic in a fight that requires quick reactions. Early on this is not an issue, but the boss only gets faster and 'barely in time' soon becomes 'raise the phone when I tell you to, you bint!'This would not be a problem, if there was room to dodge. Nope. The boss can hit you no matter how hard you hug the wall as you try to run by. And you have try to pass the boss because, guess what, if it corners you there is no way to get out of that. Considering the fight is in a very tiny room with an invisible wall in the corner thanks to the desk, this is just not fair. Especially considering you litterally have a boss who vanishes after taking a hit an can move through walls. Oh, and did I mention a single hit stunlocks you? If you get hit, prepare to eat at least 1 one more attack or even 2 if you're in a bad spot. That's not so bad, until the boss suddenly goes all Sonic the Hedgehog on you and its speed doubles. You can't run from that and odds are you'll be looking in the wrong direction when it comes out of the wall.Which brings me to the next issue. Linda is so damned slow. I understand certain items make her faster, but bloody hell. I get it. The place is dark, scary and there are dangerous beings roaming around. I wouldn't practice free running there either, but pick up the pace a little would ya? Even her sprinting speed would cause obese kids to point and laugh.All of this just made me feel like dying was not my fault, and I shouldn't feel that way. When I die, it should be because I ♥♥♥♥ed up or wasn't doing the right thing. It should not be because passing the boss without getting hit requires divine intervention and a particularly large rabbit's foot. I'm not asking for matrix reflexes and an arena to fight in, but I am asking for a character with more of a sense of urgency and more space than a bloody walk in closet to fight the hyperactive evil spirit.What finally made me quit, though, was the punishment for death. Guys, one of the most important things in gaming is being able to quickly return after dying. Making it take longer and longer each time you die is not an effective punishment. I have tried everything I could think of. I stood in the center and spun around. I died. I huddled in a corner and waited. The boss came through the wall right next to me, stunlocked me and I died. I hugged the contours of the room and ran in circles, hoping to put enough distance between Linda's slow♥♥♥♥♥and the enemy to raise the camera in time. Guess what, I died. And each time I woke up in limbo and had to walk further and further before I could come back to life.That did not make me think 'Darn. Well, I deserve this. At least I know what to do now.' Instead it made me judge the mind numbingly long and boring walk and think 'You know what? No. I'm not walking all the way over there to get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked again.'I wanted to like this game, I really did. I still want to know what was going on, but the gameplay is not worth learning what happens in the story.			"

Even you can find this kind of graphic since PS2 (2000) Plot & Story 0.5 of 5Story of this game isn't original. It just like combine Fatal Frame (From PS2 2001) + Silent Hill  (From PS 1999) so you can say this is so plagiarismEaster egg, Trick, Secret 1.5 of 5This game have enough secret and easter egg. But, again that secret is just to easy to found even by newbie player nothing specialMusic & Sound 4.5 of 5This is the only variable I love. Thanks to awesome music so you can feel the horror aura nicely. They even adding the famous Gloomy sunday as part of the game ConclusionThis game is too expensive. Developer said you can get the Act (stage) 2 as free DLC. But, again we only get 1 stage for now  for $14.99			"

												More like GlitchOutSo, a ghost catching game ala Fatal Frame, and it's cheap. Let's give it a try. - First of all, I needed to reduce the mouse sensitivity to like 1/5 of the bar because it was nearly unplayable as it was (more about this later). - I don't know what version of the game is the one shown on the trailers, but my game didn't look like that at all, and I had all the settings in Fantastic. The game doesn't look very good but I can deal witht that. - It IS very dark though, so I had to adjust brightness bar almost to the max because, with he game's suggested settings, it was almost impossible to see things during the night sequence in Act 1. - The game isn't very clear with your objectives and it lacks a map. I was stuck in Act 0's puzzle because I didn't realize (nor the game even hinted at) that you had to backtrack and defeat enemies that had appeared without any sign in order to advance. - There are tons of missable things in Act 1 even before you start the ""main"" game. Again, how are you supposed to guess you have to backtrack aaaaaaaaall the way back through town in order to get the stuff. - The Scissor enemy was pretty difficult because every time I was hit and dropped from camera mode I wasn't able to see my character, therefore I didn't know when I was actually in control again and was able to pull my camera. I had to resort to right clicking constantly which made my character drop the camera as soon as she pull it out, and the enemy comboing me to dead. The solution? Don't get hit once.- Oh a wall of insects blocked my path? I guess I need to find another way, right? Nope, you have to enter it because logic.Again, many times you have to do things that the game never hinted at and make little sense. But again, I can deal with that. If I'm stuck, I just check a guide. Something I hate doing, but at least it's a problem that can be solved. What I couldn't deal with was the numeroues glitches and bugs I encountered. Many times they were gamebreaking and apparnetly they are very frequent and numerous. So, here's the glitches and issues I encountered during my playthrough (spoilers)Act 1- Outside school at night, while going for the ""Attack on Titan"" achievement decided to quit the game to make some changes to the Graphic settings. Load the game again and I'm greeted with the dark sky and no earth, or character, or anything else at all. I have some camera movility but that's all. It´s all almost black. Quit to the title screen, load it again, and once again, blackness. Needed to close the application and launch it again for it to be fixed. Great.- Inside the school, exploring the hallways after defeating the boar ghost I enter a bathroom and the red vinnete appears, I'm expecting something to come out from one of the toilets but nothing happened. When I'm about to exit the bathroom the pig ghost suddenly rams me against the wall and he pretty muchs stays there, I'm stuck inside the enemy taking damage untill I'm dead. When I respawn at the school entrance and head to the hallway, the pig ghost is still in the running animation, but now in a different door. I can't pass because he pushes me, and I can't kill it either because its head is inside the room, therefore I can't damage it. I decided to let him be and continue the exploring, guessing he'll dissappear eventually. I do pretty much everything I can until I'm stuck, turns out I HAVE to enter the room the pig ghost is blocking. I go back to the hall way and the ♥♥♥♥ing thing is still there! It´s been like 20 minutes. Exit to the title screen, load the file, lo and behold, ♥♥♥♥ing pig is still there. Once again I needed to close the application and launch it again. Marvelous Act 2- I don't know what the hell happened during the transition between games, but oh boy did they ♥♥♥♥ up with this one. The problems I immediately noticed:First: In the very first screen I noticed that my mouse sensitivity sky rocketted, I can't explore my surroundings because the camera almost makes a 360° turn with a simple movement. I assumed that I had to adjust the settings again, but upon checking them they are still the same as they had been for the rest of the game. I assumed closing the game might do the trick once more (it´s not a good thing when your the first thing that comes to mind to fix your problems is turn off the thing and restart it) but nope, not this time. Friggin mouse is still on crack. I created a new file, still not fixed. Now, I can´t actually move the bar all the way to the left because that makes it almost impossible to move the camera at all, funny how it goes from fast to snail pace with almost no modification. I decide to move it all the way I could and kept going.Second: The framerate is horrible, it constantly drops and keeps freezing. It´s much worse when actually using the phone camera, it just skips frames and jumps from once place to another. The first part where I´m attacked by a bunch of imps is almost unplayable. Good thing that you´re supposed to ""be killed"" in that scene because if I actually had to deal with them I wouldn't have been able to continue, ever.   OK, so we got two big problems:- Oversensitive mouse- Horrible framerate (worst when you enter camera mode) I'll call this combo ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥from now on. Decided to keep going- The very first enemy you encounter is a chase sequence, in which I kept dying over and over, he always gets to you no matter what, and I can't stress this enough, but it's nearly impossible to control your character because of ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥ really, when you can't even run properly you know it's bad. I needed to check a video online to see the path to take (since there are dead ends because ♥♥♥♥ you). It took me like 4-5 tries even when I knew what I was supposed to do. It didn't help that every time I started again the camera was pointing at the enemy and not where you're supposed to go. This was an issue in the second chase sequence (because we all loved the first one, didn't we?) But at least I didn't have to make sharp turns on that one- The giant boss you fight shortly after is, once again, unplayable due to ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥ It doesn't help that it has a ramming attack which leaves me pinned taking continuos damages (much like what happened with the pig ghost). I checked a guide and it says that it only has two attacks: a swipe, and throwing stuff at you. But nope, the thing leaps and rams you, and if I'm hit by it once, well, you're pretty much dead. I can't evade it nor I can take a picture fast enough before getting rammed due to ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥This is where I gave up, if I'm only starting Act 2 and it's giving me so much trouble already, I really don't feel like going on since I'm not a masochist. -----------All in all, no matter how much I want to like this game, the sole fact that it has so many gamebreaking glitches and apparently wasn't tested properly makes it impossible to reccomend.  2.5/5Average game brought down by numerous glitches and issues			"

												Sooo, the main bady is the spirit of a witch who wants to do........something. In order to do that she has to do..........something. And your charachters past is imortant because of.......something. In the end the Witch wins by doing............something......Seriously, this game sets up the story and then never explains it. You keep getting referrences to the main characters past yet never get an explanation as to why. It seems like the villain is killing your friends to get to you specifically, yet it never explains why. All rounded out in a pretty typical ""you don't know why but isn't this creepy?"" ending. There is some good imagery and the ghosts themselves look great. But, that only makes the bad environment in areas stand out even more. The controls are also incredibly frustrating and blocky.Stay away from this one.			"

												What an ugly piece of garbage. Horrible graphics, boring plot and total lack of interactivity. All enemies are the same - you make the photos and they're gone. Plot is a classic ghost cliché about some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s lost in abandoned town. Game mechanics is so horrible that I can't beat the first boss (I am the man who beats AVGN Adventures or RE4 on professional for example). Soundtrack is just some ambient loop that goes on and on and on. The main character is may be naturally dumb because she don't talk all the time. Voice acting is awfully silly. It's like some students on high want to do some overacting. ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I really tried to give it a chance but no. This game is not worth your money, your time and your skills. Game is too overrated by community, I mean TOO ♥♥♥♥ING OVERRATED.Assh0l3s like PewDiePie and other screaming idiots may like it. P.S. The only creepy part of the game is the textures because they looks like textures from PS2 games.			"

												On one hand DreadOut offers some genuinely creepy and intense sequences.It's also set in a fairly original background of indonesian folklore(now there's something you don't see everyday in this genre!)On the other hand for every well crafted scare Dreadout has about 10 poorly designed gameplay sections filled to the brim with egregious amount of bugs.The voice acting&sound design/score are serviceable but the script is♥♥♥♥♥♥and graphics leave alot to be desired considering how poorly optimized it is.Clocking in at about 5-6 hours you'll have more frustration then enjoyment from this interesting but ultimately deeply flawed horror experience.

The grapics are not that good however the atmosphere more than makes up for it believe me. I love the story and I was extremely excited when dreadout keepers of the dark came out as a  2nd standalone game.If you can handel the scares, buy it to support the development them and to lose yourself in the world of linda for a little while.  There is huge potential. This could be one of the greatest horror games of all time.I'd give it 9/10			"

												Pros:+ Decent graphics for a non-AAA game.Cons:- Not very gripping. I didn't play very long, but what I did play really didn't make me feel like playing further.- Lack of direction. I spent half the time just walking around trying to find where to go.- Extremely slow pace, without much tension. Really wasn't scary. Generally horror games like this start off slowly to try and build the tension, but I didn't find it very frightening so it fell a little flat.- Voice acting is rather irritating.Personally, I just found the game to be unimpressive and unengaging. If you're a hardcore horror fan, you'll probably enjoy this a lot more than I did. In my opinion, you're better off spending your money on Outlast.			"

												     I was initially very excited for this game, but once the game started it was clear that I was mistaken. You are plopped in the middle of an abandoned building with no way to interact with anything besides an iphone you find shortly after. I would have been able to forgive the lack of interaction, if the graphics were anything above subpar. You are forced to move through different routes with nothing worth seeing or exploring if you do end up taking the time to check every room and alley. The sense of fear soon faded once I came in contact with the first ghost and realized she would just follow me around and couldnt atually ""kill"" me, just scream and send me to a dark tunnel. With no fear of death, and no fear from amazing graphically terrifying ghosts, this game ended in dissapointment. Would not waste the 15 bucks			"

												Below is a summary from the full review on my personal blog:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2016/06/25/Dreadout-game-review.aspxI've had the fortune of playing quite a few really good indie games, and indie developers seem to be the only ones who are really developing good, serious horror titles. DreadOut is NOT one of those games. At virtually every step, the game suffers from near-crippling design flaws and glitches. Character movement is slow and clumsy, the camera gets stuck on geometry in the game and gets spun around, dialogue is cringe-worthy. Even the game's core mechanic (taking pictures of ghosts with your smart phone) is prone to malfunction, which renders one of the mid-game boss fights and some of the puzzles almost unplayable.All the time I spent trying to figure out how to overcome the game's technical and design shortcomings resulted in a complete desensitization to any atmosphere that the game may have been trying to build, and the lazy, predictable jump scares just plain don't work.Every time you die, you have to walk through Limbo. And each time you walk through Limbo, the distance to the end is longer. During this time, the game likes to display useless and insulting hints and messages to the player. One such message says ""Thank you for purchasing a legit copy of DreadOut."" Thanks for reminding me that I really wish that I hadn't bought it.			"

												One of the worst horror games I have ever had the displeasure of playing. I knew the second I snapped a picture of a ghost riding a motorcycle that DreadOut wasn't for me. Foolishly enough I trudged on to its conclusion and was left even more confused as to what I had just experienced. Some of the ghost designs are unsettling and others are downright laughable. Overall there is no dread to be found in this game, almost like they ran out of dread before they started working on it.A peculiar journey, but a far cry from anything enjoyable.3/10			"

												Overall:Game that delivers on the horror front, but fails everywhere else.  I can't recommend this to anyone but someone who loves the horror genre that has absolutely played every other horror games.  It's too bad, because it absolutely nails the horror, and I can see it had a lot of potential and good ideas on the horror.The Good:- Scare factor.  The atmosphere feels creepy and unsettling at all times, and there are also jump scares on top of this.  Even if you expect a scare, the thing that you see and experience is so unsettling, it will give you the heebe geebees.- Ambient music fits in nicely with the unsettling atmosphere.- Sound effects and sound design come from accurate places that aids you in discovering the ghosts and other weird things.The Bad:- Gameplay feels clunky.  You basically shoot ghosts to death ala Fatal Frame with your camera.  The game design seems solid, but the terrible animation combined simplistic AI that beelines straight towards you at all times doesn't feel exciting at all.- Level design is bland.  Lots of empty rooms and empty hallways.  This causes you to run around for a long time with almost no action in between.- Item discovery is barely passing.  The game draws a blue halo around the item you can interact with.  It's really hard to see which items are interactable.  I randomly clicked around whenever the blue halo came up seeing if I can hit something.- Animation is barely passing, and characters float around.  I'm talking human characters, not the ghosts.- Graphical assets.  Textures are worse than games from 1998, and polygon counts are low other than some human characters.  I'm sure they could've purchased better looking stuff from Unity store.- B-level dialog and story.  I enjoy cheesy stories, but this was too much.			"

												This is by far the most anger I've ever gotten out of playing a game. Nevermind the graphical glitches, the stilted acting, the cringe worthy dialogue, or the lack of real direction. The thing that angered me more than anything is the fighting. Like other have said it's based on the fatal frame style. You take pictures of ghost to fight them. The problem is there is no real explanation as to how the fighting works. I ran into one ghost lady which btw did scare the crap out of me. Yet you take picture after picture and nothing happens. She just dissapeared and appears behind you giving you little time to react. Walkthroughs say you have to take a picture of her when she turns her back to you while stunned and THEN you have to catch her with her back to you and take a picture to give her any damage. THAT did not happen once in all the time I attempted this process. But not only that but not once in all of this was I given a clear goal or objective that I could follow. This game is highly positivly reviewed? How the heck in that even possible?			"

												This game is very bad. The ""puzzles"" are just you roaming around trying to stumble upon and item or whatever you need to advance. Enemies that can vanish/reappear will consistently do so on top of your body with no way to defend yourself. Everything is just way more vague than it needs to be. The control scheme is comparable to Silent Hill 1 for the PS1. About 15 years outdated and stiff/awkward. I hear it gets better when you reach Act 2. I played for 2 hours and 20 minutes but I couldn't reach Act 2 before realizing it wasn't really worth it. If you can make it and it's actually worth it, I applaud you.Might be a fun game to play with friends around to just make jokes and laugh about it. That's all I can see it have going for it.			"

You're supposed to figure out how to defeat ""bosses"" but then you die a bunch of times just trying to figure it out. And every time you die the game punishes you by making you go through this ""limbo"" thing which keeps getting longer and longer the more times you die. It is so dumb. Don't play it. Don't play it. Don't play it.Basically, to sum up this review, I hate this game.			"

												F*ck this game. Seriously. What a tease. It's got a good story, amazing atmosphere, great sound design and truly disturbing creatures. It's the closest we've been to an old-school PS2 survival horror game like Fatal Frame in a really long time. There's tons of hidden secrets and stuff to find, making exploration worth your time.BUT THEN. No learning curve. Each time you die (and you're gonna die A LOT) you have to run towards the light in order to come back to life, and each time you're gonna have to run a bigger distance. The enemies are absurdly hard, AND I MEAN *HARD*.Not because this is some Dark Souls sh*t, but because the controls are so frigging clunky you're gonna CRY TEARS OF BLOOD trying to damage them at all. Other times they won't even do what they're programmed to do, making most walkthroughs unreliable. Just because it worked for whoever wrote the walkthrough, it doesn't mean it's gonna be that way for you.I still don't get some of the stuff I've found while playing this. The costumes are supposed to be unlockable content you get once you beat the whole thing, yet I had them all avaliable right from the beginning of my first game.AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THAT BOSS. DEAR GOD.Survival horror is my favorite genre of videogames. I've played dozens of them, don't wanna brag, I'm just saying that I kinda know how to deal with these type of games. Well, this one has broken me. The level of frustration I've endured in just 5 hours of gameplay (and half of that playtime is due to the fact that I had to restart the game several times, because the respawn light was too godd*mn far as I had died too many times) is unmatched by any other title.I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I still think the atmosphere alone is worth the price. But I just cannot deal with such unpolished, unforgiving, unintuitive mechanics. They really ruin what could have been one of my favorite horror games in recent memory.There's so much wasted potential here I'm actually mad at the developers.What a shame... "

												I have never done a review on steam before, never really planned on it until playing thru this game. Hoooooo boy does this game take a nosedive after an intriguing start. The idea was there the entire game, but the lack of polish and attention to detail quickly took me out of the experience in a heartbeat.I knew something was wrong the instant I saw a My Little Pony character in the game; because nothing says true horror like My Little Pony.I am aware that the devs aren't fluent in english, because it shows at times. But that doesn't stop them from going back and fixing things with a bit of grammar.The combat was exceedingly poor and frustrating at times, the hitboxes were not always on point and that made moments that were supposed to be tense just frustrating overall.The very few highlights of this game: A pochong riding a motorcycle, winners don't do drugs (good message, after playing this game I want to partake though).The story is good in theory, but could be clearer. The lack of detail takes away from the overall experience of the game, by making it harder to submerse in the atmosphere and fully understanding what is going on as the game moves along.The biggest issue I have with this game is: The lack of direction; this game feels nearly impossible to play without a guide, the guide I read even mentions bugs that require steps to be taken to acquire achievements or advancements in the story.In closing: Don't buy it, play Fatal Frame. Or buy this if it's on a steam sale for very cheap.The pochong on the motorcycle is the hero of the game, btw.			"

												One of the most horrendous experiences I've had in a long time. Sadly for all the wrong reasons.While I can look past the rather unattractive graphics, odd dialogues, barely comprehensible story and a few other problems, like loading times and jittery camera movement, some people might already be turned off with only one of those. The only redeeming factors are the atmosphere and ghosts/monsters being good.The things I absolutely can not look past though, are the issues with gameplay and game design.If I find myself stumbling around trying to figure out what to do for an hour or more just to discover that its something cryptic, thats not only utterly unrelated to the current objective, yet necessary to do to progress but also something the game fails at giving you any feedback to whatsoever, I can only come to the conclusion that I should stop playing right here.Yet despite that knowledge, I gave it another shot just to be faced with even more questionable design choices, cryptic ""puzzles"" and bad combat. Making me question whether its better to give up hope and be done with things or to not lose hope, just to find out there never was any to begin with.If your looking for an experience like Fatal Frame, you are better off just playing that. If you want to be more frustrated than scared, you found your game right here.			"

												It's about time survival horror took a trip back to, ""originality"". This game has originality in SPADES! I am a 23 year old woman, some of the stuff in this game made ME jump, the solutions are not always out there, or easy to solve, and if you're like me with survival horror titles, than this game is a bit hard to progress through, I keep getting lost, or running around in a circular pattern. To NO avail, have I been able to beat this game! It's like Fatal Frame, and Silent Hill without a walkthrough for me, I mean it is obscure, and the puzzles were out there for me, or maybe it is just because I kept getting lost. Lol Great game, though, like I said, like classic games, either navigation, or obscure puzzles did it for me, and impeded all progression. This one, I have not played in awhile, but if I remember correctly, I kept walking in big circles, or getting stuck. I would STILL recommend this to ANYONE! This game is amazing, I will probably play it again here soon, it takes a long time to start up, story and gameplay I mean, it has a slow start. But once you hit the school, feces hits the fan! This game has some notes from my favorite series, ""Silent Hill"". But this gem is more like, ""Fatal Frame"" which honestly, is my second favorite horror franchise. I may just buy me an, ""I survived All God's Village, and all I got was this stupid shirt!"" shirt. I have a P.T. shirt on now. Anyway, I digress. Buy this game if you love horrors, and getting lost!

												I wanted to be freaked out a little (as I sometimes get the urge for a good horror game) so I played Dreadout... Instead, I uninstalled after 1.5 hours. Besides the graphical stuttering, pop-in, and wonky controls, in one and a half hours of gameplay I experienced:1) An ""intro level"" with zero story elements to segue into the actual game, nor any reason for the actual intro level. 2) A ghost of an insect to kill as your first enemy. A ghost of a slightly oversized bee.  Allow us to take a moment to fathom the strageness of this... Moment over? Okay... 3) A little girl (the same age of the girl you control) creepily runs around an cries and runs some more. Great, so more stereotypical ""creepy little girl to scare you"" trope.4) Insert random abuse of the number 666 because every culture in the world knows thats a bad number. And its badness is second only to its overuse in videogames to try to scare the player. 5) ""Creepy little girl"" turns into evil pregnant ghost girl to fight. I sense a another plot point coming soon... I didn't play enough to see this plot point develop, but my spidy sense is tingling here. 6a) Okay, so, ""Creepy little girl"" and ""pregnant ghost girl"" combine for their super-trope-abusing attack! ... Moving on. 7) Aaaand now I'm dead. No seriously, dead. I have to walk a bit on a bright white path to get alive again. Aparently this is a thing. I know this because the menu has a ""how to play"" section artfully depicting the main character walking to become alive again...   7a) This ""how to play"" section shows a lack of conveyance in the game design. Something that game designers should learn. You want to see conveyanvce in action, the intro stage of Megaman X teaches you every thing you need to know without a menu screen and panels of text. 7b) Walking in a horror game is wonderful when done right. It can work wonders for building tension when done correctly. But snotty and repulsive and downright aggravating when done wrong. This game does walking wrong, time and time again. 8) And now I'm alive again and... The trope centeral station train has left the track... It was all a dream maybe... or maybe it was just a random level to get players in the mood of a scaaaary game. I rolled my eyes so hard, I think I tore my corneas. 9) Aaaaand now were exploring an abandoned town. Why? Because we're kids on a highschool trip aparently. And because our chaperone is a complete moron who doesn't deserve the minimum wage she's getting paid. 10) And now I realize I'm a silent protagonist who doesn't talk when her best friend is talking to her. But she breathes. I know she breathes because the run speed (which is only slightly faster than my walk speed) causes her to respirate loudly into whatever mic she's wearing. 11) Also, here's that walking complaint again. I walked through that darn abandoned town for like 10 minutes. No development. Just badly rendered ghost town straight out of the stock assets of a bad indy game. Shame. 11b) Again, if the developer tries to create tension by making me control the main character through a stupid environment for ten minutes with no development... then they really need to revist some classic scary movies. Just to get an idea of how horror works, how terror works and the difference between the two. Failbot. 12) Aaaaand now it's nightime and I'm hanging with my best friend on a bench outside an abandoned school while my other classmates have checked out the environs... Being a silent protagonist, I can only imagine how riveting that conversation must have been. 12a) Someone's lost in the school, aaaaand now I'm facing a giant boar with a human face who's only damaged by me taking pictures of it with my camera... I'm done.I'm just done. Uninstalled. I'm going back to knitting. At least it's more engaging than this game.			"

												It's a lot of fun if you enjoy game breaking glitches, bugs and overall poor execution in regards to hinting what youre suppose to do next. I don't know what game the people who reviewed this as positive were playing, but it wasn't DreadOut.I've never played a game where I was forced to use a guide almost immedietly. The ghosts you fight, while typically well designed, often offer no clue as to how do defeat them. (hint: There are weak spots)There are items you can collect that claim to upgrade abilities, but... I never once found use for them.But the worst is the game breaking bugs.. And there are A LOT of them. I ran into one at the end of Act 2. Every time I loaded it teleports me to a black abyss where the character model does some kind of freaky dance. It's actually quite hilarous.If you can make it thru the game without seeing any noticible glitches you are in a vast minority. I cannot recommend a game that is obviously broken and unfinished.			"

												DreadOut is wonderfully atmospheric for an indie horror, but ultimately does too many things wrong to recommend. Issues include:* A 2 hour running time (act 1 only as of this review)* A cast of interesting characters... who up and vanish  the moment things get interesting, for no reason* A death system that punishes you the more times you die by making you run further back to a light to restore you to life* Enemies that can easily stunlock you into a quick death* Hints during the death sequence that go from ""not all that helpful"" to ""actively insulting"" in about 3 deaths* Obtuse puzzles with little connecting their separate elementsTry the Obscure games instead.

												I was very dissapointed with this game, i thought it was going to be a return to true survival horror the same of that in the ps2 days, which to an extent it is, let down by really stupid silly design choices, like no map (GOLDEN rule of survival horror ALWAYS include a map) which leads to the main problem, the game is around 3 hours long and about 2 of those hours youll speand wandaring round the school not knowing what to do, there is a difference between holding your hand and just plain stupid, the puzzles are so cryptic and the game doesnt even so much as point you in the right direction, the team behind this game needs to touch up on what makes an actual fun game, the game IS scary tho and makes you feel on edge, there is a good game screaming to get out here just let down by stupid design 4/10.

												I could not finish it without having a guide up 80% of the time. The direction you're supposed to go is so vague that it will have you looking at every possible corner with your phone camera out, or walking around slamming the use key in hopes that something will happen- this is most of the game for me. The jump scares were really good, the atmosphere was good the first time around (before the music starts looping and you can't figure out where to go), the monster/ghost designs were awesome, but the ♥♥♥♥ing level design and boss fights♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Not only that, when I died at the scissor boss it told me I should switch to casual gaming! ♥♥♥♥ you game. 5/10			"

												View Qineuro's review for a more in-depth explanation. DreadOut has some good ideas it recycled from much older horror games and could have made a great game. Sadly thats not the case. Horrible gameplay,♥♥♥♥♥♥poor audio design and extremely bizarre level design choices make this game a clunker. Even playing the original Silent Hill and Fatal Frame 2 (2 clear influences as seen in the very core of the game) is a better choice. No idea why there are so many positive reviews around, are people really this starved for ANY horror game? If you do choose to get it, well...........enjoy i guess.			"

												Dreadout, what can I say about you? First of all if you are like me I got this game because I saw PewDiePie play it. I am a huge fan of horror games because I love to be frightend but saddly this game failed to deliver the punch line.Dreadout opens you up witht he cast of characters which you will never see again (Until Act 2). It seems like the developers want's you to be attached to the characters but fails to deliever because the characters are not very interesting to begin with. WIth that being said I do love the atomospher of the game, very grully and creepy and everyone likes exploring an abandon school right?But the real problem is that Dreddout doesn't know what it wants to be an action or survival horror, until act 2 I would not recomend this game.

												Starting out, this really looking like something that would prove itself to be a worth while horror title. But when the game actually got into the meat of what it had to offer, any scares and creepy atmosphere it had, I eventually got acclimated to simply because I was STUCK in it for the longest time scratching my head over where I needed to go and what I needed to do. The game didn't make my objectives very clear beyond ""get the keys off the demon you first meet somehow"" and then expects you to magically know what you need to do!When I finally did figure out what to do, the game started to pick up again, if briefly, then threw me into an even more vauge puzzle than the last one, and then finally put me in a boss fight that was thankfully easier to figure out how to finish than the puzzles. The majority of this game wasn't me getting to enjoy a terrifying experience the way a proper horror should be. It was just me scratching my head at vauge puzzles! This, I feel was money wasted on my part, and I can't recommend this game to anyone else! If you really want to waste your money on it just to see for yourself what it's like. Be my guest. Don't say I didn't warn you.			"

												My personal review of the game:Positives:1) Asian take on Fatal Frame.2) Javanese / Indonesian mythology and folklore.3) Good ghost graphics.Negatives:4) Doesn't progessively guide you on what and where you need to go.5) Scissor Man battle is unfair.6) You won't know there was powerups till you die (many times) in the game.7) Sobbing ghost battle is unfair. You won't know that you need to shoot her back.8) Have to shoot countless times to know something is wrong with the photo?Overall:A good game, but is let-down by not providing a clear and progressive stages to acquiring information and power-ups. If you jumped in and figured out the rudimentary points, you will not be able to proceed any further as you won't know that you have to shoot like in point 8 a certain camera angle from a destroyed ledge to continue the game.The developers need to spend more time to finetune gameplay and story progression. It is great that you have a village to explore, but locking gamers to the school afterwards and not guiding them, it gets downright boring fast. I didn't know there was powerups in the game, only after I died 9 times and it was from a statement during limbo stage. The use of vignettes to indicate ghosts and information are a great point, but not obvious enough. Gamers are focused to what's onscreen and not observe what's around the screen, like me. Consider providing vibration mode for those who use gamepad controllers like the PC Xbox 360 controllers.Hopefully the developers will redo the entire gameplay and progression once Act 2 is out. Until then, I don't recommend this game to casual gamers.			"

												A while ago I played Act 1 and it really got me on nerves because of the puzzles, limbo and illogical story. Oh, and there was a boss pactically impossible to defeat. I still managed to completed the first act, but I got upset because I had to reload my game again and again after lossing against that boss. So I was not in the mood anymore.Since the demo was very appealing, I decided to give Act 2 a tried, hoping that things would get better. Limbo has been fixed, and I have to thanks the developpers for that. Also, the puzzles are much easier to solve. BUT the story is boring, and it seems like it's leading nowhere. You fight some evil creatures along the way, but it's like they're randomly thrown at you, with no real plot. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really considering to stop right now. I'm not in a difficult situation, I'm just bored. DreadOut is a very cheap version of Fatal Frame, and it's sad because it could have been better. The problem is the lack of plot. If you want to fool around, killing evil spirits, it's perfect for you. But if you're searching for a game like Fatal Frame, you might be disappointed. "

												I asked for a refund, possibly a little prematurely but the opening sequence did not impress me.The UI camera shutter sound for every little selection moving is INCREDIBLY annoying.The lack of intro was okay, common in this gameplay type, but it immediately showed me that jump scares was going to be bread and butter. I couldn't figure out where to go in the main courtyard after about ten minutes of wandering. I quickly realized that the same jump scare occured at the same location, but after jamming the E button over and over to figure out where to go, I decided this game wasn't going to be for me.			"

												It runs badly, is written terribly, is voice-acted still worse than that, has awful PS2-era textures and animations, and noticibly repetative audio looping. Worst of all, all aspects of it are explained so poorly that I had to look up most of how to play online, and even then it didn't make any sense. I don't just mean the lore (Why would a ghost be afraid of a camera phone?), but the characters and their motivations were also gibberish.The thirtieth time an old woman ghost attacks with the same animation and shrill noise, it isn't scary. It's annoying. When you resume the game from the death area, and within a second you're already attacked again while trapped in a corner, it's bad pacing. I have genuinely zero ideas how this isn't getting savaged by reviews. It's truly abysmal in every way.			"

												The game feels like it has a lot of potential, but it's just too damn awkward to play, which is a real shame.- Clumsy menu navigation with a gamepad, with a menu to re-do your key bindings that seemingly does not work to re-bind controller keys.- Confusing button layout on the controller: press (not hold) RT to bring up cellphone? Hold LB to run? It's not terribly complicated but you will fumble with it for a while. You actually seem unable to even go into first-person mode with a controller, which is one of the ways you find weakspots on enemies.- Inability to adjust the camera sensitivity with a controller. You can again do this for a mouse, but not a controller, and the default sensitivity on the controller is way beyond what any Fatal Frame-esque horror game should be at. The combination of this, plus the completely free over-the-shoulder camera makes this game downright nauseating to play on tight quarters. Attempting to adjust the camera in these scenarios leads to it swinging around, gliding against walls and just generally being a pain to manage.- Item scavenging is just plain bad. When you character can ""sense"" something, a blue aura will enshroud the corners of your screen. However, this works for points of interest *and* items at the same time, so when it starts shining, you don't know if you should be pointing your camera at an object or if you're meant to be looking around for an item. This is exacerbated by the fact that the aura seems to be triggered on a 360-degree sphere around the character, ignoring walls and anything in-between, so if you're on the second floor of a building and the aura triggers, you don't know if the item is in your floor on a different room, the next floor or the previous floor.- Lack of a map. I don't know if I didn't just advance enough through the game to get this, but I looked around for a while and could not find a map of the school. Once I came across a couple of locked doors and had to start backtracking through that relatively big enviroment, I had enough.- Kind of an ugly game texture-wise. This is just nitpicking, but there's a very big contrast on the texture quality of objects in the game. Some walls can have a respectable UV mapping while others look like the texture is blown out of proportion.It's a fascinating window into another country's culture, but aggravating to control.			"

												Really boring. This game is one of the worst horror games I've ever come across. I was looking forward to this game for a while, but I was VERY disappointed. This game has no sense of direction, half of the time you don't know where you're meant to be heading. I'm totally lost within 2hours of playing this and there is absolutely no way of finding out where to go; other than to watch a guide. I may have made my judgement too early, as I'm not nearly close to finishing the game. However, playing this game, constantly lost and bored with hardly any jumpscares at all, made me angry. I would love to carry on playing this game, but the lack of direction/storyline deters me. I'd much rather play Outlast.4/10.			"

												It's nice to see a throwback to an older horror style, something which I'm always eager for in this day and age, but unfortunately Dreadout is let down by bad game design. The core game does not flow well, player direction is largely vague, and often you're left confused as to how to progress. Even right from the start of the game when your character gets out of the car it can be confusing where you're supposed to go. Most likely while playing this game you'll need to stop every so often and go look it up, which is annoying to have to constantly do. Puzzles, knowing where to go, putting 2 and 2 together, were always a big part of survival-horror games of yore, but in Dreadout's case it's rather vague and things are not clear enough.Ghosts are cool, but some can be initially frustrating until you work out their quirks. Again, game design is somewhat bad here because you're usually left to die repeatedly until you figure out what the game is demanding from you to beat the ghost. The game all-in-all is a good effort, the atmosphere is very good, the concept is good, the protaganist has a nice♥♥♥♥♥:P, but it's unfortunately a bad gaming experience because its flaws are more frustrating and immersion-breaking.

												Fatal Frame, this is not.  My first playthrough clocking in at the 2 hour mark (for Act 1, Act 2 has not yet been released) was underwhelming.  Much like Fatal Frame, the horror lies mostly in atmosphere.  Initially, the atmosphere works well enough.  Musical cues, ambient noises, with the occasional heavy breathing from the protagonist help drill home that the game wants you to know it is 2spooky4u.Ghost encounters are anti-climatic.  The boar-ghost poses no real threat (hide in a class room, snap photos until he leaves, resume exploring), the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ghost's jumpscare/attack is effective once, and the final encounter is literally a run to the exit repeated three times in a row.  Since you respawn in the same location you ""died"", you literally have zero reason to fear the ghosts outside of the one or two jumpscares thrown at you.Oh, and there are really only two puzzles in the game.  Three if you separate getting the photo from getting the key (though the photo flat out tells you where to find it, so I don't see that as a puzzle myself).  The severe lack of ghost encounters, puzzles, and general content is incredibly dissapointing.  There are free horror games which provide many times more content (and are of higher quality) - Phobia 1.5 being a prime example.Act 2 may redeem Dreadout (once it is released), however Act 1 leaves much to be desired and is not worth it's asking price of $15.  I would, assuming Act 2 does release and does improve, suggest you pay no more than $5 for this game.  Your money can be better spent elsewhere.  Heck, Fatal Frame 1, 2, and 3 are on PSN along with Siren.  You can get Fatal Frame 1 and 2 for 2/3 the price of this.*Update*After a quick look to the Steam forums, it seems that you're able to return to the town.  After doing so I can report the following:-You can fight one more ghost.  It's hilariously easy.  Maybe there are more; I didn't encounter any.-You can use your camera to see flat / 2D ghosts random float about.  They don't make noises.  They don't attack you.  They are just cardboard cutout ghosts who circle you.  -You'll meet up with a giant ghost (whom you technically meet later in the main game), who flicks you with it's fingers as if you're a booger.  All in all that added 10 minutes to my playtime.			"

												ive tried so many times to like this game. ive tried so hard to like this game. BUT ITS JUST A BAD GAME. puzzles with no hints and enemies that will push you to the litteral and metaphoric corner before you MIGHT win. i found myself on google almost the entire time i was playing, for both puzzle hints and enemy strategies. there are several parts where you are forced to take damage and parts where you are forced to spam the camera to kill something. i didnt mind spamming my camera or taking a hit of damage, until the camera jolts in a random direction for no reason, or i find myself running in circles to find the exit, taking multiple hits of damage. i have tried, and tried, and tried again, and again, and again to like this game, but i just cant enjoy any of it. the only actual bug i ran into was after i got the slr camera, it just kept switching between the phone and the camera... it took a loading screen, 2 game restarts, a pc restart, and 2 more game restarts to fix.i did enjoy the horror of it. very good ideas, just on one set difficulty thats a bit too high for me.

												I love survival horror but real talk this game is straight awful. It's like 5+ hours of being given a prostate exam. Every character is stupid, the controls are clunky as hell, environments are unintuative, it's difficult to see anything (and this doesn't make it scary, it's just frustrating). Puzzles are just straight up bizarre and really have a solution that makes sense. The game's redeeming factor is its emphasis on Indonesian mythology, and the monster designs are pretty creative. But frankly it's not worth sitting through this almost hilariously unscary game. Only recommend if you really need a personal test of character, one that simulates the experience of wading through a pool of golden syrup.			"

												I hugely enjoyed all 3 Fatal Frame games that I played. However, the same cannot be said for DreadOut. It's a game that for the first couple of minutes has promise, but then it all disappears.I like the creature designs. It's a decent variation compared to Fatal Frame, and especially true for the giant ghost that blocks the abandoned town at night. I couldn't work out where he was at all when the orange glow started, but then I spotted his hand. I had to look straight upwards to see its huge orange eyes staring back down at me from the dark. But creature designs can't help when, instead of being scared of the game, you find yourself constantly cursing it.The puzzles in this game are so obscure that you can spend hours running around the same small building and never find it. I had to turn to guides more often than I'd like, which pulls you right out of the game. There's no fear when you're just annoyed.There was one involving a key to a locked door and a boar with a key around its neck. Finally managed to find the key (after collecting 2 unconnected items and taking a photo in another room), went to the door and nope, it's still locked. Turns out that the key I was after wasn't the key I needed. No, the key I needed was hidden behind a secret door that the key I did have unlocked. How is anyone supposed to figure that out?Another is being chased down a long hallway by some massive ghost crawling after you. I'm sprinting for ages and nothing's happening. The ghost is just getting closer and I'm just tiring out. I try the doors along the walls, they're all locked. So I give up and turn to face the ghost. Nope, sent to Limbo. Turns out that there's a secret door along the walls that you can only see with a camera. Great, another thing that won't happen in that situation but is needed to continue.Oh and the fight against the red woman in the second act? You have to die. That's it. Literally, you just wait to die. I spent ages trying to fight her, trying to time my shots and getting no where. Looking for some secret escape route or symbol to photograph. Nope. Just die and accept it.Sometimes the fighting is just irritating. The boar would manage to knock me into a wall and the wall didn't let go. I couldn't move while the boar just devastated me. Then he manages to knock me down but not far enough way. The minute I get up, he knocks me down again. Repeat until dead. The scissor guy did the same multiple times. They just constantly attack, giving you no chance of escape.The unskippable cutscenes are frustrating. Sometimes it's just the long duration of some animations, but I sit there thinking 'am I watching a game being played for me, or am I playing it?'. The first half of Act 2 is mostly this sort of thing.There's also Limbo. Every single time you die, you get sent to some black void with candles around you. It takes you ages for the character to get up by herself and then you have to run to the floating light with wings. A long waste of time just to put you back where you died. There really is no need for it, especially being blinded.Had it not been so frustrating, I'd have liked this game. As it stands, I'm only doing this for achievements. It's not scary, it's not entertaining. It's just annoying.			"

												At first I was super excited to have bought the game. Then as I played more and more of the game, I got bored. It isn't what I expected at all. I want to like the game, but am having a hard time doing so and here's why.-You move at the speed of a crippled sloth.-The ghosts are about as scary as casper.-You die, you walk into the light, you die, you walk into the light (repeat)-The controls for accessing you journal, album, camera etc. are weird af.-The sounds in the background are on a loop. They actually randomly cut out and then start from the beginning again. It's like listening to a song on a broken Ipod.-Low quality.-Glitchy as all ♥♥♥♥.-Cliche in so many ways.And I could go on and on. For $15? Hell to the no. I only recommend you buy it if its like $2-5 and even then I have a hard time recommending it.I give it 2/10			"

												This is an extremely underpolished horror game.  5/10. If you really must try out this game, wait for the crazy sales! Even at 70% off i still regret buying the game. Cons- Lots of visual/ animation glitches that really ruins the experience. - Terrible game design that leaves you wondering what to do often. - Sloppy controls.- First 10 minutes of the game i had to restart the game because i keep spawning between 2 enemies and unable to escape because of the long enemy hit-animation.  Beware of dying while cornered by at least 2 enemies! - Pretty boring and relies entirely on cheap scares.- No story (not really a con)Pros+Pretty decently scary (scary environment)			"

												A Game I Will Not Soon ForgetSo much positive to write about this game. At the very least I would describe it as ominous. One part, however, gave me cold feet, and not in the sense of being so frightened I didn’t want to continue, but because a certain “boss” cheated and made the game frustrating. I was inclined to hit the uninstall command.Every time I see a pair of scissors from this time forward I’ll feel nauseous. The only way I finally figured out how to defeat the cheating AI was to use the key that was the back-step key, and twirl the mouse so that I was using that key to run forwards, instead of backwards. The AI got so confused I was finally, quite easily, able to defeat the scissor wielding cross-dresser. In spite of this, the game is one I will not soon forget. It took me just over 12 hours to complete, which I am beginning to believe is just about the perfect length for a game.A school building being a big part of the game you eventually enter requires a cognizant approach in adventuring as it is full of spirited rooms joined by dusty halls that you’ll have to comb through in order to pick up necessary items; a process I thoroughly enjoyed. After all, it is a school, so just as one would expect the rooms and hallways to be similar, they are. Yet the classrooms and hallways are only similar in their shape and dissimilar in stains and dirt, the placement of desks, chairs, and items students have long left behind, teaching tools, etc.. Again, just as it should be. Afterwards you'll play in different ""spiritual"" locales; a garden, dirt pathways, a small village, a mansion; but will eventually wind up back in the school.DreadOut is filled with atmosphere, thus wandering and coming across ghosts makes every step threatening. There is always a sense of dread and danger. The Indonesian team of Digital Happiness have created an amazing, bone-chilling survival horror.			"

												DreadOut is one of the best new original horror games to come out in some time. In a genre over saturated with shovelware, this game is truly a diamond in the rough. Not to say this game isn't a little rough around the edges itself at times. Heavily inspired by the horror genre juggernaut 'Fatal Frame', DreadOut hits its marks, but misses a few as well. The game features a 3rd person over the shoulder camera angle, that I love, but I still would have liked an option for 1st person. In terms of voice acting, it leaves a lot to be desired, but works well enough. The main character ""Linda"" is a silent protagonist, which is a HUGE disappointment and a little awkward when it comes to cutscenes. The sound and music are good; except for a couple scenes missing score where there should have been something there. In terms of story it's very thin and could have been slightly better explained as well. it's also a VERY short game (about 4 hours).I want to point out that I actually like and enjoy DreadOut very much, but want to give constructive criticism. Although it has its problems, It's a great game that I definitely recommend to anyone who likes/loves the horror genre. The horror genre needs more good games. This is one of them. In what negatives it has, theres so many more positives to be found.			"

												Dread Out is an enjoyable horror game to play, its not far off being like Fatel Frame but that dosen't mean that its not a good game. the gameplay has some slight bugs such as lag when turning fast but other than minor things it runs great. The game play is very easy to get used to and the graphics are pretty good too. The game features a good few jumpscares when facing enemies but the game is more about putting you on edge instead of trying to be an in your face kind of game. All in all I would recommend this game for horror fans new and old.			"

												DreadOut is a PC clone of the Fatal Frame series spiced up with an Indonesian background. Playing as the schoolgirl Linda, you have to fend off various ghosts by photographing them with your camera while also solving various riddles.The game certainly has many flaws - it is not very long (I'd estimate a playtime of 6-10 hours), the graphics are mediocre at best, and the game's difficulty can vary wildly; doubly so as you are sometimes required to do things that seemingly defy all reason (such as not attacking a certain ghosts in a certain moment).Nonetheless, DreadOut is quite capable of scaring the living daylight out of you. The unfamiliar bestiary of Indonesian ghosts alone is unsettling enough, but the camera mechanic takes the cake - for the better part of the game, you will be moving forward at a snail's pace with your cellphone cam at the ready, expecting ghosts to pop up from every corner. This is only made worse by the well-done lighting and sound design - unless the light of your cellphone or camera is up, you're practically blind, and the constant noise in the background doesn't do much to alleviate your paranoia. DreadOut may be one of these games that only are scary on the first walkthrough because you don't know where the fiends are waiting to ambush you, but let none say that they didn't get the ambush part right.Personal rating: 7/10			"

												I have to say this is a GREAT horror game if you've played Fatal Frame you'll love this as it plays out a lot like the game. The atmosphere is what keeps me playing and I feel in love at it before the end of Act 0. If you're a fan of horror games you'll easily fall in love with this game within 10 minutes even if that 10 minutes is trying to find a way to hate the game.			"

												Kind of confusing, a bit difficult and glitchy. That being said, IMO deserves a higher metacritic score (55, really?) and is entertaining and spooky. Lore really adds to the game in a big way, and the combat is fairly involved and creative. A solid 8/10.			"

												Dread Out is an enjoyable horror game to play, its not far off being like Fatel Frame but that dosen't mean that its not a good game. the gameplay has some slight bugs such as lag when turning fast but other than minor things it runs great. The game play is very easy to get used to and the graphics are pretty good too. The game features a good few jumpscares when facing enemies but the game is more about putting you on edge instead of trying to be an in your face kind of game. All in all I would recommend this game for horror fans new and old.			"

												DreadOut is one of the best new original horror games to come out in some time. In a genre over saturated with shovelware, this game is truly a diamond in the rough. Not to say this game isn't a little rough around the edges itself at times. Heavily inspired by the horror genre juggernaut 'Fatal Frame', DreadOut hits its marks, but misses a few as well. The game features a 3rd person over the shoulder camera angle, that I love, but I still would have liked an option for 1st person. In terms of voice acting, it leaves a lot to be desired, but works well enough. The main character ""Linda"" is a silent protagonist, which is a HUGE disappointment and a little awkward when it comes to cutscenes. The sound and music are good; except for a couple scenes missing score where there should have been something there. In terms of story it's very thin and could have been slightly better explained as well. it's also a VERY short game (about 4 hours).I want to point out that I actually like and enjoy DreadOut very much, but want to give constructive criticism. Although it has its problems, It's a great game that I definitely recommend to anyone who likes/loves the horror genre. The horror genre needs more good games. This is one of them. In what negatives it has, theres so many more positives to be found.			"

												Man. Where do I start with DreadOut? Well, because I really do like the game and I want to see a sequel or more projects like it, let's go with positives first.+Chilling enemies+Some interesting characters+Clever Puzzles+Indonesian lore and legend mixes things upNow, at first glance, these negatives are gonna seem intense, but just hear me out after they're out of the way.-Enemy AI and Mechanics can be frustratingly broken at times (sometimes literally stopping progression)-Textures and models are generally pretty ugly-Boss fights can be confusing AF-Exploring the environments is pretty dull - mostly because the levels aren't pleasent to look at and there aren't many collectablesNow, this game still gets a positive review from me because I see this game going places. I enjoyed my time with DreadOut in spite of its frustrations and pretty poor graphics. It has weird bits of comedy that made me laugh pretty hard every time I saw them and almost every enemy is pretty f*****g scary (every hair on my body standing up on end for most of them). The game was scary enough and the characters/story just compelling enough (while again not very well modeled or textured, Linda is pretty attractive. I was hellbent on her survival XD) to get me through the game and to try and find the alternate endings. Gonna be buying the DLC soon so I can get scared some more lol $15 may sound like a lot for this relatively short title (6.2 hours and I'd beaten the game and gotten an alternate ending), but I think it's worth it to keep Digital Happiness going and see them grow.

												This game is pretty good, I'm big into horror games and its sad to see that so many more modern installments in this genre really fall flat, but this game manages to get out of that rut very well. For any other die hard horror fans this game is very akin to the Fatal Frame/Project Zero games, in terms of gameplay, characters and tone. But it does have a bit of everything, its got the atmoshere of silent hill, the charm of clock tower, the gameplay of fatal frame and a few jumpscares (though for those worried the jumpscares are not too prominent and are put togetehr with the correct amount of timing and atmosphere Story: 7/10, its develped very well and you really have to search for the whole story, but that doent stop it from being a bit typical in some places. Gameplay: 7/10, Again it does play nice and the mechanics all work, but there are glitches and camera twitches in places, though nothing too noticable. SPoOky?: 8/10, in a world where mosthorror games keep you wincing and flintching in preperation for a scare, this does well to keep you on the edge of your seat and terrified.			"

												The first game I've ever disliked on Steam that I purchased...I mostly  write positive reviews, because I only buy the games I would like in my collection.This is the first I will be physically blocking / removing in the embarresment of having actually paid real money for such a tradgic experience.The animation, lets not go there...The gameplay consists of walking through empty rooms, with polygon modelling equivelent of a student using 3D Studio Max back in 1998. Things like this game should not legally be allowed on Steam, since it requires money, and the game is just non existent. I'm confident that most 10 year olds given a full copy of 3d studio max, and 6 months to learn it, could develop better assets than what this game has.Following a robot animated school girl with a whispery voice, opening doors, whilst most being locked or not actually leading to anywhere, you listen to a cheap made music soundtrack which is stuck like ya great grannies worst lp in loop forever.The game is not funny... not scary... not a game.I'd be annoyed if I spent 1 single pound on this nonsense. The best part was pressing EXIT in the options menu. Unininstall, never again.			"

												Well, DreadOut is another flawed game with a good premise, but marred by bugs and poor design choices.  How well do these balance out?  Let's put it this way.  Normally, I list the bad things first so we can end off the review on a positive note.  I'm going the other way around this time because otherwise, you may never see the pros.Pros: The story.  Actually something different from the usual ""ghosts just want to kill you"".   Great variety of ghosts, in large part because they are taken from Asian legends and not the usual North American and European ones. Possessed Ira's dialog and actions really stand out. I mean, to the point where I wondered if they subcontracted out that part of the game. Nice variety of ways to deal with the ghosts.Cons: INCREDIBLY awkward dialog and animations.  I half thought Linda and Ira were already dead or possessed from the way they interacted at the beginning of Act I. Look, I get that Linda's a silent protagonist, but for the love of all that's holy, please work the dialog so that it's not all awkward silences. Really bad translations at times Translations for written language (especially signs) would have been nice. I get that we're not in an English speaking country, but Linda is probably supposed to be able to read Indonesian.  Or is that enabled along with subtitles? Ghosts that don't act the way their entries say they will.  All those man-hating ghosts?  Not really sure why they're so hostile to Linda. It was definitely unclear to me what I was supposed to do with the camera at first. Act 0 gives you the basic idea that some ghosts only appear there, but there was no indication that the flash would actually hurt them.  The hint text merely tells you they might be startled. How slowly Linda move when the camera is up.   How slowly Linda moves the camera up and down. (Lag) How slowly Linda does anything when ghosts are nearby (Laaaaaaag) Puzzles with random solutions.  Why that one mirror?  Why not? The devs really need to rethink their autosave/respawn policy.  In Act 0, I kept respawning to the exact spot I died in, only the enemies were still there. And since Linda took forever to move her camera up (see above), I couldn't break out of the loop.  I figured I could just reload the save point, but guess what?  It autosaved with the enemies on top of me.  Nothing I could do but replay the entire Act. The stage where there are 4 objects you need to hit the ghost 4 times.  I died after breaking the first object, but when I respawned, the object was already broken, yet the ghost still needed all 4 hits.   At one point, I could no longer hurt the Sundel Bolong.  The camera just had no effect whatsoever. Exiting and reloading did nothing. I had to go the rest of the game unable to do anything but run away from her.  Which made boss battles that much more annoying. There are, in fact, times when your survival is entirely a matter of luck. During the locust attack, for example, you are unable to raise your camera, yet are attacked by a ghost that cannot be seen without the camera. Nice. The alternate ending looks like it was thrown together at the last minute. Inconsistent rules. Invisible barriers are bad enough, but to hit them during a chase sequence?  Grrr.  Why on earth does the SLR flash behave completely differently depending on whether you take a photo or not?I dunno, maybe if this franchise is given to more experienced devs, we could have something really good on our hands.  Otherwise, I'm just going to watch somebody else play it on YouTube.  Some games just need more polish.  This one has so little polish, it's practically still a rock.			"

The game has the atmosphere and scares and stuff, it ain't perfect though and nowhere near as good as Fatal Frame but its still good. If you purchase the game and get lost as in you have no idea what to do I suggest you try out one of the many guides on steam as I sometimes found myself not knowing what to do or where a key was located....xD Anyways I recommend this game but at a discount price.

Unfortunately for me, my touchpad has no scroll wheel, and you cannot remap the zoom key to anything but the scroll wheel, so I cannot progress in the game.If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, go for it-  the game is wonderfully atmospheric, really feels like one of the older Fatal Frame games.  The first boss (Scissors Ghost) is painfully overpowered though.			"

												DreadOut is a PC clone of the Fatal Frame series spiced up with an Indonesian background. Playing as the schoolgirl Linda, you have to fend off various ghosts by photographing them with your camera while also solving various riddles.The game certainly has many flaws - it is not very long (I'd estimate a playtime of 6-10 hours), the graphics are mediocre at best, and the game's difficulty can vary wildly; doubly so as you are sometimes required to do things that seemingly defy all reason (such as not attacking a certain ghosts in a certain moment).Nonetheless, DreadOut is quite capable of scaring the living daylight out of you. The unfamiliar bestiary of Indonesian ghosts alone is unsettling enough, but the camera mechanic takes the cake - for the better part of the game, you will be moving forward at a snail's pace with your cellphone cam at the ready, expecting ghosts to pop up from every corner. This is only made worse by the well-done lighting and sound design - unless the light of your cellphone or camera is up, you're practically blind, and the constant noise in the background doesn't do much to alleviate your paranoia. DreadOut may be one of these games that only are scary on the first walkthrough because you don't know where the fiends are waiting to ambush you, but let none say that they didn't get the ambush part right.Personal rating: 7/10			"

												I was looking forward to this game quite a bit and in my opinion, the wait was worth it.If you ever enjoyed Project Zero / Fatal Frame, then you might like this game, too. It borrows heavily from those, but also got some inspiration from Silent Hill and Clock Tower. One should however keep in mind that the devs behind this are a quite small team - The game is rather short (will take you about 6 hours to finish) and there're some bugs (while in the school, savegames won't work). Also, the graphics are on a PS2 level. I still recommend it to anyone who likes horror games and doesn't mind the few issues.The Good:Great atmosphereIndonesian loreGood jumpscares (not those dull ones we all got used to)Fun gameplayThe Bad:Broken savegames in the school areaAdditional bugs for linux users (not working achievements and flickering hair textures)Overall sub-par graphics "

I want to like the game, but am having a hard time doing so and here's why.-You move at the speed of a crippled sloth.-The ghosts are about as scary as casper.-You die, you walk into the light, you die, you walk into the light (repeat)-The controls for accessing you journal, album, camera etc. are weird af.-The sounds in the background are on a loop. They actually randomly cut out and then start from the beginning again. It's like listening to a song on a broken Ipod.-Low quality.-Glitchy as all ♥♥♥♥.-Cliche in so many ways.And I could go on and on. For $15? Hell to the no.

												I just got in love with this game. Its an indie game, and you can easily notice that everywhere all along the story, but it was donde with such a sense of autenticity, that you cant avoid to feel as if was a real experience. There are many beautiful escenes, and the character of the ghosts are very well crafted. But more important, you can feel the intrigue and the enjoyment of exploring a real mistery on every step. You will feel as a young teeneger who is really concern for her friends, but has to face such a horrendous situation, that only using the best in her she can survive. The only real problem the game has is its lack of hints, if you dont want to frustrate yourself walking around, you better check with the community guides that can be of real help.			"

There is largely forgivable once you get into the game however.  Some of the 'puzzles' can be frustrating, so if you're a gamer who likes to finish a game without guides, prepare to pull a few hairs out if you're not bald. :p   Don't feel bad taking a peek at a guide to help you on your way.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes survival horror games, especially supernatural ones like Silent Hill and Fatal Frame.The game also features a 'Ghostpedia' that provides some interesting lore into the spookies that you will meet in the game.  Pretty neat stuff if you like spooky stuff in general!			"

												Let me start this review saying that I am very strong fan of horror games, like Silent Hill, Clock Tower and Fatal Frame.Dreadout is a short, but entertaining game, worth the price tag. Admittedly the duget for the models and textures are a bit lacking comparing it to recent horror games, but it is still quite the decent effort. Dreadout plays like your stereotypical horror movie, with a group of students and a teacher arriving to a ghost town. You take control of Linda, one of the students, and the only means for survival are her physical condition and a camera to fend of the ghosts, much like in the Fatal Drame series.If there are some complains about this game is the camera during 3rd person, which is kind of unstable in small places and corners, being a bit jerky, which leads to disorientation. Another issue is death, which after being defeated you are thrown into Limbo, in which as punishment you have to walk some distance in order to try again (the distance is diminished if you collect certain items). However, you are placed exactly at the location of your death, meaning that if you were completely surrounded by enemies, you will be stuck there being killed over and over and will have no option but to start anew. Lack of knowledge of indonesian mythology and folklore may affect, but I would use it as an opportunity to learn about other cultures.All in all it is quite the entertaining game, worth a shot in one of those cold, dark nights.

												This game is awesome. Its a mix of  fatal frame ,silent hill and resident evil but with a nice Indonesian flare.  The monsters are all well modeled, unique and some are actually really creepy.  Many monsters seem to be taken striaght out of Indonesian lore.You will get freaked out at certain points in the game. There is a little exploration here and there finding newspaper clippings, medals and trinkets.It has this cool camera feature where you can save your favorite photos in the in game gallery and with how awesome the monters are you will be saving plenty along with some landscapes and various NPC's. The puzzles mostly involve using your camera.  Graphics are super ps2 quality in HD and makes the game more creepy.Its method of punshiment is to throw you into limbo if you are frightened to death. Limbo is a rather dark place with a sort of white/blue light at the end in the shape of wings and the more frequently you die the further you spawn away the exit. There are items you could find to decrease the distance otherwise if you are a super nub you will be having a nice a little jog to the end. The game is a bit short but it never gets boring and throws curve balls at you in terms of what you do and scenery. Expect some glitches here and there. Some puzzles are a bit abstract but i suggest you think hard, use your camera and study your environment otherwise there are great walkthroughs out there. Replay value comes in with taking the perfect pictures and collecting them, finding all collectables and Linda has a wide selection of Alt-costumes after completing the game including soccer, heavy metal , and traditional indonesian dress ( or you could download the DLC and get all the costumes autounlocked ).FInal Verdict 8/10 would play agian.

												Take this all with a grain of salt, this game seems pretty popular in its niche. Don't be dissuaded if this seems like your kind of game.- 3rd person view is incredibly glitchyThe view jumps all over the place. This makes turning corners and going through doors more challenging than fighting monsters.- Textures are really badIt's more noticeable in the wide open areas where the textures need to cover a larger area. The textures just look like featureless smudges.- Death mechanics are badIf you die you basically need to start over because it spawns you and the monsters in the exact same spot. If you're stuck in a corner (really the only way you can die) you just enter an infinite loop of death and rebirth.- Camera mechanics aren't fun and are unintuitiveWhy does taking pictures of stuff kill it? How am I supposed to know in what way to take pictures of things to kill them? Trial and error. Good luck!Everything else is first rate, but these are deal breakers for me.			"

												I don't know if I want to recommend a game in which you respawn when you're stuck in a corner and keep dying... and dying... and dying. Good game otherwise, but what's the point if you can't progress.			"

												This game make me impressed because place in this game look like my home town ( I'm Thai, so we're neighbor)But I want to play this game after I saw Demo but It's still has too many bug and I thing It's too long for waiting for Fix.I can't play with my own save because loading screen run very long (It's not loading) and I can't wait.(15-30 minute It's very long).I will glad if you can fix bug soon before I think this game is worse.

												Let me start this review saying that I am very strong fan of horror games, like Silent Hill, Clock Tower and Fatal Frame.Dreadout is a short, but entertaining game, worth the price tag. Admittedly the duget for the models and textures are a bit lacking comparing it to recent horror games, but it is still quite the decent effort. Dreadout plays like your stereotypical horror movie, with a group of students and a teacher arriving to a ghost town. You take control of Linda, one of the students, and the only means for survival are her physical condition and a camera to fend of the ghosts, much like in the Fatal Drame series.If there are some complains about this game is the camera during 3rd person, which is kind of unstable in small places and corners, being a bit jerky, which leads to disorientation. Another issue is death, which after being defeated you are thrown into Limbo, in which as punishment you have to walk some distance in order to try again (the distance is diminished if you collect certain items). However, you are placed exactly at the location of your death, meaning that if you were completely surrounded by enemies, you will be stuck there being killed over and over and will have no option but to start anew. Lack of knowledge of indonesian mythology and folklore may affect, but I would use it as an opportunity to learn about other cultures.All in all it is quite the entertaining game, worth a shot in one of those cold, dark nights.

												Spooky, atmospheric, and a callback to Fatal Frame. You can tell there was a low budget, but that shouldn't deter you. Controls are simple, although much like PS2 era games you'll need to read them so you understand what to do.It's a bit repetitive. It wasn't enough to make me walk away, though.Seeing and learning about ghosts and spirits from another culture was more than enough to hold my attention.If you're a fan of Fatal Frame, go for it.Wait for a sale, though.

												Pros:TerrifyingLevel select for easy achievementsCons:The graphics are Playstation 2 qualityCharacter animations for some are Nintendo 64 qualityGameplay is actually quite shallow.  Enemy combat boils down to using the camera on cooldown while avoiding easy blows.Linda's movement speed is terrible.Thumbs up for the scares for only $6.  Buy it on sale for the scares because that's all you'll buy it for.  The highs are very high and the lows are very low.			"

												The game is unpolished, the topology of each character is horrible, you can tell that they didnt assign the vertex's to each bone properly, i see the model jutting out. The game can lag when it really doesn't have to, I feel like they just took the whole enviroment from turbosquid and stuck it in there with horrid geomentry.. I feel like im playing beta. On that matter- I like the game. The story is good, and the overall concept is something I always suckered for.  Its a creepfest- but it needs work. The variation of the ghosties are pretty great, and any ghost in a dress with long black hair in a hall is just creepy.If you have the fifteen bucks to spare, I'd check it out if I were you. Don't think this game is perfect, 'cause its not. But then again, if you only bought perfect games your library would be quite small.  "

												I just got in love with this game. Its an indie game, and you can easily notice that everywhere all along the story, but it was donde with such a sense of autenticity, that you cant avoid to feel as if was a real experience. There are many beautiful escenes, and the character of the ghosts are very well crafted. But more important, you can feel the intrigue and the enjoyment of exploring a real mistery on every step. You will feel as a young teeneger who is really concern for her friends, but has to face such a horrendous situation, that only using the best in her she can survive. The only real problem the game has is its lack of hints, if you dont want to frustrate yourself walking around, you better check with the community guides that can be of real help.			"

												Really nice, im not the kind of person that judge a game for its graphics, this one havent the best even for the time but i actualy enjoyed it a lot. I mean, even silent hill (the clasic type of silent hill) had a really weird and hard way to move and fight, and i really enjoy that game, this one have a weird way of moving and ""fighting"" style too, but the game itself compensate the hard controller style with slow enemies, or if not, with enemies that looks like have more problems moving than you, just like those clasic horror games.Also, the game is not based just in screamers, its also the kind of horror that makes you dont want to continue in certain moments.It was a nice game, i recomend it.

												By far not a perfect game. It's buggy, music often stops in the middle of something, I spawned in the middle of enemies who stunned me until I was dead again - but hell was it fun altogether.Despite its flaws, DreadOut is a short but powerful experience. With a great ghost and sound design the horror is done just right for a spooky evening.			"

												Dreadout is a fun horror game but...i have no idea why a ps2 graphic game is so heavy in my laptop.. D; it's laggy and fps drops sometimes.. esp if i played it on higher resolution.Puzzle is interesting.. and hard without any clues tbh (and there are no clues lmfao). Story is weak. Interesting, but sadly, weak. They could put more background stories or random trivia or more explanation about ghost lores etc, there are so many rooms to develop them. So little ghosts for a horror game... not enough jumpscares, not enough creepy stuffs, not enough ghosts luring around the streets.. (yes, i did all the secret bosses and all but still.. NOT SCARY, they simply just lacking the 'scary' elemets )... T__T Plus point is the funny, if else, interesting achievements like the cat attack thing, or how you have to die from a keysmash or the annoying reversed control because the mice thing... Fun! This game is enjoyable because it's not just walking robot taking picture and solving puzzle thing. Different things might happen on the way of your journey through the end.I'm not really satisfied, but all in all Dreadout is still a good, enjoyable horror game! 7/10.This game has so many potentials and i hope the dev gets more funding and make a better horror game in the future :DAlso i love the second sister boss fight concept! Mirror fight is so fun haha			"

												The Spookiness is there.  Creepy atmosphere with good scares.  The graphics in some areas look a bit dated for 2016, but look really good in others.  There is largely forgivable once you get into the game however.  Some of the 'puzzles' can be frustrating, so if you're a gamer who likes to finish a game without guides, prepare to pull a few hairs out if you're not bald. :p   Don't feel bad taking a peek at a guide to help you on your way.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes survival horror games, especially supernatural ones like Silent Hill and Fatal Frame.The game also features a 'Ghostpedia' that provides some interesting lore into the spookies that you will meet in the game.  Pretty neat stuff if you like spooky stuff in general!			"

												Give it a chance people. Yeah it's low budget, small dev company game... But it does have atmosphere and soul.The story is nothing complicated or new (if you saw any Horror movie and played old-school horror games; You will get a huge deja-vu). Gameplay is somewhat representative of Fatal Frame. So yeah: A group of student became hostages of abandoned city, and our heroine tries to survive and help her friends.. Her enemies are ghosts! Her only weapon -- mobile-phone camera (and later actuall camera).Of course, like most old-school horror games, this one does have puzzles, and my god -- those are creative! Same goes for enemies.The second episode of game is somewhat wierd... It becames wierd... Hard to explain without spoilers, but it's wierd in a good wat actually. So anyway. If you tired of modern horrors -- that eiter won't let you fight or are somekind of action games with monsters, try DreadOut -- a great blast from the past.			"
