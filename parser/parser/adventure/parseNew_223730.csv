												Unfortunately overlooked by many, this gem should be in the collection of any puzzle-platformer fan. While its core element of 'collect stuff and get to the end of the level' doesnt bring a ton thats new to the table, it still has plenty to entertain with. The visuals are quite lovely to look at, the soundtrack is very well composed and always fits, and piloting each of the 4 different characters and their unique powers keeps the game from getting stale. With the press of a button, the world around you shifts color, appearance, music and objects which you interact with. Navigating through the maze-like levels can be confusing at times due to this, but Ive never gotten stuck to the point I had to refer to a walkthrough.Dont let its pretty facade fool you though- this game can be obnoxiously difficult later on, with plenty of areas requiring split-second timing as you run, glide, stick to walls, fly, bounce in an invulnerable balloon, shift dimensions and try not to hit those glowing red nasties that youll be plenty familiar with in the first few levels. Fortunately, you have unlimited lives; when you die youre immediately zapped back to a checkpoint, and you can even avoid death by pressing a button that LETS you go back to your ""spawn"". All in all, a great independent title that should amuse for a good ~20 hours, and at a cheap 10 bucks (currently $3.39 on holiday sale thru Steam) youre not going to feel ripped off even if you somehow DONT like it. Just look at the demo videos, they should say enough!			"

												This is what most indie games dream of looking like. Fast-paced, really strong platforming with puzzle elements, and just a huge amount of personality, which makes a big difference.			"

												At first when I saw this game, I though this must be that cute little platformer game.Jumping here, jumping there, solve easy puzzle.But I'm wrong.The challenges in this game ain't that easy to deal with even the boss fight need skills.There's also a time-trial level where you must race with time and you must not die.If you die you have to restart the level.As an Indie Games Enthuasiast, I could say this game is a great platformer game.

												I love FLY'N it's a very cute game, the sound affects are adorable and the art is so beautifully done. But be WARNED this game is very challenging and difficult as you progress further through it. I got about Quarter way through and had to give up, just got to difficult for me. But if you do like a challenging beautiful and cute platformer game, then i do recommend picking up this game, even though it was difficult for me, i have absolutely no regrets having it in my library.Believe me it's a very cute and colourful game, besides being difficult of course. And at 75% of it's a very good deal. :D			"

												Here is another game I grabbed for $2.48 during the Steam summer sale. You won't find many cartoonish platformers prettier than this one. The graphics, gameplay and mechanics all were smooth and gorgeous. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8 hours of this campaign. Although the final boss was a bit drawn-out and tedious. This game was one of the first to come out of Greenlight. I can see why Steam showcased it.			"

Its got a bit of a challenge to it but it definitely kept my attention and gave me a bit of enjoyment. :D I can't say anything for the bonus levels, I am not quite skilled enough to 100% the game...or maybe I just don't have enough patience haha. That's what you might want to bring to the table when you have a sat and play this game >.> Anyway, it's a good one. 8/10			"

												Fly'n is a puzzle platformer that delivers a delightful amount of platform and puzzle gameplay, on top of a richly designed world.In Fly'n, players control small, cute looking creatures called Buds. There are four different kinds, which all have the same ability to double jump, glide, and switch states of the level. Each Bud has a unique ability that is used to solve certain puzzles in the game. The levels range from run and jump platforming to solving puzzles using a certain character. While things may seem easy at first, the levels get harder to be actually quite challenging. The puzzles grow to involve using more characters together in one level and more challenging level layouts. The normal levels have no timer, except for certain levels that are more linear in nature and involve outrunning a rising sea of junk. These speedrun kind of levels are the harder levels in the game, due to the strict time limits and higher bar for platforming skill. A boss battle occurs at the end of each world, complete with more puzzle platforming to navigate through and win. The levels are all fun to play through and try to solve, with levels tending to take around 5-10 minutes or maybe more depending on the pace of play.Controling the characters feels natural and responsive at times. Sometimes, moving the Buds around feels not as refined as they might sometimes move too fast when not needed to be or don't jump as high enough. Still, the controls are solid and work well with only a few quirks that may pop up when playing the game.The art style of Fly'n is very, very well drawn. The characters have a simplistic design with solid colors and simple shapes. On the other hand, the worlds are highly detailed with lots of color and intricate designs on the surfaces of each level. The world styles range from natural inspired designs with foilage, to more abstract designs and mechanical parts. Changing the state of the level turns the world to silhouettes or a more tinted color. The animation is also really well done both ingame and in the cutscenes. The characters themselves are simple in design, but are animated so smoothly that it feels natural. The cutscenes are also of high visual quality, owing in part that both the ingame and cutscene character data are both from the same source material. With high details with great animation and drawing style, the art style is very pleasing to look at and play with.The music in Fly'n adds a nice backdrop to the graphical design. The songs tend to be relaxed in nature or more frantic depending on what level is going on. There is a fair variety of tracks present in the game, ranging from light, instrumental pieces to faster paced rock or electronic styles. The music does its job in adding to the style of the game, and they do sound great to listen to as well.Fly'n does have a story, albiet a weird one. Basically, a hair dryer collects garbage and dumps them everywhere. The hair dryer dumps it on the worlds where the Buds are. It's up to the Buds to stop the hair dryer from dumping more garbage on their worlds. Anyway, the cutscenes themselves tend to be silly in nature and a little bit weird in terms of storytelling. The story isn't amazing, but tends to silly and help drive the game.Fly'n gives a full 10 hour game with fun and challenging puzzle platforming, set in a world that looks and feels great with the art and animation quality. This game is definitely a joy to play and does provide some great puzzles, all wrapped up in very well done style for the game's setting.			"

Fly'n is a beautiful game and in this context beautiful is referring to the visuals of the game. No matter how you look at the game and even if you don't like platformers you have to admit that the complete game is looking fantastic.The story is told fast: A hairdryer called Dyer is attacking the world trees in order to rob their energy the ""Helys"". To prevent this, the world trees have created the buds to stop Dyer  polluting the trees even more.Fly'n  is a platformer. You are trying to reach the top of the different trees and fight the specific world boss there. Every world consist of 7 levels plus one boss level and three bonus level (exception is the last world with only one bonus level) so there is a lot to do and the game is gradually getting harder. You have four different buds and every bud has its own special ability. Fly'n can sing and activate the Helys and revive the inhibitants of Helica, Lyft can stick to any (unpolluted) surface and crawl on them, Ywok can transform to a ball and bounce around and Nyls can propel himself (up to three times). And all Buds can jump, double-jump and glide. You can not change the buds freely everywhere, only in the specific checkpoints which is a good thing because you don't have to think too much with whom you have to solve a specific part of the level. Additional to all the abilites the buds can also change between two visions which may make different parts of the level solid and/or accessible.As for the difficulty: If you only try to reach the exit it should only need patience since you may die as often as you ""wish"" and you will restart from the last checkpoint. But you should notice that the game has been tagged as ""hard"" so keep that in mind. It may look cute but you need to know what you are doing. For those looking for a higher challenge there are different options: You may try to ""complete"" the levels which means you explore more and collect all the Helys and pollen which are hidden. If you are still not satisfied you can try to play the levels without dying. And for the motivated there are the Leaderboards where you can compare your points to the rest of the playership.All in all I think I can't recommand this game enough. I bought the game on release day and never regretted it. I put more than 100 hours into this game which says a lot. The buds are lovable and each world has a different beautiful design. If you like platformers you have little to no reason to not buy and play Fly'n. All this is rounded up with a beautiful soundtrack which you can and should buy aswell.			"

												fantastic indie puzzle platformer... YES I KNOW HOW FREAKING PREDICTABLE THAT SOUNDS! but its true, very enjoyable game with some honestly gorgeous 2D graphics, tons of personality and a very acceptable level of challengeplaying this game simply makes feel good, a mix of great 2D art, calm soundtrack and a very forgiving gameplayyou control a little bug(?) with the ability to swift between 2 dimensions as well as many other acquired abilities like sticking to walls, dash through the air and bouncing around, the objective is to reach the end of each stage with some collectables along the way, the levels are non-linear and the puzzles are very well designed, it can be tricky at times, but the checkpoint system makes sure it doesnt take long to get back in the actionmy mayor complain is i guess, the fact the first half of the game is much better than the rest, the first power you get, sticking to walls, is much more interested and better implemented than the dashing and bouncing you are able to use later, bouncing can be specially problematic since it lacks finesse and precisionoverall very enjoyable and quite a bit long, it took me 12 hours to complete and i havent even checked any of the secret levels, indie puzzle platformers are a dime a dozen nowadays, but this is one of the few actually worth your time and money			"

												Flyn is an absolutely gorgeous 2d platformer that includes some elements of exploration as well as slight hints of puzzling. You can get further abilities the more you progress in the game, which varies your gameplay experience, while you can also revisit older levels for 100% completion. The music enhances the relaxed atmosphere of the game and its art style should be envied by accomplished titles. The reason I do not recommend it for the average player is that I have found the difficulty level growing significantly, relatively early in the game, with no option whatsoever to adjust it for a smoother experience. This is a great shame for not so skilled players, who can miss the majority of the beautiful worlds portrayed in Flyn, and turn their experience frustrating instead of relaxing. Would definitely recommend it though, if your platforming skills are above average, or you like a hard challenge. Take my review as a warning, with a grain of salt.			"

												Bought this game a long time ago, thrilled by the awesome level design and atmospere.Unfortunately this has been a false step...The trailer showcases a beautiful game, with amazing graphics/animation and fun gameplay....Well, all those elements are there but the game suffers from a very big problem...IT'S OVERLY REPETITIVE.The game itself starts out nice, but after a couple of hours you start experiencing the same level styles, colours and layouts.After 3,4 hours you basically have seen everything the game has to offer, and you notice how the level design actually isn't that inspired.The platforming is always the same and the game does nothing to reinvent istelf to make the player complete the adventure.I (almost) always finish the games i play...sometimes i even spend hours and hours getting the achievements...but i couldn't pull myself togheter to finish this one...and that says it all.Quite a shame...to be honest.Note i'm not saying the game is awfull....it actually plays well; but if you really want to play it do it in small doses, it will make you less bored.

												Absolutely phenomenal game, platforming gets hard but never frustrating and every level is well-designed. Puzzles are clever without being too difficult. So much fun to play, art design is fantastic, music is amazing, just an all-around great package. Also reminds me somewhat of Rayman Origins, which is, as you can see, another game I love. Basically: get this game!5/15/14:I don't think my last review does this game justice.I have not played this game in 5 months.It still lingers in my mind as one of the best games I've ever played. I can't stop thinking about it. I've played it twice through and feel like I could play it many, many more times and not get tired of it. I don't know what it is about this game. The fantastic art, the great music, the stellar level design and creativity, the superb gameplay mechanics.... just everything about this game comes together into a nearly perfect package. There is one bad level in the game, out of 40, and it's not *terrible* either. There's one other relatively mean move, but it's an optional thing that you could easily ignore. Other than that... nothing bad to say here. I love this game.			"

												you ever played one of those games that when you metion it to someone, they look at you weirdly and do not even know if that game even exsited. Well Fly'N, to me, is one of those games that took a lot of effort in the design and stages making it quite challengeing and yet have this spark inside that calms you down from your rage with it's music and the way the characters look. As I try to explain Fly'N to my friends, they really take a good intrest on what is it about. I guess it's one of those games that you need to experience it first hand to get caught in it gamplay.

It has absolutely brilliant artwork and a fantastic soundtrack to go with it. It has a simple narrative which makes you want to play more, and it has some very innovative mechanics which I found very interesting to play with. Its essentially a puzzle platform type of game but done in a different way. If you want a challenge when you get further into the game then I would reccomend this. The difficulty curve is perfectly fine.			"

												Really fun platformer that should probably have gotten more attention. The art and animation are gorgeous! The audio is pretty nice too.You control 4 different characters that all have double jump/float and a special power. 1 crawls on walls, 1 can bounce on deadly surfaces, 1 can dash any direction for long distances, and the last is the least maneuverable but sort of a key. In each area you're trying to use the available characters to explore and open up areas for the other bugs (or locate spawn areas for a different character).The movement feels really tight with just the right amount of skill and finesse. You can also swap between light/dark words at any time to toggle certain platforms, walls, and deadly areas. So often you'll do something like: double jump and stick to a wall, detach, toggle off a dangerous platform above, air jump through it, toggle a platform above off, double jump through it, toggle the platform back on, and land. The trick jumps get much crazier from there... the difficulty is somewhere between Sonic and Super Meat Boy, but it never feels unfair.Anyway, if you ever miss challenging old school platformers or want to see where the evolution of platforms has gone, check this one out. I finished in about 8 hours, but missed most of the secrets which unlock bonus levels.			"

												Fly'N is one of my favorite games, not just because of the cute graphics, but the difficulty increases at a fun level as you go along. At least in my opinion (I've cleared Super Meat Boy and that was $#$#@#^% tough).The graphics themselves are top notch, but there is an FPS bug that will likely never get fixed. Play it in windowed instead of full screen and you'll likely have no issues, otherwise you'll get FPS drags/spikes randomly. Though it seems this bug doesn't affect some older PCs. Anyway, the backgrounds, characters, and creatures are so colorful and vibrant. You'd swear an artist came in and beautifully painted each area.The characters are really cute and well animated, not to mention the main antagonist is a....hair dryer named Dyer. You play as the four buds of the world trees- Flyn (blue), Lyft (green), Ywok (black), and Nyls (orange). Each has a different ability that will come in handy as you progress through the stages. There will also be ""chase"" stages where you have to make it to the end without dying once, so that you can save some of the various creatures of the world trees. If you want to know a little more about them, check out the commuity guide about them.Gameplay goes fairly quick, even if you end up dying a lot. You have unlimited lives and if you get stuck, you can just ""pop"" yourself back to the respawn point. This game can be quite difficult, but it helps you get used to the pace and characters. Each level is more difficult than the previous, but also challenges you to think of new ways to use the buds. Like Ywok for instance can turn into a ball, so in the earlier stages you'll see guidelines of collectables on how to bounce at the right angle, but later on the angles get more specific and require good timing. There are also a bunch of bonus levels (tied to rescuing of creatures in chase stages) that are much, much harder than the normal ones. I would suggest tackling those after completing the game. Oh, and of course, there are boss levels at the end of each tree, which challenge you to use the buds to the best of their abilities. You may die a lot and you will get frusterated, but the music and sights help take the edge off.The music is beautiful and if you enjoy it, definitely grab the soundtrack. It's soothing and appropriate to each area. In the beginning of each level it starts out softly, but as you progress through the level more beats are added. I feel like it adds some fun to progressing through. There isn't any dialogue to the story. It's told mostly through cutscenes and it's pretty clear about what is going on. I feel there is also some story related visuals in some of the levels, but generally it's the cute cutscenes.To me, the only real complaint is the bug I mentioned previously, but thankfully has a simple workaround. It only took me about 10 hours total to complete the game, so it's short and sweet. If you want to see some gameplay or check out the design, feel free to check out my Let's Play here.

												This is one of the most enjoyable platformers I have ever played.It takes place in a beautiful, surreal-looking world that is being corrupted by red trash which is being deployed by a weird metal creature with haird-dryer for a head (um...yea).You take a role of one of 4 Buds, creatures native to the afforementioned world, all with a unique ability. All of them can double jump and glide, but the blue one can sing, green one can turn to a lettuce that sticks to any surface so he can climb walls and stuff, the black one can turn into a bouncy ball and the red one can dash multiple times being able to cross large distances even vertically.The goal is to reach the end of the level while collecting as many floating seeds that simply give you score and weird glowing balls that you use to solve certain puzzles. There is also a timer and leaderboards so if you like going OCD over collecting everything and getting the best time and score possible, this game's got you covered.There are 2 kinds of levels. In most of them, you have infinite time to finish and collect everything but once in a while the game throws the other kind at you, where you must rush upwards as fast as possible because there is red garbage rising from below that kills you if you touch it. So the pace of the game kinda alternates between slow (not if you are speedrunning, but you CAN go slow), methodical gameplay and frantic mandatory speedrunning which is something I liked, it kept me engaged. There is also a bonus available when you don't die on those speedy levels which I found absolutely rage-inducing because some of the later ones are VERY difficult, but it does give you a reason to try and master the game so I still consider it a good thing.Overall, I find this game great. Great visuals, interesting gameplay mechanics and  the price is almost suspiciously low. I certainly recommend it.			"

												Fly'N is a fantastic, brutal and beautiful 2D platformer. The gamepad controls, platforming and level design are solid and the game provides a challenge even for players experienced with platformers. There's enough incentive to 100% levels for the unlockable concept art, puzzle rooms and easter eggs in the home areas and, on rising lava levels, solely for the satisfaction you'll feel if you manage to pull off a perfect run. Having no reason to replay levels or improve my skill to perfect them is an area where I'm let down by quite a few indie platformers, so it's nice to see another one doing it right. Acquiring new forms, each with unique platforming abilities, and being required to shift between them adds to the fun, and they're introduced at a rate that revives the learning curve just when you think you're getting comfortable and keeps things from getting too repetitive.  Regardless of which form you're in, you'll also be required to shift between two dimensions where platforms, collectibles, obstacles and hazards appear and disappear—adding another element of timing and skill to the formula, similar to the new Giana Sisters.You'll die a lot trying to perform well on the timed levels; fortunately, there are plenty of stages you can explore at your own pace in between these skill checks and boss battles.  Watch the Steam trailer if you're considering picking this up; in this case, it accurately showcases how the game plays and whether it's something you're likely to enjoy.			"

												Beautiful and challenging.I've played a lot of 2D platformers and I can say that this one is unique and stimulating. You can play as 4 characters, each one with a different ability: one can activate objects and open ways, one can stick to surfaces, one can bounce and pass through lethal obstacles and one can dash in the air. Also, all of them have a dream ability that makes the level switch to an alternate ""dimension"" where some objects appear and others disappear: jumping from one to another while switching repeatedly will require precision and reflexes, and in the last levels the game will get intense. Several levels are nonlinear and there's a bit of puzzle solving. There are many hidden collectibles and some bonus levels. The game lenght is 5-7 hours for just finishing the story and around 40 hours for completing it at 100%.The art is gorgeous, the music is engaging and the style is charming. The story is very simple but cute and has imaginative characters.The flaws of the game are the bouncing ability which is quite unpredictable and a few collectibles that are too hard to find or get (remember to notice the ""flowing sparkles"").I give it a 8.7/10.

												This is one of those overlooked platformers.  It may appear cute but it becomes more challenging progressively.  Just when you think you've overcome the most difficult part of the game, you're right at the next one.  It's quite unforgiving at times, where you miss something by just one pixel (exaggerating), may even make you want to ragequit.  At those times, take a little break, do something else and come back later.  Recommended, I would say you don't need to wait for a sale to collect this one.  Definitely watch some gameplay videos to get an idea of what this is like. I should mention - in full screen I couldn't get past 42fps, it just seems to be stuck.  I had to go into windowed mode to get 60fps.  The game is 4-5 years old now so I don't think the developers will be fixing this now.  Works well with a Steam controller.			"

												This is a great game with fantasic visual, sound and level design.I would highly recommend this game if you are skilled in platforming type games as is it VERY difficult!Whilsty the difficulty of the game may make some shy away, I hope you will meet the challange and see just how far you can go, the music and art style is worth the try and for asking price it is worth every cent.This game is kid friendly and just like nintedo game of old were infuriertainly difficult, they were fun to play even if I never finished them, the same can be said for Fly'n. Recommended ages 8+.			"

												I guess it's worth $10, The game is like a puzzle game+ sonic. You collect flowers there are some hidden around the map progress through and get to the end. It's a nice platformer but there are many other games which are way better for the price of $10. I got this in humble bundle so i'm ok with the price. The game's soundtrack isn't that good i don't see why there are games with bad sountracks for sale it could be my taste but i don't like alot of them. Bosses to fight many stages to go through over all 6/10			"

												82/100Fly'n is more than just another casual platformer, it is a skill-based puzzle-platformer. Nice looking graphics, easy control, fancy world, pretty sounds, unlockable contents (bonus levels, arts, bonus comics story). There are some cute characters each with the unique abilities. If you want a casual platformer feel free to beat it perfunctorily. But to discover all hidden things and collect all stuff you need to play very skillful because it is a bit of a challenge. In any case, you would be satisfied with the purchase of this game (at least if you like platformer genre)I don't regret my purchase. I really enjoy it and don't shy to spread the word!So if you want a sign for the purchase of this game - here is it ;)			"

												I am 25 years old at the time of this writing. Throughout that time, I have been playing video games. But rarely do I find a game that truly makes me say 'this is what I've been waiting for.'Fly'N is one of those rare gems. This is one of those games I have always wanted to play. A seamless, challenging, atmospheric platformer with an unusual method of control and gameplay; both in a good way mind you. Each of the four characters brings a new gimmick to the table, and the sheer, painstakingly creative level designs take advantage of them in a way that will simply astound you.Everything about this game is beautiful. The asethetic, the gameplay, the levels (though, some of the rising levels are admittedly questionable), the music, and of course, the price! Its insane for Ankama to be asking a mere $10 for this. Most $60 games these days don't have a quarter of the quality and love you will find in this game. Christmas already came this year. It came on November 9th, 2012.Pick this up immediately. Its everything you could ask for in a game in general, let alone a platformer.			"

												Fly'n is a 2-D platform action game. For me, it was VERY difficult. A lot of the moves required very precise motions of the analog stick and very precise timing on multiple buttons, often at the same time. I am not as young as I once was, and I am afraid that my reflexes are no longer fast enough for a game like this. For the parts that I was able to complete (the first half of the game) it was a lot of fun. The art is great, the sounds are cool, and your character is very cute. The game is fast paced and fun for the most part, my thumbs were sore after playing for a while on my controller. If you are young and have fast reflexes, this game would be a treat for people who like fast paced platform action games. If you lack mongoose-like reflexes, you may get frustrated.			"

												If you are interested in a 2D platformer (with a bit of puzzle) where it's offers a  challenge to get 100% in then this may be for you. The graphics look very pretty and the songs are soothing and fitting. The game takes a while to beat if you aim for 100% completion (it took me about 25 hours). The level design can be a bit evil at times hiding things in places you might not go into or sometimes rare sections in some levels that can only be progressed once and can't go back (unless you were to restart the level). Also, I reccomend playing this game with a controller.			"

One needs to get used to the protagonists' special skills, but once you find out (and calm down :D) and catch the rhythm, it'll be more enjoyable and fun. When you've beaten the game, you can still replay several times to catch all the bonuses, save all the buddies or improve your playtime and you can also compare your results with others' worldwide.

												Fly'N is a gorgeous 2D platformer with puzzle elements and fast paced gameplay. Fly'N progresses through 5 worlds, each with a different and gorgeous art theme. As you play FLy'N you will acquire additional playable characters (for a total of 4), each of which has its own unique skills. The skills include singing, wall-climbing, bouncing, and darting through the air rapidly. These skills are necessary for navigating levels, opening new pathways, and avoiding damage. Each character can also double jump or glide. In my experience playing the game, I felt that character controls were responsive and smooth and I did not experience any bugs.The aspect that really drew me into the Fly'N was the art style. Fly'N art themes range from a botanical/floral theme to a mechanical/industrial theme. Each world has a unique look and every world is very colorful. The characters themselves are also very unique, colorful, and well animated. I also felt the sound design and music are well above average in quality.Fly'N also stands out in level design. While the levels can be very challenging, they never seemed frustrating. Out of my (many) deaths, I never felt I had anyone to blame but myself. The levels typically involve using your different skills to get past obstacles, avoid touching deadly surfaces, navigate moving platforms, and outrunning a rising layer of gears, bolts, and screws which kill you if you touch them. For lack of a better description, I will refer to this as the ""ocean of doom"" from here on. In addition, there are three types of levels throughout the game. The first, which makes up most of the levels, involves navigating obstacles and finding the way to the end of the level. The second, more challenging level type is similar to the first but adds the additional challenge of the ""ocean of doom"" gradually rises through the map, forcing you to move quickly. The last level type is the two-stage boss battles where you must first fight a mechanical boss which usually involves avoiding projectiles and a significant amount of platforming. The second-stage of the boss battles involves you traveling inside the boss to dismantle it by collecting glowing orbs and using them to break down the machinery.If you are interested in a story, Fly'N has one but don't expect much. It is very minimal and its not why I would choose to play the game. The story is very basic and is essentially just there to provide a context to play. There is a bad guy, he is messing up your world, and you are trying to stop him and repair the damage he does. However, I don't consider the minimal story a drawback because that really is all this game needs to make it fun.I have seen some reviews critique the difficulty of Fly'N . However, though Fly'N was challenging, I was able to complete the game without too much trouble and I would not say that my skills are above average when it comes to platformers. Fly'N also gives you the option of decreasing the difficulty of the ""ocean of doom"" levels if you die too many times by stopping the ""ocean of doom"" from rising. On the other hand, if you are a completionist, the ""ocean of doom"" levels have optional bonus objectives that require you to complete levels quickly and without dying. The game also offers many collectables and secrets to discover. I was content with just completing the levels and finishing the game. In my opinion, trying to collect all items, find all secrets, and getting through the levels without dying would take a great deal of skill and dedication.As you can see from my recorded hours in game, I was able to complete the game in just over 7 hours. I imagine that this would be in the ballpark of how long it would take the average gamer. If your platforming skills are better than mine you could probably shave that time down by a pretty good margin as I died pretty frequently. If, on the other hand, you are a completionist....expect much longer since I imagine you will be replaying and restarting levels a ton. I would also say that Fly'N has a pretty decent margin of replayability. Overall, I felt that the game was definitely worth the price tag.TL;DR: Fly'N is a great little platformer with excellent art and sound design, exceptional level design, and provides a good challenge that any fan of platformers can enjoy. I highly recommend this game and I also tip my hat to the developers who clearly put in a lot of effort to make a high quality and very fun game.			"

												I certainly recommend Fly'N, specially to those who enjoy platformers. It is very fun and joyful to casual and hardcore gamers alike, since the levels are somewhat simple and linear, but contain nice challenges and puzzles on them aswell as secrets that require searching and/or skill, the music fits perfectly and both it and the art of the game is fantastic, you can also unlock neat artworks and secrets, but you will need to get ready for some hard challenges in order to do that. The gameplay is simple but neat, hard to handle at first, but amazing after you manage to. From what I played so far, it seems to be kinda short, but if you are up to enjoy the game at its fullest, achieving all challenges and bonuses, you will have many more hours of great fun. :D "

												Fly'n is a surprising game. At first I thought this was just some kids game, but as the levels went on and the difficulty ramped up, as well as the collecting became more challenging, all I can say is that it has me hooked. I'm onto the 4th tree, and have already played over 8hrs on this game. Amazing, I would recommend this to people who like challenging platform games with the added challenge of collecting items and trying not to ""die"" (which you will, a LOT). Fans of metroid fusion/zero mission, and the new rayman origins/legends (which I'm sure it grabbed some influence from) will likely enjoy this a lot. Highly recommended, just be warned, you will get frustrated trying to succeed! No pain, no gain as they say...			"

												A side-scrolling platformer is only as good as its controls and sadly, that's where Fly'N fails the most; its floaty and sensitive to a fault and considering the accuracy needed to make nearly every jump in this game, that's a major issue. The rising lava stages are the worst of the bunch in this regard and are bound to test the patience of even the most composed of gamers.It's a real shame because the art, music, sound design... it's all really good, but ultimately wasted on a game severely lacking polish in its most crucial department.

												This game has one major flaw (in my eyes): It doesn't explain it self to the player. It describes the controls very poorly. I completed the first two levels. These were managable. But the 3rd level is already a hard-one I can't beat. No matter what I try I always fail because 'the flood' catches up to quickly. Further more I get the sense that this game was made with in the back of there minds a Controller.Besides that the game is really nice done. So it has ""+ sides"", don't get me wrong here. The story is something you've see before. But is well done displayed... But for a game where the controls / gameplay is described so poorly the looks don't matter. Controls (and from time to time gameplay) come before the looks of a game.It's the reason why I asked a refund for this. Furthermore: there is no Tutorial !			"

												I originally intended to give this a negative review but I had to realize that I am just not made for these kind of games. I can remember that I wrote in my review for Giana Sisters that I hated every minute of playing it (I gave that game a positive review, too) ... I can safely say for this game that I hated every single second of it. I initially bought it because it was on sale, things look so easy in videos and I found the visuals rather cute. I could not have been more mistaken. I played it with a controller and my thumbs are still hurting. The controller's life was only spared from being thrown against the wall because it is relatively new.Since the game is really well made I can recommend it: If you are a platformer completionist and are up for a challenge, look no further. If you find failing in these games infuriating and struggle with precision jumps and creative level design, stay away from this one.			"

												Fly'N is a puzzle platformer game in which you rotate between different creatures with various abilities. The emphasis of this game is on the platforming but the levels are laid out in a way that makes it more puzzley, having to backtrack and figure out where you are headed.The game starts out simple enough, and seems very casual friendly, but as you unlock more characters, the levels get harder and the difficulty becomes very steep towards the end of the game.I love the visuals in this game. It has a cute art style that is completely unique. You begin to appreciate the world you're involved in.The gameplay itself revolves around trying get through basic levels, but between all the collectables, and the different characters you use, it doesn't feel very linear. This can be frustrating or enjoyable, depending on the level and depending on the type of player you are. The mechanics are very solid, the game controls well and the mechanics that each creature has lends itself to creative play. The Black creature, which uses a bouncing mechanic was difficult for me to get the hang of, but once you understand it, it can become quite fun to play around with.The game took me about 6 hours to completion, without collecting much and without doing the bonus levels. I was very satisifed and felt very challenged towards the end. This game might become too challenging for a more casual audience, as I'm use to playing more hardcore platformers.The boss fights were also interesting as they were focused on the platforming itself, which I feel is the right call instead of a typical ""jump on the bad guy"" playstyle you might see in platformersThe story is hit or miss, I wasn't 100% sure what was going on but the cutscenes were still enjoyable to watch.Pros-Great length for the price, good value-Solid and Unique Mechanics-Lot of extras in levels and beyond-Interesting Boss Fights-Awesome Art Style-Challenging, bit steep on difficulty curve Cons -Saw Minor Frame Rate Drops at some portions-Might be too challenging for casual play-Nonlinear level layout may confuse players-Some players might feel overburdened by the large amount of mechanicsI really enjoyed Fly'N and I highly recommend it. Even a casual player will enjoy the early portions of the game. This is another must have platformer on steam if you love this genre. The collectables, unique mechanics, and pretty art style is just icing on the cake 8.5/10  "

												Simply beautiful. The music is amazing, the gameplay is fun. There's pretty much no dialogue whatsoever, leading you to discern the character's personalities purely through their actions. The story as of yet seems to be a nature vs industrialization sort of thing, and it works beautifully. Definitely worth the money.			"

												An exceptional, beautiful platformer. It piles on the cute factor by the bucketload as I found myself going ""awww!"" on far too many occasions as the adorable buds repair the damage of the inhabitants of stunning worlds ruined by electrical garbageDon't be fooled though... this isn't for the light hearted. The difficulty becomes fantastically challenging to the point that I was breaking a sweat on many occasions. It's tough, but you get infinite lives and feel like a complete boss when you execute it perfectly. I'd definitely recommend a controller for this one, as the keyboard might be a bit awkward at timesThe only thing where this game really fails... the ending. It grudgingly just felt very rushed. Maybe I've played too much Sonic and want to enjoy utterly wrecking a big, evil machine in the final level - but it weirdly switched from the fun boss fights it had throughout to basically dying repeatedly whilst you learn the sequence to basically avoid dying. After the anti-climatic level; the end doesn't seem to conclude much too. Without spoiling it, you kinda get a ""yay! It's all sorted""... without anything really being sorted. There's still 4 tree worlds completely wrecked with garbage. It just really sucked considering how well the game had been executed up to that pointIn the grand scheme of things - it's a small gripe, as I got 10+ fantastic and gripping hours out of this game (just the basic game too... I've still to find all the goodies on the levels and complete the bonus ones) - but I found the end leaves you with a bit of an ""oh... that's it?""			"

												Warning: only play this game if you have a controller. The keyboard controls are atrocious.Now that we got this out of the way, this is a good precision platformer, that plays exceptionally well (with a controller, remember hey?) and gradually increases in variety as you play along.You control a sperm-like, but yet cute, creature which can double jump, glide, and has one special ability. Each boss you defeat will unlock another creature with a different special and soon you will need to master the various combinations to get through the levels. There are quite a lot of levels - which start nice and easy, but towards the end will offer a serious challenge. The level design is excellent: no superfluous tutorials, you just gradually learn how to use your new abilities until the fiendish last levels where you'll need perfect timing and cool nerves. The end game also begins offering a puzzle element, as you need to think about which creature to use where in order to solve the level.With leaderboards, collectibles, hidden levels and bonuses for not dying, there is also plenty of replay value.The art, animations, music and sound provide for a super cute yet gripping atmosphere - game recommended for children and adults alike.

												While Fly'N truly looks beautiful, sounds good and have interesting setting, I can't say same thing about most important thing - gameplay. It's not a short game so it hitted me really hard, after some time I felt really bored with it and really tired of how repetitive it was. I wasn't any longer having fun, I was praying that there soon will be end. Controls at times, and some mechanics, also wasn't quite right but maybe it was just me. I really wanted to enjoy it more, to have more fun but sadly the longer you play it, the worse it starts to get. Not sure if I want to recommend it to anyone, since it's not one genre but mix. Maybe it could count as just platformer, but there are plenty of platformers more interesting. Try it at your own risk.			"

												Wouldnt recommend due to lack of precision in controls. Would recommend using a game pad. Secondly, the bosses in the game require clearance on the first try for rewards, without a preview of the level often times it requires a twitch reaction to get away from death but the characters speed isnt enough. All in all 6/10 get this game on sale when its around a dollar for game value.			"

												I just saw this game recommended to me by Steam, and I decided to give it a try.The game is pretty, and the premise is sound, but I didn't last 2 minutes ingame. The movement controls are awful. Unrefined. I am a hobbyist game developer, and I know what it takes to make a control scheme that works right -- it takes some effort, yes, but it is not that hard to make it feel smooth. This game needs transitions: switching directions should have a bit of inertia -- not much, otherwise you'd feel like you walk on ice --, jumping should feel like the character has put some force into it, and not just magically moving upward, and so on.I'm not going to ask for a refund or anything -- but neither can I recommend it to others when I can't enjoy playing it.

												Bought this to my niece in her early teens. Now,  few years later, she has not finished it because she got stuck in an impossibly hard timed section with rotating mechanisms. It's clear how to get past it (youtube), but it's just very hard to actually do it. I know, because I tried to do that, and I failed. I bailed her out a few times before, but that bit was just too much.. And it is nowhere near ending (not even near middle of the game).The man who designed this must never work on a game again, unless that game is for hardcore gamers (with guns, fu**s, and flying exploding pigs or somethin).

												This game is fantastic. The art is beautiful, as good as Rayman Origins, even being an indie game, the gameplay is solid and it is pretty long for a game this cheap. It took me 13 hours to finish and I did not bother getting everything and unlocking every bonus level. The difficulty is spot on: never too easy or too hard, unless you are trying to get 100% completion. The way collectibles work is also similar to Rayman Origins, but the gameplay similarities stop there. The pace in Fly'n is slower and there is an emphasis in using the abilities of each of the 4 characters to overcome obstacles and transverse the levels, which are not simple left to right affairs: they are big and sprawling and you move both horizontally and vertically, free to go back and forth. Although the game is 2D, the level design reminds me of the levels in the 3D platformers of the N64 era. Buy this game, it's totally worth it even for full price.			"

												This game is gorgeous, with not so much character, but rather, charm. The game has a great stylistic aesthetic, play mechanics change naturally, and feels great with a Xbox controller. Platformers aren't really my style of game, but I'd still recommend Fly'N for its rewarding aesthetic and audio compliment. The game gets quite difficult actually, at some points, but remains satisfying. I don't like, however the extreme precision needed on random puzzles, so the difficulty curve is a bit weird, and there are a few  instances where you get only one shot at achieving something at the end, and if you miss it, start over the whole level. Other than these minor points, it's a delightful casual title.			"

The game is fluid and easy to grasp and though the controls are not always on your side it remains mostly a charm to handle. The game is not quite the favourite I was envisioning, but it is still a superior display of indie game production and I have certainly not been disappointed. Fly'N is an Eight out of Ten.			"

												Fly'n is a great little platformer, and one of the most gorgeous 2D platformers that I have ever played. It centers around a group of creatures which each have unique abilities, dealing with trash which is invading their homes. There's a great deal of collecting throughout the game, which is the only real source of replayability. The graphics are absolutely fantastic and smooth - it felt like playing a cartoon. Difficulty starts off very easy, but it does eventually ramp to where the final levels were quite difficult, but a satisfactory difficult - it never felt truly unfair even when it was being quite demanding.All in all, an extremely satisfying game, start to finish. Highly, highly recommended.			"

												A wonderful platformer all-around. The feel fluid and versatile with fast movement, a glide and a double jump on top of their special abilities. Pacing is great, each character's gimmick is useful and fun (once you master its controls anyways) and immersion is great. All the secrets offer decent replayability. Also it's got great aesthetics and is undeniably cute.Levels alternate between two types. The first is large and immersive, with plenty of secrets and platforming and mild puzzles. The others are difficult death courses where you race against rising spikes. On each world this leads up to VERY difficult (but well-designed) bosses each followed by a handful difficult but non-timed deathtraps. There's no level skips so you probably won't beat the game if you're not very good, but you don't have to be godly either and it's not a constant slew of death courses like most games which are as difficult as it gets at its peaks.

The villain has a motive beyond the typical ""I just want to take over the world"" ones; his actual motive makes him surprisingly sympathetic.

												This is perhaps one of the best indie games released in a while. The controls may take some time to get used to, but you should be able to find a comfortable way of playing this game. Be warned though, this game can make you pretty irritated at times, especially if you want to unlock stuff.the game may have performance issues on windows 8, if so, use the tool ""throttlestop 8"" to fix it.

												I was attracted to this game because it looked like a cute, simple little platformer. It's so much more than that! I bought the soundtrack version and boy, I'm glad I did because the music is enchanting, and the tracks work especially well with the visual style of the game. It's beautifully painted, with vibrant colours and both ""versions"" of the world just as pretty as each other, and it makes for a really immersive experience. The little characters are adorable and all have unique, interesting designs and strengths for playing. If Fly'N was an easy game, it would only take a handful of hours to whiz through, unlock all the characters and grab all the achievements. However, it's surprisingly difficult. It'll certainly keep you concentrating, and it's great fun. It's probably enjoyed best with a controller, since using a keyboard makes complex manouvres kind of difficult in places, but I'm getting along just fine on the keyboard so as long as you set the controls to something easy to use (you can change any key) you'll do great. I wholeheartedly recommend this game; it's one of the most entertaining things I've played in quite a while. If you're a fan of challenging platform games, beautiful visual design and enchanting music, this is the game for you!			"

It's mechanics aren't the same as trine though, it has more flying/wallclimbing type movement, but it is very fluid, fun, and frankly challenging near the end (I still can't beat it).Buy it now while its only 3 bucks on the winter sale. you won't regret it.

The background music/effects blends in well with the graphics, adds a nice touch to it without distracting away from the game. About an hour into it I am seriously impressed, and had loads of fun already, something not all platformers can deliver. Thoroughly recommended.

												Watch the trailer. That gives you a very good indication of what this game is like. The presentation really is that good all throughout the game. The music isn't quite AS good as the trailer, but the art sure is. What that trailer doesn't convey very well, however, is that this isn't a casual game. There's a solid, challenging platformer hiding behind this deceptively cute face. If you like platformers, don't pass this one up, it's a real treat.There's only one issue I've found with this game- moving platforms are kinda slippery. It hasn't caused any serious problems for me though.			"

												A beautiful game with clever and quirky humor.  The characters are impossible to hate, with their highly expressive eyes.  The villain has a motive beyond the typical ""I just want to take over the world"" ones; his actual motive makes him surprisingly sympathetic.  And this might just be me, but the ending was so lovely that tears sprung to my eyes.  Combine all of this with addictive gameplay and a wordless tale of nature vs technology, and you have the best possible game to direct someone to if you want to prove games can be art.			"

												A wonderful platformer all-around. The feel fluid and versatile with fast movement, a glide and a double jump on top of their special abilities. Pacing is great, each character's gimmick is useful and fun (once you master its controls anyways) and immersion is great. All the secrets offer decent replayability. Also it's got great aesthetics and is undeniably cute.Levels alternate between two types. The first is large and immersive, with plenty of secrets and platforming and mild puzzles. The others are difficult death courses where you race against rising spikes. On each world this leads up to VERY difficult (but well-designed) bosses each followed by a handful difficult but non-timed deathtraps. There's no level skips so you probably won't beat the game if you're not very good, but you don't have to be godly either and it's not a constant slew of death courses like most games which are as difficult as it gets at its peaks.

												Fly'n is a great little platformer, and one of the most gorgeous 2D platformers that I have ever played. It centers around a group of creatures which each have unique abilities, dealing with trash which is invading their homes. There's a great deal of collecting throughout the game, which is the only real source of replayability. The graphics are absolutely fantastic and smooth - it felt like playing a cartoon. Difficulty starts off very easy, but it does eventually ramp to where the final levels were quite difficult, but a satisfactory difficult - it never felt truly unfair even when it was being quite demanding.All in all, an extremely satisfying game, start to finish. Highly, highly recommended.			"

												This game is gorgeous, with not so much character, but rather, charm. The game has a great stylistic aesthetic, play mechanics change naturally, and feels great with a Xbox controller. Platformers aren't really my style of game, but I'd still recommend Fly'N for its rewarding aesthetic and audio compliment. The game gets quite difficult actually, at some points, but remains satisfying. I don't like, however the extreme precision needed on random puzzles, so the difficulty curve is a bit weird, and there are a few  instances where you get only one shot at achieving something at the end, and if you miss it, start over the whole level. Other than these minor points, it's a delightful casual title.			"

												This is a must own for any plaforming fan.Don't let the cute art style fool you. This is a very challenging and very rewarding precision platformer. The best part about it though, is you don't have to collect anything. If you want to grab all the orbs and seeds, and sing to all the creatures that's great, but if you don't, that's ok too. The game gives you the power to decide when you want a bigger challenge. Even on the boss levels with rising ""lava,"" every 10 deaths the game will ask you--in a patronizing way--if you want to disable said ""lava"" (except on the final boss).The controls are tight, thank goodness. You will be jumping, floating, phasing, and sticking/bouncing/dashing constantly. The level design encourages speed and will challenge your muscle memory and reflexes. You will have to plan a small route, then execute these abilities within fractions of a second of each other, and then adapt and react on the fly to whatever you couldn't see. These levels are quite large and varied, and there are 5 worlds with 8 levels in the cute main story. Despite their size, I never felt lost, and there are checkpoints strewn all over them that let you change characters. The camera pans and zooms by itself, so it kind of suggests what you should do (along with the seeds). The automatic camera was a necessary feature as most of the time you will be too busy doing something to look around.While the art style is great and the game is beautiful, there are practically no graphics options, and the menus are too minimalistic. I hope you have the recommended specs. On the other hand, the game has great sound design with happy, upbeat music during puzzle oriented levels and intense music whenever the villain is involved. The music also gets muffled and changes when you phase kind of like Giana Sisters.Overall this Is an amazing platformer with beautiful art and sound, amazing level design, and tight controls.P.S.Random observation: I swear the final level was inspired by the final level of Earthworm Jim. Luckily you float way slower than Jim and can double jump while floating.			"

												Artfully crafted sprites, well thought-out level designs, and good old fashioned fun gameplay make this deligthful platformer a joy to own. All through the game I was awe-struck at how pretty the environments I was exploring were and often sprang to life as you progessed. This being said do not think Flyn'N requires no skill; the game mechanics cumulatively add a particularly engrossing challenge in addition to execellent controls allowing for incremental difficulty of the platforming itself. On the other hand if you're a collect-a-thon type of person it may occasionally be irritable when you have 99/100 collectables on a level and there is no way no know even the general vicinity of the last seed and some of them are hidden perhaps a tad too well - I will admit I resorted to cheating to find those last little seeds. Subjectively the story alone may not have a lot of depth - however extra collectible art does deepen it - but that is okay I feel as the game delivers what I expected when I bought it: a pretty fun platformer. I have no regrets whatsoever about purchasing Flyn'N and only wish more people could appreciate like I do.			"

												Very enjoyable platforming game with some puzzle aspects snuck in here or there. The design team must have been putting in a lot of overtime because the visuals are crisp, clean and fluid, and the music sets the scenes very well. The controls are a little different from usual platformer games because of the natures of your protagonists: A and D handle 'left' and 'right' movement, S 'down,' but since W is used for gliding in mid-air, 'up' is relegated to right mouse button. It's a little weird but once you get used to it I find it works just great.The character designs are neat (especially the player-controlled protagonists, of which there are 4 in total, each with a wildly unique ability for navigating through levels). And I've actually come to strongly dislike the antagonist, a sentient hair dryer who would I guess be adorable if he wasn't such a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and intent on ruining your world.The main detraction of this game I suppose is that there isn't really much of a story to go on... something more along the lines of early Sonic games, I guess: Evil Bad Guy comes and does Bad Stuff, and it's up to you to stop him.

												This game is fantastic. The art is beautiful, as good as Rayman Origins, even being an indie game, the gameplay is solid and it is pretty long for a game this cheap. It took me 13 hours to finish and I did not bother getting everything and unlocking every bonus level. The difficulty is spot on: never too easy or too hard, unless you are trying to get 100% completion. The way collectibles work is also similar to Rayman Origins, but the gameplay similarities stop there. The pace in Fly'n is slower and there is an emphasis in using the abilities of each of the 4 characters to overcome obstacles and transverse the levels, which are not simple left to right affairs: they are big and sprawling and you move both horizontally and vertically, free to go back and forth. Although the game is 2D, the level design reminds me of the levels in the 3D platformers of the N64 era. Buy this game, it's totally worth it even for full price.			"

												This game is amazing. It's so much fun and I've played through it several times. It has great level design and I love the characters and it is beautiful to look at. I especially like playing the bouncy ball character.			"

												One of the most visually pleasing games I have ever played. Great gameplay, enjoyable pacing, very good level design, tight controls. Story? Not bad. Recommended for fans of platformers.			"

												Very enjoyable platforming game with some puzzle aspects snuck in here or there. The design team must have been putting in a lot of overtime because the visuals are crisp, clean and fluid, and the music sets the scenes very well. The controls are a little different from usual platformer games because of the natures of your protagonists: A and D handle 'left' and 'right' movement, S 'down,' but since W is used for gliding in mid-air, 'up' is relegated to right mouse button. It's a little weird but once you get used to it I find it works just great.The character designs are neat (especially the player-controlled protagonists, of which there are 4 in total, each with a wildly unique ability for navigating through levels). And I've actually come to strongly dislike the antagonist, a sentient hair dryer who would I guess be adorable if he wasn't such a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and intent on ruining your world.The main detraction of this game I suppose is that there isn't really much of a story to go on... something more along the lines of early Sonic games, I guess: Evil Bad Guy comes and does Bad Stuff, and it's up to you to stop him.

												FLY'N is an utterly fantastic indie game that I'm surprised isn't talked about more often. A beautiful platformer with tight controls and pretty good puzzles, and quite a few levels (particularly the boss fights) that pose a significant challenge. On top of all that, this game is unbelievably gorgeous in its visuals and music. I honestly think I can recommend this game to everybody.			"
